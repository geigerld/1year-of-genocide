00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
[Jenifer Girke] The day that changed everything.
On 7 October, Meron Mendel’s world stood still.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
[Meron Mendel] Everybody continued their life. I
said: Stop! I can’t! [JG] Peace for Israel:

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That’s what he’s fighting for. In his homeland
and in Germany. As a kibbutznik. As an Israeli soldier.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
As the Director of the Anne Frank Educational Centre.
He builds bridges between cultures. He loves Israel. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And criticises it. He was raised to be peaceful.
[David Mendel] We taught you not to hate and to 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
always seek peace. [JG] He’s travelling to his
wounded homeland. He wants to support his family 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and friends. To grieve, digest and hope together.
[Yehuda] There was a special happiness that she had.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I’ll miss it. [JG] It’s a journey to an Israel that
has to find itself again. To a familiar yet foreign

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
homeland. With an uncertain future. 
[Mohammad] Will Israel give the Palestinians a state 
 
10
00:01:01,000 --&gt; 00:01:05,000
after Hamas is over? [Ilan] The only way is with two
states. [JG] It’s also a journey into his own past.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Into his own beliefs. How much of this remains after
7 October? [Itai] We think the solution is peace.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
[Rahel] It’s not enough to just want peace.
[JG] Meron Mendel wants to know: “What’s next for 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
my Israel?”

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:45.000
[INTRO]

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
A suitcase full of pain. Returning to Israel is a
familiar feeling for Meron Mendel. But this time 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
everything is different. Not all of his loved
ones survived the terrorist attack on 7 October.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
[MM] I’ve been living in Germany for over 20 years.
But all those years meant nothing in that moment. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I suddenly realised that I belong there. That’s
where I grew up. That’s where my childhood friends

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
are. My family is there. I need to be there.
[JG] Meron Mendel came to Frankfurt in 2003.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Today he directs the Anne Frank Educational Centre
and is a professor of social work. The 47-year-old

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
is married to the political scientist
Saba-Nur Cheema. She’s a Muslim. He’s a Jew.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Together they promote diversity in society.
They’re passionate about peace in the Middle East. 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Even now. What’s next for Israel? A very personal
question for Meron Mendel. And one he needs to 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000
ask to overcome his own trauma from 7 October.
He’ll get answers. And we’ll join him on his journey. 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.000
[MM] I’ve been waiting for this moment for over a
month. Yes, I’m excited. But I’m also very tense.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
[Aeroplane announcement] “Solidarity with Israel”.
We arrive. The airport corridors are lined with 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:25.000
pictures of hostages. As we’re about to leave…
We hear an air-raid siren. The next bunker is too

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.000
far away. The way there is too dangerous.
[MM] Now we’ve truly arrived. [JG] After a while,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000
we’re given the all-clear. We’re finally on the
way to Mashabe Sade. On the way home. But then…

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Our car breaks down in the middle of the highway.
It’s not long before a young Arab comes over. 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
The Bedouin lives nearby and wants to help out as
fast as he can. A few minutes later, a Jewish-Israeli

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000
reservist also stops to lend a hand. A fitting start to
our journey between cultures. Togetherness in action.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
This is the Israel that Meron Mendel 
knows and loves.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.000
[MM] Straight on. Straight on. We’re almost there.
[JG] First stop: his parents’ house. He hugs his

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.000
mother and father. That’s important to him. They’re
reunited after a year. Reunited after 7 October.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000
[MM] What’s new in the kibbutz? [DM] Not much…
Well, there’s a war going on. That dictates  

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.000
everyday life. [MM] Have a lot of people from the
kibbutz been mobilised? [DM] Of course. There’s a

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
general mobilisation. All reservists have been
called up to the army. [JG] Fight for your own 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
existence. That’s how Meron was raised. His parents
met during the Yom Kippur War in October 1973. 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Many stories in Israel – even love stories – begin
with a battle. [DM] My father was in the War of

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Independence and the Six-Day War. I was in the 
Yom Kippur War. You were in the Lebanon War. And

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Eyal is in the Gaza War. [JG] Meron’s mother is
worried. For Israel and her sons. The youngest is

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:43.000
on the front line. [Haviva Mendel] Two, three, four 
soldiers are killed every day. I’m very worried.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000
This is the kibbutz where Meron Mendel grew up. 
In the middle of the Negev Desert. [MM] Trees, meadows…

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Our kibbutz wanted to let the desert flourish. And
those hills are military training areas. I used to run

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and shoot there back in the day. [JG] There are no
shooting drills at the moment. Most of the soldiers

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
are probably on duty in Gaza. Show respect. Work hard.
Share instead of owning. These values had a strong 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000
influence on his upbringing. [MM] And here’s the
school. [The sound of fighter jets] That’s 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.000
completely normal: war up there, lessons down here.
[JG] One thing is much more exciting than war:

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.000
our camera. Meron was a pupil here himself 40
years ago. [MM] Is anyone here from near Gaza?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:50.000
[Children] Me… me… me… [JG] The gate remains locked.
There are soldiers everywhere. They want to protect

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.000
themselves. From terrorists. [JG] What values were 
taught to you here as a child? What kind of person 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
are you raised to be here in the kibbutz? [MM] The most
important thing is to be productive and 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:16.000
contribute to the community. The entire kibbutz movement
is part of the peace movement. Hardly anyone supports

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Netanyahu’s nationalist government. But that doesn’t
mean that you grow up together with Palestinians.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
[JG] Be open to other cultures. Live in peace with
everyone. But keep your distance. This attitude still

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
rings true in the kibbutz. Meron’s father has been
painting for many years. The 71-year-old deals 

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000
with the problems facing the Bedouins. Around
200,000 of them live in Israel. Little attention

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:52.000
is paid to the nomadic Arab people. [DM] You 
wouldn’t believe it. There are high-voltage power

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.000
lines running over their huts, which are all made
of sheet metal. [JG] That particular metal hut is

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000
home to Eid Ratil. Meron’s father visits him
regularly. The two often meet over a cup of tea.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000
But it’s a friendship with limits. And those limits
were taught to Meron Mendel. You can play with local

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Arab children. But you can’t welcome them into the
kibbutz. One reason: Kibbutzim are largely homogenous

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
communities. To this day. Meron Mendel has challenged
this idea more and more over the years. And he’s 

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:46.000
built up a circle of friends who advocate for peace
and cohesion between Jewish and Arab Israelis.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
One of them is Avital Benshalom. They’ve been 
close friends for many years. She stands here 

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000
every day, demanding the release of all hostages.
The same wish in every Israeli’s heart.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:10.000
[Avital Benshalom] These are the two cute redheads…
from Be’eri… It’s just awful… I haven’t even got

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:24.000
round to crying yet. [JG] A shoulder to cry on.
An important moment for Meron. [AB] I’m quite angry.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Releasing the people isn’t the first goal of this
war. But it should be. [JG] One of the demonstrators

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
is Shaul Levy. He’s a family friend who has known Meron 
since he was little. His 19-year-old granddaughter,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Na’ama, was abducted. The footage has been seen
around the world. But instead of being comforted, 

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000
he’s the comforter. [SL] Stay strong… [MM] I can’t.
I can’t get the images of Na’ama out of my head.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:08.000
I don’t know how you do it… [SL] You take a
deep breath… And keep going. There’s no other way.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000
The young soldier had just started her military
service. Na’ama wanted to become a diplomat. 

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:29.000
She campaigned for reconciliation. [SL] She’s attended
lots of “Hands of Peace” forums abroad. Where Jews

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000
meet Palestinians. [JG] Her chances of ever being
released are uncertain. Her grandfather still

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:45.000
believes in a happy ending. For Na’ama and the whole
of Israel. [SL] There’s hope… It’s not just hope.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I’m sure we’ll get back on the right path. 
[JG] Meron is amazed by his strength. Hope and

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
grief are inextricably bound in this country.
Meron Mendel’s homeland is hurting. But it won’t 

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:13.000
give up just yet. [MM] I’m a bit more optimistic
than I was a few days ago. I see that people are

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:23.000
determined no matter what. As Avital and Shaul said,
we might be on the canvas right now, but now we can

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:32.000
rebuild. Make a fresh start. We have to rethink our
future and do something about it. I find that so 

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:43.000
strong. [JG] This optimism is 
constantly being put to the test.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Rethinking the future is also inevitable for the
country’s many refugees. One of them is Itai. 

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
A friend from Meron’s university days. 
His German-Israeli family lived in a town on the

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:02.000
border with Gaza. Until two months ago. They want to
go back. They want to know how things are at home.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
[MM] You can probably remember a few years back…
We were hiking through the desert with a few friends

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:14.000
of mine from Germany, with sleeping bags and
everything. My friends asked you what it was like

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
living on the border with Gaza. And you said so
casually: It’s not a problem with all the rockets

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
because we live so close to the border. They fly
over us to Ashkelon, to Tel Aviv. It’s safe where

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000
we are. [JG] Safety: a feeling that has been gone
since 7 October. Meron tried to reach his friend

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
for hours. It wasn’t until late in the evening that
that he knew they were alive. [MM] That was one of

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:49.000
the nicest messages I’ve ever received.
[JG] The place almost seems dead. When the siren

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
sounds, you have 15 seconds to get to safety.
There are shelters everywhere. Many of them served

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.000
as a refuge on 7 October. [Itai] An old woman,
the mother of a close childhood friend. She ran from

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:13.000
her house behind that tree into there. A terrorist
saw her inside and shot her. [JG] Itai lost 20 

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.000
neighbours that day. Those who lived here are either
dead or have fled. They were torn from their lives.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.000
All that’s left here are a few abandoned cats. 
Explosions are still ringing out. The Gaza Strip

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.000
is just a few hundred metres away. [MM] I spent a
lot of time in Gaza as a child. Not in that part but 

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000
on the beach. It was the closest beach to the kibbutz.
We played with Palestinian children in the sand.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Things were much different back then. [JG] Despite all
the destruction, as soon as Itai turns onto his street, 

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:14.000
he feels at home. [Itai] That’s our house. Home at
last… And here… This is our shelter. This is where 

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:24.000
we were on 7 October. There was a mattress here.
I took things from the fridge. [JG] They spent 

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
over 12 hours here in the dark. Itai and his
daughter came up with an emergency plan. They hid 

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
two long kitchen knives in the cupboard.
[Maya Shimonovich] If someone were to come in,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.000
I was going to hide in here and the they would have
the knives. [MM] Were you scared? [MS] Yes, very.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.000
They take some food and their favourite clothes.
At least a little bit of their normal lives.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Will they ever be able to live here again? Itai
wants to come back. However: [Itai] I hope that it’s

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.000
actually safe to come back. We’re peaceful people. 
We think the solution is peace.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000
[Tini Maisberger] We actually felt completely safe 
here before 7 October. We thought we were living in 

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:24.000
maximum security. We never locked the house. We left
the car key in the ignition at times. And the children 

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:37.000
were out at night with friends in the village. We 
thought everything was completely safe. But it turns

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000
out it’s not. It’s not safe at all. [JG] You can sense
the inner conflict. This is their home. Or at least

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:55.000
it was. They’re currently staying with relatives,
about a 4-hour drive from Netiv HaAsara. There we 

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
meet Itai’s wife Tini and daughter Maya again.
Tini is from Munich. She was in Germany on 7 October.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000
She found out about the terrorist attack via
WhatsApp. [TM] It’s obviously awful when you’re 

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:18.000
3,000 km away and can’t do anything. [JG] It was
an agonising wait, not knowing whether she would 

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:27.000
ever see her family again. But Tini doesn’t feel hate.
She feels sympathy – for the people in Gaza.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000
[TM] I can’t change the way things are. But I just
think it’s an important feeling to have. You shouldn’t

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000
just close yourself off and have no compassion.
[JG] Maya is defying Hamas’s terror with unwavering

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:53.000
hope. She sees her future in Israel. [MS] I love
Israel! Perhaps my dreams are too big, but I just 

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:02.000
want peace. Because there was a lot of hate here 
before the war. Not only between Palestinians and

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Israelis, but also amongst people in Israel.
I just want us to love and see one another.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.000
[JG] She refuses to let 7 October divide her family,
destroy her values or shake her belief in a peaceful

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Israel. [JG] Not all of Meron’s friends survived.
Shachar and her husband Shlomi were brutally murdered.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Shachar’s family is like a second home to Meron. 
He’s been friends with her brother Yehuda since 

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.000
they were 15. Her parents see Meron as their own
son. [Ilan] Welcome. How are you? [JG] Asks a man

00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:23.000
in need of comfort himself. For her mother, 
Rahel, there’s nothing left to say.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:31.000
[Rahel Troen] At the funeral, I found myself
repeating the words of a song: 'Sometimes it’s me,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Sometimes it’s you, Who is so in need of comfort'.
I felt it was important to comfort one another.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:19:00.000
[JG] It’s a song that Shachar used 
to sing herself.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Shachar. Her name meant “sunrise”. She was known
her gentle heart, confident of peace. Her family

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:22.000
can’t fathom her death. [IT] Our children believed in
the possibilities of mutual understanding. Not just

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000
of stereotyping and hating one another.
[RT] They believed it was important to engage with 

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:37.000
people who are actually different, who have different
beliefs. Not only a different language, a different

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
culture. [JG] Shachar and her husband Shlomi made
a conscious decision to move to Kibbutz Holit.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Knowing full well that living near Gaza could be 
dangerous. They refused to be intimidated. 

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:57.000
They wanted to have a positive impact on society.
They co-founded a Jewish-Arab school.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:06.000
[Yehuda Troen] There was a special happiness that 
she had. I’ll miss it. [JG] They’d celebrated her

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.000
50th birthday just 6 days before her death. Full of
laughter, warmth and friendliness. That’s how

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Shachar was. And so was the Israel she died for.
[YT] She was so happy. Shlomi was so happy.  They were

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:35.000
so good together. That’s how I’ll try to 
remember her. And not focus on her horrible death.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Her father Ilan is looking for a rational explanation
to cope with the loss. His view: Hamas wanted to

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:54.000
exterminate the Jews. [MM] Has your political opinion
changed since 7 October? [IT] For me it’s become 

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000
even more stuck. It made me even more convinced
that the only way is with two states. For me it’s

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:11.000
proof that it’s impossible for one people to take
this whole territory. So maybe this could be a 

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
turning point. Maybe. [JG] Could 7 October really
be a turning point? They’d like to think so.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:25.000
But Rahel also admits that it’s never been as hard 
to cling on to peace as it is now. [RT] It’s not enough

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
to just want peace and work for peace, coexistence 
and mutual understanding. If you’re working with

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:39.000
somebody who actually rejects the very idea of it.
[JG] Meron would like to pay his respects at her grave.
152
00:21:40,000 --&gt; 00:12:47,000
He’s suddenly joined by Rotem, the son of Shachar and
Shlomi. He recounts how he survived and the others

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000
died. The family ran into the shelter. His mother
told him to hide between the wall and the bed.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:05.000
[Rotem Mathias] And then she laid on top of me.
I heard them scream 'Allahu Akbar', and then they

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:21.000
blew up the door. My dad screamed that he’d lost
his arm. There were gunshots, and they threw a grenade.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:30.000
[JG] His parents died upon impact. Rotem remained
under his mother for almost an hour. [RM] I pushed

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:38.000
my mum’s body away. I saw  that there where clumps
of flesh on the bed. [JG] He had no time to process

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:48.000
what he’d seen. He heard the voices of terrorists
again. [RM] So I went to my parents’ bedroom. I took

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:56.000
a cover, put it on top of me and prayed to God.  
But not the Jewish God. Not Allah. I don’t know. 

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
I just prayed to any God. Even Zeus. 
[JG] The 16-year-old had to wait ten hours for help

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
to arrive. He was seriously wounded in the attack.
But he wouldn’t have survived without his parents’

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:17.000
sacrifice. [RM] I’m glad I know them as heroes. 
[JG] The tombstone cites a verse from the

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Song of Songs: “Mighty waters cannot  quench 
love. Rivers cannot sweep it away”.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Israel is not just experiencing loss and pain on
the Jewish side. We’re on the way to the Arab town

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000
of Iksal. We drive past Jewish settlements.
[JG] Are we about to see a completely different 

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
side to Israel? [MM] Israel is very diverse.
That’s part of its identity. We’re not going to

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000
the West Bank. We’re on the border with the West Bank,
but Iksal is actually part of Israeli society. 

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:10.000
The people there see themselves as Palestinians -
but with Israeli citizenship. [JG] One of those 

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
people is Mohammad Darawshe. He’s a close friend and
role model for Meron. They’re united by their

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
joint efforts for peace between Palestinians 
and Jews. The attacks on 7 October hit him very 

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000
personally. Hamas didn’t spare Palestinians. They,
too, were targets. Mohammad’s cousin, Awad, was 

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:35.000
one of their victims. [Mohammad Darawshe] His focus
was on saving lives. That was his dream.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000
[JG] The 23-year-old was working as a paramedic
at the Supernova Festival. When the terror broke out,

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:52.000
he provided first aid to many of the wounded.
[MD] He had bandages in his hands. He ran from

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
one injured person to the next until the bullets
started coming closer. [JG] His colleagues ran for

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:10.000
their lives. Awad refused. [MD] He said: You go.
I speak Arabic. I think I’ll manage. [JG] Less than

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
60 seconds later, he was hit by two bullets.
His funeral prayers were led by Muslim imams and 

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Jewish rabbis. Awad died as a proud Palestinian 
and a proud Israeli. [MD] If people in leadership:

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Israelis, Palestinians, Jews, Arabs, Muslims,
Christians whoever… If more people focused on 

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.000
humanity, decisions might be different. 
[JG] Seeking dialogue. Building  bridges instead

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:47.000
of walls. A mindset that starts with the little things.
Like coffee, for instance. [MD] If you like…

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:57.000
[MM] That’s the most Israeli stuff. [MD] And this
is also connected to your culture. [MD] So you

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.000
have all the cultures in your kitchen. [MD] Yes,
but this is the best… Smell it. [MM] Cardamon.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:12.000
[MD] Exactly! [JG] But it takes more than just
making Arabic coffee together. They quickly get

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
back to the topic. [MD] I believe that without a
political solution, we’re going to have many more 

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
attacks like 7 October. The Palestinians deserve to
have their human dignity protected, and that cannot

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:36.000
be protected under occupation. [JG] Mohammad doesn’t 
just see the occupation as a problem. It’s the problem.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
[MD] So let’s finish Hamas today. Let’s start with
a clean sheet. Will Israel give the Palestinians a

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:50.000
state after Hamas is over? No, and that’s the problem!
[MM] I think that Israel is much more complicated.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
There’s not one Israel. There’s different Israels.
[MD] I haven’t seen a single Israeli who is

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
willing to give the Palestinians their state yet.
[MM] I know a few. I agree with you. The occupation 

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:09.000
is a very big problem. The settlements are a huge problem.
[JG] They agree that holding discussions is important.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
But there also needs to be some political will.
And precisely that is lacking. [MD] We can make  

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
personal peace between us. You as a Jew and me as
a Palestinian. But it needs to transcend to collective

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:30.000
peace. And for collective peace, you need need
political frameworks. [JG] There are no simple

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:39.000
solutions to this conflict. [JG] Could you understand
his harsh criticism? He said that if we don’t 

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
change the occupation problem and the political
dimension, then we’ll see one 7 October after

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
the other. [MM] Mohammad was right to criticise
the occupation. But I find it troubling from an

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
analytical standpoint when he says that the occupation
is the only problem. At certain points during the

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000
conversation, I felt that he almost absolved Hamas
of responsibility and justified their actions.  

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
As though Hamas should act like that as long as
the occupation persists. [JG] Friendship despite

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:17.000
disagreement. Letting others have their say, even if
they disagree with you. Meron Mendel thinks this 

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:32.000
principle is often neglected in Israel.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
This is demonstrated most clearly in the West Bank.
That’s exactly where we’re going. 

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Our destination: Hebron. A microcosm of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Nowhere are settlers 

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:51.000
and Palestinians confronted so directly. Meron Mendel
spent a lot of time there as a young soldier.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:59.000
What does the region look like today, especially
after 7 October? [JG] What is your most vivid

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:09.000
memory of Hebron? [MM] The settlers in Hebron who
threw stones at passers-by from the rooftops.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:17.000
An extreme racist ideology is drilled into them
from the start. They think they’re better than

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.000
the rest. [JG] In 1997, the city was divided into
a Palestinian and a Jewish sector. The latter is

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000
controlled by the Israeli military. The market is
in the heart of the Palestinian sector. Each seller 

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
tries to outprice the other on vegetables. It seems
bizarrely normal. But Meron also notices that

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:44.000
the city has changed. And not for the better.
This road used to be open. [MM] Here we can already

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
see the first settlements in Hebron. [JG] So now
we’re in Palestinian territory. [MM] That’s right.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000
[JG] And that’s Israeli territory over there. 
[MM] Yes and no. That settlement is Jewish, 

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:05.000
so to speak, but the house next door is Palestinian.
So they’re really just individual houses along

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:17.000
that street. [JG] We’re not allowed on the Jewish
side. The soldiers send us to the next checkpoint. 

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:27.000
[MM] She asked whether we were Jewish. [JG] To get in?
[M] Yes, to get in. I’m shocked. [JG] They check 

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.000
our passports and press badges. No luck. That’s
the end of the road for today. [MM] Thousands of

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:43.000
Palestinians live there. And now they’re almost 
imprisoned. I don’t know how they get to their houses.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Or have they already been kicked out? [JG] We soon
get an answer. This Palestinian lives in the 

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Jewish sector. [Ismael Kakarki] They only open the
gate on Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. From 7 am

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:07.000
to 5 pm. [JG] He says that access regulations have
been even stricter since 7 October. The residents

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
are harassed on a daily basis. [IK] Our life is a
tragedy. We’re living in one big prison We’re not

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000
allowed to open our windows. Women are assaulted. 
And we use the roofs to hang out our laundry. 

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Today is Saturday. The settlers will drink
alcohol and throw bottles at our windows.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
[JG] At the time Hebron was divided, around 35,000
Palestinians were living in the Jewish sector. Just ten 

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:40.000
years later, over 40% of them had left the area.
[MM] Those Jewish settlers have no place in this

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:51.000
city. More generally speaking, there should
be no settlements anywhere in the West Bank.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
The only solution to this conflict is the 
two-state solution. [JG] Hebron is an extreme case.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Peaceful coexistence seems impossible there.
But there are also places in Israel where Jews and 

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Palestinians can interact without restrictions.
Those approaches need to be promoted even more,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:18.000
says Meron Mendel. 
Like these boys and girls. True beacons of hope

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000
for Meron Mendel. This is the only bilingual school 
in southern Israel. A project that is particularly

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:33.000
close to the educator’s heart. Here he meets 
Avital again. She runs the school. [AB] So this is

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:42.000
our school. We have a vision to create an equal
educational environment for Jewish and Arab 

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.000
students. [JG] Over 300 children learn side by side
here up to the 6th grade. It’s been this way for

00:32:50.000 --> 00:33:02.000
15 years. Even now, in times of war. They’ve set up
a little mourning corner. [AB] To show their compassion

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:11.000
towards everyone: soldiers, their families here in 
Israel or in Gaza… So it’s kind of a safe space. 

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:19.000
You just put your letter in here and it’s private.
[JG] Some of the children share their thoughts

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:27.000
openly. Like Natem. The 11-year-old has written
a letter to the children of Gaza.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000
[Tanya Zion Waldoks] He wrote: "We care about you
and want to help you. But for now, just try to

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:42.000
survive. So don’t stop believing you will succeed”.
He wrote it to the children. But I think it’s also

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
a message to parents. Hopefully the children 
growing up with this are able to become the leaders

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:56.000
of tomorrow. Then maybe we have hope. [JG] A Jewish
child in Israel instinctively expresses sympathy

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:05.000
for an Arab child in Gaza. It seems trivial.
And yet it’s a small miracle. They sit in on a

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000
class. You can sense how much
Avital cares about her protégés.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:34.000
[children are singing]

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
[MM] It was so amazing to see them. How they love
each other. [AB] They’re pretty good children.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.000
And I think they’re privileged to be together in
such a situation. [JG] The privilege of not having 

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.000
to hate one another. Three quarters of the 
Israeli population are Jews. Around 20% are Arabs. 

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Israel’s schools are generally divided 
into Arabic and Jewish. 

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:10.000
[MM] We both grew up in a segregated school
system. Why is that? [AB] I think it’s the original

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:20.000
sin of Israeli society. A Jewish child doesn’t have
the opportunity to meet an Arab child maybe until

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:27.000
he gets to university. [JG] But many beliefs and
prejudices have already become entrenched by then. 

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
That’s exactly what Arabic teacher Samira wants to
break down. [Samira Alhawarin] You have to know the

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
heritage of the Islamic, Jewish and Christian
cultures. Then you can move away from hate,

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
plant seeds of love and let it grow. If you
understand me and I understand you, there’s no more

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:52.000
room for hate. Only love. [JG] The 28-year-old
sees Israel’s future through the eyes of her students.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
[SA] Nobody here would ever say: 'Go away! You’re
an Arab. I’m not playing with you'. Or: 'Go away!

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
You’re a Jew'. They’re a community. So I see a
brighter future with these children. As long as

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000
they continue on that path. That will also
guide our entire country to a brighter future. 

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000
[JG] And what do the children think?
[Amir] I hope there will be peace. Almost every 

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
child in this school would say the same.
[Dania] They see that I’m Arab, so they just ask me:

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.000
'Who are you with – Palestine or Israel?' 
I’m like, 'I respect everyone. I'm with neither.'

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
[Youssef (next to Yazaan)] The Jews learn our
language. And we Arabs learn their language. 

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:40.000
They learn our holidays. We learn their holidays. 
It’s just fun to be at this school. [JG] It’s words

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:47.000
like these that motivate Avital. It’s the only way
for peace to really prevail at some point. Even if

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000
there’s still a very long way to go. [MM] What we
have here is 1% of the school system. 99% is

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:03.000
segregated. We have to turn that around. If 99%
grew up in a mixed environment, peace could truly be

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
achieved from the ground up. [JG] Meron Mendel is
convinced that real peace building begins with

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:18.000
education. And it’s never too late to start. 
“What’s next for my Israel?”. This question has been

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
playing on Meron Mendel’s mind since 7 October.
The journey is coming to an end. How do you look

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.000
back on the past eight days? [MM] I’ve met people
who are very close to my heart. Some of them I’ve

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
known for 30 or 40 years. There are so many things 
that unite us. And yet I’ve now seen a completely 

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.000
different side to them. They’ve been completely 
reshaped by the past year. And I don’t just mean 

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:52.000
7 October. They spent a year fighting for democracy.
Against the government. And since October, they’ve 

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
been fighting for their existence. That’s what
everyone is saying. It’s our existence at stake.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:08.000
[JG] What kind of future do you see for Israel?
[MM] What gives me hope is the cohesion of civil

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:17.000
society. Everyone we’ve spoken to has made one point
very clear: There’s a desire for peace. Both the 

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Palestinians we’ve spoken to, such as 
Mohammad Darawshe, and Jewish Israelis. That’s a

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:33.000
real glimmer of hope in very dark times.
[JG] Everyone is hurting. Jews and Palestinians. 

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
They’re united in their suffering. Therein lies an
opportunity. To make amends. To rethink Israel 

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
together. Meron Mendel has met people with
the strength and desire to do exactly that.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
They’ve strengthened his own belief in a peaceful
future. His homeland has rarely been so fragile.
