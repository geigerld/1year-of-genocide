[Jenifer Girke] The day that changed everything. On 7 October, Meron Mendel’s world stood still. [Meron Mendel] Everybody continued their life. I said: Stop! I can’t! [JG] Peace for Israel: That’s what he’s fighting for. In his homeland and in Germany. As a kibbutznik. As an Israeli soldier. As the Director of the Anne Frank Educational Centre. He builds bridges between cultures. He loves Israel.  And criticises it. He was raised to be peaceful. [David Mendel] We taught you not to hate and to  always seek peace. [JG] He’s travelling to his wounded homeland. He wants to support his family  and friends. To grieve, digest and hope together. [Yehuda] There was a special happiness that she had. I’ll miss it. [JG] It’s a journey to an Israel that has to find itself again. To a familiar yet foreign homeland. With an uncertain future.  [Mohammad] Will Israel give the Palestinians a state  Into his own beliefs. How much of this remains after 7 October? [Itai] We think the solution is peace. [Rahel] It’s not enough to just want peace. [JG] Meron Mendel wants to know: “What’s next for  my Israel?” [INTRO] A suitcase full of pain. Returning to Israel is a familiar feeling for Meron Mendel. But this time  everything is different. Not all of his loved ones survived the terrorist attack on 7 October. [MM] I’ve been living in Germany for over 20 years. But all those years meant nothing in that moment.  I suddenly realised that I belong there. That’s where I grew up. That’s where my childhood friends are. My family is there. I need to be there. [JG] Meron Mendel came to Frankfurt in 2003. Today he directs the Anne Frank Educational Centre and is a professor of social work. The 47-year-old is married to the political scientist Saba-Nur Cheema. She’s a Muslim. He’s a Jew. Together they promote diversity in society. They’re passionate about peace in the Middle East.  Even now. What’s next for Israel? A very personal question for Meron Mendel. And one he needs to  ask to overcome his own trauma from 7 October. He’ll get answers. And we’ll join him on his journey.  [MM] I’ve been waiting for this moment for over a month. Yes, I’m excited. But I’m also very tense. [Aeroplane announcement] “Solidarity with Israel”. We arrive. The airport corridors are lined with  pictures of hostages. As we’re about to leave… We hear an air-raid siren. The next bunker is too far away. The way there is too dangerous. [MM] Now we’ve truly arrived. [JG] After a while, we’re given the all-clear. We’re finally on the way to Mashabe Sade. On the way home. But then… Our car breaks down in the middle of the highway. It’s not long before a young Arab comes over.  The Bedouin lives nearby and wants to help out as fast as he can. A few minutes later, a Jewish-Israeli reservist also stops to lend a hand. A fitting start to our journey between cultures. Togetherness in action. This is the Israel that Meron Mendel  knows and loves. [MM] Straight on. Straight on. We’re almost there. [JG] First stop: his parents’ house. He hugs his mother and father. That’s important to him. They’re reunited after a year. Reunited after 7 October. [MM] What’s new in the kibbutz? [DM] Not much… Well, there’s a war going on. That dictates   everyday life. [MM] Have a lot of people from the kibbutz been mobilised? [DM] Of course. There’s a general mobilisation. All reservists have been called up to the army. [JG] Fight for your own  existence. That’s how Meron was raised. His parents met during the Yom Kippur War in October 1973.  Many stories in Israel – even love stories – begin with a battle. [DM] My father was in the War of Independence and the Six-Day War. I was in the  Yom Kippur War. You were in the Lebanon War. And Eyal is in the Gaza War. [JG] Meron’s mother is worried. For Israel and her sons. The youngest is on the front line. [Haviva Mendel] Two, three, four  soldiers are killed every day. I’m very worried. This is the kibbutz where Meron Mendel grew up.  In the middle of the Negev Desert. [MM] Trees, meadows… Our kibbutz wanted to let the desert flourish. And those hills are military training areas. I used to run and shoot there back in the day. [JG] There are no shooting drills at the moment. Most of the soldiers are probably on duty in Gaza. Show respect. Work hard. Share instead of owning. These values had a strong  influence on his upbringing. [MM] And here’s the school. [The sound of fighter jets] That’s  completely normal: war up there, lessons down here. [JG] One thing is much more exciting than war: our camera. Meron was a pupil here himself 40 years ago. [MM] Is anyone here from near Gaza? [Children] Me… me… me… [JG] The gate remains locked. There are soldiers everywhere. They want to protect themselves. From terrorists. [JG] What values were  taught to you here as a child? What kind of person  are you raised to be here in the kibbutz? [MM] The most important thing is to be productive and  contribute to the community. The entire kibbutz movement is part of the peace movement. Hardly anyone supports Netanyahu’s nationalist government. But that doesn’t mean that you grow up together with Palestinians. [JG] Be open to other cultures. Live in peace with everyone. But keep your distance. This attitude still rings true in the kibbutz. Meron’s father has been painting for many years. The 71-year-old deals  with the problems facing the Bedouins. Around 200,000 of them live in Israel. Little attention is paid to the nomadic Arab people. [DM] You  wouldn’t believe it. There are high-voltage power lines running over their huts, which are all made of sheet metal. [JG] That particular metal hut is home to Eid Ratil. Meron’s father visits him regularly. The two often meet over a cup of tea. But it’s a friendship with limits. And those limits were taught to Meron Mendel. You can play with local Arab children. But you can’t welcome them into the kibbutz. One reason: Kibbutzim are largely homogenous communities. To this day. Meron Mendel has challenged this idea more and more over the years. And he’s  built up a circle of friends who advocate for peace and cohesion between Jewish and Arab Israelis. One of them is Avital Benshalom. They’ve been  close friends for many years. She stands here  every day, demanding the release of all hostages. The same wish in every Israeli’s heart. [Avital Benshalom] These are the two cute redheads… from Be’eri… It’s just awful… I haven’t even got round to crying yet. [JG] A shoulder to cry on. An important moment for Meron. [AB] I’m quite angry. Releasing the people isn’t the first goal of this war. But it should be. [JG] One of the demonstrators is Shaul Levy. He’s a family friend who has known Meron  since he was little. His 19-year-old granddaughter, Na’ama, was abducted. The footage has been seen around the world. But instead of being comforted,  he’s the comforter. [SL] Stay strong… [MM] I can’t. I can’t get the images of Na’ama out of my head. I don’t know how you do it… [SL] You take a deep breath… And keep going. There’s no other way. The young soldier had just started her military service. Na’ama wanted to become a diplomat.  She campaigned for reconciliation. [SL] She’s attended lots of “Hands of Peace” forums abroad. Where Jews meet Palestinians. [JG] Her chances of ever being released are uncertain. Her grandfather still believes in a happy ending. For Na’ama and the whole of Israel. [SL] There’s hope… It’s not just hope. I’m sure we’ll get back on the right path.  [JG] Meron is amazed by his strength. Hope and grief are inextricably bound in this country. Meron Mendel’s homeland is hurting. But it won’t  give up just yet. [MM] I’m a bit more optimistic than I was a few days ago. I see that people are determined no matter what. As Avital and Shaul said, we might be on the canvas right now, but now we can rebuild. Make a fresh start. We have to rethink our future and do something about it. I find that so  strong. [JG] This optimism is  constantly being put to the test. Rethinking the future is also inevitable for the country’s many refugees. One of them is Itai.  A friend from Meron’s university days.  His German-Israeli family lived in a town on the border with Gaza. Until two months ago. They want to go back. They want to know how things are at home. [MM] You can probably remember a few years back… We were hiking through the desert with a few friends of mine from Germany, with sleeping bags and everything. My friends asked you what it was like living on the border with Gaza. And you said so casually: It’s not a problem with all the rockets because we live so close to the border. They fly over us to Ashkelon, to Tel Aviv. It’s safe where we are. [JG] Safety: a feeling that has been gone since 7 October. Meron tried to reach his friend for hours. It wasn’t until late in the evening that that he knew they were alive. [MM] That was one of the nicest messages I’ve ever received. [JG] The place almost seems dead. When the siren sounds, you have 15 seconds to get to safety. There are shelters everywhere. Many of them served as a refuge on 7 October. [Itai] An old woman, the mother of a close childhood friend. She ran from her house behind that tree into there. A terrorist saw her inside and shot her. [JG] Itai lost 20  neighbours that day. Those who lived here are either dead or have fled. They were torn from their lives. All that’s left here are a few abandoned cats.  Explosions are still ringing out. The Gaza Strip is just a few hundred metres away. [MM] I spent a lot of time in Gaza as a child. Not in that part but  on the beach. It was the closest beach to the kibbutz. We played with Palestinian children in the sand. Things were much different back then. [JG] Despite all the destruction, as soon as Itai turns onto his street,  he feels at home. [Itai] That’s our house. Home at last… And here… This is our shelter. This is where  we were on 7 October. There was a mattress here. I took things from the fridge. [JG] They spent  over 12 hours here in the dark. Itai and his daughter came up with an emergency plan. They hid  two long kitchen knives in the cupboard. [Maya Shimonovich] If someone were to come in, I was going to hide in here and the they would have the knives. [MM] Were you scared? [MS] Yes, very. They take some food and their favourite clothes. At least a little bit of their normal lives. Will they ever be able to live here again? Itai wants to come back. However: [Itai] I hope that it’s actually safe to come back. We’re peaceful people.  We think the solution is peace. [Tini Maisberger] We actually felt completely safe  here before 7 October. We thought we were living in  maximum security. We never locked the house. We left the car key in the ignition at times. And the children  were out at night with friends in the village. We  thought everything was completely safe. But it turns out it’s not. It’s not safe at all. [JG] You can sense the inner conflict. This is their home. Or at least it was. They’re currently staying with relatives, about a 4-hour drive from Netiv HaAsara. There we  meet Itai’s wife Tini and daughter Maya again. Tini is from Munich. She was in Germany on 7 October. She found out about the terrorist attack via WhatsApp. [TM] It’s obviously awful when you’re  3,000 km away and can’t do anything. [JG] It was an agonising wait, not knowing whether she would  ever see her family again. But Tini doesn’t feel hate. She feels sympathy – for the people in Gaza. [TM] I can’t change the way things are. But I just think it’s an important feeling to have. You shouldn’t just close yourself off and have no compassion. [JG] Maya is defying Hamas’s terror with unwavering hope. She sees her future in Israel. [MS] I love Israel! Perhaps my dreams are too big, but I just  want peace. Because there was a lot of hate here  before the war. Not only between Palestinians and Israelis, but also amongst people in Israel. I just want us to love and see one another. [JG] She refuses to let 7 October divide her family, destroy her values or shake her belief in a peaceful Israel. [JG] Not all of Meron’s friends survived. Shachar and her husband Shlomi were brutally murdered. Shachar’s family is like a second home to Meron.  He’s been friends with her brother Yehuda since  they were 15. Her parents see Meron as their own son. [Ilan] Welcome. How are you? [JG] Asks a man in need of comfort himself. For her mother,  Rahel, there’s nothing left to say. [Rahel Troen] At the funeral, I found myself repeating the words of a song: 'Sometimes it’s me, Sometimes it’s you, Who is so in need of comfort'. I felt it was important to comfort one another. [JG] It’s a song that Shachar used  to sing herself. Shachar. Her name meant “sunrise”. She was known her gentle heart, confident of peace. Her family can’t fathom her death. [IT] Our children believed in the possibilities of mutual understanding. Not just of stereotyping and hating one another. [RT] They believed it was important to engage with  people who are actually different, who have different beliefs. Not only a different language, a different culture. [JG] Shachar and her husband Shlomi made a conscious decision to move to Kibbutz Holit. Knowing full well that living near Gaza could be  dangerous. They refused to be intimidated.  They wanted to have a positive impact on society. They co-founded a Jewish-Arab school. [Yehuda Troen] There was a special happiness that  she had. I’ll miss it. [JG] They’d celebrated her 50th birthday just 6 days before her death. Full of laughter, warmth and friendliness. That’s how Shachar was. And so was the Israel she died for. [YT] She was so happy. Shlomi was so happy.  They were so good together. That’s how I’ll try to  remember her. And not focus on her horrible death. Her father Ilan is looking for a rational explanation to cope with the loss. His view: Hamas wanted to exterminate the Jews. [MM] Has your political opinion changed since 7 October? [IT] For me it’s become  even more stuck. It made me even more convinced that the only way is with two states. For me it’s proof that it’s impossible for one people to take this whole territory. So maybe this could be a  turning point. Maybe. [JG] Could 7 October really be a turning point? They’d like to think so. But Rahel also admits that it’s never been as hard  to cling on to peace as it is now. [RT] It’s not enough to just want peace and work for peace, coexistence  and mutual understanding. If you’re working with somebody who actually rejects the very idea of it. [JG] Meron would like to pay his respects at her grave. 152 00:21:40,000 --&gt; 00:12:47,000 He’s suddenly joined by Rotem, the son of Shachar and Shlomi. He recounts how he survived and the others died. The family ran into the shelter. His mother told him to hide between the wall and the bed. [Rotem Mathias] And then she laid on top of me. I heard them scream 'Allahu Akbar', and then they blew up the door. My dad screamed that he’d lost his arm. There were gunshots, and they threw a grenade. [JG] His parents died upon impact. Rotem remained under his mother for almost an hour. [RM] I pushed my mum’s body away. I saw  that there where clumps of flesh on the bed. [JG] He had no time to process what he’d seen. He heard the voices of terrorists again. [RM] So I went to my parents’ bedroom. I took a cover, put it on top of me and prayed to God.   But not the Jewish God. Not Allah. I don’t know.  I just prayed to any God. Even Zeus.  [JG] The 16-year-old had to wait ten hours for help to arrive. He was seriously wounded in the attack. But he wouldn’t have survived without his parents’ sacrifice. [RM] I’m glad I know them as heroes.  [JG] The tombstone cites a verse from the Song of Songs: “Mighty waters cannot  quench  love. Rivers cannot sweep it away”. Israel is not just experiencing loss and pain on the Jewish side. We’re on the way to the Arab town of Iksal. We drive past Jewish settlements. [JG] Are we about to see a completely different  side to Israel? [MM] Israel is very diverse. That’s part of its identity. We’re not going to the West Bank. We’re on the border with the West Bank, but Iksal is actually part of Israeli society.  The people there see themselves as Palestinians - but with Israeli citizenship. [JG] One of those  people is Mohammad Darawshe. He’s a close friend and role model for Meron. They’re united by their joint efforts for peace between Palestinians  and Jews. The attacks on 7 October hit him very  personally. Hamas didn’t spare Palestinians. They, too, were targets. Mohammad’s cousin, Awad, was  one of their victims. [Mohammad Darawshe] His focus was on saving lives. That was his dream. [JG] The 23-year-old was working as a paramedic at the Supernova Festival. When the terror broke out, he provided first aid to many of the wounded. [MD] He had bandages in his hands. He ran from one injured person to the next until the bullets started coming closer. [JG] His colleagues ran for their lives. Awad refused. [MD] He said: You go. I speak Arabic. I think I’ll manage. [JG] Less than 60 seconds later, he was hit by two bullets. His funeral prayers were led by Muslim imams and  Jewish rabbis. Awad died as a proud Palestinian  and a proud Israeli. [MD] If people in leadership: Israelis, Palestinians, Jews, Arabs, Muslims, Christians whoever… If more people focused on  humanity, decisions might be different.  [JG] Seeking dialogue. Building  bridges instead of walls. A mindset that starts with the little things. Like coffee, for instance. [MD] If you like… [MM] That’s the most Israeli stuff. [MD] And this is also connected to your culture. [MD] So you have all the cultures in your kitchen. [MD] Yes, but this is the best… Smell it. [MM] Cardamon. [MD] Exactly! [JG] But it takes more than just making Arabic coffee together. They quickly get back to the topic. [MD] I believe that without a political solution, we’re going to have many more  attacks like 7 October. The Palestinians deserve to have their human dignity protected, and that cannot be protected under occupation. [JG] Mohammad doesn’t  just see the occupation as a problem. It’s the problem. [MD] So let’s finish Hamas today. Let’s start with a clean sheet. Will Israel give the Palestinians a state after Hamas is over? No, and that’s the problem! [MM] I think that Israel is much more complicated. There’s not one Israel. There’s different Israels. [MD] I haven’t seen a single Israeli who is willing to give the Palestinians their state yet. [MM] I know a few. I agree with you. The occupation  is a very big problem. The settlements are a huge problem. [JG] They agree that holding discussions is important. But there also needs to be some political will. And precisely that is lacking. [MD] We can make   personal peace between us. You as a Jew and me as a Palestinian. But it needs to transcend to collective peace. And for collective peace, you need need political frameworks. [JG] There are no simple solutions to this conflict. [JG] Could you understand his harsh criticism? He said that if we don’t  change the occupation problem and the political dimension, then we’ll see one 7 October after the other. [MM] Mohammad was right to criticise the occupation. But I find it troubling from an analytical standpoint when he says that the occupation is the only problem. At certain points during the conversation, I felt that he almost absolved Hamas of responsibility and justified their actions.   As though Hamas should act like that as long as the occupation persists. [JG] Friendship despite disagreement. Letting others have their say, even if they disagree with you. Meron Mendel thinks this  principle is often neglected in Israel. This is demonstrated most clearly in the West Bank. That’s exactly where we’re going.  Our destination: Hebron. A microcosm of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Nowhere are settlers  and Palestinians confronted so directly. Meron Mendel spent a lot of time there as a young soldier. What does the region look like today, especially after 7 October? [JG] What is your most vivid memory of Hebron? [MM] The settlers in Hebron who threw stones at passers-by from the rooftops. An extreme racist ideology is drilled into them from the start. They think they’re better than the rest. [JG] In 1997, the city was divided into a Palestinian and a Jewish sector. The latter is controlled by the Israeli military. The market is in the heart of the Palestinian sector. Each seller  tries to outprice the other on vegetables. It seems bizarrely normal. But Meron also notices that the city has changed. And not for the better. This road used to be open. [MM] Here we can already see the first settlements in Hebron. [JG] So now we’re in Palestinian territory. [MM] That’s right. [JG] And that’s Israeli territory over there.  [MM] Yes and no. That settlement is Jewish,  so to speak, but the house next door is Palestinian. So they’re really just individual houses along that street. [JG] We’re not allowed on the Jewish side. The soldiers send us to the next checkpoint.  [MM] She asked whether we were Jewish. [JG] To get in? [M] Yes, to get in. I’m shocked. [JG] They check  our passports and press badges. No luck. That’s the end of the road for today. [MM] Thousands of Palestinians live there. And now they’re almost  imprisoned. I don’t know how they get to their houses. Or have they already been kicked out? [JG] We soon get an answer. This Palestinian lives in the  Jewish sector. [Ismael Kakarki] They only open the gate on Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. From 7 am to 5 pm. [JG] He says that access regulations have been even stricter since 7 October. The residents are harassed on a daily basis. [IK] Our life is a tragedy. We’re living in one big prison We’re not allowed to open our windows. Women are assaulted.  And we use the roofs to hang out our laundry.  Today is Saturday. The settlers will drink alcohol and throw bottles at our windows. [JG] At the time Hebron was divided, around 35,000 Palestinians were living in the Jewish sector. Just ten  years later, over 40% of them had left the area. [MM] Those Jewish settlers have no place in this city. More generally speaking, there should be no settlements anywhere in the West Bank. The only solution to this conflict is the  two-state solution. [JG] Hebron is an extreme case. Peaceful coexistence seems impossible there. But there are also places in Israel where Jews and  Palestinians can interact without restrictions. Those approaches need to be promoted even more, says Meron Mendel.  Like these boys and girls. True beacons of hope for Meron Mendel. This is the only bilingual school  in southern Israel. A project that is particularly close to the educator’s heart. Here he meets  Avital again. She runs the school. [AB] So this is our school. We have a vision to create an equal educational environment for Jewish and Arab  students. [JG] Over 300 children learn side by side here up to the 6th grade. It’s been this way for 15 years. Even now, in times of war. They’ve set up a little mourning corner. [AB] To show their compassion towards everyone: soldiers, their families here in  Israel or in Gaza… So it’s kind of a safe space.  You just put your letter in here and it’s private. [JG] Some of the children share their thoughts openly. Like Natem. The 11-year-old has written a letter to the children of Gaza. [Tanya Zion Waldoks] He wrote: "We care about you and want to help you. But for now, just try to survive. So don’t stop believing you will succeed”. He wrote it to the children. But I think it’s also a message to parents. Hopefully the children  growing up with this are able to become the leaders of tomorrow. Then maybe we have hope. [JG] A Jewish child in Israel instinctively expresses sympathy for an Arab child in Gaza. It seems trivial. And yet it’s a small miracle. They sit in on a class. You can sense how much Avital cares about her protégés. [children are singing] [MM] It was so amazing to see them. How they love each other. [AB] They’re pretty good children. And I think they’re privileged to be together in such a situation. [JG] The privilege of not having  to hate one another. Three quarters of the  Israeli population are Jews. Around 20% are Arabs.  Israel’s schools are generally divided  into Arabic and Jewish.  [MM] We both grew up in a segregated school system. Why is that? [AB] I think it’s the original sin of Israeli society. A Jewish child doesn’t have the opportunity to meet an Arab child maybe until he gets to university. [JG] But many beliefs and prejudices have already become entrenched by then.  That’s exactly what Arabic teacher Samira wants to break down. [Samira Alhawarin] You have to know the heritage of the Islamic, Jewish and Christian cultures. Then you can move away from hate, plant seeds of love and let it grow. If you understand me and I understand you, there’s no more room for hate. Only love. [JG] The 28-year-old sees Israel’s future through the eyes of her students. [SA] Nobody here would ever say: 'Go away! You’re an Arab. I’m not playing with you'. Or: 'Go away! You’re a Jew'. They’re a community. So I see a brighter future with these children. As long as they continue on that path. That will also guide our entire country to a brighter future.  [JG] And what do the children think? [Amir] I hope there will be peace. Almost every  child in this school would say the same. [Dania] They see that I’m Arab, so they just ask me: 'Who are you with – Palestine or Israel?'  I’m like, 'I respect everyone. I'm with neither.' [Youssef (next to Yazaan)] The Jews learn our language. And we Arabs learn their language.  They learn our holidays. We learn their holidays.  It’s just fun to be at this school. [JG] It’s words like these that motivate Avital. It’s the only way for peace to really prevail at some point. Even if there’s still a very long way to go. [MM] What we have here is 1% of the school system. 99% is segregated. We have to turn that around. If 99% grew up in a mixed environment, peace could truly be achieved from the ground up. [JG] Meron Mendel is convinced that real peace building begins with education. And it’s never too late to start.  “What’s next for my Israel?”. This question has been playing on Meron Mendel’s mind since 7 October. The journey is coming to an end. How do you look back on the past eight days? [MM] I’ve met people who are very close to my heart. Some of them I’ve known for 30 or 40 years. There are so many things  that unite us. And yet I’ve now seen a completely  different side to them. They’ve been completely  reshaped by the past year. And I don’t just mean  7 October. They spent a year fighting for democracy. Against the government. And since October, they’ve  been fighting for their existence. That’s what everyone is saying. It’s our existence at stake. [JG] What kind of future do you see for Israel? [MM] What gives me hope is the cohesion of civil society. Everyone we’ve spoken to has made one point very clear: There’s a desire for peace. Both the  Palestinians we’ve spoken to, such as  Mohammad Darawshe, and Jewish Israelis. That’s a real glimmer of hope in very dark times. [JG] Everyone is hurting. Jews and Palestinians.  They’re united in their suffering. Therein lies an opportunity. To make amends. To rethink Israel  together. Meron Mendel has met people with the strength and desire to do exactly that. They’ve strengthened his own belief in a peaceful future. His homeland has rarely been so fragile.  Its future is on a knife edge. He feels more connected to the country and its people than ever before. [CREDITS]
