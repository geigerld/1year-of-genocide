hello and welcome to verified live at least 1,000 Israelis are now known to have been killed in Hamas attacks over the weekend more Rockets have been fired today into Israel with the Israeli Port of ashalon targeted in the past few hours Israel has continued its campaign of air strikes on Gaza for a fourth day un Aid agencies have warned of the severe consequences of Israel's Siege on the territory the World Health organiz sttion has called for a humanitarian Corridor to be opened into the area the families of Israelis taken hostage have been speaking about their Agony today the Israeli Army says it's contacted the families of 50 soldiers seized by herass at least 123 Israeli soldiers have been killed since Saturday well coming up in this hour we'll hear from a former senior minister in the Palestinian Authority we'll also hear from an Israeli whose family members have been Tak hostage and from Oxfam on the humanitarian situation in Gaza but let's take a closer look at the attacks on ashon in the last couple of hours our correspondent Anna Foster has been there in the city as those attacks began the sirens went immediately I think actually I was just about to take you upstairs out of the shelter um because uh we thought that there was the all clear uh but again I can hear just coming from upstairs the sound of the Sirens once again here in ashalon you can see uh there's people around me I should just tell you a little bit more about where we are actually this is the the center of ashalon at a shopping center that at this time it's just after 5:00 on a on a Tuesday here in Israel it would be really really busy uh one of our local producers the words he used were um you wouldn't be able to breathe in this place at this time on a normal weekday it would be wall to wall it would be packed with people uh who just finished work um who were out for the the evening uh but instead all of the shops up there are shut there are still you can see people drifting down this is basically an underground shelter and it's Robbie if you wouldn't mind just um around here um they're all really well marked so if you come into one of these areas uh you know where you have to go so we were just out 5:00 when the sirens started uh we came down the stairwell there's a a shelter right underground there you can see I'm just going to take to this corner and you can just sort of see up the stairs because remember people who live uh in these areas they are used to Rocket attacks coming from Gaza this is not something that they they haven't experienced before um I wouldn't say they were relaxed about it but you know they they've they've done this many many times um so they come into a place of safety when they get underground you can see them starting to move out again so well right here because we are so very close to the uh the perimeter the perimeter fence from Gaza this is something this is an area that is within reach for Hamas Rockets essentially so what they do is they they send them right around this area of Southern Israel uh and they put out the alasan brigades that the military wing of Hamas put out this warning earlier today asking people in ashalon to leave by 1700 local time and as I was just explaining to you at 1700 uh we were just outside the sirens started straight away 10 minutes or so ago we've had the sirens twice but I just want to show you we lost the signal a little bit cuz we were obviously downstairs in that shelter uh with the very thick walls but look this would normally be so busy on uh on a Tuesday afternoon the shops are all shut there's nobody here I'm just going to take you outside uh so you can see just how quiet this place is right now um a lot of people are choosing to to stay at home some have left all together um but a lot of people are choosing to stay stay at home stay indoors stay places where there are shelters where they know they can be safe but look it just gives you an idea Matthew if you look around here you know it should be a car park packed with cars it's a a beautiful sunny evening here in ashalon less than 10 kmers from Gaza um but people here they are indoors they're in shelters they're doing what they can to stay safe Hann of Hoster in ashalon the Israeli military have taken journalist to a kabut today where soldiers have been removing the bodies of people killed by Hamas including babies and children just a warning we're about to show some distressing images from that area a small community has been destroyed with bodies strewn across the area troops were unable to remove the victims until now because of the fighting and the need to disable booby traps Israeli combat soldiers are still deployed in the fields around that kibuts our International editor Jeremy Bowen is there and sent this update these are combat troops from elite units and there is a high state of Readiness here you can feel it the confusion in the the Israeli Army that followed the initial Hamas attack has gone now as they've come in and regained control of these border areas it was tough enough for the Israelis to come in to recapture this area these small border communities it is a different order of military challenge to cross the wire to get into Gaza potentially to fight house to house at a time when Hamas will have made its plans and we be waiting well we gone straight to these live pictures from Gaza because as the light has dimmed that is the scene and we've seen this now for 4 days these strikes in retaliation from Israel lighting up the sky some strikes there Israel says on Hamas positions but we know from the Palestinian authorities that over 800 100 people have now been confirmed dead in that area let's bring in Lee duet who's there for us in Jerusalem as we stay with these pictures day four of this and absolutely no letup lease in terms of the Israeli response Israeli response and uh Hamas response it it was extraordinary that we heard at about 3:30 local time that they were going to attack uh the area of ashalon in retaliation for Israeli bombardment of Gaza and right right on time local time 5:00 there was a rain of rockets into ashalon you were reporting them earlier in the program and now comes Israel's retaliation last night was reported as the night of the most intense aerial bombardment of Gaza and now as as the night draws in it looks looks like it will be another night the same last night Israel said it hit 2,400 Hamas targets uh we know that they have said prime minister Netanyahu has said they will hit everything to do with Hamas they want to to Tred to degrade or destroy all of their in infrastructure we our our viewers will have seen the comments by our reporter in Gaza rushi Abu Alo he's been there for 20 years reporting from which means that he's reported on a lot of wars and he said last night was the most frightening night that he and his family the families who living in their building had ever lived through yes it was a really graphic account he gave uh on the BBC a little early he even filmed when he got outside some of the damage in Gaza he described it at one stage as looking like an earthquake had struck now the Prime Minister said uh around this time yesterday it was only the beginning in terms of options for the Israelis what is still available to them a lot is available to them we heard from the Prime Minister prime minister Benjamin atyu last night warning that Israel's air strikes that we've been discussing that our viewers have been seeing in the live shots from Gaza was only the beginning of a war he said Israel was now engaging nothing less he said than to ensure Ure Israel's survival as we've been reporting most of that military activity over the past few days has centered around ashalon around the southern border where it's given that the Israelis say they have recovered so far 1,500 bodies of Hamas Fighters those who managed to penetrate what was always regarded as an impenetrable fence with so many uh you know high-tech sensors drones te- walls watch Towers meant to keep Hamas away from firing Rockets from entering and of course Hamas was able to overcome all of that we heard from Israel earlier today they believe they have secured that border with the Gaza Strip although they admit it there may still be ways for Hamas fighters to penetrate but once they feel they have that area under control and they will intensify the bombardment try to to diminish hamas's cap capabilities in the Gaza Strip while all the while preparing for what is widely expected to be highly dangerous um highly risky but what Israel now believes is highly necessary a ground incursion of the kind they haven't undertaken since they pulled out their troops from Gaza in 2005 briefly at least because we've been hearing from some of the families about loved ones taken hostage how much real pressure is growing on benj Netanyahu in terms of trying to get those citizens back huge pressure Israel always regards it as absolutely vital to bring every Israeli home they negotiated for five years to get one Israeli soldier gilad Shalit uh out of Hamas hands this time the situation is different because of hamas's assault on Israel and so many lives lost that may change the Dynamics a bit but they'll do everything possible but it is a process fraught with risk
