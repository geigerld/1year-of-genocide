hello I'm Nikki schill welcome to the program we start this hour with the latest developments in the Middle East President Biden has promised Israel Ironclad United States support amid fears that Iran could launch reprisals for an attack that killed senior Iranians Us Media are reporting that an American General visit Israel on Thursday to discuss Washington's fears President Biden warned at Iran is threatening to launch a significant attack after Israel struck the Iranian Consulate in Syria 10 days ago Mr Biden was speaking hours after the Iranian supreme leader again said Israel would be punished for the strike on its consulate meanwhile the Hamas political leader ishmail hania says there'll be no change in the group's demands for a permanent ceas fight in Gaza despite the killing of three of his sons in an Israeli air strike Israeli media is reporting that the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had not been briefed in advance of the attack this video is believed to show Ismael hania receiving the news in Qatar where he lives in Exile Israel has confirmed the strike describing the Suns as Hamas military operatives he's been actively involved in negotiations to broker a ceasefire with Israel demanding a permanent end to the fighting and the return of displaced Palestinians to their homes we'll assess the implications of the killing of his sons in a moment first his President Biden on the threat posed by Iran in the region we also want to address the Iranian threat to launch a sign they're attack on Israel as I told prime minister Netanyahu our commitment to Israel's security against these threats from Iran and his proxies is Ironclad let me say it again Ironclad we're going to do all we can to protect Israel's security let's go live to our Middle East correspondent Hugo Bea who is in Jerusalem we heard President Biden there Hugo there are real fears now over what Iran might do and the possibility of the conflict spreading wider in the region yeah and it's very interesting that over the last few days American officials have been saying that they believe this possible Iranian uh response to that attack in Damascus is a matter of when and not if and uh obviously you know we don't know what the Iranians are planning to do they have this network of factions across the region the socalled axes of resistance which includes Hezbollah in Lebanon the houthis in Yemen uh factions in Iraq and Syria and all those players have already been involved in this conflict Hezbollah for example has been attacking Israel from Lebanon almost every day but I think the fear here is that Iran may be planning to launch an attack by itself uh you know from its own territory and that could be involving um missiles and drones and uh Israeli officials have been saying that uh they are going to retaliate to any kind of attack coming from uh Iran uh Israeli Authority said they would give a significant response and uh I think you know in another sign of these concerns uh today the axio website is reporting that the senior US military commander in charge of the Middle East is going to come to Israel to have conversations with the Israeli defense minister and also with u military officials and I think what President Biden was trying to say is that despite uh the differences uh you know between the Americans and the Israelis over the you know the Israeli conduct in the war in Gaza and we've seen in the last few days you know the level of frustration from America uh with Israel with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu President Biden is saying that these two countries remain very strong allies and that any kind of Iranian attack on Israel would trigger uh an American reaction if we move now to that attack that killed the three sons of hamas's political lead what more do we know about the attack itself yeah so is ha is saying that this was a political assassination and that uh you know his reaction was that you know Israel would be delusional to think that this would change uh you know the position of Hamas in these ceasefire negotiations I think you know the key context here to this attack is that uh this happened as you know uh we're waiting to to hear from Hamas whether they're going to accept you know the ceasefire proposal that was put forward after those mediat negotiations in Cairo and uh at the heart of this proposal is a six we ceasefire uh in the conflict in Gaza uh and uh you know this would see Hamas uh releasing you know 40 hostages were being held in Gaza in return for 900 Palestinians were now being held in Israeli jails but many obstacles remain because it seems that Hamas has told negotiators that it doesn't have you know 40 hostages who fit the criteria that has been you know set up in this proposal you know female soldiers elderly people people who are sick uh and it seems that there's some differences as well uh related to the identity of the prisoners who are going to be released so we're still waiting to hear from Hamas but I think you know Hamas has been sticking with its you know demand that any kind of ceasefire in Gaza should be permanent because you know senior Hamas official said that they believe that any kind of temporary ceas fire would mean that once the hostages are out the Israelis May return to Gaza to finish the job and tried to destroy Hamas so they want a permanent ceasefire they want the end o of the war but we're still waiting to see uh you know how they're going to respond to this latest proposal Hugo PGA at Middle East correspondent live in Jerusalem thank you
