well in an attempt to contain the conflict to stop it from spreading to The Wider region the French President Emmanuel maon has become the latest world leader to to visit Israel first in a show of strong solidarity speaking alongside his Israeli counterpart Isaac Herzog he said the first objective of Israel's war in Gaza should be to secure the release of all the hostages president Manon added that it was Israel's duty to fight against Hamas without enlarging the conflict he's due to visit the Palestinian president Mahmud abas in the occupied West Bank later today if I'm here with my my delegation it's indeed first to express our support and solidarity and share your pain what happened 7th of October is an hour full terrorist attack against your people your nation it's right and it was an immense shock for the whole planet especially in France I'm here to express our solidarity today and tomorrow and that was Emanuel maon speaking earlier alongside Israel's president Isaac Herzog Mr maon is currently meeting Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu uh and this is part of a two visit to the region what can he achieve in this time we live now to fris Joseph shishan A former French diplomat and consultant at the Strategic advisory firm Flint Global thank you very much for uh for joining us today of course we've we've just been hearing from one of the elderly Israeli hostages who uh they were both released overnight and we've been hearing about uh this particular hostages yov liit how should was taken into the Gaza Strip and how she was treated there Emanuel maon says releasing all of the hostages has to be a top priority for Israel today yes I mean this is one of the key objectives of em macon's visit to the region alongside showing unequivocal and ambiguous support to to Israel and the right to Israel to defend itself um and also at the same time avoiding or trying to Avid working towards avoiding escalation of the conflict for in the waterer region um while protecting the human humanitarian situation in in in in in Palestine in Gaza in particular so it's a very delicate balancing exercise that the president has to do while um visiting the region um and I think there are 24 French people that have been killed in the attack two weeks ago um and also um around I mean seven people perhaps who have been taken hostage while French national French Israeli dual Nationals um so so this is going to be an important focus of the present visit indeed and also dual Nationals amongst the uh civilian population inside Gaza we've seen um many Gaza civilians holding foreign passports uh in the in the air um and obviously appealing to uh their governments to to try and help them amongst those fronts but as you say Emanuel M has a very delicate Balancing Act here he wants to stop the conflict spreading in the wide region but Express strong solidarity for Israel but also explain concern about Palestinian civilians and what we've been hearing is anger amongst Palestinians and in The Wider Middle East at countries Western countries like France accusing them of hypocrisy of not caring enough about Palestinian uh civilians in this case uh emphasizing Israel's right to defend itself whereas they say and this was said again at the Europeans at a at a peace Summit in Cairo they're accusing the west of hypocrisy um in its attitude with uh towards ukrainians when Russia invaded there I think the president has been very clear about the humanitarian situation and the need to uh to protect civilians within the Gaza Strip that has been a constant message of the French government of the French President um so um you know there was a time at the start of the crisis where you know strong support and unequivocal support for Israel was was necessary given the scale of the attack and the shock that it represented in uh in many if not all Western and European countries in particular um and I think the purpose of the trip uh of the president to the region is really to deliver that message message extremely strongly while um uh make taking steps and and you know also conveying the message that respecting humanitarian law international human humanitarian is also an very important if not um decisive element of the crisis um to to work towards um a resolution at some point I think this is also what the the Pres trip is about to start um a discussion not just with Israeli by the way because the president as we say is going to meet mmud Abbas as well and he's going to talk to Arab leaders as well in the next couple of days um so this is going to be a long conflict and I think the president is sort of positioning France as a key intell in the region to prepare the ground for the resolution of the conf conflict but this is going to take time and this is going to also require coordination among Western countries and the EU as as we speak is is also trying to coordinate a coherent position um for the conflict going forward but it it is although it's not doing very well I mean there's disagreement amongst the EU 27 countries about their exact uh position here we did see France um release a statement alongside the United States Canada Italy Germany and the UK so there are attempts at working together in diplomatic terms but this also hits home for France directly doesn't it I mean France is home to the biggest Jewish community in Europe and the biggest Muslim Community in Europe and France is is worried about the conflict coming home yes indeed absolutely and that also explains partly why the president is of waiting have waited has waited a few days before uh going into into Israel there was there was some issues internally domestically that need needed to be addressed and we've seen the terror attacks in north of France shortly after um the attack in Israel that that really shocked the country um and um and the president was very much focused on on that for for a few days um and we continue to be focused on that you know to protect the the security because there is a clear sense that the the um the crisis in the Middle East is having a political impact in Western countries that has always been the case but you're right specifically in France there is a a specific situation here which means that this particular conflict has huge ramifications for for France both socially and politically and we have seen also um the crisis within the leftwing Coalition um in France because of the positioning of some some political leaders so the the conflict is starting to also you know affect the political landscape as a whole and and the balancing exercise that I was talking about for Israel also applies to France and the president um is is also aiming at at you know preserving stability and Security in France
