growing diplomatic pressure to get essential supplies into Gaza which has been sealed off after Hamas which is designated as a terror organization by many Western governments launched attacks into Israel here are some of the latest developments the United Nations says more than 338,000 people have now been forced to flee their homes in Gaza and food Fuel and water are urgently needed ahead of a possible incursion into Gaza the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has established a National Emergency Unity government with opposition leader Benny Gans Israel has continued its mobilization of troops hundreds of thousands are on the southern border with Gaza President Biden said says he's told Mr Netanyahu that Israel must abide by the rules of war in its fight against Hamas as we mentioned the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is due to arrive in Israel in the next hour or so all this as Israeli air strikes on Gaza continue the Palestinian Health Ministry said at least 51

air strikes since Saturday a similar number of people in Israel are now thought to have been killed in the multiple assaults by Hamas at the weekend in the last hour a military spokesman said at least 220 soldiers are amongst them well our correspondent Nick beak reports now from Tel Aviv Israel says hundreds of thousands of its troops are gathering outside Gaza and warns they'll soon be moving into the Hamas controlled territory as part of its response to the atrocities committed on Israeli soil alongside this show of military force a war cabinet has been formed citizens of Israel this evening we have established a National Emergency government the people of Israel are united and today its government is united we are fighting a cruel enemy world than Isis in Washington President Biden pledged unwavering support for Israel Americans were among the up to 150 hostages feared to have been taken into Gaza and among those killed in hamas's assault this attack uh was uh a campaign of pure cruelty not not just hate but cruelty against the Jewish people and I would argue it's the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust the deadliest St is Holocaust this is what Gaza looked like in the early hours of this morning plunged Into Darkness after its only Power Station shut down Israel has cut off electricity supplies to these densely populated Palestinian communities many are now in Ruins after being bombarded by Israeli air strikes over the past 5 days the UN says essential supplies of food Fuel and water must be allowed to reach civilians we left our homes thinking that we would return in an hour we left our belongings money food and everything we owned now there are 50 people in the house without food drink water or electricity I do not know how we'll provide food for our children I'm searching here under the rubble for the remains of lentils and rice even a little for my children Israel says hamas's attacks justify this response that this is an act of self-defense but Israel is accused of breaking international law killing hundreds of civilians in an act of Revenge this is the latest footage released by the Israeli military showing their bombardment of Gaza they say it will continue until Hamas is wiped off the face of the Earth as the calls become even more urgent for Aid to be allowed in and for civilians to be given away out Nick beak BBC News Tel Aviv well we heard from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Nick's report joining his War cabinet is the main opposition leader and Mr netanyahu's longtime rival Benny Gant after they agreed to form an emergency Unity government to manage the war with Hamas at a news conference Mr Gans who's a former Army Commander said the move sent a strong message our standing here together shoulder to shoulder is a message to our enemies and most importantly a message to all citizens of Israel we are all together we are all soldiers there is a time for war and a Time For Peace now is a time for war well overnight Israel 's exchange of Rocket fire with Hamas continued these pickets these pictures show Rockets being fired into Israel from Gaza and this footage shows Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system intercepting those Rockets with Explosions in the Sky well BBC verifies is continuing to monitor the impact of Israeli air strikes in Gaza several videos released by the Israeli Defense Force have shown their attacks one was on the Islamic University of Gaza targeted between the 10th and 11th of October this is a satellite image of what the university looked like before the strike BBC verify matched the building's distinctive shapes to know that this image was taken after the strike Israel says Hamas was using the university as a training camp for weapons development and Military Intelligence well that's a claim we haven't been able to independently confirm these images show the AL Ral area before the strikes and this is a satellite image of the same neighborhood in Gaza which came through yesterday and has been located by our colleagues a BBC verify well with me now is s shat from BBC Arabic s just over two million people living inside uh Gaza very small area what have what's the latest of that we've been hearing overnight uh the latest is more bombardment from uh Israel air strikes and demolish building uh destruction people will killed I look at several videos it's horrific videos of children dying the ambulances carrying some of them under the Restriction because the ceiling of like not allowing food or electricity so there's a problem in fuel to even to make this Hospital working at full capacity so you use only the hospital for helping people saving life all not like death uh like threat but like nothing more than that and this like put pressure there is more than 100 1,200 people died according to the uh Ministry of Health in Gaza and there is about 5,000 injured so far there is more than 300,000 according to the UN at this place or forced to leave their houses but the problem where do you go even Israel like warn them like leave their your houses because we're hitting it under the claim they are used by Hamas Fighters but where do you go these people well where do you go that's the question isn't it I mean I know there are some negotiations ongoing there is pressure mounting on Israel to allow some civilians to leave Gaza what are some of the challenges with that idea the problem is uh there was a an old idea that to put the people of Gaza in Sinai and it was like a proposal but was refused by Egypt and the president of Egypt refused that but allowing like humanitarian uh for humanitary reason to come that's no problem and Egypt sent a convoy big Convoy but Israel refusing to allow it end so Egypt can do that through Rafa Crossing uh United States and I think with blinkin visit and with other pressure from uh C turkey Saudi Arabia Iran it might uh help to ease attention and put pressure on Israel to allow that because with the images of people children dying and with demonstration in many places so I think Israel will lose I think the battle in media if they don't allow this humanitarian to go humanitarian Corridor to do to go there you've mentioned all these Regional players now we know that Saudi Iran uh Saudi Arabia and Iran have been speaking quite unusual really they've only just started to reestablish diplomatic ties can you tell us what they've been talking about and and in particular where Saudi Arabia is standing in all of this it was the first time uh a contact between the Iranian president Ibrahim RI and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Muhammed bin Salman since uh the uh agreement of resuming the relationship in March uh through mediation by China and according to the Iranian State media they saying that uh the Ibrahim RI talk with Muhammad B Salman the need to stop the what he described war crimes against Palestine but on the other hand this the Saudi media uh agency like the state media saying Ben Salman didn't mention about war crimes but he what he said is there is need to allow humanitarian AIDS there is need to stop like uh the atrocities happening there and and there is no and even he was rejecting killing civilians and implicitly it means civilian from both sides so he didn't take one side because killing civilians is is not is not is not allowed and the same time you know like Iran has is known to support Hamas and uh and hisbah so I think the rule of Saudi Arabia to convince Iran not to do that so it will contain uh the uh conflict not to be uh uh outside this uh thing and to escalate it side thank you very much for taking us through that side sh shahata from BBC arbec thank you
