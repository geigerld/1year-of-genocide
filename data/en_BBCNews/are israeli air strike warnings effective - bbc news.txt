[Music] know in the canonist refugee camp the bodies kept coming today this was the funeral of the Hajj family they were asleep in their beds when the Israeli air strike hit flattening their home they didn't Warners says their neighbor it was the first time they've hit a house without any warning the fact that um an individual is associated with a Palestinian military group does not make the apartment of that person into a military Target nor does it make the entire building with all the other apartments in there into a military Target Hamas is killing its own civilians when you put a family as a human shield defending missile launchers when you hide missiles and weapons within hospitals you are responsible for killing your own civilians
