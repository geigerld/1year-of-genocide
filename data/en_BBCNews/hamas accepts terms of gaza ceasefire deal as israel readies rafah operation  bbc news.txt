let's start with that breaking news this hour very important breaking news because an official Hamas Source has told the BBC that it does accept a proposal for a ceasefire deal in Gaza now Israel has yet to comment on that we'll bring you more details on it as soon as we get them meanwhile Palestinian civilians have started leaving parts of Eastern Rafa in Gaza after Israel told a 100,000 people there to leave the area officials in Gaza say Israeli air strikes have targeted parts of Rafa just hours after that evacuation order was issued pictures we've received show Thick Smoke Rising as displaced Palestinians try to flee Eastern Rafa now those Palestinian civilians closest to the Israeli border are being urged to move to what the Israeli military the IDF calls expanded humanitarian zones in the almasi and cunis area is let's just go back to those live pictures of people in Gaza in the center of Gaza actually getting that news that there looks like Hamas well Hamas have confirmed that they have accepted the ceasefire proposals as we say no confirmation yet of that from Israel so let's go straight to our security correspondent Frank Gardner who's in Jerusalem for us um well Frank Hamas uh saying that they have accepted these ceasefire proposals we don't know what Israel thinks about this yet but what would that mean potentially two crucial things here Ben one are those proposals the same ones that Israel essentially agreed to the ones that were on the table during the weekend at the Ciro talks which were a 40-day pause in the fighting a return of Palestinians to Northern Gaza to their homes and an exchange of roughly 33 is ready hostages out of captivity in Gaza in return for an undisclosed number of Palestinians out of Israeli jails those were broadly the terms that we think were on the table do we know if this deal that has been accepted by Hamas is the same one is it the same terms we don't know yet second thing is is Israel going to sign up on this is it going to sign up to it because if the terms are different then it's quite possibly going to get rejected by the Israeli side and those wonderful celebrations you saw there in Rafa and Gaza Strip could be premature of course the Israeli Prime Minister benjin Netanyahu is under huge pressure isn't he to get the remaining hostages out and many people would say that a ceasefire deal is the best way to get those hostages out well that's exactly right I mean the only time we've seen large numbers of hostages released out of Gaza have been with a negotiated deal by Qatar and Egypt with the support of the United States and that appears to be what's going on now because the message and we're basing all of this on a genuine one single but genuine posting on uh on social media by Hamas saying that their political leader is hania has telephoned the Kat prime minister Sheikh abdan Muhammad abdan Alani uh and abas camel the head of Egyptian intelligence to say that Hamas accepts the Ceasar proposal so we don't yet know what the Israeli reaction is the Israeli media has been pretty cautious about it saying that if it's if the terms are different then it's not going to be acceptable to the Israeli cabinet and let's just remind ourselves what the sticking point was at the weekend why those peace talks those ceasefire talks collapsed or stalled and that is that Hamas insisted on an undertaking by Israel that this would be a full and final ceasefire in other words it would be an end to the fighting and Israel would withdraw Israel said we're not going to commit to that because it would leave hamas's battalions intact and allow them to regroup and attack us again what mediators have been saying both during the weekend and subsequently to Hamas is look take the 40-day deal you know if you don't take that nothing's going to happen the idea is to build on the 40-day deal to make another 40-day Troop and another one beyond that and eventually it becomes um a permanent ceasefire but if you don't make a start then nothing is going to happen and just give us an idea of who exactly is mediating in these various ceasefire negotiations that we've been having it's very much Egyptian Le I mean the cutteries are involved cutter is of course the home in doar its capital to the political leadership of Hamas something that is pretty controversial because it's a weird situation you've got Qatar that is home to the largest US military base in the Middle East at alade it's also home to what is a the political wing of a prescribed terrorist organization prescribed by the US and many other countries um but it's the Egyptians that have been driving this one and it's Egyptian intelligence remember that Egypt borders Gaza they've got a vested interest in seeing calm restored um the last thing they want is to see the violence spill over their borders um into the northern Sinai which has already suffered a lot of violence from um Isis that's been attacking Egyptian Army positions uh they there's no love lost between the Egyptian government which is very secular and Hamas which is a religious movement a political religious movement but the Egyptians have been driving this they want very much to see this deal succeed Ed and that's why hamas's message mentioned abas camel the head of Egyptian intelligence who is been who has been instrumental in trying to get this deal over the line and Frank just looking at the timing of this I mean this this uh acceptance by Hamas of the ceasefire deal it comes on the same day that we've had heightened reports that there could be an imminent Israeli military offensive ground assault on Rafa we've had those evacuation orders dropped by flyers on Palestinian civilians telling them to get out of Eastern Rafa ahead of of uh what could be an imminent Israeli assault do you think that could be connected to what Hamas now have agree to well certainly I think hardliners um and others in the military here in in the Israeli establishment will be saying you see military Pressure Works the threat of military action has made them capitulate I'm not sure that's how Hamas would see it um because after all yesterday they fired a load of rockets at the Kim Shalom Crossing Point killing four Israeli soldiers Israel has been conducting air strikes in Rafa certainly the prospect of a major military operation in Rafa has appalled International Aid agencies and the US for that matter so President Biden only a couple of hours ago held a 30-minute phone call with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu the readout of that that was released to the media was unbelievably short and uninformative uh most of it was about Holocaust Remembrance Day one line in it referring to Rafa saying the president made clear his views on Rafa well we know what those views are and it frankly don't do it the US does not believe that Israel can undertake a military operation in a place with 1.4 million people 2third of whom are already displaced from northern Gaza without severe harm to those civilians uh Frank you were saying at the start that of course we have to wait and hear and wait and see what Israel's reaction to this is and we have just received a report while you've been talking to us from the Reuters news agency um quoting an Israeli official unnamed Israeli official saying that Hamas have approved uh a quote softened Egyptian proposal that is not repeat not acceptable to Israel so the initial and that is a that's just on the Reuters news agency but they're quoting an Israeli official saying that this deal that Hamas have agreed to is not acceptable to Israel because it's it's based on a softened Egyptian proposal yeah I I that doesn't surprise me and that's very depressing because um you know I kind of feared as much because certainly when the talks collapsed at the weekend there was still considerable dist between the Hamas position and the Israeli position the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has been absolutely adamant that Israel will not commit now or at any time to an end to hostilities why because they think that this is unfinished business and there are four battalions of Hamas still alive and intact and they want to finish them off at the same time they want the hostages out now those two aims I think are incompatible with each other the best way to get hostage is out of captivity in Gaza is through a deal um but there are people in the security cabinet and the war cabinet here in Israel um well certainly there are hardliners in this country and in the government who don't want to see a deal instead they want to see a hard military push into Rafa that in some way finishes off Hamas I'm not sure that that is achievable and it's certainly not going to get a lot of hostages out alive yeah and and just one additional line from Reuters Frank that I will just put to you but it just amplifies that earlier report I was uh reading out from the Reuters news agency that Israeli official who's already said that these proposals are not acceptable to Israel says the proposal includes quote far reaching conclusions that Israel does not agree to that so that does look like initially at least confirmation that Israel isn't going to go along with these uh proposals even if Hamas is yeah I mean it's almost certainly concerning the end State because Hamas is saying look you know it's unrealistic to give up their key bargaining chip the hostages um only to find themselves attacked the very next day now I mean you know Hamas is a prescribed terrorist organization they've committed absolute atrocities in southern uh Israel on October the 7th but they've been quite canny militarily and um they are in quite a strong bargaining position because they still hold somewhere upwards of 90 hostages who are thought to be alive the pressure on prime minister Netanyahu here is mounting to get those hostages out every night I drive past protesters um who are waving banners saying bring them home do more make it a priority the protesters and they numbered tens of thousands a couple of nights ago in t they don't believe that the Israeli government is doing enough to get them out they don't think it's a priority for for this government they think this government's priority is to get tough on Hamas and fight it and beat it and crush it into the ground and that the hostages are a second PRI secondary priority Frank very good to have you with us for that instant analysis that's Frank Gardner our security correspondent live with the very latest from Jerusalem on that uh Hass acceptance of ceasefire proposals but as we've just been hearing according to the Reuters news agency um Israel does not accept those proposals and isn't likely to and Frank Gardner there just giving us his analysis well
