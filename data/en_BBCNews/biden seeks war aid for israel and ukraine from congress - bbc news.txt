US President Joe Biden has delivered a televised speech following his visit to Israel earlier this week he used the address to draw a link between the conflict in Ukraine and Israel and urged Congress to do more to deliver Aid to both Nations let's have a listen to what President Biden has been saying you know history has taught us that when terrorists don't pay a price for their Terror when dictators don't pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos and death and more destruction they keep going and the cost and the threats to America and the world keep Rising if we walk away from Ukraine if we turn our backs on Israel it's just not worth it that's why tomorrow I'm going to send to Congress an urgent budget request to fund America's national security needs to support our critical Partners including Israel and Ukraine let's talk to our chief International correspondent Le duat now who is in Israel fors in southern Israel wel welcome to you Le what's your assessment of Joe Biden's televised address we saw him there in Israel just a couple of days ago now appealing to Congress for More Money More aid for the country well in a very divided America in a very divided Congress uh opinions are very divided there are some who don't like uh the way that he is linking Ukraine and Israel there are some on both sides of the house who don't want some much Aid going to Israel there there before this crisis erupted there was criticism among leading Republicans that too much Aid was going to Ukraine but Joe Biden has tried to take the moral High Ground you'll remember that when he first came to office he wanted to divide the world into Democrats and autocrats Democratic societies and authoritarian societies and now he is building on this message comparing Hamas to Vladimir Putin and saying that the United States had a responsibility um as a democratic country as a as a world leader that he personally also believes that America has to take the lead he did make an effort to say that of course that the United States of America was standing right behind Israel he also spoke about the suffering of the Palestinians and how Aid needed to get into Gaza and his concern that this could spread across the region so he tried to address many audiences not all of them will be happy but this is how we beli in this rather historic live broadcast from from the from the White House from the Oval Office the setting was was important the timing was important the consequences will be important yeah Le he also urged Israel leaders to learn from us mistakes after the biggest terror attack on their country 911 and not to rush into something that could have unintended consequences as you stand there today on the southern Israel border waiting to see what happens whether or not there will be a ground offensive which is is expected isn't it by Israeli troops into Gaza what's your assessment what's coming out of the Israeli military and the Israeli government about that well I think for for today the what everyone is waiting to see happen today because it is also dependent on decisions of the Israeli military and the Israeli politicians is will that Rafa Crossing at the border with Egypt the only way in and out of Gaza where more than 100 lores packed with food and uh food and water in medicine have been waiting and waiting for days to get in we hear that Egyptians are gathering on that side of the Border waiting there protesting until that desperately needed Aid gets in not only the eyes of the world on that Crossing even the world's top Diplomat Antonio goeres the Secretary General is heading down to the Rafa Crossing to be seen to be emphasizing just how crucial it is that a gets into Gaza not just those 20 trucks that President Joe Biden said he had secured an agreement for it seemed to be a kind of a test case to ensure it could be done safely to ensure it didn't get diverted to Hamas but we are still waiting the gazans are still waiting all of the aid agencies are still waiting to see whether that Crossing opens today and right now the crossing itself is open but it's not open to the aid trucks there'll be a lot of of waiting to see whether this this firstep takes place absolutely and we'll of course be updating our viewers should there be any developments at that ruffer Crossing least for now thank you
