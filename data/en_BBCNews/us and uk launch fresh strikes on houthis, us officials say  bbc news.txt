you're watching BBC News if you are just joining us I can tell you that uh us and UK air strikes have resumed uh in Yemen this evening there have been strikes in S at the capital of Yemen and we are told that us Jets from the carrier Eisenhower have been involved in those strikes uh our panel Ron Christi and Tim Allen uh are still with us um I want to talk Ron about the the the US military because two US Navy Seals who went missing during an operation to see some of these Iranian made weapons uh that were Bound for the houthis uh we're told are dead uh this was the statement we got from us Central Command um after 10day exhaustive search they say our two missing US Navy Seals have not been located and their status has been changed to deceased that incident wrong took place uh a few days ago when elite soldiers were boarding a ship off the coast of Somalia but we've also been told that there were strikes uh on the al-assad airbase in Iraq in which two uh military personnel have been very seriously injured and suddenly we've got American Personnel dying and being wounded over 140 strikes on us uh bases and and installations since October the 7th so slowly but surely as Lee says this this is starting to spread and the Americans are being dragged into it I think that's absolutely R and I think Le's analysis here Not only was it eloquent but I think it really points to something from a domestic standpoint here in the United unit states where you have bipartisan consensus you have Republicans uh in the Congress who are saying why are we sending American men and women to needlessly die overseas particularly in the disastrous way that we pulled out of Afghanistan and then you have more moderate SL Progressive members like Rana from California uh my beloved home state and District in California who a Democrat who has said why are we not invoking the War Powers Resolution why is the President coming to Congress because under our constitution you have to declare war not through the president but through the Congress and why is the president taking these because he doesn't he doesn't want to declare award does he's in an election year and he certainly doesn't want to be suggesting that he's sending more troops overseas having brought troops back from Afghanistan not in an election year and that's the sticky situation the president finds himself in he's wedged in by the Democrats he's wedged in by conservative Republicans and he has to work with his British and other coalition Partners to clearly articulate as Le said the need to open the Red Sea the need for shipping to get through the Suz Canal because otherwise the costs are going up the supply disruptions continue to grow and there's growing sense here in the United States that the president's not up to the task the way he's conducting this operation yeah you you'll have heard um Lee say that it's it's not going to work there was some frustration irritation I think on the part of the White House Tim that Grant chaps the you UK defense secretary was sort of almost triumphant in the way that this was going to work that this would sort of deal with the issue and quite clearly it wasn't going to deal with the issue and of course the Americans are deeply involved in the peace plan in Yemen which could unravel if this expands yes but I think it's been interesting how David Cameron has actually been uh in in Washington um sort of making the case often uh on behalf of the American government sometimes whether it be about uh Ukraine which is has has been an issue that where there's been political splits in the US and concerns about whether there will be uh enough commitment going forward for that and it's been Cameron that has been out there making the case on on American Media and equally on on this issue where UK government ministers are getting involved in on us media often to be backing up the American government uh when it is facing internal uh problems and internal debate and I think that's going to I think Cameron himself now as back as the foreign secretary is going to be increasingly important having been a former prime minister he's able to have the Diplomatic heft to go to a lot of uh capitals and to get to meet people that maybe other foreign secretaries wouldn't uh have got to meet and is becoming increasingly influential on on putting the case whether it is on Ukraine or this it is actually interesting that it's America it's UK ministers in America making the case just let me pick that up we've only got a minute left Le to the end of the program but just on that issue do do you think the UK is influential in this argum well they want to be seen to be backing the United States both of them their own populations stand to Lo are losing in this Red Sea confrontation but it is the United States which calls the shots and the houthis know that m
