the United Nations top court has decided that Israel must immediately halt its military offensive in Rafa in southern Gaza the international court of justice which rules on disputes between countries says the catastrophic situation in Gaza had deteriorated and described humanitarian conditions in Rafa as disastrous Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has again rejected allegations of genocide calling them false and outrageous Lucy Williamson has the latest from Jerusalem Israel's soldiers have been ordered to push into Rafa Israel's leaders have been ordered to stop footage from both sides shows the fighting as Israeli troops Edge closer to the city center but the un's highest court today focused on civilians those still there and the 800,000 who are fled Israel must immediately hold its military offens and any other action in the Rafa Governor which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part Israel says this is a precise and limited operation but satellite pictures of Rafa show the destruction less than 2 weeks after the assault today Israel's Army said it had recovered the bodies of three hostages from northern Gaza Michelle nissam orian Hernandez and Kanan Blanca one member of the war cabinet said Israel had to keep fighting to return its hostages and Safeguard its citizens and would continue to act according to international law foreign criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza is growing but prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu or BB as he's known is comfortable being seen as the staunch defender of Israel's security Under Siege I don't like being to say the least I don't think he's a more criminal it's very easy to sit miles away and criticize what's happening do you have a better alternative I don't really care about what people thinking about us you can see that if we do care about what people think us so we should stop the war no we are here we are Israel therefore it's really uh important us to have a support and we don't get it MRI Sheltering in a tent on the coast north of Rafa had little faith in the Court's power to change her situation implement this on the ground they shouldn't say one thing and do something different today they say they want to stop the war but the massacres are only increasing the Rafer offensive has blocked key Aid routes through southern Gaza supplies brought in Via a new US Pier quickly looted the court today ordered Israel to reopen the Rafa Crossing new battle lines in this war driven by promises on both sides to protect civilians Lucy Williamson BBC News Jerusalem Dominic casani is here with me um the jurisdiction of the Court can they enforce this not really Clive no it's not as if there's a world police force out there to to go and execute a warrant look South Africa asked for a lot more than it actually got here so while this is is chalking this up as a victory if you actually look at the wording it only applies to um Rafa nowhere else in Gaza and there's actually room in here for Israel to actually effectively appease the courts because the court says hold the military offensive there if it may may bring about the physical destruction of the Palestinians so in essence it's saying if you've got other military options go for those on the enforceability the Practical route for South Africa if nothing happens is to go to the UN and try and get a security Council vote but then of course that becomes political the US has a a block there so in reality this is where law and diplomacy rubs up and the court has tried to P pull off a balancing act it stopped shorts Yes again I'm talking about this being genocide it's trying to find the language to underline the alarm and reflect what it's seeing on the ground but it's not tone death to diplomacy so it's really bassing this towards Israel and critically also the US and country is saying enforce this find a solution sure okay Dominic thank you Dominic cashian our legal Affairs correspondent there
