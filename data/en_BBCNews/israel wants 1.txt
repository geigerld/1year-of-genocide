well we start with breaking developments on the Israel Gaza war in the last hour or so the United Nations has said that it it has been told by the Israeli military that more than a million Palestinians must leave the northern Gaza Strip within the next 2 24 hours in a statement the UN spokesman Stefan duar said that the United Nations considers it impossible for such a movement to take place without devastating humanitarian in consequences the United Nations strongly appeals for any such order if confirmed to be rescinded avoiding what could transform what's already a tragedy into a into a calamitous situation well this is the scene live in Gaza where it has just turned 7:00 in the morning the United Nations said that the order by the Israeli military also applies to all of its staff and those sheltered in in un facilities including schools Health Centers and Clinics there and a Hamas official quoted by the Reuters news agency said that the relocation warning from Israel was fake propaganda let's give you a sense of the geography in Gaza this is a map of Israel where you can see Gaza and the West Bank marked what the Israeli military is saying is that everyone living in Northern Gaza should really locate to the southern end in the next 24 hours that's more than a million people around half of the population of the entire Gaza Strip well let's uh speak now to uh my colleague from BBC Arabic s shahata um what do you make side of what we've heard in the last hour from the United Nations from Israel via the United Nations it sounds as if things could be escalating uh in the next 24 hours or so it looks like that because if you look at the density of the population in Gaza 2 million on living on 88 square miles uh so it's about 21,000 be uh square miles so to move half of them to another part this will be a crisis is going to have like as the United Nation mention uh humanitarian consequence for that I think Israel doing that in order to make it easier for the ground assault so it makes because there is many times hundreds of thousand of reservist of Israeli troops came to join from different plac in the world and so Israel pushing for that and all uh you know some military inside Israel supporting that saying we cannot destroy Hamas without the ground assault so I think Israel trying to put pressure on the people on Gaza to move in order to avoid any casual qualities uh because there is many people dying it's more than 1,500 people and more than like 5,000 injured uh beside that the blockade like no food no electricity so all of that human think it's making the picture is gloomy and it will put pressure on other countries especially on blank uh on America and blankin in his visit to Jordan to do something in order to diffuse that because I think it will make re might make reaction from parties which Israel try and America to not to be involved in this conflict like hisbah or Iran so a pretty tense 24 hours obviously um ahead um do stay with us though for the moment s because I want to cross over to to Gaza now and speak to uh Nala shawa who's the regional country relations manager uh for oxfarm in Gaza she's currently one of the 1.1 million residents of Gaza who've been told to leave uh but by Israel uh thank you very much for making the time to talk to us M shawa um can I get your reaction on the ground to this uh call uh from Israel for people to evacuate uh Northern Gaza how how feasible is it even to do it within the deadline that's been set uh hi uh first of all we're there's so much um chaos in in in Gaza uh we managed to leave that uh at like 4:30 a.m. um we are about um um 15 people here we moved to another location South and um we we think I mean basically now asking this question uh is clearly puts um puts the the reminder that Israel can do whatever whatever it wants and uh nobody can stop it obviously so the arrogance of of Israel is has been like that for for decades so obviously now it's happening again and it's um simply on the news and everyone is watching while this another catastrophe is actually taking place right now I know everyone is in a total panic and everyone is is leaving it's talk about kids elderly everyone the roads are being bombed while we were traveling now there is bombing I'm smelling smoke what is this madness we of course Gaza and Gaza City to the South what what what is it what is the plan and and are we going to come back to any of our homes when we were leaving we were like just looking at things as if we're not going to see them again we have of course n seen n we have seen of course the the the devastating pictur is coming out uh of Gaza we know that hospitals are running out of crucial supplies uh electricity has been cussed to uh to many parts of of the area and if this uh evacuation uh order is to be is to be followed H how feasible is it how possible is it of course it's not feasible and of course you'll have hundreds if not more of casualties and you'll have destruction and then what Bravo Israel yeah that's great what what is it that it's fighting here what do you think the timing of this order um says about the Israeli military's uh approach to protecting civilians yeah moving I don't know one million people um to uh to travel to the to the South during 1 million you know you you understand you understand the figure you're not talking about neighborhood so Israel started with a house with a building and with the neighborhood just three days ago and yesterday and the the days before now it's like an entire region of of the god STP like like maybe third or more of the godess strip area of course it's not feasable but Israel can do whatever they want nobody's stopping them no matter how how I scream on the TV or how angry people are around the world it's not going to make any difference right because we are living by these double standards decade after decade double standard we are not seen as humans enough we're not human enough that's it that's a fact of life as we're listening to you Nala we're we're seeing pictures coming in of uh uh fresh rocket fire uh what appears to be fresh rocket fire uh over Gaza um the situation there obviously incredibly unimaginably uh difficult for you and uh and others who are living there what's your message to uh the world leaders Anthony blinkin the uh us uh secretary of state who's in the in the region right now uh trying to to find some kind of a a diplomatic solution what's your message uh to him and others to stop this madness and what I just mentioned stop living and practicing and imposing these double standards because we are also people reminder we have been under occupation for 70 plus years we are people and we are here we have been here we are suffering before October 7th Palestinians in Gaza and in the West Bank Israel before before October 7th was living a normal life not worrying about anything before October 7th it was not the same case for Palestinians you should be aware of that and they are aware that's why I'm not sure I even want to say that passage to them do they really bother what are you going to do now Nala you're involved obviously in the uh humanitarian situation there uh we've had this uh fresh warning coming from the Israeli military just in the last hour or so uh how is it going to change your response today is it going to change uh your the work you're going to be doing today the work that uh we are supposed to be doing is simply not feasible and not possible with the extent of Destruction with that that there is no uh no uh ceasefire there is no uh humanitarian Corridor there is nothing nothing is is is even discussed or or or suggested we just hear it in in in the media in discussions that that doesn't allow for any kind of response so people are simply suffering and will continue to suffer in displacement in the areas they are in in the schools or in the streets now it's going to be everywhere not only in whatever designated schools it's going to be everywhere and yes we are hearing about no water no enough food uh all all all these things now I bringing with me now to this place some uh some water and some food maybe for a couple of days God knows until when are we going to be here here for okay and I am in a much better position than many others so no talking about response nobody is able to do anything Nyla shaer um we thank you for joining us we thank you for giving us uh your time and wish you all the best for uh what's ahead of you uh in the days ahead thank you for joining us today on BBC news thank
