well in Israel the war cabinet has been meeting to consider its response a spokesman for the Iranian government insisted that Teran had shown restraint and that the strikes were a limited Act of self-defense our Middle East correspondent Lucy Williamson has the latest Israel is deciding how to respond to this hundreds of drones and missiles fired over the weekend from Iran damage on the ground was limited damage to Regional stability much more severe at an air base hit by missiles in the neav desert today Israel's Chief of Staff promised a response Iran will face the consequences for its actions we will choose our response accordingly the IDF remains ready to counter any threat from Iran and its Terror proxies Israel says only a half handful of missiles made it through air defenses but this direct confrontation with Iran the First on Israeli soil has thrown the Middle East off balance what's shaken Israel in these attacks isn't the damage caused but how they happened with drones and missiles sent straight from Iran and what these strikes left broken isn't so much infrastructure it's Iran's fear of launching a direct attack Iran's attack came with careful signaling its government warned Israel's allies of the strikes and said they were punishment for an assassination in Syria and that Iran now considered the matter closed our advice to all the supporters of the Zionist regime is to appreciate Iran's responsible and measured action and dissuade the Zionist regime from committing more wicked acts which would bring incalculable consequences but Israel has said it will exact a price from Iran its prime minister under pressure from allies to deescalate the situation has been discussing with his War cabinet exactly what that price should Beal one former Diplomat with experience of Iran says military action is only one option our military options are far more varied than the Iranians um and frankly the Iranian uh barrage was a a demonstration of weakness not of strength there's clearly uh a strong need for Israel to uh however it decides to respond and the respond can response can come in many different ways not just military Israel is already fighting iranian-backed groups in Gaza to the South and Lebanon to the north a far less powerful opponent delivered a major blow on the 7th of October Israel's challenge now is how to restore a fear of conflict in its biggest enemy without triggering a war Lucy Williamson BBC News Jerusalem our International editor Jeremy Bowen is here so as we heard Jeremy Israel continuing to insist it will retaliate even while the US is saying Iran has embarrassed itself well I think they're trying to get the message over to the Israelis that look yes your right to be concerned you have been attacked but this is under control look Iran's embarrassed itself it's not that simple though for the Israelis uh I think they feel the need very strongly to send a signal a really determined signal that they uh are not deterred in any sense by Iran there's something very deep in Israel's DNA that it has to push back it's not a question of turning the other cheek it's an eye for an eye at least uh that is something which is really part of their ethos but the gamble is always how is the other side going to respond because as you've heard the Iranians are also saying hang on this was self-defense we were just doing it to make a point also to restore to Terence and I think what they were also trying to do was uh to avoid making causing a large numbers of Civilian casualties which would have escalated matters so Israel is having those same similar kinds of discussions about the way that they need to go the Iranian Army Chief has said today in the last few hours he said something like our attack on Israel was limited if Israel retaliates there will be a far greater response you know from netanyahu's point of view for many years he has seen Iran as Israel's number one enemy bana I remember him saying to me in the BBC office in Jerusalem about about 2006 when armad was President he said look armad had is Hitler and it's 1938 you know it wasn't an exclusive he was saying it a lot at the time to people but that's very much his view now don't forget there's also the war in Gaza going on that's something which is still urgent it's still there's still the famine there is still military action going on there in the middle part of the Gaza Strip but as far as Israel's uh Western allies are concerned it is less of a priority these last few days than Iran Iran seems a lot more urgent doesn't mean to say that they've forgotten about what's going on there but instead of talking about differences potential war crimes famines they're talking about Unity coalitions facing Iran together
