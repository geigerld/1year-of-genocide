yes they have agreed on some points and delayed other points for discussion in one month time what the Palestinians and the Israelis have agreed upon via the Egyptian mediations is that the border crossings between Gaza and Israel will be open to allow aid supplies in also construction material will be allowed into the strip to help in the Reconstruction process white scale damage have be has befallen Gaza during the war so finally construction material will be allowed into the strip also the fishing area for the Palestinian fishermen will be expanded that's the points both sides agreed upon however we have more controversial issues like releasing Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails h building a Seaport and an airport for the Palestinians in Gaza Strip that what they have repeatedly demanded both sides will hold further discussions about that in one month time so it's finally a long-term ceasefire agreed on between both sides after a really tough process of negotiations here in Cairo and what we understand is that the Egyptian mediators kept contacting both sides even after the Palestinian and Israeli delegations left Cairo a couple of days ago all right Sally for now in Cairo thank you very much indeed uh let's just go uh via uh this live shot we have of Gaza the sky is now uh clear uh no Rockets 5 certainly today although Israel reporting that an Israel has been killed and several injured near ashol let's go live though to Quentin Somerville who joins us uh from Gaza Quentin how are they reacting to the news there lots of gunfire in the air at the moment uh Tim and right up until the wire right up until we came on air there were in fact Rockets leaving Gaza and flying over uh into Israel within the last hour we believe that three Palestinians were killed in a bombing in the Rafa Crossing in the South uh of Gaza and one Israeli was killed uh just across the border as a result of rocket and mortar fire uh but the expectation is here that this ceasefire deal is uh has been agreed there's more of that gunfire and celebration you can probably hear uh ceasefire has been ceasefire deal has been agreed it's been a long time in the in the coming 50 days we've seen a number of ceas files I think our counting is there have been eight previous ceas files some of them just for a few hours some of them for as long as 5 days they haven't held uh but the the Hope from people here in Gaza and I expect people in Israel will be that this time it will be different that after 50 days and 2,000 people uh being killed many hundreds of thousands of people now homeless here in Gaza that this deal might actually hold have you got any more detail though about the substance of this ceasefire uh will all the borders be open will the blockade be lifted well we don't have those details yet we're told that the blockade will be lifted the Egyptian and the Israeli blockade but what does that really mean how many um trucks will be allowed into Gaza from the Israeli side will it be 200 a day will it be a thousand a day those details haven't been released how many uh people from Gaza will be able to enter into Israel how uh how will they then proceed with the thornier issues of a sea port for Gaza uh will Hamas prisoners be released those Hamas prisoners who were arrested in the occupied West Bank before this conflict uh began and and and that was an issue that really contributed uh to this conflict so many many uh issues still outstanding we believe that the fundamentals are the blockade will be Li lifted people here in Gaza will be happy about that and the gunfire All Around Me seems to indicate that that fishermen will be able to fish further uh into the Mediterranean and that rocket fire and Israeli air strikes will stop
