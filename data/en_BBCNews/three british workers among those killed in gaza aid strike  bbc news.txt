Dead there are reportedly British citizens too the Prime Minister Rishi sunak says he's shocked and saddened they're doing fantastic work bringing alleviation to the suffering that many are experiencing in Gaza they should be praised and commended for what they're doing they need to be allowed to do that work unhindered and it's incumbent on Israel to make sure that they can do that and we're asking Israel to investigate what happened urgently because clearly there are questions that need to be answered World Central Kitchen has been sending food to Gaza from Cyprus along a new sea route the aid workers had just unloaded 100 tons from the latest shipment when they came under attack Israel's military says it's investigating we are committed to examining our operations thoroughly and transparently I just spoke to wck founder Chef Jose andos and expressed the deepest condolences of of Israel Defense Forces to the families and the entire world Central Kitchen family in Gaza

Charities now paused its operations in the war torn territory where famine looming it says it will soon make decisions about the future of its work yolan now BBC News [Music] Jerusalem straight to breaking news an update on that main story World Central Kitchen have confirmed in the last few minutes to the BBC that three of their staff killed in that Israeli air strike in Gaza were British we said in our introduction that a variety of uh foreign Nationals we knew there were uh British workers but we did not know the numbers and that coming in the last few minutes that it is three of the seven are British so that is just come from World Central Kitchen confirming to the BBC that three of the seven staff killed were British so we will have more on that element of that story in a moment or two but in terms of the questions being raised well we've heard world leaders we've heard a variety of foreign ministers asking serious questions of Israel well Israel's primee Minister has released this video message just a short time ago let's hear Let unfortunately in the last day there was a tragic incident of an unintended strike of our forces on innocent people in the Gaza Strip this happens in war we are checking this thoroughly we are in touch with the governments and we will do everything for this not to happen again well that was Benjamin Netanyahu let's talk to unicef's spokesperson James Elder James welcome here to the program a really tough day this your reaction to this news of the deaths of seven Aid workers well it's just such a senseless loss Matthew it's a reac an immense tragedy for their families who would have no doubt been worried for them every single day uh that they're away hearing news and happy to get the old message back and no doubt happy to hear the work that they were doing the incredible work that they were doing the th those people the Frontline some of the Frontline actions for for for people who were coming particularly down from the north of Gaza Strip who had cut off Matthew and had not seen food or or or or sometimes anything like psychological help and that's what these colleagues at World kitchen were doing it was immense work and they would have been sharing that with families it's a senseless loss just in the same way it underscores there are senseless losses that families are enduring on the Gaza Strip every single day we heard there that you know Inn lives beautiful innocent lives there are beautiful innocent lives tens of thousands of them have been killed since this war started James we spoke to you only last week on the program you were there in Gaza you're now out but I gather you met with this team only in the last couple of days something like this for all Aid workers must be shocking must be winding they're such an impressive team Matthew they were where I met them um one of their spaces at World Central Kitchen which is just near the final checkpoint on the coast there um they have psychological support for people because people who are coming out of the north have suffered all types of humiliation and Relentless bombardment a lot of people in in residential housing around Shea hospital f for two weeks had seen unspeakable things and they come out and they get food and and yeah so there was something about these colleagues Palestinian I hadn't met my Australian counterpart um and they just they they knew the dangers they wanted to be there but I'm sorry when I say they knew the dangers they knew this is a difficult place to work it's a place where you've got bad sanitation I just left a friend who's got severe hepatitis um because of what she's caught but you don't expect this when you get approvals to move and you're in an armored vehicle you have to trust the occupying power you have to trust Israel therefore that you are allowed to move you're only moving in that Convoy as we've all done many times and an armored vehicle is good if there's a stray bullet or something a missile through the roof with your exact coordinates I mean and here and here we are here we are James just for those people watching around the world who don't know how Aid agencies operate on the ground the cars we're seeing images of those vehicles on our screens at the moment they were very clearly marked the a agencies do let Israelis know what they're planning their routs used the car used is that absolutely common practice very much so it's essential you can't move particularly where they are Derry berer in the middle area in the north you cannot move without that approval you seek an approval might take a day it might take three days but you seek an approval two days before minimum you get that approval the exact coordinance you will move you will move to a designated spot you might then wait it's called a waiting era you might then wait again for another call to go to get an all clear then you will move again it is laborious it is painstaking it's an active military zone but then once you start to move as these young people were you know again in the in the essential delivery of of food to people facing famine then you do so in the hope that despite all the horrors you've seen that day at hospitals and so on and and and injuries to Children you do so with a fair knowledge that you will not get a missile attack and yet here we are I mean there are as I say there are thousands of families who assume they'd be safe in their homes a final thought then because World Central Kitchen have now suspended their operations they had been at the Forefront of that operation of bringing in Aid via the sea that new route so here is the question is this a coincidence is it the fog of war or is it something more Sinister honestly Matthew I don't know I can't speak to to the intent here of course we've heard many many apologies around this the the facts still remain that we've certainly seen um Mal intent in restrictions of Aid that's why we have imminent famine that's why we seen a catastrophic decline that's why we see 13,000 children reportedly killed these numbers don't don't occur when their all due all due care is given to uh children civilians or in this case those people who traveled across the world to try and help others James Elder thanks once again thanks for joining us here live on
