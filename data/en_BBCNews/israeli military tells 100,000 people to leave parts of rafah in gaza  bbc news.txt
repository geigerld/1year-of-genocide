we begin at this hour in the Middle East Israel's military has said it's begun ordering Palestinian civilians to leave parts of Eastern Rafa ahead of a planned operation in the southern Gaza City in this video by the Israeli Defense Forces they're urging those in eastern Rafa close to the border with Israel to move to what they call a humanitarian Zone in the al- mawasi and KH Yunis areas the IDF have said this is a limited operation and should affect about 100,000 people Israel's Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to insist that a military operation in Rafa is necessary to seek out remaining Hamas Fighters despite widespread humanitarian concern for those Sheltering there western and Arab leaders have repeatedly warned against such a wide ground operation because of the prospect of high numbers of Civilian casualties meanwhile officials from Israel and its closest Ally the US have been holding meetings to discuss alternative more focused plans it's not yet clear if the new evacuation orders are part of those well let's speak to James zelder who's a spokesperson for the United Nations Children's Fund also known as UNICEF thanks very much indeed for for being with us so tell us what you think the impact will be of this evacuation Lauren absolutely devastating you have families in Rafa their coping capacity has been smashed this is six months of enduring this war moving many times probably having lost a home already they are children are malnourished they've already been living in conditions with you know one one shower for three and a half thousand people they're being told to move quote unquote to a humanitarian Zone that's a unilaterally declared humanitarian Zone that's not a humanitarian Zone where humanitarians have been able to provide the services they need to so I've been talking to colleagues and friends in Rafa this morning and they they're terrified I was speaking Lauren to a young woman she's like I know this has been coming I just don't know what to pack they'll go to an area in the middle Zone Lauren called der Bal where there is literally raw seage in the streets or maybe to alasi which is a beach same story applies nowhere is safe but as unbearable as this is it's happening and and it's going to be horrific and is it your understanding that there are only specific areas that people have been allowed to move to or can they can they choose no there are specific areas without a doubt partly they will have to choose based on those people who have the means to leave a lot of people have injured children with them hospitals as I've seen hospitals cannot cope with the number of injuries there's a lot of children who have had amputations who are back living in tents those families will find it hard to move but geographically logistically no you still can't a lot of families will not be able to move to the north if they'd hoped to car unus is impossible that's another city bordering raer that is Rubble not a little bit but Street after Street of rubble so they'll be pushed into this area called masasi Lauren which is a Beach area it's sand it has next to no sanitation or hygiene it's getting hot right now in Gaza it's raining today but it's getting hot so they'll be intense side by side five or six times is the population density of New York City but all on the ground not a highrise to be seen with no hospital care the last remaining Hospital of size is in Rafa European hospital so named because it was donated by the people of Europe uh it's got 20,000 people hiding there and thousands more uh in care they will have to move somewhere without the medical care that they need tell us you said that um the Israeli Army had set up these areas without assistance from the humanitarian community what can you now do in terms of providing help if people are moving is is there anything you can do yeah it's it's a great question the whole Aid operation has been so fragile because of denials and restrictions and insecurity and bombardments let's not forget our our colleagues from the world Central Kitchen who were killed a week later a UNICEF vehicle come came under Fire now of course that Crossing in Rafa that is the lifeline of Aid if we are going to get close to meeting the the needs of people that Crossing will now be closed for I don't know for how long so no we have to be clear you can't unilaterally declare a safe Zone firstly because the other side won't be considering it as that and secondly because the United Nations needs time to actually try and support a million or two people I said this in November UNICEF and the UN has said this Lauren from the very start in November and December this safe Zone narrative is very dangerous because a safe Zone legally must also provide water food sanitation and protection these zones don't have that for people and quite frequently as the people in raffle will tell you safe zones also get bombed James Elder from UNICEF thank you very much indeed for taking the time to talk to us
