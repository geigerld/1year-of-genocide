you're live with BBC News the World Health Organization is warning that more people could die in Gaza because of untreated diseases than due to air strikes if the health system isn't restored there more than a million people are Sheltering in overcrowded United Nations facilities as cases of diarrhea and respiratory infections are widespread patients with chronic illnesses like cancer are also not getting any treatment well to discuss this further I'm joined Now by mikee noise from action a thank you very much for joining us here on the BBC you've been in touch with your teams in Gaza if we can begin by finding out a little bit more about what they're telling you about the situation on the ground thank you reie obviously a few days now into a course there's a there's a yeah there's a sense of improvement just in terms of the the access for our for our colleagues and for humanitarian workers and and crucially for supplies coming in through the Raffa Crossing although they're still far below meeting the levels of need that said you know with the needs as high as they are and particularly with the situation that very little of that Aid is reaching the north we continue to hear from our colleagues about their concern for what can be achieved and and for the needs we're continuing to hear from our colleagues that the hospitals that we work with are still lacking fuel meaning they can't run generators which is impacting on their their basic abil to Pro provide you know basic Medical Services we're continuing to hear concerns about the state of the water system and the ab again the lack of fuel to provide to to get pumps running and that also many people of course around Gaza particularly those who fled from the north to the South are exposed and living in very poor conditions and lacking basic shelter I heard from a colleague today talking about uh uh seven families sharing one blanket for the the for the night you know the the levels of of need uh the the lack of humanitarian Aid is is still quite crucial no matter how hard we and one of the uh concerns is Aid getting into the north we've been talking to other Aid agencies in the last few days who say that has been one of the biggest challenges and one of the greatest needs in indeed the hospitals we work with up in in the north I I didn't hear from them today but as of yesterday they not received any any fuel at all and and so yeah yeah it for for them yes the bombardment is has has stopped but the pores has really not resulted in in much Aid getting through to them them mle up in the north and of course as well as the hospitals there are still you a large number of people living in the north we're doing what we can in terms of getting people whether it's in the North or the South uh cash uh through through our action A Partners on the ground but obviously cash can only go so far when there's not much to buy in the shop and just very briefly Mike uh the who talking about the danger of infectious diseases because sanitation conditions are obviously very poor as well now yeah indeed this is this is what we are hearing again from our colleagues uh in the camps the number of people using you know one or or two latrines you know I think I heard something like 700 people using two latrines recently in one of the shelters down the South so the risk of waterborne or diarrhea diseases is incredibly high and as I say sort of aggravated by the fact that people are living in very poor conditions in terms of shelter and the cold I this is you know the challenge for us very much at the moment is the pause is helping it is getting things through but when the pause is extended on a day-by-day basis it's very hard for us to scale up and plan properly okay Mike noise from action a thank you very much for bringing us up to date on the situation on the ground in Gaza this is the context stay with us
