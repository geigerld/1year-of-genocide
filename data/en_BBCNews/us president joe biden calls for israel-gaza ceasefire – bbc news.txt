move on to the middle east now because president biden has said he backs a ceasefire in gaza and said the u.s is engaging with egypt and other partners to secure one in a phone call with the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu mr biden also voiced his support for israel's right to defend itself against indiscriminate rocket attacks while urging mr netanyahu to protect civilians more than 212 people including 61 children have died in gaza and 10 including two children in israel this was the scene in gaza city as day broke bringing with it more airstrikes with the latest here's our middle east editor jeremy bowen nightmares come true in gaza for parents and their children this mother couldn't talk about the airstrike that engulfed them last friday eight-year-old mustafa al-zahana and his mother are further down the children's ward at chifa gaza's main hospital she says mustafa trembles when he hears israeli attacks ever since the one that wounded him almost a week ago as he left their home with his father to buy new clothes for the end of ramadan his father was paralyzed most of his friend who went with them is dead his friend was killed when bara was dying he was clutching my son tightly and telling him not to leave him alone but died when my son has a fever he hallucinates about it as well as the badly injured 61 children in gaza have been killed in the last week about 20 miles north is this synagogue in the israeli town of ashkelon it was hit by a hamas rocket it was the festival of shavuot the feast of weeks usually a celebration it's a very sad time for for us over here in ashkelon we are always on bombing i hope it will finish fast in jerusalem the western wall plaza was almost deserted this is the holiest place for jews to pray it's usually packed on religious holidays but some of the worshippers said people were scared to go out the grey dome of al-aqsa mosque is one of the most sacred places for muslims you can see how close it is to the wall above the wall is the golden dome of the rock both muslim shrines are built on the site of the ancient jewish temple these sites are all also national symbols a month of tension here raised the hatred level so high it led to war the events of the last week have shown a couple of things first of all the power of jerusalem to ignite this conflict and hamas have sent a strong message to palestinians that as far as they're concerned they are their real protectors here in the holy city even though hamas hq is 60 or 70 miles away by the sea in gaza our gaza producer filmed his drive to work and you can see the bomb sites if palestinians and israelis could be equally safe and secure they might have a chance of peace right now they don't jeremy bowen bbc news jerusalem well let's speak now to the former prime minister of sweden carl biltz he currently sits as co-chair on the european council on foreign relations a pan european think tank mr bill thank you very much for joining us on bbc news the united states blocking a u.n security council statement again calling for a cessation of violence in the region although president biden has spoken of his support for a ceasefire will eu foreign ministers meeting today explicitly call for an end to the violence well i certainly hope so um particularly now with even president biden had come out and talked about a ceasefire and i would expect that within not too distant future we will have a ceasefire i think the important thing is what happened thereafter that uh international community be that the united states would be that the european union doesn't just walk away from the issue again as we've done after these outbursts of jerusalem or gaza that occurs frequently a comprehensive solution might be difficult that's granted but it should be possible to move towards a more stable situation after this but it requires political determination and political courage and i hope that you can demonstrate that so why specifically do you think do you say that a ceasefire may be coming i mean what's happening on the ground what's happening internationally to make you say that uh i do apologize we're having problems uh with the lines to guests let me see if we can get carl built back uh while we do that this is the area around sterot in in southern israel very close to the border with gaza where we have seen sustained activity from the israeli army obviously this is an area that is within range of rockets fired by hamas militants and we're now into the second week of this violence in the region as efforts continue to find a diplomatic solution and to in the first instance secure a cessation of violence i i believe we do have carl biltback co-chair of the european council on foreign relations apologies for the technical issues mr bilt i was just asking you why you had said to me that you think that a ceasefire may be coming soon because that is what normally happens i mean these these conflicts over gaza that they don't go on forever at some point in time israel will say that we've run out of a target list and we will accept a ceasefire and i hope hamas does the same but the important thing is what happens thereafter that we just don't walk away from the issue because the only thing that is certain if that happens is that the conflict is going to be back new rockets new airstrikes new misery and how do we build how do we build a sustained conversation a sustained dialogue and diplomatic effort to ensure that we don't have these crisis points and then more conversation how do you keep the conversation going then to try to work towards a longer-term solution difficult difficult difficulty but the first thing you have to do is to try to do it i mean in the last few years the international community be that the americans are the europeans have not been very active on these issues it is difficult it is hard it might fail but if you don't try it will not happen and and there are i remember way back 10 15 years ago when we have this outburst as well then the eu was trying actively to facilitate some sort of at least temporary solution so there are models that can be used in order to get a slightly better situation you say that the core problem is the absence of a two-state solution um where where do you think international efforts are on that question nowhere uh i mean the americans i mean the trump administration was against the two-state solution defector divided administration seems to i can understand that they seem to be reluctant to engage because it's too difficult the europeans have been too divided lately to be a particular active actress netanyahu is against so it's difficult so perhaps one should start with trying to sort out them issue by issue see can we do something with garcia can we do something with the issues in jerusalem can we do something with something else but just to walk away from the issue is i think that's been demonstrated not responsible let me pick up on what you said uh about joe biden you don't think that the u.s is going to engage in this you say because they see it as simply too difficult the obama administration in the second term john kerry was the envoy did make a very determined attempt to move forward with the two state solutions and and failed no faults of that but failed of course part of that administration uh bruised by that experience you think i think washington is bruce by that particular experience um then of course trump tried to do something entirely different that's of the cards at the moment but i i would hope that in spite of that experience and in spite of perhaps understanding that sort of a two-state solution within the next few months is not achievable to put it badly there that's issues that needs to be dealt with say garcia is an example of what can be dealt with and must be there it feels like the international community needs to take this in small steps because trying to clearly solve the totality of this is impossible at the moment so as you say it is about small stages so what do you think needs to be the next step well the immediate step is obviously a ceasefire then perhaps i think one should start perhaps with the gauss asia perhaps with the jerusalem issue perhaps with some issue and then move gradually forward with those particular issues i mean certainly not giving up on a two-state solution but perhaps doing more incrementally instead of the big bang okay carl built a former swedish prime minister now co-chair of the european council on foreign relations thank you very much
