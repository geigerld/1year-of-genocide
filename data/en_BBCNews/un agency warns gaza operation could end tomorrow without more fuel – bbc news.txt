straight away to tomara arifi who's the spokesperson for Ana who of course are working there on the ground in Gaza thank you so much for being here on the program and the Secretary General referencing the amount of your staff that are being lost in this conflict and those numbers continue to go up 35 now in total yes uh the Secretary General set the bar I think for where we all stand as humanitarians with a very very urgent call for a humanitarian ceasefire and for the application of international humanitarian law that is particularly relevant to my colleagues at unra the fact that unra the largest UN agency in Gaza has already lost 35 Staff members women and men doctors Engineers nurses you name it it is devastating it is shocking and it is appalling so we stand behind the UN secretary General's call for a respect for all civilians those who have nothing to do with this conflict including Aid workers including my own colleagues at Ana now your agency spoke to the BBC only a couple of hours ago issued a warning today about how much longer you can keep going what are you saying be very clear about what that warning is the warning is if we do not get more fuel into Gaza we as unra the largest Aid agency in Gaza will not be able to carry out any humanitarian operations and that is because we need the fuels for our trucks that uh that whole conversation about convoys coming in from Rafa we need fuel so so that our trucks can pick up that Aid we need fuel for our water desalination PL so that people can have access to clean water hospitals need fuel for life-saving machines without which people can die so fuel is a top urgency my colleagues in Gaza have confirmed that we have enough fuel for about two to three days after that we will not be able to work neither will the bakeries that need fuel electricity neither will the water salination plant or the life-saving machines and hospitals just just be very clear because one of your colleagues said you had enough fuel to last till tomorrow night is that what you're saying and also just tell me the consequences if you get no more fuel the consequences if you have to Halt operations if we get no fuel we cannot work and people can die people can die because there will will no longer be electricity in hospitals for life-saving machines people will no longer have access to bread that is almost the only thing people are eating now and that is because Ona and the world food program have been Distributing wheat flour to bakeries in those bakeries in order to make bread we need electricity and water for the wheat the water we get it through a water desalination plant that works through a generator that is powered with the fuel so if we don't get the fuel there's no water there is no baking Bakery and there is no machines in hospitals and there will be no trucks to pick up the humanitarian supplies from the borders let me put to you what Israel their army spokesman has said that Hamas is stockpiling fuel can you understand the reasons why fuel is not being allowed in to you and others that that are being actually given and articulated no I cannot understand it as a representative of a humanitarian agency we are not responsible for what a party at war is doing we are responsible for enabling our own humanitarian operations and therefore it is not okay to not allow the UN and the larger humanitarian Community to have access to something as basic as fuel for our cars so so tell me what conditions are like in the UN hospitals in the UN schools which are being used as shelters and which parts of the Gaza Strip are currently where AID is needed the most the North or the South Aid is needed everywhere people are displaced everywhere there was a huge wave of displacement about a week ago from the north of the strip to the south of the strip so there is overcrowding in unaa shelters in the south of the strip up to 600,000 people are now living in around 150 unest schools for a bit of visuals these are regular schools and all of a sudden two three four thousand people live day and night in these schools with very little access to water living in very unsanitary conditions a few hundred people sharing one toilet very little water for showering very little food so the conditions are extremely dire the UN Secret General said that they're they're growing more dire by the hour over the last week or 10 days your agency has made multiple warnings exactly as you are doing today in terms of people listening what is your sense of it is there frustration do you think that anyone is actually listening to any of these warnings there's a lot of frustration about having to negotiate for two weeks for very small restricted convoys of much needed humanitarian supplies to go in we can choose to hail the Breakthrough to celebrate the break the Breakthrough and the entry of 20 trucks on the first day three days ago to Gaza and then 14 and then another 20 we can also go back and say to the International Community and those who have influence and say before this conflict up to 500 truck went into Gaza every day loaded with supplies aund of these trucks were humanitarian assistance 45 of these trucks every day were loaded with fuel I I've only got 30 seconds left so really briefly if you could can you imagine what it is going to be like on the ground if you have to halt your operations and if there is a ground offensive less than 30 seconds it is going to be hell on Earth well tomorrow thank you than you so much for joining us here on BBC News with that assessment and responding to what we just heard from the UN Secretary General as that meeting convenes in New York
