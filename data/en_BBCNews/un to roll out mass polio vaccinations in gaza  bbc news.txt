un agencies are preparing to start a mass polio vaccination program in Gaza this weekend after Israel and Hamas agreed to a series of three-day localized pauses in fighting the World Health Organization officials have said that 1.2 million polio vaccine doses have already been delivered to Gaza ahead of the rollout the goal is to vaccinate more than 600,000 children after the first case of polio in 25 years was discovered in Gaza Lucy Williamson reports born a month before the Gaza War Began Abdul Rahman has played a role in pausing it something world leaders have struggled to do earlier this month Abdul Rahman was diagnosed with polio the first case in Gaza for 25 years the family nine children in all live in a camp in central Gaza displaced multiple times from their home in the north the constant moving disrupted his vaccinations his mother says others in the camp are afraid and stop their children playing with him the virus stopped his progress he stopped sitting stopped walking stopped crawling and stopped moving I want him to be treated he wants to live and walk like other children abdur rahman's diagnosis is raised fresh alarm over conditions in gaza's camps the phased PA in fighting with will allow Medics to vaccinate more than half a million children in stages across the territory but the conditions that caused this crisis are worsening say Aid organizations and their Solutions are not straightforward due to the insecurity the damage the road infrastructure and and population displacement but also based on on our experience with this kind of campaigns uh globally and worldwide the three days might not be enough to to achieve adequate vaccination Israel's prime minister was clear that this was not a ceasefire the war has so far been resistant to both diplomacy and disease but preventing another layer of tragedy is seen as one small victory what the eu's foreign policy chief called a drop of Hope in a sea of Despair Lucy Williamson BBC News Janine well Sam Rose director of planning it unra told me more about the vaccination program I mean we're deeply deeply concerned about the the levels at which it can be it might may be at there's one confirmed case that that your reporter referred to there may be may be many more uh because the health system here has been decimated largely over the past 10 months the bombardments the destruction of of clinics the collapse of water and and and sewage so Solid Waste Management infrastructure the malnutrition these are precisely the conditions in which a vaccine like this reemerges a vaccine which had been eradicated for more than 25 years inside the Gaza Strip has reemerged so we're deeply deeply concerned and at the same time we welcome so much as everyone here does the rest bite for for just a small amount of time from the bombings from the evacuation orders that we hope will allow us to administer a successful campaign working closely with the World Health Organization UNICEF the the Ministry of Health and and and other partners but as you said this is a massive massive effort we just really really hope that that that it will be successful for the children we're vaccinating the the disease reemerging of course rather than the vaccine reemerging but just just explain for us how you actually get to all the children and how can you be sure that that all the children there will be reached is is three days enough three days perhaps isn't enough as your previous interview he said and this will be three days across three different areas of the Gaza Strip the southern governorates the middle governorates and the the northern governorates the vaccines most of them have now arrived in Gaza the the the Personnel who are who will administer those vaccines who will register the children who are raising awareness amongst the community have been hired have been trained are are out there but doing anything in Gaza right right now is incredibly difficult surviving the night is is is is very difficult so we Face a number of of challenges the fact that there will be causes humanitarian pauses the fact that there will be no uh evacuation orders make our lives more easy it means that we can distribute the the vaccines the fuel the staff to the areas in which they need to go and unra my organization will be vaccinating up to half of these children we've taken on about 1,00 of our Personnel will be involved and we'll be vaccinating at our primary health clinics that we have at Health points that we've set up in areas that people have been vaccinated to we have mobile teams who work in the dozens and dozens of schools where hundreds of thousands of people Sheltering and we will do what would previously have been house to house but now is tent to tent largely given the realities of the situation in which people live but reaching that more or less M magic number of 90% of children will be very difficult because we don't quite know how many children there are we don't know how many are still alive we certainly don't know precisely anyway Sam Rose there director of planning at unra
