we're bringing you now the latest pictures from the Lebanese Capital Beirut there were protests late into the night outside the US Embassy and more protests today you can see there in those pictures the anger boiling over on the street Security Forces trying to contain the crowds using tear gas and water cannons to push people back anger boiling over in Lebanon there were also protests yesterday outside the Israeli Embassy in the Jordanian Capital Aman protest in Libya protest in the Iranian Capital tan outside the British and the French embassies there is no Israeli or American embassy of course in the Iranian Capital but let's now focus on the situation in Lebanon because there has been heightened concern from the very beginning of this crisis that that could be a second front in this war and there have been clashes along that border border of Northern Israel with Lebanon with hisbah militants Allied to Iran firing Rockets across the border Israel firing into Lebanon let's bring in our Middle East correspondent Lena sjab Lena you have been following this very closely from the start what has changed in the mood in Lebanon after last night's devastating explosion at the Al Ali Hospital uh you know le as you mentioned the tension has been uh mounting since the start of the attack and since the start of the 7 October incident uh but yesterday was completely different uh everyone many countries including the US and France and other countries have been you know sending messages to Lebanon not to get involved in this war but Iran was saying that you know it it you know other fronts could open at any moment and the attack on the uh hospital yesterday raised a lot of anger not only in Lebanon but in the Arab streets as as you mentioned there were lots of protests marching towards the um American Embassy here in in in Beirut just as as I'm talking to you a protest passing near uh my home I can see I saw flags of hisbah flags of you know the Palestinian uh the Palestinian flags were raising people are angry and the a few minutes ago also we've heard the foreign minister here um you know in a meeting in in in um in Saudi Arabia saying that the situation the escalation uh you know reached a point where its consequences could spill over in the whole region in a you know in an uncontrollable way hisbah this morning also said that there should be a response and that's not acceptable condemning the attack on the hospital the problem here Le in this region and especially in Lebanon with the presence of hisbah and its hostility towards Israel everything is it it could happen at any moment at any um you know resp who has been with us in Beirut reporting on the situation in the Lebanese Capital which have been Lena uh I don't know if you can hear me or not this is Mariam in the London studio um I think we've lost lease I want to continue talking to you Lena because of course we're seeing these incredible pictures of the US Embassy in Beirut the outside of the embassy and there just the the reaction the visceral reaction from so many as you said just after the news of that explosion came in uh you talk about the issues that could potentially spill over what could that spill over potentially look like do you think it's really unpredictable and it's really worrying I mean it's been worrying the past 10 days uh because of you know people here especially in Lebanon remember very well the one monthlong war in 2006 that destroyed the infrastructure in in Lebanon and this time Israelis said that if hisbah would launch an attack against Israeli um you know territories or involve in a war against Israel it's going the price is going to be very high many people have been really wary about this and you know expressed fear of getting Lebanon involved but the problem problem is the anger in the street the Ang youth the protest that we're seeing everywhere in b as I was mentioning it was just passing next to my home you know a few minutes ago before with the hisbah flags and the Palestinian Flags it's really hard to control or you know expect what their reaction is going to be the Iranians have been warning hisbah warned we don't know what and when if and if they will be and what is the response that is going to trigger everyone is calling for people to come down and not to involve in war but this is the region of the unpredictable and after the anger of the um the hospital attack things could go out of hand Lena it feels to me like the hospital attack was very much kind of a catalyst for these protests it feels to me that even if tomorrow uh we were presented irrefutable evidence of you know the the the Hospital exposure not being the fault of the Israelis these protests would still happen they'd still carry on it feels this goes beyond that it transcends what happened last night the issue is if I don't know if you can hear me I don't know if you can still hear me but the issue here in the Arab world we can Lina we can yes the issue in the Arab world and in the Arab street is that who can they believe who is going to provide the evidence is there an independent country who can investigate and provide the evidence now we're only hearing what the uh Israeli government is saying and the Americans immediately backed uh that narrative most people in the streets here uh they express concern that the international media is just buying what the Israeli government and the American government is providing as uh the narrative over the hospital um incident so you know uh we have to wait and see but they need independent institutions to verify who who carried out the attack before making decisions on their responses the history of this conflict in how it is seen in the Arab world that the whole International Community superpowers are biased to the Israeli narrative that's why there is lack of confidence lack of trust with the International Community here in the streets of the Arab world and especially in Lebanon we're going to stay with these pictures Lena and I think we're going to stay with you I want to ask you another thing I've been reading about the US us warning Americans not to travel to Lebanon after the these incidents in Beirut and the US Embassy uh Lebanon itself of course has its own problems its own economic Strife if understatement really uh what kind of impact is all of this having on Lebanon itself as a as a country as a nation to see scenes like this in its capital it is really concerned uh raising concerns among the Lebanese I've been having calls from friends from relatives everyone is reassessing whether to stay uh or to leave we've heard some reports that you know some of the DI diplomatic missions here called on a non-permanent residents to leave the country and that's all signs of concerns for the coming days and and and and weeks probably and this is a country that is already uh suffering immensely from economic collapse and you know financial crisis and lying in poverty but this is also a situation that is fueling a lot of anger that people are forgetting about about their economic issues and thinking about what they see as Injustice in treating the Palestinians and this is a country that has like a core support for the Palestinian cause for the Palestinian civilians basically and seeing these images of the hospital coming out people forget about their own their own pain and their own worry and they want to see Justice they want to see a fair um you know uh outcome for for this situation as you were discussing before that we have to to wait for an investigation to see who carried out this attack on the hospital but for people in Lebanon and in the Arab world they need transparency they need to know that there is an independent uh institution or a country to carry out the investigation and not the United States backing U the Israeli narrative on this situation and Lena as we see these incredible pictures of uh the uh US Embassy in Beirut and protesters outside it uh I just wanted to ask you I've been reading also about the fact that it's not just the US em Embassy that has been uh targeted by protests protesters also broke out in the at the French Embassy as well well the anger is targeted towards all the countries that are are seen here in the streets as as biased to to Israel I mean the French government even banned protests that are pro Palestinian and this is unprecedented in a democratic country that supports freedom of spe speech so imagine the reflection of uh these kind of decisions and these kind of stances here in the Arab world when they see fellow uh you know Palestinians that they support and they feel uh wholeheartedly to their Agony uh they being attacked and you know the whole world is still supporting an Israeli uh um narrative and Israeli stance don't forget that you know people follow closely what happens around the world and they've seen The Stance of the US the EU and other government to Russia's uh committing similar attacks on Ukraine while there it was condemned but here it is declared as self-defense and that's only fueling anger and feeling among the Arab street that the whole world don't care about this part of the world and don't care about providing real Justice real human rights and defending uh these values that you know superpowers and world first world countries um you know uh keep uh promoting but not applying in this part of the world Lena thank you so much for that Lena and job it's really good to get your voice on talking about what's happening in Beirut giving us context and Analysis because of course as we leave you uh we were seeing just a second ago those pictures of protests in Beirut um we have the French and the Americans warning their citizens not to travel to Lebanon to Bay rout because of those protests happening well as you know demonstrations in support of the Palestinian people have been organized as we saw by Hezbollah now it's a group which supports Hamas our correspondent Hugo Bea was at one of those protests he sent me this update this protest has been organized bya uh in response to the hospital explosion in Gaza yesterday and we're here uh near the wom section of the protest next to the stage where thousands of Men Behind the section lots of people here carrying the Palestinian flag also the yellow and green flag of H now this protest is happening uh also on the day that US president Jo Biden is visiting Israel in a demonstration American Support Israel so there is a very strong anti-American and anti-israeli sentiment here now of course in Lebanon lots of people want to know what Hasa is going to do if this country is going to be dragged into this conflict we've seen that in the last few days violence the Lebanese Israel border has intensified today there was more exchange of fire between militants here in Lebanon [Music] and towards and also his supporter that's Hugo Bea there I want to just take you to Beirut and just to show you these latest pictures these live pictures coming into us uh we're not entirely sure where these are but you can see tear gas being exploding at the feet of
