we begin in the Middle East where pressure is growing on Israel to let more Aid into Gaza Washington is urging Israel to do more to provide sustained humanitarian access officials say they're deeply concerned about reports of imminent famine they've called for the Raffa Crossing to be reopened as soon as possible Egypt stopped allowing in supplies after Israel seized control of the Gaza side the two countries have blamed each other for its continued closure speaking at a news conference the White House Press Secretary Karen G Pierre said more needed to be done so this level of Aid remains insufficient and we want to continue to press uh Israel to increase the level of assistant moving into Gaza we understand what I just laid out is not sufficient we want to get more in We are continuing to have those conversation with Israel and we have seen some progress we need to get more in the US concern over the amount of Aid getting into The Enclave has been echoed by the UN their aid Chief War that famine is now an immediate threat and that un staff were struggling to help people displaced by the Israeli offensive in Rafa the facts on the ground tell us we don't need to be scientists to see the the consequence of of the removal of food and you know also for famine particularly the removal of medical care and nutritional care which is the the precursor to you know famine kills through disease um as well as hunger the Israeli Prime Minister has doubled down on the importance of a military campaign in Rafa Benjamin Netanyahu was shown flying over the Gaza Strip with Military Officers his comments come after a very public spat with his defense minister yoav Gallant over the future of Gaza he was speaking during a visit to soldiers at a military base the battle for Rafa is critical it's not just the rest of their battalions it's also their oxygen pipes for escape and resupply this battle of which you are an integral part is a battle that decides many things in this campaign I repeat we are in a critical battle now your action helps to end it we can speak now to our correspondent Dan Johnson who's in Jerusalem and we say the pressure is mounting John Dan just tell us what um the US has been saying yeah the US is calling for the land borders into Gaza to be reopened to ease access for Aid particularly for food and for fuel there is some positive news in that the uh emergency temporary floating dock that has been constructed by the US military will soon be ready to accept Aid via the sea and there are already deliveries sailing from Cyprus towards Gaza but the message is that that shouldn't be relied upon solely to deliver Aid to Gaza now that the most important and effective routs are the land Crossings to all allow trucks through to deliver food and to bring fuel so that that food can be effectively appropriately distributed throughout Gaza to the Palestinian refugees who need it and the warning from the UN is that 2.4 million refugees are now on the brink of impending famine if more food doesn't get through and can't be distributed uh effectively so that is the call for Israel to reopen particularly the Rafa Crossing but that of course has been difficult because of the intensification of Israeli military operations in that area over the last week or more now and what about today then we've got Israel making its case at the icj responding to these accusations from South Africa what can we expect today yes this is a further stage in South Africa's submissions to the international court of justice uh calling effectively for a halt to the Israeli military operations uh in Rafa the earlier case that started at the beginning of the year accused Israel of genocide and that wider case is still going on but South Africa's been able to bring an emergency motion uh calling for the uh the operation the military conduct around Rafa to be suspended because of the impact that that is having on Palestinian refugees hundreds of thousands who've been uprooted in the last week or 10 days by the military operation there and these were people in the main who had already been forced from their homes earlier in this conflict people who'd moved to Rafa in in seek of shelter and safety and they are people who are now on the move again and are wondering where is safe where they will be able to find shelter and food because of the desperate situation and the lack of safe options Israel will make its submissions in defense of its case to the icj later this morning okay well thanks very much for now that's Dan Johnson reporting to us live from Jerusalem and we will of course keep right across what's going on at the icj uh later today and bring it to you here on BBC News
