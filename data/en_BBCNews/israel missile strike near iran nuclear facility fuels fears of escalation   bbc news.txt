United Nations Secretary General and other world leaders have called for restraint in the Middle East after what's believed to have been an Israeli attack on Iran overnight us officials say Israel was responsible for a missile strike the Israeli government hasn't officially commented Iran says the attack didn't cause any damage and indicated there would be no retaliation there were reports of explosions in Syria Iraq and most significantly in Iran in the province of isv Han in the middle of the country the area is home to an airbase and several nuclear sites as well as a missile Factory us officials called it an Israeli missile strike Iranian media said three small drones were involved in a moment we'll hear from our North America editor Sarah Smith in Washington and our chief International correspondent Lisa set first though let's hear from Lucy Williamson in Jerusalem well there reports tonight that Israel's defense minister has been having conversations with his us counterpart there's obviously been a lot of pressure from Israel's allies to contain this crisis and the sense here tonight is that both Israel and Iran may be looking for a way to avoid escalating it but this is the middle east's most dangerous conflict and this crisis has changed calculations on both sides a message not of War but of warning that Israel could also strike its enemy at home if it wanted after threatening a harsh and massive response to the smallest incursion Iran has downplayed the morning strike it president didn't mention it once in his speech today and this is the situation in esphahan shown on Iranian TV the message nothing to see here other than that nothing has happened everything is back to normal Israel was divided over how to respond to Iran's barrage last weekend the Judgment of one farri right cabinet minister this morning lame and in Jerusalem's main market today many others were disappointed when a bully comes to you we're going to respond to the bully with restraint the bully is just going to come back harder and harder and harder but if you want to take down bully got it take down with Force I expected more to be quite honest I think more would have been even Justified considering they sent 300 arets to kill so many people I think that we're losing we're losing the war with Hamas we're losing the war with kah we're losing the war with Iran we lose again it's a Pity we have so much strength but we're afraid to use it last weekend Iran fired more than 300 drones and missiles towards Israel punishment it said for the assassination of a senior commander in Syria earlier this month all but a handful was shot down before hitting Israeli soil this missile fuel tank pulled by Israel's Army from the Dead Sea Israel's allies urged it to take the win and avoid escalating the conflict we're committed to Israel's security we're also committed to de-escalating uh to trying to bring uh this tension to a to a close this strike and Iran's muted response to it suggest both sides a keen to step back from this conflict but their direct confrontation last weekend has left them in a new more dangerous position the immediate risk may be cooling but from where they stand now it's a shorter route to war is one analyst says there's a lesson for the future in Iran deciding to act even when it knew Israel would respond they considered it and they took it into account and they decided to do it so they there is a change in the way that they are thinking and therefore I have to take into account that in the future they will be doing the same things and this is the big question because Israel is not going to stop a attacking any arms that are coming across Iraq the Iraqi Syrian border Iran today avoided blaming Israel directly even as crowds called for its destruction after Friday prayers but Israel is already fighting iran-backed groups across the region even if this crisis is subsiding the Sparks that triggered it will not Lucy Williamson BBC News Jerusalem well our North America editor is Sarah Smith uh Sarah President Biden of course had urged restraint what's being said in Washington tonight well interestingly President Biden and those around him are very deliberately saying almost nothing about this today except to confirm that the US wasn't involved in any military operations and that's because amid the relief there is here that the Israeli response was relatively small scale they don't want to Fan the Flames of anything by statements or commentary that's coming out of here but you're right President Biden had urged Israel to take the wind I.E the massive failure of Iran's attack on their last weekend and not to retaliate um and that and and of course as we saw Israel didn't do that there's growing frustration here it has to be said about Israel's tactics not just this attack on Iran but also uh what's been happening in gaza's causing mounting concern but the limited success that America has had in trying to limit Israel's operations there I mean the US does remain Israel's biggest backer by far militarily diplomatically and even financially uh this this weekend the Congress is going to vote on over 26 billion dollars of Aid that to be sent to Israel but it doesn't seem to buy them as much influence as the White House would ideally like all right Sarah thank you and let's get the thoughts of our chief International correspondent Lee tet who is here with me and we heard Iran indicated there would be no retaliation for this do we take that at face value for now this round seems to be over both sides believe they have sent a very clear signal to their Arch Enemy that if they strike there'll be a heavy price to pay in other words they believe they have reestablished deterrence for Iran this limited strike which Israel hasn't officially acknowledged gave them vital political space that they could say nothing happened that they don't have to invoke that rule that new rule that when Israel strikes Iran will hit back immediately and hard for Israel this lied strike seems as we've been hearing to be a warning Salvo that Israel can and will strike the Beating Heart of Iran the central province of Isfahan which is home to a nuclear facility a major air base an industrial Heartland which produces the drones and missiles which Iran sent into Israel by the hundreds last Sunday so behind Iran's dismissal even mockery of what happened this morning there's still much for Iran to worry about and as we've been hearing the grief this the roots of this confrontation aren't over the griev has cause a war Iran's networks a network of proxies armed militias across the region and of course what has been a decades long hostility between these Regional Rivals so tonight there is a palpable sense of relief in the region in capitals including London no one wants an all at War but tonight no one can say for certain and what will happen next
