Iranian State media says a suspected Israeli strike has destroyed an Iranian Embassy building in the Syrian Capital Damascus with the senior commander in the powerful Iranian revolutionary guard among those killed Israel hasn't commented on the incident these are the latest pictures we have of the scene Iranian State television is reporting the senior Commander is Resa zahedi who led the Palestinian division of the Revolutionary guard K's Force the UK based War monitor the Syrian Observatory for human rights says at least eight people have died but as yet there's no official confirmation of the figures Iran's Ambassador and his family are reportedly unharmed well let's get the latest from our correspondent in Jerusalem that's Hugo Bea uh Hugo what more are you hearing about this incident yeah Anita so this is a very significant escalation so again as you said uh Iranian and Syrian state media saying that an Israeli uh air strike targeted the Iranian Consulate in uh the Syrian Capital Damascus and our uh report suggest that the senior commander of the powerful Iranian revolutionary guards Muhammad Raa sahi was killed so very significant a high-profile member of Iran's revolutionary guards reportedly killed so uh we're hearing now these accusations we haven't had any kind of re reaction from uh Israeli authorities we know that over the last few years uh Israel has carried out attacks targeting uh positions and also members of Iran's revolutionary guards but uh it's really uh it's very rare for the Israeli authorities to acknowledge uh involvement in those assassinations so uh again very significant uh development we've seen that these targeted assassinations have been happening frequently since the beginning of the war uh between Israel and Hamas Hamas obviously is a group uh that is supported by uh Iran it is part of Iran's uh so-called axis of resistance and we are having a reaction from Iran uh already uh the Iranian authorities are saying that they're going to give a decisive response so uh again u a very significant development it seems to be a very significant escalation as well with this attack Hugo thank you very much for that Hugo Bea there let's talk now to farz Maad who is a senior fellow at the middle e Middle East Institute about this story and um forz Hugo describing this as an escalation do you see this particular uh strike as an escalation of what's been happening there's no doubt about that Anita I think some might want to sort of write this off as part of sort of the ongoing uh operations that Israel has been conducting against both Iran and some of the Iranian proxies operating out of Syria namely Hezbollah there has been senior very senior Iranian commanders killed in the past including uh one major strike in December however this is the most senior Iranian revolutionary C guard Commander to be killed to dat and I think very importantly what differentiates this is that essentially the Iranian Consulate in Damascus uh which is under international law Iranian territory has been flattened so um some major escalation here on behalf of Israel of course the Iranians have a preference to taking the war to Israel via proxies indirectly using Hamas Hezbollah Palestinian Islamic Jihad and others the Israelis here retaliating in a more direct fashion willing to risk that escalation yes and of course we're waiting for absolute confirmation that uh Muhammad resa zahi is amongst the dead but that is certainly the report that we are getting if we look at these images from the scene uh of the explosion I'm going to ask our director to to pull up those images for us um as far as we know what we're seeing here is part of the consulate but the buildings on either side appear relatively undamaged so it does seem to have been a very precise strike yes Israeli Precision uh in going after these individuals whether they be in Syria or even in Lebanon has been quite remarkable but has also been REM remarkable and and noteworthy is the fact that the Israelis have quite powerful uh operational intelligence they know where these commanders are they've went after several senior Hamas and hisbah commanders in Lebanon targeting them within meetings Target them in their own private quarters uh and so that raises quite a bit of questions and concerns in terms of operational security for Iran and for these groups in terms of Israel's ability to get to them okay farz thank you very much for your thoughts on this developing story farz Maad from the Middle East instit and let's get more now from our International editor Jeremy Bowen who is in Northern Israel Jeremy hello to you and I'd like you for our viewers to put what has happened in Damascus into uh The Wider context of what's going on in the region especially since uh the war between Hamas and Israel well essentially there's been an increasingly serious war going on uh over the Israel Lebanon B order between Israeli forces and hisb which is the political militia movement dominant one in Lebanon which is very close to Iran also very close to the Syrian regime now if it wasn't for the fact that so much has been happening in Gaza in the war since October the 7th I think there have been a lot more International attention on what's been happening here and of course there are connections that's why it's going on so what we've been hearing here uh this evening there's quite been quite a lot of activity going up towards Lebanon the Border isn't too far from here and I think what's been going on as you've been hearing this is an escalation by Israel uh I think they're testing the resolve of both Iran and its clients its allies hisbah particularly in Iran to see how they will respond because while they have been engaged this particularly in a in a in a tit fortat series of increasingly fear exchanges with Israel they've always kept it within what in this part of the world is sometimes referred to as the rules of the game hisbah going after military targets uh but Israel seems to be pushing it to move to the next level quite repeatedly and this is a big upward step so now the big question is given that the Iranians particularly are Keen to keep to restore the deterrence they feel they've been building up against their enemies in other words their enemies feeling that they can't hit Iran its people or their targets well the Israelis have said oh yes we can we're going to do this so now the question is does Iran respond how does how does it respond it may not be the way that you'd expect it may not be you know I wouldn't expect them to start sending missiles into Israel far from it might be a Cyber attack I mean this is all speculation on my part but the point is is that this really increasingly dangerous war between Iran and its allies and proxies and the Israelis has tonight taken quite a big step up and what impact Jeremy do you think that is going to have on the ground uh with regards to the situation specifically in Gaza well I think that Gaza now has its own Dynamic there that's going on I don't think that you know you can actually there have been responses elsewhere in the region because of what's been happening in Gaza I don't think it necessarily works the other way around uh you know the point is when all this started 6 months ago now October the 7th there were fears that the war would spread well the war has spread and that has been clear at the very least since the end of last year and this is another example of the way that a part of the world that is fragile and incend that has now taken another step up you know I've been doing some reporting around here today uh up near the the border with Lebanon in the town of kirit Shimona the Israeli Town talking to the mayor and the mayor says Israel should invade Lebanon because it should invade the South should take on his BAH and destroy it because in this area thousands of Israelis have not been home since October they've all been evacuated the towns are empty so you know this is something which is a continuing crisis which has every chance of getting worse Jeremy thank you very much Jeremy Bowen there for us our Middle East editor
