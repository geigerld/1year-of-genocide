US President Joe Biden's flown in and out of Israel today on a whirlwind 8 hour trip a trip that's been overshadowed by last night's blast at a hospital in Gaza Israel maintains it wasn't responsible but not everyone agrees Hamas Palestinian authorities and other Arab Nations have blamed Israel for the explosion which has triggered protests across the Middle East meanwhile Britain's foreign office is advising its citizens against all travel to Lebanon due to the risks associated with the conflict between Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories now to discuss all of this with me tonight our panel is Tom peek a political sketch writer for the independent and Amanda renia a democratic and policy strategist and former top campaign Aid to Hillary [Music] Clinton good evening the US President Joe Biden has today pledged solidarity with Israel during a world wind 8-hour visit but his trip was overshadowed by last night's blast at a hospital in Gaza which the gazan health Ministry says killed 471 people its inflamed tensions and sparked protests across the region Israel's maintained it was not responsible saying the blast was caused by a rocket misfired by the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad today President Joe Biden agreed with Israel's leader saying it appears that the blast was done by the other team but Hamas Palestinian authorities and other Arab Nations have blamed Israel for the explosion which has triggered protests across the Middle East the BBC is trying to verify the claims from both sides well after the two leaders had talks Mr Netanyahu called Mr Biden a true friend saying that he commends his deeply moving decision to visit Israel during the war well following the president's V visit Israel said it will not thwart the delivery of food water and medicine from Egypt for civilians in Gaza as long as this Aid does not reach Hamas for days people there have been fleeing their homes to escape Israeli strikes which palestinia authorities in Gaza say have killed more than 3,400 People Israel says it's targeting members of Hamas a group designated as a terror organization by the UK government all of this follows the deaths of around 1,400 people in attacks by Hamas on Southern Israel 11 days ago well let's begin this hours of coverage with this report from our International editor Jeremy Bowen on President Biden's crucial diplomatic Mission a warning that there are some graphic details in his report a car park outside the alaki hospital became a killing ground the arguments about who's responsible come too late for the people whose lives ended here even with their bodies Tak away the clean up this morning also meant collecting small pieces of civilians and Muhammad Al Safi a neighbor can't unsee children with legs blown off and the bodies he helped carry they all he said thought they'd be safe near a hospital early this morning at the defense Ministry in Tel Aviv the military presented data it said proved Israel did not attack the hospital instead they said it was a malfunctioning rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad the trajectory analysis from the barriage of rockets confirms that the Rockets were fired close proximity to the hospital according to our intelligence Hamas checked the reports understood it was an Islamic Jihad rocket that had misfired and decided to launch a global media campaign to hide what really happened they went as far as inflating the numbers of casualties coming to Tel Aviv was a gamble for President Biden he wanted to ease gaza's humanitarian catastrophe while supporting Israel's war effort perhaps an impossible Circle to square with Israel's leader Benjamin Netanyahu but a deal emerged from their meeting food water and medicine but no fuel from Egypt to Gaza for Israel more military aid and agreement that they didn't hit the hospital and based on what I've seen it appears as though it was done by the other team not not you I wanted to personally come and make that clear thank you for having me and uh I'm looking forward to having a thorough discussion about where everybody goes from here the president won't change the minds of those who insist Israel attack the hospital Joe Biden's presence here will only deepen the conviction among Palestinians and millions of other Arabs that America isn't just on Israel's side but that it's also complicit in everything Israel is doing in Gaza including killing civilians until the Hamas attacks on Israel President Biden dreamt of transforming the Middle East the Americans were negotiating with Saudi Arabia and Israel to try to get the two countries to recognize each other that is not on the agenda anymore in Arab capitals there have been protests against Israel this was Beirut and this is SAR in Yemen so far the shouting has spread but not the fighting keeping it that way will be a challenge Jeremy Bowen BBC News Israel well joining me now from Washington DC is Asher Castlebury Hernandez a former US state department senior advisor to the Bureau of NE Eastern Affairs welcome to the context Asher if you were advising President Biden you have told him to make this trip yes I would have um I think it's imperative that President Biden shows that he is committed to uh achieving Regional peace and security uh I think it's very important that he's also showing that he's in support of the security of the state of Israel as well as ensuring that um the message is um important that everybody knows this is all about uh innocent civilians and protecting innocent civilians and making sure that they receive humanitarian assistance so his leadership or his presence in the region definitely is going to resonate and it's important that he is there so clearly there's been a breakthrough we we think when it comes to getting aid from Egypt into Gaza remains to be seen whether and when that actually happens but there's certainly been a promise now from Israel on that but can the president's visit really deescalate what is by all accounts a situation that seems to be escalating by the hour his presence will be able to ensure that uh again that the state of Israel along with key Partners uh are receiving enough support uh that are receiving ensuring that that he has a good outlook of the operational environment and that he can make the best decisions as far as how to move forward with regards to peace and security so I think it it does resonate I think it you know interaction with our partners in person especially about the hostage Affairs issue is definitely going to be helpful in terms of being a game changer as we are dealing with a very complex operational security environment but the problem is there wasn't interaction in person with with other key leaders in that part of the world uh including from the Palestinian Authority other countries like Jordan um so it wasn't really the the overwhelming kind of uh consolidator visit that the president was hoping for because he only really met Israeli leaders that is true but uh but the good thing about it is that he has his secretary state along with other senior officials that are able to uh cover down with those interactions like secretary blinkin to ensure that that the humanitarian assistance uh mission is is being completed as well as that the hostage Affairs uh uh issue is also being effectively coordinated so um we know that because it's such a comp Lex uh evolving issue that you know it realistically it does it is very difficult for the president to be able to meet everyone or all the key Partners what would you say is President Biden's next step in this now uh I think it's it's it's it's uh extremely important that President Biden uh works and looks very closely at the hostage Affairs issue uh ensuring that those innocent people whether Israeli palestini as well Americans uh are are you know we're able to get them back protected provide humanitarian assistance I think that's the highest priority right now um and then work you know very closely with the Israeli Defense Force ensuring that that happens so I think the hosage Affairs uh um situation is extremely important it's the number one priority in ensuring that uh we are not detrimentally impacted or a lot more this issue does not exacerbate more in terms of especially when it comes to Americans as far as uh making sure that these Americans are returned back so definitely the priority right now I think there's concern for everyone uh no matter what their nationality do stay with us Asher let's bring in our panel Tom peek a political sketch writer for the independent and Amanda renia a democratic and policy strategist and of course a former top campaign Aid to Hillary Clinton um Amanda what do you make of the president visit it didn't go according to plan let's be blunt about it listen this is a President Who consistently in his presidency goes to the front lines looks people in the eye builds the kinds of relationships and understanding of what is happening by being there and so that has been consistent with his presidency of course this is way more complicated and I think it was even more important to be on the ground to establish those relationships to listen to what is happening he has folks on the ground that are going to stay there who have been there who can really give him the information he needs I do think as this relationship moves forward it is going to be important for President Biden to keep um Israel that relationship accountable to making sure it gets we get Aid into the ga into Gaza it's also going to be really important for him to continue to reach out to those other partners that he was not able to talk to in this time which is also exactly who he is he doesn't give up picking up the phone to build relationships and that's going to be incredibly important right now as we move forward in these next several days weeks months Tom let's bring you in we're hearing that British prime minister Rishi sunak is going to be traveling to Israel next um so there's a lot of world leaders who want to go there but what difference do you think Mr sunak is going to make well there's not really very much difference any world leader could make and rich richy sunak is not the president of the United States of America the point of this there are there are no good outcomes so when you judge whether or not someone's visit has been successful or unsuccessful it has the context has to be that there there are no good outcomes it's very hard for these things to be construed in anyway as a success the point of Israel's uh if you like Western allies going to visit them there are two purposes one is to show solidarity with a country that was a victim of an appalling appalling terrorist terrorist attack and the other purpose is to try and contain that country's Rage which which is exactly what President Biden said in the clip that you've shown to to get it to act to get it to pursue Justice ra rather than Vengeance because if they don't do that then it the risks of escalation are enormous I suspect that if you are Netanyahu who is the trying to be the voice of the average Israeli you are more answerable to that sense of visceral rage that your population are feeling than you are to a pressure put upon you by world leaders ERS to act in a measured way you just have to hope that they win but precisely the amount of influence someone like rishy sunak can wield in that situation I think it's quite minimal but there are plenty of them which there's there's Biden there's tunak um Ola Schulz has already been hasn't he you have to hope to see more of this and then slowly slowly slowly you can try and persuade Israel to respond in a more measured fashion but it won't be easy Asher we heard from President Biden warning that Israel shouldn't act with raage cautioning about what he described as mistakes which the US made after 911 what did you make about that warning shot from President Biden well uh when you look at the security environment it tells you a lot about the information flow or the information environment and the reaction and I think that was a good move of what he said because we does not want the bad reaction to subsequently happen because it makes the operational environment a lot more complex and dangerous so I think that's his commanderin-chief style of ensuring that he sends those signals or communicates effectively to everyone around the world that look there's information running around uh and this is the accuracy that uh the the verocity of what is going on and it's very important that we we react accordingly and not be too uh um uh you know reactive in terms of of inflaming uh danger to others and just destabilizing Iz in the operational environment
