myself and many others have been in discussion with the Israeli government about making sure the building materials get into Gaza I I don't think in the end that's going to be the problem actually I think that there there is a an agreement being worked out uh which I'm reasonably confident about that will allow construction material to go into Gaza rebuild the infrastructure but also for private housing um there's a whole set of other measures we want to take in order to help Gaza help his private sector for example but I think the the real question is you can reconstruct Gaza but are we going to have a um a lasting peace and make sure we don't go back into the cycle of Destruction again and that I think will also require a political framework a political Horizon and a a Palestinian politics that's unified on the basis of of Peace So I think it's these bigger political questions that are really the issue it was interesting I thought today the Egyptian president Fat Al Sissi he called for the vision of the Arab peace initiative to be considered now just for a viewer that would be full recognition of the Jew Jewish state but only if it gives up all land seized in the 1967 Middle East war and agrees to and I quote open to interpretation a just solution for Palestinian refugees what did you think of that statement by President ali um I mean I think the Arab peace initiative remains one of the most important things that's happened in the Middle East over the last couple of decades it does provide a basis for for going forward you know 67 borders with agreed land swaps is essentially the you know that's the as it were the traditional formula for the borders of a Palestinian state but I think my point really is that you know you you could probably take 90% of that conference today from the International Community from the Arab world and so on and they would have rough agreement on the parameters of a of a of an a of a deal to create a Palestinian State the the issue and the challenge is the politics both Israeli and Palestinian that at the moment aren't cohering in a way that allow us to to take that that pretty clear shared International vision and make it a reality so that's why I say I think the critical thing is really the politics so how do you then get in there and begin to try and battle the ideological political positions that are obviously so firmly entrenched right I think the first thing is if we're going to reconstruct Gaza it should be done under the authority of the Palestinian Authority president abas and their prime minister prime minister Amela and it's very important that that process of of change in Gaza is led by unified politics in other words Gaza and West Bank together so Hamas and fata which are the two Palestinian main Palestinian parties have agreed that they will have a process of reconciliation we need that to happen but we need it to happen on a basis of Peace which also takes account of Israel's security and the second thing is that we need an Israeli politics we need to have a a clear Way Forward so that when the Palestinians get into a negotiation they know there's a serious political Horizon for Statehood because otherwise they think we're just going to go and talk and talk and not come to an agreement so it's it's as I say it's the political challenge that I think is an even bigger challenge than putting the bricks and water back into Gaza which probably probably can be done
