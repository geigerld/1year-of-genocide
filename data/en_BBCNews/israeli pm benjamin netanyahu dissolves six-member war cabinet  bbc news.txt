we start with some breaking news this hour that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved the six member War cabinet it was a widely expected move that comes after the departure from government of the centus former General Benny Gant Netanyahu had faced demands from the Nationalist religious Partners in his coalition to be included in the war cabinet a move which would have intensified strains with International Partners including the United States well IDF spokes person Daniel hagari has been speaking about the decision in the past few minutes if cabinet members are being changed and the the method is be shed we we have the the ashlon and we know the chain of command we're working according to the chain of command this is a democracy we will keep on doing so and if the members of the cabinet are being changed this is the decision of this democracy of this cabinet of this prime minister and we will keep acting according to the cabinet according ing to the law according to the international law this is what the IDF does did and will do in the future Daniel hagari there well Israel's military is expected to repeat an 11-hour daytime tactical pause today extending along 12 kmers of Road into Gaza from a key Southern border crossing the announcement of the plan to allow in humanitarian supplies was criticized on Sunday by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and several far-right government minister isers operations are being halted between 8:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. every day along the road that leads from the Kem Shalom Crossing to the main Salah Alin Highway which extends north through the territory Aid agencies say they still remain concerned about Safety and Security our Middle East correspondent yolan Nell has more from Jerusalem although there's been a political storm with the Israeli military announcing this new Arrangement um they're calling a tactical pause to allow more Aid deliveries into Gaza um that Arrangement is still in place we believe it's in effect right now we've had far-right Israeli ministers who have descried this decision you've had the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu really criticizing the military saying we have a country with an army not an army with a country but there are Israeli commentators at the same time who are saying that this step would have had political approval what it's designed to do is to allow lorries to reach the Kem Shalom Crossing from the Gaza side pick up Aid and then take it at least as far as a main north to south road so it can be distributed uh inside Gaza with more safety and really that is is necessary since the uh Israeli incursion of Rafa in the very south of the Gaza Strip last month a lot of Aid has got stuck at this main entry point now with a full ceasefire in Gaza still looking a long way off the Israeli military is also now warning about a wider War being possible with the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah that follows a recent intensification and violence across the Israel Lebanon border and we're expecting a key us Diplomat Amos Hawkin to come here today to try to reduce tensions along the Israel libanon border zoland now there uh let's just take you briefly to osow where Philip lazarini um from the United Nations relief and works agency is addressing um a press conference there um about Aid we understand and that Aid getting through uh in Gaza um we will bring you the uh important lines from that um press conference as we get it we have let's just have a listen now of lawmaker trying to label the organization as being a terrorist or to try to get rid of the organization from the occupied Palestinian territories and we have also regular L demonstration which turn violent organized sometimes by elected member of the municipality of Jerusalem and will turn into Aron attack in Jerusalem as you say espan these are not just attack against un these are attacks against the UN and this is a reason why I have called member of the security Council and the member state to express outrage and to put in place the necessary measure to prevent that this become a new Norm because if we tolerate this in the occupied Palestinian territory this will be the new Norm anywhere else in the world the last point we were discussing is about the day after or the day after the ceasefire I prefer to say after the ceasefire once there is a lower intensity of military operation and we discuss indeed the top priority of trying to bring back the 600,000 girls and boys on the age of primary and second School living in the rubel being deeply traumatized back into a learning environment and the more we will wait to do this Philip lazarini there from unra um we are hearing him speak in Oslo there at a press conference um let's move on now to speak to tal Schneider uh political and diplomatic correspondent at the Times of Israel uh thanks very much for your time here on BBC News let's go back to that story that we've had break uh within the last half an hour that um Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved uh the six member War cabinet uh is that a surprise to you that that's happened no it's actually a five members War cabinet it was set up uh immediately after the beginning of the war in order to accommodate Benny guns the the the partner that you know stepped in to help during the War uh it was you know a special arrangement for this what they called emergency government uh it became less effective with time and that was one of the reason benig Gans stepped out uh Benny Gans is not the opposition leader but he's leading in all polls to be prime minister if uh there will be elections so once he was out he is a former Chief IDF also once he was out um one of netanyahu's Partners the ex very extreme right-wing itamar bangir said I want to be part of this war cabinet and n doesn't want him in those you know very close uh close meetings uh and for that reason I think he he broke up the war cabinet in order not to include benir in there but we have to say Israel has um you know a cabinet a security cabinet so this was like an extra you know very near a war cabinet and now authorities or or decision making will go back to the just regular uh security cabinet okay so does that mean will have implications for um strategy in the war going ahead it well with the stepping out of Benny gun I think itar benir and another extreme partner batala smri both of them have more leverage on the Prime Minister as it is in the government or in the cabinet so they have they can use their you know they can threaten to to dissolve you know the government at any any minute they could have done this also before but they had less power they were diluted with benig Gans inside now they have more um power over the Prime Minister and we we have learned through those you know very difficult months that those two uh are very uh influential on Net's decision making so this is you know the the bad you know the disappointing side of this very extreme government what will this mean in terms of diplomatic relations do you think will particularly the US will will will there be any implications um with disbanding the the war cabinet um for relations with Israel going forward so for example those two extreme ministers are you know they are four uh more uh settlements there are for you know they oppose any type of of agreement with the terror organization the Hamas uh when you have to approve uh an agreement with a terror organization and release uh convict murderers that are sitting in Israeli jails when you have to do that you need to have a vote in the government those two are you know they they say it out loud they just they will not just vote against it they will also dissolve the government uh having said that I think n still have a majority in his own government to move forward a deal such as that you know the expectation of the Israel public is for a deal there is you know huge majority in the polls for a hostages release deal that will also include releasing uh convicted murderers terrorists I mean um so and maybe end of War so there is huge majority in Israel public for that and I think Netanyahu still have the majority in his own government to do that he just knows from those two extreme types that his government this is the end the political end of his extreme government if if they will you know they will participate in the vote of course T Schneider in Tel Aviv we appreciate your time here on BBC KNE
