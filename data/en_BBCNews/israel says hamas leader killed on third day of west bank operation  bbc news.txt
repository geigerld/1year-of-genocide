now the Israeli military says a senior local Hamas Commander was amongst three Palestinians killed on the third day of a major Israeli operation in the occupied West Bank eyewitnesses say Israeli undercover forces attempted to detain a man in a village near Janine when they tried to flee their car was struck by an Israeli drone Israeli forces are now thought to have withdrawn from the city of taram where five Palestinians were killed on Thursday well I'm joined by Sharon husk a member of the Israeli Parliament the nesset for the national un party thank you very much for being with us today um do you support the government's operation in the West Bank because you will have seen leaders from the UN from other countries have have expressed concern at the escalation in the region well the IDF is protecting and defending our children our citizens these operations are operation to eliminate Terror cells violent cells of Hamas today uh that was one of the heads the terror cells of Hamas in Janine that was eliminated the two that were with him were actually from the Islamic Jihad and from the fat which is tied to the Palestinian Authority it means that ever since I think it was two days ago when khed mash who is a senior Hamas leader who called up for everybody in Hamas in Judea in Samaria the West Bank to go out on and and act and and and commit acts of terrorism of murder of suicide attacks suicide bombings so right now we are on the guard and are trying to eliminate that threat for our communities for our children can I just put to you a statement from from the British foreign office which says the UK is deeply concerned by the ongoing IDF military operation in the occupied West Bank we recognize Israel's need to defend itself against security threats but we're deeply worried by the methods Israel's employed by reports of Civilian casualties and the D ruction of Civilian infrastructure now the UK is obviously a long-standing Ally and and political supporter of Israel but you know the British government is expressing its concerns today so look here in Israel we are fighting a multi-front war against Iran Iran is sending its tentacles from all around from Lebanon from Yemen from Iraq from Syria and is trying to ignite this violence from within as well including Judea and Samaria we expect our allies our friend to stand beside us when we are actually fighting on our survival this is our second Independence war and you know that if Hamas wouldn't have opened this murderous most violent attack that Israel's has actually everever uh uh uh um ever experienced this would have never happened before we didn't want this war this is this is happening at the same time um that that many International uh players are trying to help a resolution a peaceful resolution and the concern is that even with those security concerns that Israel obviously has that this escalation is is going to further ignite those tensions and not yield not lead not help lead to a peaceful resolution which is presumably what everybody wants Israel once uh the hostages returned absolutely gaita I mean don't forget a ceas fire will be possible when all of our hostages are back we have more than a hundred brothers and sisters and parents and babies and grandparents who are being held in the dungeons of torture of Kamas being abused being sexually abused being starved uh we have released one of the prisoners a Muslim Israeli uh uh hostage that Kamas kept for 10 months he returned 25 kilos less he said there was no food they were abusing him I mean any other country would have never stopped looking for their family members for their Community for 100 hostages and will not stop until they will be returned I I mean this is what any country would have done and this is what we are doing here in Israel and obviously I'm so sorry if if you don't mind we'll have to leave it there but um thank you very much indeed for being with us and uh we do appreciate your time today thank you thank you very much
