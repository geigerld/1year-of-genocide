right we're going to look now at UK US diplomacy because foreign secretary David Cameron is the latest European leader to make the trip to Washington just a few hours ago he met US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin here talks focused on well the two major conflicts bringing stability to the Middle East and the war in Ukraine now Republican lawmakers have been holding up a proposed 60 billion dollar military aid package for Ukraine for months Republican house Speaker Mike Johnson has n let the Ukraine Aid issue be debated in the House of Representatives as yet now Lord Cameron said it wasn't for foreign politicians to tell uh lawmakers In Another Country what to do but he urged Congress to see the funding released I think it is absolutely interests of US security uh that Putin fails in his illegal Invasion I think it's good for us jobs uh that we continue to back uh Ukraine with the weapons that they need and I think in terms of how the United States the United Kingdom as allies are seen around the world um there will be people in Teran in pongyang in Beijing looking at how we stand by our allies how we help them how we stop this uh illegal and unprovoked aggression and working out whether we are committed whether we're prepared to see it through and Mr blinkin said they' also talked about ways to prevent the transfer of weapons to Russia particularly from China and North Korea this is an ongoing challenge uh and we see um weapons U we also see Technologies to support the defense industrial base in uh Russia coming from North Korea from Iran from China this is an area of particular concern for not only the United States and the United Kingdom but many of our allies and partners throughout Europe let's speak now to our state department correspondent Tom baitman hi Tom so what should we take away from that pressure conference well the most significant bit of news was an answer to M that Lord Cameron gave to a question I asked him in the Press briefing there which was about the growing pressure on the UK government to Halt armed sales to Israel around the issue of whether or not Israel had been deemed by the UK to be in breach of international humanitarian law in Gaza now um Lord Cameron had said on the 8th of March that he would receive legal advice within days about that issue but here we are a month later and there had still been no announcement so I asked him that question what um did the UK government deem um Israel to have done when it came to International humanitarian law and he confirmed in his answer that the UK would continue to supply weapons to Israel and therefore that a review had taken place and my understanding is these are fairly broad not just legal reviews but also policy-based reviews and under that uh the UK would continue to um uh sell uh what is around a 35 million pound a year uh trade in weapons to the Israelis but he also said that they continue to have concerns about the issue and they would continue to review it um so that was there too but that was a significant uh moment in that news briefing there okay Tom thank you very much for that going to take a look now at the issue of ukra ukine we can speak to a global Affairs analyst and Senior fellow at the Atlantic Council Michael bosu who's in Odessa in Ukraine thank you very much for coming on the program my pleasure good to be with you so let's talk about this issue of politicians going from one country to another saying well we can't tell you what to do but you really ought to do this basically Lord Cameron today in Washington urging well expressing his support for Ukraine and urging the us to do the same how do you find that balance that diplomatic balance well it was very entertaining I think Lord Cameron was being very tight lipped about his trip to Florida but I am quite sure I would bet money on it that he told Mr Trump exactly what's going to happen if that 60 billion dollar in Aid which is being blocked by his mother Republicans will not reach Ukraine and I noticed that both um ministers made the point that a lot of this money that is your mark for Ukraine is not going to be loaded on to pallets and you know airlifted to Ukraine it's actually going to stay in the United States and create jobs that's a message that the American public needs to hear but um the other quick thing that came out is I noticed uh Lord Cameron was almost ahead of his count us counterpart Mr blink in terms of his conviction in terms of his passion in terms of the arguments made for Aid to Ukraine it's almost as if the Americans were a bit hedgy about it but Lord Cameron really his message really came through that if this war is not stopped if this Aid is not delivered Putin will go further and it will become a lot more cost C for everybody and the potential hesitancy yes there's diplomatic politics at play there's Party politics at play is it simple geography as well country is far away seen as a far away problem oh yeah absolutely uh the message I got out of today more clearly than ever is that it it is now the United Kingdom and Europe that are going to take the lead on the so-called ukra file in terms of helping Ukraine for example booler their domestic production of ammunition but um the other thing that came through is I think Lord Cameron rightly tiptoed through everything because it is a very complicated Diplomat sorry political scene in the United States right now where the man who has basic control over this vote speaker Johnson I think he does support Ukraine I think he does have the votes to make that bill pass I think he knows that uh the US public support this but he's prioritizing his own political future over everything else that he wants to remain important in that Trump wing of the Republican party and what's going to happen there if he continues along this path I think people will see him as a man who could not summon the DI the political courage to do the right thing and hence this war will continue to go on for a lot longer than it has to and what do you think the implications would be for Ukraine if Trump won the presidency well absolutely horrible he views himself as the master of the art of the deal he will try to bring it to resolution in 24 hours uh leaked reports from closed door conversations he's had indicate what most of us believe is that he'll give into territorial concessions Crimea will remain in Russian hands uh the donbas other areas that Russia has seized including that crucial land bridge between the Russian Mainland and um and the western part of Ukraine and uh he'll probably um give the signals to Mr Putin that he can go even further I mean there's a lot of nervousness I have to tell you right here in Odessa we've had alarms air rate alarms uh most of the day and night and missiles coming this way it's it's not going the right way whatsoever well I just want to just very briefly just expand on exactly that because I wanted to highlight that that is exactly where you are and ask a bit about what life is like and how it is going right now a couple of things I mean I'm very close to to the port and these strikes tend to uh Target electrical infrastructure if there's no power there's no Port uh at working and there's no grain going to World Markets uh the other thing on the other side of the country in khu it's really hell on Earth um being bombed relentlessly it does look like the Russians are on an L campaign to turn it into a a piece of rubble of gry Zone and possibly even encircle it uh so very very bad news coming out of hard tonight as well Michael bosu we really appreciate your time thank you
