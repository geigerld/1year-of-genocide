three sons and four grandchildren of the political leader of Hamas have been killed in an Israeli air strike on their car in Gaza ishmail hania who lives in Exile in Kata has been actively involved in negotiations to broker a ceasefire with Israel in return for some of the more than 100 hostages still being held by Hamas he now says the killing of members of his family will not change demands for a permanent end to the fighting and the return of displaced Palestinians to their homes Israel has confirmed the strike describing the brothers as Hamas military operatives Jeremy Bowen has the very latest from Jerusalem three missiles hid the car in the shatty refugee camp in Gaza City is hania's three sons and three grandchildren were killed along with their driver Witnesses told local journalists that they were visiting bereaved families the Israelis said they attacked to stop the men committing an act of Terror the Dead Man's father is the senior Hamas political leader deeply involved in ceasefire talks isil hania was in Kat when he was told his sons were dead their blood he said was no more precious than that of any Palestinian and Hamas would not change its position on a ceasefire killing members of Isel hania's family might strengthen suspicions that Israel's prime minister does not want a ceasefire deal with Hamas and will buy Time by sabotaging the talks for Muslims this day is supposed to be joyful it is ID Al F the celebration at the end of Ramadan even in Gaza this is Rafa where life was always hard Eid was a respite this year graveyard visits instead of presents sweet treats and new clothes for the children ummed is at her son Ham's grave one of more than 33,000 pales Ians killed by Israel I'm asking God to take revenge on Israel and America may they suffer too oh God have their children killed and their wives widowed they destroyed our house we live on the street Gaza is drowning in destruction darkness and Damnation benuron University about 25 mi from Gaza looks tranquil but more than 100 St students and staff from here were killed or taken hostage on the 7th of October 6 and a half thousand students were mobilized among them three young men just back from Gaza after months in combat tell me what the impact of the 7th of October was on you I think everybody here is related somehow to what happened everybody feel everybody knows someone that was kidnapped that was killed it's it's all all around the country I mean you saw Palestinian civilian inside Gaza and they've been going through hell what was going through your mind I think many of them aren't innocent and I think it will be really hard to find those that are Innocent but it doesn't mean I think everyone should uh get hurt and what's the future going to be with the Palestinians next door I think that if You' have asked me this question on October 6th then I would say definitely yes I would uh just do a Palestinian State let them live over the there we'll live over here and we'll all coexist and everything will be nice but after October 7th it seems clear to me that that they don't want it as much as I wanted it of course I prefer to be here in the university to study to go and drink my coffee instead of go going fighting a war like it's not fun going to to fight in a war but sometimes it's necessary and in this situation it's necessary I mean it's it's a two-way street sort of what you like your question I mean it like it feels kind of Israel's responsibility to not radicalize gazans but where is gaza's responsibility to towards us you know I mean this if we ever want to coexist if we want a two-state solution we need responsibility on both sides we need accountability at the North End of Gaza the fences that did not stop Hamas have been repaired last week after International anger about the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza Israel promised to open this Crossing Aras to allow Aid directly into the north which faces famine it is still shut prime minister Netanyahu is under a lot of pressure at the moment from the Americans who want to cease fire and for him to open the gates of Gaza to unlimited amounts of humanitarian aid from the hostage families who want to deal with Hamas to get their people back and from the ultra nationalists in his own Coalition who've said that if that offensive intera doesn't go ahead then they will bring down his government North Gaza gripped by hunger and disease is on the other side of the wall when The Siege was imposed the Israeli defense minister said they were fighting Human animals 6 months on Israel's allies say it's 1200 dead on the 7th of October did not give it license to kill and destroy so much prospects for those ceasefire talks are not looking good at the moment not just because of the attack on isia's family it's also because the two sides are way apart Hamas has their position essentially saying in return for the hostages Israel has to eventually fully pull out of Gaza Israel meanwhile wants to do that military operation in Rafa which the Americans are against now a couple of days ago I was wondering whether it's clearly not the end of the war but maybe the beginning of the end game I don't think that is the case I think now that it's clear that there's a lot more to go in in Gaza but more than that in the wider Middle East war between Israel and Iran and its friends that could escalate too Israel tonight is on high alert because of warnings relayed as well by the Americans of an Iranian strike of some sort on Israel and that would be in retaliation for the assassination that Israel uh mounted in Damascus last week of a senior Iranian General and other senior officers at their diplomatic compound in the Syrian Capital so I'm afraid to say again that the war in Gaza no chance of it ending soon I'd say and The Wider war in the Middle East the sad and sorry uh steady escalation perhaps to something worse yes
