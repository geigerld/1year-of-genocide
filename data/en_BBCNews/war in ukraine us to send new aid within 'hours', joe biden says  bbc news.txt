President Biden has said that the US will begin sending new military assistance to Ukraine within hours after he signed a long-awaited bill passed by Congress speaking at a press conference at the White House Mr Biden said that the aid worth $61 billion would make America and the world safer he said Ukraine had the will and skill to win the war against Russia the package also includes billions of dollars in aid for Israel and Taiwan as well as $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to Gaza it's a good day for America it's a good day for Europe and it's a good day for world peace for real this is consequential I just signed in the law the National Security package that was passed by the House of Representatives this weekend and by the Senate yesterday it's going to make America safer it's going to make the world safer and it continues America's leadership in the world and everyone knows it gives vital support to America's partners and they so they can defend themselves against threats to their sovereign and to the lives and freedom of their citizens and it's an investment in our own security because when our allies are stronger and I want to make this perent again and again when our allies are stronger we are stronger I'm grateful all grateful all those in Congress Democrats Republicans Independents who voted for this bill well our North America correspondent will grant joins us now from Washington it's been a long time coming this uh Ukraine has been waiting for it for a long time in particular um just to talk us through through how how this is going to work he's saying that some of the aid will be arriving in Ukraine within days yeah it has been a long time coming and Mr Biden acknowledged that he said it' been a difficult path to his desk and that it should have got there sooner um but obviously he was also uh very thankful to the members of Congress and the Senate who made it possible um I think the fact is that um this has been a torturous process to get to this point um but the aid is sort of there and Good To Go part of it is anyway the military aid will start rolling out almost immediately particularly in terms of armored vehicles Munitions uh and so on that the Pentagon has essentially waiting to one side but obviously run out of funds uh that were allocated by Congress to do so so we will start seeing that roll out in the coming hours um and of course President Biden as you heard In that clip there his core message is that this is good for the United States of course that is part of the sale that he's making to the American people because this has been such a divisive issue all the way through but uh it it it was also pointed out that a lot of the Munitions that will be built and will be sent to Ukraine will be made in the United States um so that it will benefit the economy here too we should just mention the the other aspects of the bill he talked about the vital support uh for Israel and he talked about that Ironclad commitment to helping Israel defend itself against Iran and and those its supports and also he he talked about this 1 billion in Aid going to Gaza and called on Israel um to make sure that Palestinians uh get that uh he was very clear about that wasn't he about that need to be for it to be facilitated he was now of course his critics will say that you know that the waiting is clearly in favor of what he called that Ironclad commitment this is about the 26 billion dollar of uh Aid to Israel uh and much less about for example the aid going to Gaza or other humanit Ian support around the world he mentioned Haiti as well for example um but he does make that commitment to to Israel clear mentioning of course the Drone attacks earlier this month and missile attacks from Iran and putting it into that context so I think that much was again underlined um but you're right I think the humanitarian assistance is important for him particularly to the left wing of his party to make sure that that billion dollars was made clear uh and the urging of Israel to make make it possible for that a to to to get into Gaza um that was noteworthy too in his speech so yeah um touching on all of the difficulties uh within this bill the some of the hardest issues on his desk at the moment I would say okay thank you very much will grant for us there in Washington
