and we can bring you breaking news as the Rafa Crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip has just opened as you can see the first trucks loaded with food water and medicines desperately needed by civilians inside Gaza are able to start Crossing it's unclear how long that Crossing will remain open Israel had agreed to let the first 20 trucks through uh but all sides have imposed conditions on those deliveries Israel sealed its borders with Gaza so that means the rougher Crossing between Egypt and Gaza is the only way right now to let in vital aid supplies one other big question is whether foreign passport holders and duel Nationals at least 600 of whom are American according to the US state department may be allowed out through that Crossing Tamara arfi from anra from the United Nations organization gave us this update from her team on the ground in Gaza very tragic 17 of my un colleagues were killed in the last two weeks I would like to remind that unra has 13,000 staff in Gaza most of them almost all of them minus a few are themselves gazans from Gaza they for most are Sheltering in unra schools and unra shelters and where they are they are doing all they can so for instance we have Mobile Medical Teams doing the rounds in about 90 shelters in the middle and South regions of Gaza also bread has continued to arrive to different shelters thanks to cooperation with the world food program but as Gaza is running out of clean water people have been drinking water that is not fit for human consumption and this also causes a huge risk for our ability and the wfp's ability and the bakery's ability to continue making bread if there is no clean water our call has been very clear clean water has to go into Gaza fuel must go into Gaza to be able to nourish the water desalination plants of unra and UNICEF so that we and civilians have access to clean drinking water basic medical supplies we're talking about paracetamol antibiotics and Insulin have to go in this is why when we speak about the Convoy getting ready to go into Gaza our call is that this should not be a one-off as welcome as it is it should be a continuous unimpeded and safe access of Aid convoys and Personnel into the entire strip North middle and South not just the South and that was Tamara alfi from the United Nations organization anra uh the key Aid agency uh on the ground inside the Gaza Strip talking about the need for Aid uh as we've been saying already in the last hour the border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip has opened to allow the first trucks of much needed uh Aid allowed in the practicalities of which we will hopefully be finding out as we go along there's been a tweet in the last moments from the UK foreign secretary James cleverly who's been uh moving around the region in recent days he says uh on the subject of the trucks going into the Gaza Strip This Aid is a Lifeline he says for those who are suffering but it cannot be a oneoff the UK continues to push for humanitarian access uh to Gaza and we will be bringing you up to date of course uh this morning with those a trucks going in
