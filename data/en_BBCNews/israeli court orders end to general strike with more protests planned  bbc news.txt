flights have been delayed some doctors have stopped work and schools and businesses across Israel have been hit by a nationwide strike and protests people are demanding that the government secure the return of hostages still held by Hamas the one-day strike was called by the Trade union Federation histadrut a court ordered the strike must end around half an hour ago with organizers saying workers had been ordered back to work these latest protests began after the bodies of six hostages were found in a tunnel beneath Rafa in southern Gaza the Israel Defense Forces say they were killed shortly before troops reached them on Saturday one of those found was American Israeli hsh Goldberg pollen in Jerusalem where people are holding a procession from his home to the cemetery where he will be buried uh we are seeing evidence of the outpouring of uh feeling that the government must do something to secure the release of other hostages well the impact of strikes uh aren't yet isn't yet fully clear uh as we mentioned flights have been delayed and diverted at Israel's main airport benor and as part of that action but several cities and municipalities said they wouldn't take part and the government said the strike was political uh it is affecting businesses Banks and government Ministries and some elementary and middle schools closed earlier uh closed early while hospitals and health clinics are running at a reduced capacity major bus companies are also taking part in action with roads blocked by protesters Sunday night saw tens of thousands of people protesting across Israel calling for a hostage release deal some accus prime Min Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government of not doing enough to bring home those taken by Hamas it's not clear how many hostages remain in Gaza Hamas kidnapped 251 people and killed 1,00 others during its attack on October the 7th the Israeli military responded with a ground and air offensive aiming to destroy Hamas more than 40,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then according to the Hamas run Health Ministry well let's speak now to our Middle East bureau chief Joe floto who joins me from Jerusalem and Joe I just wonder with the uh labor Court ruling supposed to have taken effect a short time ago ordering people uh to stop their strike action what's actually happening on the streets look I think it's fair to say that this strike while it was widespread and uh affected pretty well every municipality in the country was not as devastating as those protesters really wanted last night was undoubtedly a massive show of grief and anger directed at the government for not having concluded a deal and one of the biggest protests ever to take place in this country I think uh but this morning we haven't seen that momentum continue to the agree that people would have wanted and as such there's a question about how much political pressure that is going to put be putting on the government yeah that is a key key question isn't it Joe how much pressure does it put on will it lead to some sort of change in in in policy but I do see here that the hostages and missing families Forum has announced several more protests to take place across Israel later on today yeah they're determined to keep this going and they're angry as we saw last night is palpable obviously uh the first degree of shock and and condemnation goes to Hamas that's a given for having uh murdered the hostages under its care but many people not all but many people in this country feel that after nearly 11 months of this conflict the government should have done more to have concluded a deal now the Prime Minister here says very clearly the fact that these hostages were killed shows that Hamas doesn't want to deal and he is determined to continue to what he calls total Victory but several people within his own Administration some of the hostage negotiators who've been speaking anonymously and other people within his office say that he himself uh is trying to block a deal that would leave Hamas in any way intact and because of that we're still 11 months into this conflict without a hostage negotiation and without the hundred or so who remain inside G are both alive and dead on the Israeli side being released Joe thank you very much for that Joe floto and udie gorin is the cousin of tal hamay who was killed on the 7th of October and his body taken by Hamas Mr Goran gave me his reaction to the protests and strike as far as we're concerned we the labor the labor Court can decide whether we protest or whether we strike or not I think it it really does um uphold only to the unions and so forth um and other businesses that choose to abide by the court but I think at this point in time when there is a true very strong sentiment and I think noga has put it very well there's a very strong sentiment among the Israeli public that this government does not represent the vast majority of the public in its decision not to have um not to have a deal that would bring the hostage is back then at this point I think we are allowed to to do what we think is right in order to do what is right and that is saving people's lives and udy you're joining us straight from those protests give our viewers a sense of what it feels like to be in the midst of that today I'm actually joining you right now from the knesset from the Israeli Parliament where we hostage families come every week to speak in the different committees and speak to the parliament members directly and try to you know break some of these um alliances that noga has describe and influence the the the ministers and the Parliament members this way and later on there will be uh first of all there's another funeral today we've had six funerals in the past two days of the hostages that were just murdered three days ago and uh from the from the funeral I'll be going to another protest later tonight in front of the Prime Minister in home obviously we have reported on many many protests by relatives of the hostages and and the bereaved indeed uh it hasn't caused the government so far to change its Position will the action today change that do you think I don't think there's one specific action that would change their mind I think that the main thing is persistence and that is true to any public campaign it's persistence it's believing in what's right it's believing in what we're doing and I think that after 11 months of uh of this war which is the longest Israel has ever had and at this point where we know where the divides are between Israel and Hamas in terms of the deal and we know that these gaps can be bridged then we need to be saying this over and over again and when I say we it's not just the families we is the Israeli public we is the foreign governments that have to do with this conflict that have influence over the Israeli government that have influence over Kamas we should all be saying enough is enough we need to end this war we need to save people's lives we need to bring the hostages back and bring some alleviation to the Gans and make sure that we have an agreement that secures Israel's future and make sure that that October 7th does not happen all over again and that has to do with a regional uh with a regional deal that would keep Israel safe and on the other hand that we start building Gaza because the gazans are also suffering tremendously at this point in time and the fates of these two people have been linked for ages now and it's more obvious than ever at this point in time UD
