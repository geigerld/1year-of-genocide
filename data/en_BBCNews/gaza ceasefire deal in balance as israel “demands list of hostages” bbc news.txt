representatives of Hamas the US and Qatar are in Egypt as part of attempts to agree a six- we ceasefire in Gaza but Israel is pushing for a list of hostages still alive in Gaza before it'll send a delegation to the talks Hamas says Israel must withdraw its forces before there can be a deal on hostages pressure for a truce has intensified since Thursday when at least 112 people were killed as crowds rushed towards an aid Convoy in the north of the territory amid Israeli Army gunfire overnight another Israeli strike on Rafa in the South killed 20 people including twin babies according to health officials and gaza's civil defense our senior International correspondent Olan reports from Tel Aviv you may find some of the images in her report upsetting a truce can't come soon enough in Rafa another day of harrowing loss Palestinians mourn for 20 members of the Abu Ana family killed in their beds by an Israeli air strike according to hospital officials and gaza's civil defense among the dead femon old twins as old as the war Naim and wisam laid down gently with their relatives their mother Ria spent 10 years trying to have them and ured three rounds of IVF now all she can cradle is their baby clothes I gave birth during the war she says it started on Saturday I gave birth the next Friday well I didn't get enough of them I swear I didn't get enough I have no one else she says they've gone with their father we were sleeping I swear Israel continues to say it takes feasible precautions to lessen civilian harm there were about 35 people in the house says faruko Abu Anza most of them children there were no Fighters the house collapsed on them three or four stories in Israel too families in anguish their loved ones trapped in tunnels in Gaza they need to be released now this weekend and they've been pleading with their government to do a deal to bring the hostages back home toer is a very warm person you can see his smile he a family person he has four children lovely children how hard is this time for the families this this wait must seem endless it's like a hell you know we are in some of a loop since the October 7th H we are living this day every day again and again we have only one goal all these days to bring him back alive to his family to his children H this is the only thing that's matter but there will be no homecoming for offer or any of the hostages without a ceasefire and no rest bite for mothers like Rania burying their children in Gaza I think it'll be several days before we know if there will be a deal or not Israel is insisting on a list of the hostages who remain alive Hamas is insisting it can't provide that information while the war continues and says anyway it's not holding all of the hostages both sides are clearly still trying to drive the hardest bargain that they can but it's also very clear that there is immense intern National pressure growing pressure because there are 30,000 Palestinians who have been killed and there are increasing fears about starvation in Gaza and here in Israel hostage families have been telling us that if the government does not agree a truce it amounts to giving a death sentence to their loved ones so there are reasons for both sides to want to do a deal that said there's no guarantee that we will actually get one
