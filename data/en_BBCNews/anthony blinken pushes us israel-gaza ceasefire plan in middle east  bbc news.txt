now America's top Diplomat Anthony blinkin is in Israel as part of a three-day tour of the Middle East in an effort to boost support for a ceasefire in Gaza it's the US Secretary of State's eighth trip to the region since the war between Israel and Hamas began last October the visit comes as the United States asked the UN Security Council to vote on a draft resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas it's also calling for the release of the hostages still held by the group earlier Mr blink told reporters in Cairo that Egypt has been speaking with Hamas as recently as today the only party that has not accepted the only party that's not say yes is Hamas that's who everyone's waiting on that's who the Palestinians in Gaza are waiting on it's who the Israelis are waiting on it's who the hostages and the hostage families are waiting on does Hamas want to end this conflict end uh this war that it started or not we'll find out but it's clear that virtually the entire world has come together in support of the proposal and the only open question is will Hamas say yes well Mr blinken's visit comes as the Director of the UN world food program says her organization has paused distribution of humanitarian Aid into Gaza via a US built Pier citing safety concerns Cindy McCain said that following Israel's military operation on Saturday to rescue full hostages two wfp warehouses in Gaza were hit by rockets and a member of staff injured gaza's Health Ministry says more than 270 Palestinians were killed in the operation Mr blinken's visit also comes amid growing turmoil inside Israel with the resignation of Benny gance one of the most senior members of the Israeli War cabinet which was set up after the Hamas attack last October he had threatened to stand down unless he felt there was a post-war plan for Gaza with a deadline set of yesterday Mr Gant told reporters he wasn't satisfied this is the moment he confirmed he was standing down unfortunately netan is preventing us from approaching true Victory which is the justification for the painful ongoing price and this is why we quit the national Unity government today with a heavy heart yet we feel that it is the right decision the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called on Mr gance to stay in the war cabinet he posted this message on X Israel is in an ex exential war on multiple fronts at Benny this is not the time to abandon the campaign this is the time to join forces we can speak now to Benham Ben tblu who is a senior fellow at the foundation for defense of democracy uh in Washington hello to you um as I was just saying it's a very interesting time isn't it in terms of the political situation uh in Israel with B gans's departure and I suppose what does this mean for for Benjamin Netanyahu and is you know is he going to be uh even more influenced I suppose by the right well it's a pleasure to be with you right now it's very much an open question the resignation of of Benny yens as you know was really foreshadowed or telegraphed with the warnings he had issued ever since there was a Unity government in the aftermath of the October 7 terror attack uh but in general uh this did seem to be a matter of when and not uh if uh based on the way uh the war at home in Israel uh was going between different factions that had constituted that Unity government the heart of your question right now uh it is very much uh an open question as to will BB the current prime minister be more beholden uh to that hard right an ultra Orthodox faction uh to make up the seats uh with the loss of Gans and Eisen cat or will he try to move to the center or center right I mean we're just um hearing from Anthony blinkin there saying that the only party who's not said yes to this cisa um deal is Hamas but we are also hearing from our correspondent earlier Hugo was saying that there are members of the of the cabinet who are saying that they they would not um be supportive they would resign if he was to say yes uh to this ceasefire deal we'll have to really wait and see and test that out I don't think the us would have embarked prematurely on its eighth trip in the region and now pushing to move a political understanding or agreement into the text of the UN Security Council Revolution if the agreement did not have some kind of ta support or ability of Netanyahu to at least deliver let alone other factions but you did mention the secretary and his trip uh and it's worth noting at least based on what's reported uh that he will be visiting not just with the cabinet but also with those ministers who had resigned or those former ministers who had resigned yeah that is interesting isn't it and bny gance was calling for Netanyahu to set a date for election is there any chance of that uh in my view it's still very unclear very fragile but very fast moving okay um it's well it's certainly a very interesting time isn't it in terms of of what could be achieved I suppose um in terms of the US and its ability to put even more pressure on there is still a long way that it could go isn't it do you expect to see the US get any stronger in terms of it putting pressure on I think right now it's anyone's guess I would wait to see how a lot of the Arab capitals react uh both to the messaging in the leadup to Blink script uh you know the the point about Hamas being the only one to not agree to the to the ceasefire proposal or the ceasefire resolution idea uh was echoed before blinkin W on his script by National Security adviser Jake Sullivan as well as many other White House officials who had actually left uh Washington for France for uh commemorations yeah okay well thanks very much for talking to us B and Ben tbu a senior fellow at the foundation for defense of democracy in Washington thank you for joining us just seeing a a bit of a readout from the meeting between blinken and prime minister Netanyahu saying he reiterated that the proposal on the table would unlock the possibility of calm along Israel's northern border and further integration within the region
