Syria says at least 16 people have been killed and what it says were a series of Israeli air strikes State media say five sites were targeted including scientific research centers monitoring organizations say that one of the sites in the city of msaf was housing pro-iranian weapons experts our Middle East correspondent Huga MAA has the latest there has been a sharp increase uh in the number of Israeli attacks targeting locations inside Syria since the beginning of the war in Gaza almost a year ago and many of those locations are weapons and ammunitions depos also facilities being used by uh Iran and uh Iranian supported proxies uh such as Hezbollah here in Lebanon which is the main group in this Alliance of of factions across the Middle East supported by Iran the so-called axes of resistance so obviously one of the main goals here in this campaign is to try to disrupt uh this uh infrastructure that has been set up uh to supply these groups with weapons but still what happened yesterday was one of the most intense uh attack so far Reports say that one of those locations hit was a research center uh in the city of masiaf uh in the uh hamama province in Syria believe to uh house Iranian military experts now there has been some strong reaction from Iran uh the Iranian foreign Ministry rejected those reports suggesting that these were Iranian facilities or facilities being used by Iran uh it said these were Iranian uh these were Syrian uh sites uh and they also describ these attacks as as a criminal act by Israel now as you said there wasn't any reaction from uh Israel Israel uh rarely reacts to these reports of strikes inside uh Syria but again I think this shows you know how tense these relations between Israel and Iran uh has Spain uh remember that back in April the Iranian diplomatic compound in the Syrian Capital Damascus was hit a number of senior Iranian military officers were killed Iran then retaliated with an unprecedented missile and drone attack on Israel and most recently in July the Hamas political Chief isma was assassinated in tan again the Israeli military was believed to have been behind this uh killing uh which was humiliating security bridge by uh for the Iranians and Iran has vowed to retaliate to respond to that assassination this hasn't happened yet but again it shows uh that these tensions between Iran and uh Israel have been extremely high in recent months
