Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is willing to send a delegation to discuss the latest ceasefire proposals over the war in Gaza Hamas leaders tonight said they accept the plans brokered by Egypt and katar which is believed could involve the exchange of Palestinian prisoners for 33 Israeli hostages held since the October the 7th attacks a ceasefire would be welcome resite for many tens of thousands of Palestinians Sheltering in southern Gaza and would be the first pause in the seven-month War since a week-long truce back in November but Israel has been making plans for a full-scale attack on the southern city of Rafa and tonight continued to bomb the area a 100,000 refugees have been told to move to what Israel is calling an expanded humanitarian Zone near Khan Yunis but gazans say the area is already overcrowded fergal Keen has more details they haven't had reason to dance for a long time [Applause] but they haven't forgotten how even amid uncertainty about Israel's position Hope Springs across Gaza BBC journalists captured the reaction of those convinced perhaps prematurely that a ceasefire will happen the feeling is Indescribable we're so happy we're going back to our home in Gaza City we are refugees from the north and we fled here this young man says we're so happy there's a ceasefire Israelis are still absorbing the news it came late on one of this society's most important days when across the country Sirens bring the nation to a halt in memory of the dead of the Holocaust a day of reflection in a country traumatized by the Hamas attack last October tonight on the streets of Tel Aviv those who believe healing that trauma can begin with a ceasefire deal and the release of Israel's hostages we expect from the Israeli government to take this de to save all the remaining hostages who are still alive but after 7 months of a war in which Israel's Army pledged to destroy Hamas a ceasefire deal that fails to accomplish that risks breaking Israel's wartime coalition government Israel will send negotiators to talks but won't stop fighting yet we examine every proposal very seriously and we review every possibility on the issue of negotiations and the return of the hostages to their homes as quickly as possible and as a central task at the same time we carry on with our operations in the Gaza Strip and will continue to do so this morning the people of Eastern Rafa woke to leaflets telling them to evacuate many have been displaced before but still they were told to leave everyone no matter how old how young or how vulnerable to al- mawasi Israel says and other desolate places Beyond Rafa the so-called humanitarian zones were to be expanded but they've never been safe from sickness hunger or [Music] War this is the aftermath of raids on Rafa last night people hope these may have been some of the last air strikes if the ceasefire can be made to work news of the Hamas announcement was still hours Refugee for 7 months this has been the daily reality hany ashtar an orphan grieved by his relative ree his family was killed during the war she says even he was killed so many here are grieving and exhausted late tonight Israel attacked Eastern Rafa where they told people to leave celebration had turned to fear and the hope that tomorrow might bring peace Ferg Keen BBC News Jerusalem let's get the very latest now from Frank Garden who's live in Jerusalem and Gary odonahue who's in New York Frank first to you um as we speak Israel still hasn't signed on to this deal no they haven't but they have at least agreed to to do what they didn't do at the weekend which is to send a delegation of mediators experts in their view to try and trash out a deal they've said that the terms that Hamas have agreed to are very far from what is that meets their needs but they're not ruling it out so I think there is a degree of optimism here but at the same time as I mentioned they are continuing their push their military push against the wishes of the Americans in Rafa and that is controversial because all the aid agencies are saying this could be a catastrophic result for the civilians there and essentially I think if if you had to sum up the Israeli position it would be keep talking but keep fighting all right Frank thank you uh to you Gary at the White House um Joe Biden his team they're very anxious um over Israel's planned attack on Rafa they don't want it to go ahead but Israel it's clear tonight is still planning to push on yeah the administration here believing we're at a really critical stage uh in this whole process they are saying that they're looking at the the details of the deal that Hamas have said they'll accept uh talking to their Partners in the region uh and also of course the CIA director Bill Burns is shuttling between Qatar and KIRO trying to work out what to do next now they're saying that they're going to look at that in great detail one thing they're being very clear on is the question of Rafa they say they've seen no credible plan uh of how to protect humanitarian uh needs in Rafa if there were any kind of uh incursion there they've been opposed to that all along and I think one thing today from the National Security Council spokesman Clive John Kirby summed it out he said I don't think there has been a more sensitive stage than right now
