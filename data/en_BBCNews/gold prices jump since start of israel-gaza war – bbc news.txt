now let's uh focus on a warning that's come from the World Bank of the increased risks of price Rises across the board if the conflict in the Middle East escalates focusing on the possibility for huge rises in the price of oil to over $150 a barrel but also looking at the price of gold long seen as a safe haven investment in times of upheaval the price of the precious metal has risen by around 8% since the start of the Israel Gaza war and according to to a new report from the world gold council is also being brought up by central banks like never before John Reed is Market strategist at the world gold Council and he explained the findings central banks have more than doubled the amount of gold that they've purchased really starting from the middle of last year and and that's made a major difference I think to the gold market you know even before this conflict lifted the gold price we've seen um the US dollar really we've seen interest rates really strong normally that would put gold Under Pressure but because of this enormous Central Bank purchases we're within a few percentage points of the all-time high in gold which we saw both during coid and then following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and I presume you don't see this trend changing or going in the opposite direction anytime soon no I don't think so we spent a lot of time talking to central banks about what they're doing in gold and why they're doing it helping them understand the gold market and there's number of factors that are driving their purchases you know I I I think there's a recognition from central banks that inflation is going to be more of a problem in the in the next decade than it was in the in the past 10 years I think geopolitics is playing a role not just the Russian invasion of Ukraine but I think concerns that we're entering into a a more lively geopolitical um Arena I I think as well the the actions taken uh against the Central Bank of Russia uh sanctioning its reserves following the invasion of Ukraine have really made Reserve managers at central banks uh sit up and take notice and I think that they they see the sanctions resistant uh quantities of gold as very attractive and and finally I think there's there's the belief that we're moving towards a more multi-polar world where it's not just the US dollar that is the reserve currency of the world but in time there'll be other Reserve currencies too this rate of purchasing can continue we think for years maybe even decades and it just goes to show doesn't it that that gold I mean once upon a time it was very much out of fashion and our former Chancellor Gordon Brown famously sold off huge amounts of UK reserves which now looks like a a huge mistake of course it it just goes to show that gold will always remain as the safe haven in times of trouble won't you think I I think so and I wouldn't be too quick to blame Gordon Brown for his sales uh lots of other central banks were selling gold at the time as well but you're right um gold is a perennial asset it's uh and certainly over the last 10 years following the global financial crisis following the coid pandemic the Russian invasion of Ukraine it's really demonstrated its role uh in a portfolio for central banks but also for investors too John Reed there from the world gold Council
