we begin with the war in Gaza and Israel's reaction to President Biden's warning on the supply of Us weapons to its Ally Mr Biden has said America will continue to give Israel the weapons it needs to defend itself but he added Israel won't keep Washington's support if it carries out military operations in heavily populated areas Israel's un Envoy has called Mr Biden's remarks disappointing more on that in a moment but first here's more of what President Biden said civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers and I made it clear that if they go into Rafa they haven't gone into Rafa yet if they go into Rafa I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafa to deal with the cities to deal with that problem we're going to continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of Iron Dome and their ability to respond to attacks like came out of the uh the Middle East recently well for more on that on North America correspondent will Vernon sent this update from Washington President Biden said America would continue to give Israel the weapons it needs to defend itself but he said the US wouldn't Supply heavy weapons bombs artillery shells that could be used in a major assault on the city of Rafa and Mr Biden said it is these us supplied weapons that have already killed killed civilians in Gaza and human rights groups say uh these Munitions are responsible for the utter Devastation in Gaza uh now earlier we heard from us officials who confirmed that one shipment of heavy bombs was delayed last week and the other shipments were under review and that was a hugely uh significant announcement a historic step not for 40 years has the US held up any arms uh deliveries to Israel for this kind of reason the Israeli government said uh that it was very disappointed uh now the US of course is Israel's biggest supplier of military equipment its most important Ally uh and Mr Biden has already come under criticism from republicans in Congress for example who say he is abandoning a key us Ally but I think Mr Biden is hoping that um by making this move there have been uh many months of expressions of deep concern from president Biden from uh other officials too about the conduct of the war in Gaza about the plans for Rafa those warnings have been more or less ignored by the Israelis who said they're going to go into Rafa regardless so I think Mr Biden is hoping that this will send a clear message sufficiently clear to the Israelis that they must change course will Vernon there well let's speak to our Middle East correspondent yoland Nell who is in Jerusalem for us yoland uh good to have you now you and I regularly talk about this growing Rift between the US and Israel it's become uh much more public now hasn't it what's the latest we've heard well this is being covered extensively in the Israeli media as you would expect there haven't been many comments yet from Israeli officials although we did have Israel's ambassador to the UN gillad erdan speaking to public radio he said that these comments by President Biden were extremely disappointing and they would give hope uh to Israel's enemies um we've also had the opposition leader yel AED coming out and and really criticizing what he says is Israel's um government's management of the country uh and the the relationship uh with the US it's a source of of great concern among many Israelis um that the relationship is becoming um so strained um of course Washington is is the closest Ally of Israel it provides a diplomatic shield for it as well as this huge amounts of military assistance so it's not exactly clear exact about how this is going to affect things happening on the ground in Rafa I mean from what we know there has been uh more heavy shelling the Israeli military continuing to carry out what it says a targeted uh raids against Hamas uh but people living in Rafa not just the areas that have been given evacuation orders tell us that it is is terrifying that uh Panic has set in among people and they really just don't know where to go for their own safety and your land uh what has Israel said Benjamin Netanyahu said about why Israel would move forward with such a large scale offensive despite opposition from its own allies well the reason that Israel really wants to go into Rafa with a full uh scale invasion is because it says there are four Hamas battalions remaining there it's really the last stronghold of Hamas in Gaza in um Israel's eyes and it doesn't believe that it can achieve the victory that it has said is only achievable by dismantling um Hamas in Gaza unless it goes into this Southernmost city now of course the problem with that which we're starting to see already is that you have so many displaced people uh in the city that a fullscale Invasion there indeed any kind of uh increased military action really does involve huge amounts of human suffering um we're getting reports of people in the day of civilians having been killed in the air strikes that have been going on but uh even bigger than that is the fact you now have this sort of downward spiral in the humanitarian situation because Aid is blocked from going in through uh the Raffa Crossing which Israel took control of early on Tuesday that's not been um open to humanitarian uh groups since and also although Israel said um yesterday that it was opening the Kem Shalom Crossing after 4 days of closure it said caused by Hamas rocket fire which killed four Israeli soldiers nearby um and there's so much fighting going on in that area and Palestinian workers um fled with the the start of the Israeli military operation that that really means that um no Aid is able to get in there in effect either and your land as this Rift becomes public there are also domestic pressures on each of these leaders in the US and Israel what pressures is Benjamin Netanyahu facing domestically right now I mean he has uh two pressures really I mean you have on the one hand the hostage families who have so much public support in Israel they're carrying out near daily demonstrations they say Rafa can wait bring the hostages home they can't wait um and then you have those far-right members of um the coalition government that Mr Netanyahu heads who have been saying specifically that Rafa must be prioritized a full invasion there that's the only route to bring Israel the victory that they want and they have threatened if Israel signs up to a reckless deal in their eyes with the ceasefire talk still going on in Cairo uh that they would walk away from his government yolan thank you for that update now as yourand was saying the humanitarian situation on the ground is already dire and it is getting worse a an investigation by BBC verifi has found over half of gaza's water and sanitation facilities have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the war here's Caroline Hy water in Gaza is in dangerously short supply posing serious health risks to the population BBC verify has analyzed more than 600 water and sanitation facilities here the dots represent a mixture of water wells tanks desalination and sewage treatment plants the red dots are all those that have been destroyed or damaged that's more than 300 facilities AC cross the Gaza Strip now Gaza used to have six functioning wastewater treatment plants which are crucial to preventing the buildup of sewage and the spread of disease this was one of them here it was before October the 7th and now after three others are also damaged or destroyed and we've been told the remaining two are out of action largely because of a lack of fuel now to compound the problem officials in Gaza say they're struggling to repair damaged infrastructure after an attack on a key Warehouse where Fuel and spare parts were stored this shows the warehouse before and after it was struck at the end of January the IDF said it was targeting Hamas Fighters nearby it's accused the group of storing weapons and ammunition inside civilian structures including in and near water facilities all of this has had a very direct human Consequence the World Health Organization says that the average person needs 15 lers of water each each day for drinking washing and cooking but most people in Gaza are getting just a fraction of that and that scarcity of water and untreated sewage are causing dehydration and disease so we are seeing death coming from uh the outbreaks of disease um in the highly vulnerable in the small children in the elderly and in the pregnant women hepatitis and pregnant women is is very very dangerous this is killing people people in Gaza have told us that they're queuing for hours to access drinking water others are drinking Dirty Water Aid agencies want to truck in more water but say they can't because of limited access to fuel and this isn't just an acute problem now exacerbated by the current Israeli operation in Rafa gaza's infrastructure will take years decades to rebuild you can see our full analysis on the BBC News website Caroline Hy there
