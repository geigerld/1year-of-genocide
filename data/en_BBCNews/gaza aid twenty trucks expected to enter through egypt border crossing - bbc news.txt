the British prime minister Rishi sunak has told his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu that the UK will stand by the country what both men described as its Darkest Hour during talks in Jerusalem the Prime Minister said Israel had the right to defend itself after attacks by Hamas killed nearly 1,400 Israelis the meeting came amid continuing concerns about the plight of people in Gaza RI sunak said gazans were victims of Hamas as well and welcome plans to get Aid into the ter from Egypt Aid agencies are warning that Gaza is in need of far more Aid than the initial 20 lorries announced by President Biden during his visit to Israel yesterday the UN humanitarian Chief Martin Griffith says about 100 lorries a day will be required more than 60 International Charities including Christian Aid Oxfam and save the children have called for an urgent ceasefire Israeli air strikes are continuing in Gaza the latest reports from Gaza say that several people including children have been killed or wounded in an air strike on a house in the southern town of KH Unis these are some of the pictures from the hospital nearby with what appears to be un workers among the injured well Palestinian Health officials said the death toll had risen to more than 3,800 Palestinians in total diplomatic meetings to try to secure aid for Palestinians are continuing with the King of Jordan meeting Egypt's President in Cairo both countries have played significant mediation roles in previous conflicts well coming up this hour we'll hear from a UN Agency on the ground we'll also hear from a British man who's lost family members in Gaza and from the families desperately trying to trace loved ones seized by Hamas first though we start with this report from WEA Davis what on the heels of yesterday's visit by Joe Biden a UK military flight today brought rashis sunak to Tel Aviv the Prime Minister here to meet Israeli leaders and British Israeli victims of the brutal violence of 12 days ago on the well traveled road to Jerusalem Mr sunak trip is a symbolic show of solidarity after one of the worst events in modern Israeli history rak's visit here and that of world leaders before and afterwards is to show Israel that its allies have its back there may well be some calls for restraint but what happens next is perhaps inevitable and they won't try to persuade Israel otherwise Israel's military buildup on the border with Gaza continues when they go in is perhaps yet to be decided but with the avowed intention of completely destroying Hamas those who've seen this before say this time will be different the two previous uh ground campaigns in 2014 and 2009 both lasted for about 18 days and then the Israeli forces which were there on the ground left this this time it's going to be a heck of a lot longer than 18 days and nobody is going to say whether it's say weeks months perhaps even years until Israel has reached that uh objective eradicating Hamas leadership and Military capabilities in Gaza so that is really the main difference now for now Israel continues to hit targets inside Gaza from the air confirming it had hit hundreds of Hamas infrastructure sites but say Palestinian officials there have also been numerous civilian casualties many of them children gaza's humanitarian situation is dire and like President Biden before him Rashi sunak impressed on Israeli leaders the importance of allowing limited Aid into Gaza through the border with Egypt something Israel has agreed to and which should begin by the end of the week compared to its Reliance on the United States for support and military aid Israel's relationship with the UK is much less important but at times of such crisis these moments are significant I'm proud to stand here with you in Israel's Darkest Hour as your friend we will stand with you in solidarity we will stand with your people and we also want you to win this is not merely our battle it's the battle of the entire civilized world it's the Battle of uh Israel it's the battle of the moderate Arab countries it's the Battle of uh Western Civilization the battle of the Free World the battle for the future Israel says it cannot allow its friends or The Wider world to forget what happened on October the 7th when 1300 people were murdered and on the day of Rishi Sak's visit British Israeli yonni Rapaport was the latest victim to be identified murdered in the attack on kibot ber the lifetime man united fan leaves behind two young children G Davis BBC News jus Jerusalem we talk to our correspondent Tom bitman these are the pictures live from Gaza another huge plume of smoke there on the skyline so let's bring in Tom bitman has been across all of today's developments Tom your assessment of that visit from Rishi sunak the day after the American president well it was meant to show a very strong uh signal of solidarity by Mr tunak and the British government for for the Israeli leader uh at this particular moment but I thought what was interesting was that whereas we were hearing uh towards the end of last week uh really only that message from the UK government um I think what we've seen which was triggered largely by a tour by the US Secor State Anthony blinkin of around eight Arab capitals this rapid shuttle diplomacy at the end of last week in which he kept adding new venues and dates and then coming back to Israel that's where we saw some of the messaging from the Western Powers start to shift a bit and we've heard much more Focus about the need to get humanitarian Aid into Gaza and a bit more of an emphasis too which we heard from Rishi sunak about the need for Israel to operate within the boundaries of international law um because clearly what they are worried about here is the way that this has the potential to escalate and spread to The Wider region and remember that many many millions of people across the rest of this region have been seeing those pictures coming from Gaza with this huge civilian um death toll and that is creating uh it's making the temperature rise and so I think you know what we were hearing from Mr Biden yesterday and Mr sunak a bit today uh was the need to sort of show that they are urging some sort of restraint to the Israelis remember we haven't even had of course that ground Invasion begin yet it's still expected and I think one of the the really one of the only practical ways they can try and do that at the moment is is to try and alleviate some of the desperation in Gaza by getting that Rafa Crossing open with Egypt so that uh messaging that you know the deal that was done between Mr Biden and the Israelis yesterday that they'll try to open get Rafa opened tomorrow which will allow in 20 Aid trucks of uh food water and Medicine not fuel though and that is really um crucial and although having said all of that what we're hearing now from Aid groups and the UN is that really not that is just it will help but it's not going to be anywhere near Enough Tom a twin thought uh just a supplementary on where You' finished what have Israel said about where that Aid may go are there any limitations and in terms of the military buildup where are we in terms of where the aid goes I mean the Israelis have said that there should be a designated uh Aid point a supply point for the uh Aid which is on the coastal side of the Gaza Strip but we we really don't know much about the logistics at the moment I mean all we've heard we heard from uh an Egyptian official saying that they are working at the moment to repair the roads after the damage from the Israeli bombing um close to the crossing the the part of the road that runs between the Egyptian side of the Border onto the sort of liaison Point Rafa with the um Palestinian side so they're working on that um but beyond that what exactly will happen to the AIDS we simply don't know I mean one of the things the Israelis had been saying is uh that and one of the reasons they don't want fuel is they have said that if there's any sense that supplies are being exploited or stolen by Hamas they'll they'll stop it um so these are really going to be really sensitive discussions between all of the parties involved as to the buildup to war we're not really any further in terms of what we know than we were I think at the beginning of this week quite honestly I mean the you know the buildup around on the perimeter of the Gaza Strip of Israeli forces has been absolutely huge the biggest cool up of military reservists in half a century of 360,000 people it is all a massive operation it feels to me that while we've had this week which has almost felt like a slight pause while um International diplomacy is ramped up you know President Biden yesterday we had Olaf Schultz uh the German Chancellor there may be more European leaders coming um this week it feels like it would be unlike that a grand Invasion would be launched during that but of course we simply don't know these are unprecedented and extremely volatile um times uh but you know clearly they have been and they've been saying since the weekend the Israelis militarily they're ready to go Tom bitman there in Jerusalem thanks very much
