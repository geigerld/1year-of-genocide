the un's health agency says a significant proportion of gaza's population is facing catastrophic hunger and famine likee conditions after eight months of war thousands of children have been diagnosed with acute malnutrition with me is BBC Arabic s shahata say thank you very much for coming in so tell us a little bit more about the aid situation at the moment in in Gaza there's problem of Aid delivery uh the G7 uh leaders said yesterday they should be uh more Aid going to Gaza without any obstacle uh the world food program uh said uh that there is it War houses were hit twice in uh in June in addition to that there is uh obstacles for Aid delivery because of increased fighting in different areas especially in north and Central and South everywhere in Gaza so there is problem in Aid delivery uh to add to that there is the US state department impose a sanction on a a violent extremist group is called tavf 9 which uh looted some Aid uh trucks and blockade made blockade on a delivery to uh to Gaza because he said he supporting the uh hostage families and this what they need but I think there is a question mark about that uh in addition to that there is some uh interviews with the world food program with some people in Gaza saying they have nothing uh to eat in addition to the health situation the World Health Organization says there is no medical supplies even there's some hospitals opened again partially like Indonesian hospitals in the north of Gaza but still there is no medical supplies so is not functioning like uh full capacity uh in addition to that there is uh even the uh the interal court of justice called on Israel to allow aid for the need people in Gaza so all of that you know like showing that there is problem uh in delivering Aid to people in Gaza people dying and there is one report a child died yesterday because of like hunger and there is tens of children are facing that so the hunger looming there is problems people dying people suffering so there is pressure and Oxfam in this context said it's a time to action not talks because talks time is is is over so now is action time and it seems as though any progress towards a ceasefire deal which would also involve trying to get more Aid in seems to stalled tell tell us a bit about the situation with the hostages because there's some some confusion about how many hostages are are actually still alive tell us what what we think the latest is on that yeah the leaders of Hamas one of them is AMA hamdan talk to CNN and said like there two uh hostages were killed RAF recently because of Israeli raid according to him and they said no military leaders in Hamas know how many people of the hostages died and how how many of them like still alive so it's confusion because of the fighting and where the talks sto so there's a problem because there is even like there is isra isi managed to release four hostages in operation but the result of it was killing more than 200 people according to the Hamas Health uh Ministry in Gaza so the hostage situation is is dire and is a problematic and the hostage family calling for Mr Netanyahu to have a deal but all indicators there is no deal in the foreseeable future because of the fighting going on and Israel refusing to end the war and to uh concede to Hamas conditions of full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza in addition to that end of all end of the war and Israel not willing to do that as a time as this time and at the moment we don't we haven't heard the response really properly from from Hamas either have we on on the hisbah um situation the border with Lebanon and Israel the fighting's been going on through throughout this period since since October 7th hasn't it there's been exchanges of fire in that situation what's the situation there now and has that has that got worse yeah it has been the recent days has seen witness escalation uh one of the example in on Thursday hasbullah fired 150 Rockets against Israeli targets and Israel also made several launched several raids on uh Southern uh part of of Lebanon in this context you know Mr uh macro the French President made a plan for to help to ease a tension and for the growing tension between his and and Israel but you have Gant the Israeli defense minister rejected the French proposal which is three lateral uh contact group of France United States and Israel and from the other side United States France and hisbah to uh to Lebanon Sor and Lebanon to try to ease the tension between them but Israel refusing that because you afghanan Minister the Israeli Minister of Defense said uh uh France position on Gaza is not is against Israel and in this case we cannot accept uh any french proposal to end hostilities s thank you very much for coming to Tes thank you
