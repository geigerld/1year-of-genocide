after days of argument over the precise wording the United Nations security Council has passed a resolution on the conflict in Gaza calling for the unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance but stopping short of supporting an immediate ceasefire instead it urges the creation of the conditions for a cessation of hostilities 13 council members voted for it with the US and Russia abstaining a UN agency has warned that gaza's entire population is at risk of starvation in a moment will be reporting on the situation on the ground in Gaza but first to Washington and our correspondent there John sudworth John well the mere fact that there is an agreement is for many people Rita a success in itself diplomats ahead of the vote today speaking of the dire humanitarian need in Gaza and that concern is certainly front and center of this resolution but it is also undoubtedly a compromise the US making its position clear through days of torturous negotiations that there was no point demanding that Israel stop fighting or that it give up its insistence on screening and monitoring the aid going across the Gaza border if it has simply no intention of doing either after the long drawn out diplomacy the Drafting and redrafting finally the Moment of Truth the wide show of support from most Security Council Members was no surprise the resolution the UAE has put in blue this morning morning responds to the calls for a sustainable cessation of hostilities and a massive scale up of humanitarian Aid often in diplomacy the challenge is meeting the moment in the world we live in not in the world that we want all eyes were on the US and Russia in the end they both abstained but it wasn't a veto and so the resolution passed on the ground its immediate practical implications may be limited the US did much to tone down the language motivated by what it sees as Israel's right to keep fighting so the call for an immediate ceasefire has gone replaced instead with a call only for the conditions that might eventually lead to one and the insistence in earlier drafts that the United Nations take control of the delivery of Aid has also been struck out the final version Now talks of Consulting all relevant parties as always the geopolitics were never far from the surface with Russia describing the us as shameful for not calling for a ceasefire the US in turn dismissed that claim given Russia's actions in Ukraine and then made clear it had lingering concerns of its own while we are encouraged that the council spoke out on this humanitarian crisis we're deeply disappointed a called actually that once again the council was not able to condemn hamas's horrific terrorist attack on October 7th despite the differences though there is now agreement on the scale of the crisis in Gaza and the intent at least to do more to address it John sudworth BBC News Washington well in Gaza itself the Hamas run health authority says more than 20,000 people have been killed by Israeli forces and it emerged today that an American Israeli hostage being held by Hamas designated a terrorist organization by the UK government is believed to have died in captivity President Biden said he was heartbroken by the news our Middle East correspondent Lucy Williamson reports now from Jerusalem when Israel and Hamas refused to budge from their positions the people of

never now know peace Lucy Williamson BBC News Jerusalem let's go back to John sudworth in Washington uh John if the UN resolution as you said has little immediate practical impact what does happen next well as so often in diplomacy Rita points of high principle have surrendered to real politic there is no call for an immediate ceasefire the UN has failed in its efforts to wrestle control of Aid flows into Gaza away from Israel so you know you might well ask that question what is the point then of this resolution of broad principle I think in the end for those who say that this has achieved something the important thing isn't just the agreement itself but the fact that it now has the backing of really the only outside power that has clout in this conflict Israel's staunch al Ally the United States and of course this resolution although Israel may choose to ignore the letter of it does have the force of international law and the US can perhaps behind the scenes now use this to pressure Israel some observers will hope to do more to minimize civilian casualties and to work harder to increase those flows of Aid into Gaza
