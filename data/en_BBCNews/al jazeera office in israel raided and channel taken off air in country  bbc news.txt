okay let's get more now on uh the Israeli government decision to close down the uh Al jazer uh TV channel uh in Israel this has been happening throughout the day and Sebastian user is our Middle East Analyst at the BBC World Service and we've had some some news in um just in the last half an hour or so Sebastian from Frank Gardner our security correspondent in Jerusalem who says that Israeli police have already raided the offices of the Qatar based Channel um and that was just within hours wasn't it of of that decision right to to shut it down it it seems very very Swift it is it's Swift but it has been building for some time and this is something that the Israeli government now this far right government has very much pushed for and especially in the context of the Gaza War event since October the 7th the hamus attacks on Israel then in which Al jazer which Israel has accused for a very long time of being anti-israeli it's acted against its journalists uh journalists have been killed I mean most famously two years ago Shireen Abu Akay the star correspondent of Al jazer for the Arab Service uh that they run uh in the occupied territories was killed aljer accused Israel 100% of having carried it out since then Israel has uh has said that it it you know the the chances are that it was uh an accidental uh killing so this this showdown between these between aleser and Israel goes back a long way but really this has become much stronger during the Gaza war and aler has been really the only International medor Outlet which has been able to keep its reporters on the ground there they've been reporting essentially 24 hours a day on its Arab language Channel and its English language Channel and again that's something which the Israeli government uh is very much against and believes is essentially acting as a mouthpiece for Hamas and they've said that explicitly they've even accused Al jazer staff of of collaborating with Hamas so this announcement today which was made by the Prime Minister Netanyahu was followed very swiftly by the communications Minister saying he'd signed it and as we as as we've seen actually the communications Minister posted video of the raid within a couple of hours of this happening uh so the powers that Israel has over Al jazer to confiscate its uh broadcasting equipment to close its offices and to block access to it on satellite and its websites now what we're hearing from Israel is that that has happened that it's no longer uh obtainable by satellite or cable in Israel but there's other ways of doing it and again as as as Frank was saying you can get it on Facebook now very difficult in this day and age obviously to completely close down access to uh to a network like aleser I wonder in your anal Anis what do you think this means in terms of people's views of netan who we have seen more protests haven't we in recent months but uh for the for the people in Israel in particular what what do you think their perception will be of this and probably I'm look I'm thinking more in terms of free speech yes no I understand that I mean I think in terms of the uh critics of netan who date back before October the 7th who basically went on the streets and hundreds of thousands every Saturday to protest against what they saw as a move by his government to close down the ability for the Judiciary to take uh positions against what the government wanted to do they would say this is another attack on Free Speech I think many Israelis though would see it as this is a time of War Al jazer I think many people uh if if they do watch it would see it as some kind of propaganda they would see it as taking too strongly a prop Palestinian anti Israeli position so I don't think it'll change particularly the way that Israelis see netan if they already see him as someone who's opposed to free speech who's opposed to democracy in Israel then they will see this as another sign of it but for many others it will be mixed up with this feeling which is you know this this is a time of War just as you have many Israelis who are very much against the way that the war has been fought by the Israeli government and Israeli military and and and and the casualties on the paltin side they're not necessarily against the fact of a war in the first place because of what happened October the 7th okay Sebastian user thank you very much
