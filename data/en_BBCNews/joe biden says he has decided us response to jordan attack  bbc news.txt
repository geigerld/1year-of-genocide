three service members killed at least 40 injured in a drone attack President Biden who has been briefed on all the options available said he has now decided what his response will be he didn't elaborate but his National Security spokesman John Kirby suggested it would be a teered response guiding principle is making sure um that we continue to degrade the kinds of capabilities that these groups have at their disposal to use against our troops and our facilities and to send send a strong signal uh uh to their backers in the irgc that these attacks are unacceptable and we're going to do the president will do what he has to do to protect our troops and our facilities and to look after our national security uh our national security interest in the region Brad Bowman is a senior director of the center on Military and political power at the foundation for defense of democracies Brad thank you very much for being with us um what do you take from what you've heard this afternoon what what do you think President Biden and his security team are thinking I thanks for the opportunity to join you I think the Biden administration's clear goal here is to restore deterrence which was clearly tattered I mean we've seen more than 167 attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria and now Jordan with these three service members paying for it with their lives and this Administration has to act there's bipartisan consensus on that I believe it has to act strongly it's premise throughout uh the last few weeks at least since October 7th if not long before that is that American restraint uh was the best way to do this uh many Republicans on Capitol Hill worry that that restraint is what got us to this point and that restraint has been read by the Islamic Republic of Iran and its Terror proxies as weakness and a green light for additional aggression that's really interesting because I was asking this question last night whether American first policy talk of withdrawal the language from the administration that there needs to be restraint whether all of that in is in fact seen as weakness in Russia Iran China um we've seen a tweet today from from Wesley Clark the former supreme commander of NATO who said stop talking about about retaliation and restraint just go after the people who are sending the bombs and that's Iran yeah you know we sometimes forget you know I worked for in the US Senate for nine years we sometimes forget that leaders can't talk to One audience at a time right and so when when you're speaking in Brussels or Washington or Davos you're talking about restraint and reason and proportionality it all sounds very good and it earns you cool points but I I do worry many in Washington worry that our adversaries hear very differently and if you're on a playground you say hey I don't want to fight I don't want to fight what do you expect the bully to do keep throwing punches and unfortunately that's what we've seen both in the Red Sea with the houthis and also in Iraq and Syria with the Iranian proxies and militias there so when you talk about a strong response are you saying that it needs to go beyond a strike on the proxies does it have to in some way stretch the boundaries of what we might ordinarily consider proportional my view is that what the Islamic Republic of Iran is doing is a decades long strategy where they're the puppet master and they use Terror uh puppets proxies around the region I'm thinking of Hezbollah Hamas Palestinian Islamic Jihad and now the houthis to advance Iran's foreign policy objectives while displacing the consequences and the counterpunches onto others usually Arabs it's it's going quite swimmingly for because everyone's focusing on the proxies right now meanwhile Iran is inching toward a nuclear weapons capability and and has has put a least on hold for now normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel so um the bottom line is we can't have our adversaries from an American perspective thinking that they can kill American Service members and get away with it so we're going to see a strong response I predict much of it will come in Syria maybe in Iraq there's some reasons why the administration might want to avoid that um and I think if we only go after the proxies and not go after some of the Islamic revolutionary guard Corp uh elements particularly in Syria and elsewhere then it plays right into Iran's Puppet Master puppet strategy that I just described all that said you'll have heard our discussion on the deal that's being discussed was discussed in Paris at the weekend and also the warnings from the Qatari prime minister who was in Washington yesterday that a response that goes too far could complicate the whole process that's fine it's interesting though people always express concern about escalation when America is talking about responding but let me reiterate 167 attacks since October 17th on US forces so how would anyone expect the United States to respond and uh you know I think In This Moment the danger really is too weak of a response but I'll hasten to add if the administration hits back hard and doesn't take steps to protect American forces we're going to Simply see a more American casualties we saw that after the solomani killing in January 2020 where we had more than 100 americ an in two bases in Northern Iraq suffered from traumatic brain injury because there wasn't sufficient air and missile defense in the region so hit them hard yes restore deterrence if possible but expect an escalation at least in the short term and make sure you've taken steps in advance to protect American forces that's what I would be offering to the administration in this moment well the president has put them on notice uh we will keep watching through the night um because it sounds like it could be imminent Brad Bowman thank you very much indeed for that thank you thank you
