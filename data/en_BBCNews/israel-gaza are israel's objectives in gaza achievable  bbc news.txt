the Israeli military assault on Gaza in response to the October 7th attacks by Hamas has the highest rate of death of any conflict of the 21st century most of the deaths from both events have been civilians but Israel remains steadfast in its [Music] mission but can Hamas really be eliminated and with Worldwide calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire what are Israel's chances of Victory tensions have grown over the scope of Israel's military campaign and the need for a lasting solution this can only come through a regional approach that includes a pathway to a Palestinian state yet prime minister Netanyahu has openly defied the US with no road map to peace the conflict has has already escalated with fears of a wider Middle East War despite accusations of breaking international law and committing genocide which Israel says are profoundly distorted Mr Netanyahu refuses to back down in its mission to eliminate Hamas has Israel set itself an unobtainable goal months since the the conflict erupted Israel whose Army far out strips hamas's military capabilities is still facing resistance in Gaza before October 7th hamas's armed Wing was thought to have up to 30,000 Fighters the Israel Defense Forces claim they have killed almost a third of them and estimates 16,000 Hamas Fighters are wounded US Agencies think the figure is lower up to 11,700 and many could return to battle if those figures are accurate it would amount to a significant reduction in capabilities we put them to Hamas which rejects the figures if what the occupation says is true how does it explain the Kasam brigades continuing to operate with such force and in all areas of the Gaza Strip it is certain that the casam briat is able and ready to continue defending our people in this war as long as the occupation aggression on Gaza continues former Israeli colonal Marie Eis who once worked as a media adviser for the PM's liud party gives her assessment of Israel's military campaign the commanders have been killed cash a of weapons have been found that doesn't mean that we've killed every single terrorist we are systematically blowing up the underground Subterranean Terror system but some military analysts are more skeptical about the level of damage to Hamas they could fairly easily Recruit new Fighters um so that's probably not the most important metric that we're looking at in this the tunnel network is a lot larger than um than previously estimated so destroying or neutralizing the tunnels is uh is is is where you might describe it as uh um there's still a long way to go for the Israelis initially they started off and they were blowing up the shafts of the tunnel to try and stop people popping out of them but because there are so many shafts linking into the network then that's relatively futile so you go down and blow up the whole tunnel but then that could there could be um hostages down there so uh it's really difficult job either way it's a critical question for Israel Med is Hamas is one of two dominant political groups the other is the more secular fat which dominates the Palestinian Authority governing in the West Bank Hamas won the elections in 2006 ejecting the PA from Gaza by force the following year and they have governed there ever since the PA are seen by many as corrupt and collaborators in Israeli occupation under their governance Jewish settlements in the West Bank deemed illegal under international law have drastically increased in numbers although the PA has publicly condemned this it has still fueled anger among Palestinians backing for Hamas seems to be growing according to a poll of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza from late 2023 it suggests support for Hamas doubled during the fourth quarter of 2023 from 22% to 43% still less than half of Palestinians but outstripping their longtime Rivals fat the rise in support for Hamas comes almost entirely from participants in the West Bank 72% of respondents overall agree with Hamas decision to launch an offensive on October 7th and the poll suggests 63% support armed struggle as the best means of ending Israeli occupation again the majority of this support comes from participants in the West Bank the polling organization say that support for Hamas usually Rises temporarily during or immediately after a war academic and critic of Israel Dr Brahim frat gives his view of Palestinian support for Hamas they are living with no hope with no future and Hamas gave them the the alternative which is through confrontation and through Revolution that would bring to them a different approach on that level so Hamas enjoys the largest support not only in Palestine but in the entire Arab and Muslim world we don't have data to verify support for Hamas regionally but there are also many Arabs who oppose them hundreds of Palestinian activists took part in a rare online event at the start of 2022 criticizing Hamas governance of the Gaza STP where under Israeli blockade people were already living under dire conditions and there was high unemployment Hamas says it's engaged an armed struggle against Israel to end occupation and create a Palestinian State they are considered a terrorist group by much of the West with many pointing out its leaders still call for Israel's destruction but a resistance movement in parts of the Arab W Hamas agenda is limited within the the Palestinian agenda so it doesn't have a global message that uh Advocates religion and Islam for the world or for other countries so it's a it's a National Liberation movement that limits its objectives its agenda to the end of occupation and establishment of a Palestinian State they started carrying out attacks mostly targeting Israeli soldiers in 1989 but after 29 Palestinian worshippers were killed by an Israeli settler in 1994 at Al ibrahimi mosque also known as the cave of Patriarchs Hamas upped the violence starting a campaign of suicide attacks targeting civilians over the following three decades the levels of violence from both sides got progressively worse and the failure of peace talks which had once looked promising continued to have a defining impact there is another context to 7 of October and again none of this is to justify atrocities but clear that is a context in which Gaza has been under U Israeli blockade um since Hamas took over the strip in 2007 it is's a context in which Israel's occupation remains entrenched including the West Bank where Israel has been consolidating what the European Union has called a one state reality of uh inequality and uh Perpetual conflict which many human rights organizations refer to as a part Israel says that the blockade is necessary because of the threat from Hamas however to many Palestinians the occupation renew the Grievances and observers argue it could reenergize resistance a concern expressed by a Palestinian psychologist who grew up in Gaza as a psychologist I would say that I'm I'm sure there is a lot of these kids want to revenge for the death of their parents I'm sure you know they they want to revenge for you know their siblings who been killed and with this a aties that has been happening in in Gaza nowadays I don't know how many how many um you know Fighters Israel made um that supports Hamas now a wori also voiced by the Irish foreign minister who reportedly told the Israeli president on a recent trip to Israel what you are doing is creating fertile ground for more extreme views to grow how worried are Israelis about the war in influencing radicalization they are already so radicalized our response in that sense is first and foremost to try to eliminate the capabilities the ideology is already there it won't make the ideology worse than it already is they did that on October 7th and they have said that they want to do it again Israel have never been as explicit as they are now about their intention to eliminate Hamas yet earlier experiences highlight how challenging this is Hamas is not just a military movement nor is it just a political movement it is an ideology that ideology will not be eradicated certainly not through Israeli Force of Arms during the second intifada from 2000 to 2005 and Uprising following the failure to establish a Palestinian State Israel killed leader isma abushanab and Hamas founder shikh Ahmed yin and then his replacement abdulaziz RTI but Hamas continued to gain support from many Palestinians in 2014 a war erupted in the Gaza Strip Israel claimed to have dealt a significant blow to Hamas however ex Israeli soldier Beni Sanders who fought in the War claims it ended up strengthening Hamas I know for a fact that many civilians were killed in the area that I was in and uh I was left uh after that experience kind of uh questioning what it what it all accomplished did it actually strike Hamas did it actually weaken them did it actually prevent uh the risk of that happening again and what I realized in the Years afterwards was that no it didn't uh not only that uh Hamas got [Applause] stronger we don't know if Israel will succeed in its Mission but even its allies argue that a lasting settlement between Israelis and Palestinians is the only way to guarantee peace in the future some suggest it could be the best way to weaken Hamas if one truly wants to marginalize and to weaken Hamas then the only way that can happen is through the creation of a viable or political trap but Israel shocked by the brutality of the October 7th attacks remain firm in continuing to prevent a Palestinian State and are defiant on eliminating Hamas I just can't see a victory day for the Israelis so they they can uh massively degrade Hamas but the key thing is then how do you prevent Hamas reemerging in the sort of afterm of the major military operation so when I look at the day after I think that is Israel will very much control the continuation of the campaign to eliminate Hamas capabilities they're always going to show something but the bulk of them the threat of them that we're going to be able to eliminate under Mr Netanyahu who leads the most rightwing government in Israel's history Israel plans to retain security control for the foreseeable future as amounting to long-term occupation supported by ministers and parliamentarians in Benjamin netanyahu's coalition government some of them openly say they want to see Jewish settlements in Gaza but this post-war vision is not one that is endorsed by the US following pressure from the Biden Administration for a day after scenario defense minister yuav Gallant outlined a plan critically it satisfied the US by ruling out civilian settlements in Gaza prime minister Netanyahu has since confirmed local officials would run gaza's civil Affairs but has not said he'd allow the Palestinian Authority to return Israel would retain complete freedom to conduct military operations there how post-war Gaza is governed remains an open question as does the prospect of a lasting peace deal but without an alternative to the status quo there is a real risk of more extreme exem violence in the
