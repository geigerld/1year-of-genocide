hello to you a warm welcome to the program I'm Ben Thompson now the Hamas run Health Ministry says gaza's largest medical facility that's the alifa hospital has been forced to suspend operations because it has run out of fuel that comes amid reports of intensified fighting close to a number of hospitals in the territory overnight the BBC has heard from a doctor at the alifa who says that its intensive care units had been hit separately though he says because of fuel shortages two patients who are on ventilators have died one of them he says was a baby according to the World Health Organization there are currently 130 babies on incubators in Gaza 45 of them are believed to have been at the alifa hospital well the Gaza Health Ministry says 39 of them are now at serious risk of death given the lack of fuel and therefore a lack of power take a Liston to what that surgeon at alifa hospital told us in this update lost two patients who were in a ventilator one in the ICU one in the Nal ICU unit it is very very dangerous very critical situation there is no water even in the main building no electricity no food even and no fuel the generators stopped to work in the main sub speciality building shooting and bombardment everywhere you hear it at every seconds here around the shifa hospital and no one can get out from the shifa hospital no one can come to the shifa hospital situation is very very very dangerous and the people who H tried this morning to evacuate from the hospital they were have been shooted in the streets uh some of them they are on the they are got killed some of them they are got injured no one can arrive to the hospitals we are in the main building of the hospital no uh no we cannot get outside of the building because uh there is a shooting everywhere we don't have electricity we don't have water we don't have even the food and and we are afraid the in the middle of the night we don't we lost the electricity to the main ICU and to the newal ICU and our engineer during their walk to the uh to maintain this issue one of the team was hit in the neck and he got paralyzed we we don't we don't want to have any uh outbreaks due to this dead bodies who are outside the main refrigerator it is not working more because we don't have a fuel to run this generator this is that issue now well Israel's military has been closing in on Northern Gaza the purple areas on this map show the approximate location of soldiers as fighting ramps up in Gaza City well the international charity msf Medan Frontier says that unless there is a ceasefire alifa and other hospitals will turn into graveyards they say Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using alifa to conceal an underground Command Center but Hospital staff have denied it meanwhile in an interview with the BBC the French President Emanuel macron has called for Israel to stop killing babies and women in Gaza Now France like the UK has prescribed Hamas as a terror organization with the details here's our correspondent Nick beak this was Israel's aerial attack on Gaza overnight an unrelenting barrage like most Knights over the past 5 weeks Israeli forces have now surrounded Gaza City's major hospitals where they say Hamas have built headquarters underground but thousands of patients and those just trying to seek shelter are stranded on what is now a Frontline of the fighting The Red Cross says hospitals in Gaza have reached a point of no return France's president Emanuel macron once again condemned Hamas but he told the BBC that Israel a country he called a partner and friend had no justification for its continued bombing of Gaza de facto today civilians are bombed de facto these babies the ladies these old people are bombed and killed there is no reason for that and no legitimacy so we do urge Israel to stop I just remind everybody international law I call for a ceasefire and I will urge them for a ceasefire for minute against this fire in response the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said world leaders should be condemning Hamas not Israel his government said once again it was targeting Hamas not civilians meanwhile the families of hostages taken by Hamas on October the 7th are desperate for their release Tom hans's 8-year-old daughter Emily was kidnapped he had this message for her Ro waiting for her um we know we're going we're going to get you back be strong every day and uh wait we're coming to get you we're coming to get you home we going to bring you home tens of thousands have been making the journey South to what Israel tells them is a safe place for their families but it feels like nowhere in Gaza is safe Nick beak BBC News Jerusalem well a little while ago I spoke to Nick beak who's in Jerusalem he sent us this update the Israeli Defense Forces have been holding uh a briefing here today and journalists were able to put to them some of the accounts that are coming out out of the uh the alifa hospital including the the very Vivid account there we heard from the surgeon and the Israeli position on this is that Hamas has created the situation whereby a hospital hital is in effect a legitimate military Target so by that the Israeli forces are saying that Hamas has created this control and Command Center Center underneath the hospital from which it's directed operations and has been planning atrocities on is Israeli soil so that is what the Israelis are saying they were also uh really unwilling to be drawn on some of the very Vivid accounts of what's been happening in terms of civilians in the in the crossfire the Israelis saying that they've spent the last four weeks trying to evacuate hospitals urging people to move out of them but said that Hamas has been holding patience and other people basically as human Shields and has been preventing them from leaving saying that there have been checkpoints that have been set up to stop people moving out uh the the IDF spokesperson though did concede that there were thousands of people within the courtyard of the Osa hospital so that really gives you an indication of just how perilous a state the the civilians and other patients are who of course moved to hospitals thinking they'd be in one of the the safest places in Gaza but as we've seen it appears that no place within the territory is safe so our correspondent there Nick beak who's in Jerusalem
