let's turn to the Middle East now where Israel's defense minister has been outlining his plans for Gaza once its war with Hamas is over it comes almost three months after hamas's deadly October the 7th attacks on Southern Israel which triggered the conflict under yuav galant's four corner proposals Hamas would no longer control Gaza and Israel would retain overall security control a multinational force would take charge of rebuilding Gaza after its widespread destruction in Israeli bombing neighboring Egypt would also have an unspecified role under the plan but Gaza would be run by Palestinian bodies as long as they were not hostile towards Israel while fighting in Gaza has continued alongside the plan's publication the Hamas run Health Ministry says that dozens of people have been killed in the past 24 hours let's go straight now to our correspondent Yulan Nell who's in Jerusalem for us so Yulan how does this plan tally with the ideas that the US was suggesting for the day after in Gaza well uh Washington which is of course Israel's closest Ally has been calling consistently for a detailed uh plan for the day after what we have at the moment is really a kind of set of bullet points from the defense minister um but uh there has been this insistence that it should be Palestinians who are governing uh in Gaza in the future and this plan uh does account for that it says specifically that there will be no Israeli civilian presence in the Gaza Strip at the end of the war um now that is important because you've had far-right ministers in Israel's coalition government who have been calling for the return of Jewish settlers to the Gaza Strip and there are some who've been calling for the forced displacement of Palestinians and that is something that has um stirred up a lot of anger around the region with other Arab countries um also uh with the Americans saying that that talk was inflammatory and irresponsible what about the Palestinians what's their view on this there's been relatively little comment uh from the palestin Ians so far uh perhaps because this is really just the kind of sketch of a plan we are going to have the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin coming in a few days time and he will be visiting Palestinian leaders in the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank as well as Israeli leaders and we know that in the past uh the US has been pushing for the Palestinian Authority kind of a revitalized Palestinian Authority to have a role in the future of Gaza uh the Palestinian Authority is the body that governs parts of the West Bank but on the Palestinian side you know it has proved to be unpopular Palestinians have been saying in polls uh that really uh it it would take a kind of a different look to to the makeup of the Palestinian authorities they see at the moment for them to be convinced that it could be uh put in control of the Gaza Strip as well and how difficult would would it be to assemble the multinational force that Israel is talking about to to how would who would be part of it I mean that of course is still uh to be discussed there's so much to still to be discussed uh with this plan uh perhaps not surprising it's saying that the US would take a lead role here it has already been so much involved uh in this war but uh I expected they would be looking to International bodies to the UN agencies that already have a big role in getting humanitarian Aid into Gaza um and already have had historically a long presence in the Gaza Strip to be very involved in the Reconstruction efforts uh but it's sort of made clear by other statements from the Israeli defense Minister that Israel would insist that it still has Security checks on all materials that are going into Gaza and there have been calls too for um reinforcement to to stop smuggling across the border with Egypt because there's a lot of concern about how um Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza have brought in weapons or weapons Parts in the past we know that the Secretary of State as you mentioned earlier Anthony blinkin is going to be having talks again how is it going because at the moment Israel hasn't seemed to have listened at all on on the US's request to try and scale back uh some of the operations in Gaza to try and protect human life and also allow more humanitarian Aid in how is that discussion going to go given that Israel hasn't changed its uh its Methods at the moment well it's interesting that at the top of the list of what Anthony blinkin says he wants to achieve in this region is the protection of civilians in Israel the West Bank and Gaza he says and we we know of course that there have been these calls from the US to the intensity of the operations in Gaza because of the high numbers of civilians uh being killed now what we have seen is Israel saying that it's starting to pull out uh some of its Ground Forces its combat troops but at the same time we have seen in recent days still very heavy bombardment um of the Gaza Strip and heavy heavy shelling as well and that is continuing to cause high numbers of Civilian casualties youan n for the latest there from Jerusalem thank you very much
