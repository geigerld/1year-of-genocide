hello and welcome to the program I'm Samantha Simmons we start in the Middle East and the Israeli military says its forces have taken control of the Palestinian side of the Rafa Crossing which borders Egypt and Southern Gaza these are the latest pictures that show the view at the Crossing from on board an Israeli military vehicle Aid organizations operating there say the flow of Aid into the territory through the crossing has now stopped Israel continued to bombard Rafa overnight after rejecting his T5 proposal which was put forward by International mediators and agreed by Hamas Israel says the plan doesn't meet its core demands Israel is though sending a delegation to indirect talks in Cairo well we've had this update from our correspondent fergo Keen in Jerusalem they haven't had reason to dance for a long time but they haven't forgotten [Music] how even amid uncertainty about isra 's position Hope Springs across Gaza BBC journalists captured the reaction of those convinced perhaps prematurely that a ceasefire will happen the feeling is Indescribable we're so happy we're going back to our home in Gaza City we're refugees from the north and we fled here this young man says we're so happy there's a ceasefire Israelis are still absorbing the news it came late on one of this society's most important days when across the country Sirens bring the nation to a halt in memory of the dead of the Holocaust a day of reflection in a country traumatized by the Hamas attack last October tonight on the streets of Tel Aviv those who believe healing that trauma can begin with a ceasefire deal and the release of Israel's hostages he expect from the Israeli government to take this field to save all the remaining hostages who are still alive but after 7 months of a war in which Israel's Army pledged to destroy Hamas a ceasefire deal that fails to accomplish that risks breaking Israel's wartime coalition government Israel will send negotiators to talks but won't stop fighting yet we examine every proposal very seriously and we review every possibility on the issue of negotiations and the return of the hostages to their homes as quickly as possible and as a central task at the same time we carry on with our operations in the Gaza Strip and will continue to do so the people of Eastern Rafa woke to leaflets telling them to evacuate many have been displaced before but still they were told to leave everyone no matter how old how young or how vulnerable to Al maasi Israel says and other desolate places Beyond Rafa the so-called humanitarian zones were to be expanded but they've never been safe from sickness hunger or War this is the aftermath of raids on Rafa last night people hope these may have been some of the last air strikes if the ceasefire can be made to work news of the Hamas announcement was still hours Refugee for seven months this has been the daily reality hany ashtar an orphan grieved by his relative re his family was killed during the war she says even he was killed so many here are grieving and exhausted late tonight Israel attacked Eastern Rafa where they told people to leave celebration had turned to fear and the hope that tomorrow might bring peace fergal Keen BBC News Jerusalem let's show you the scene live in Rafa right now where we can smoke uh rise into the air there this comes after the Israeli Defense Forces said it does have operational control of the Garen side of the ra acrossing following the announcement that the IDF was targeted targeting having targeted strikes against Hamas in eastern Rafa well in the past few hours the military have said that their forces were scanning the area after launching this ground and air operation in parts of Eastern Rafa on Monday this is as we know a diplomatic efforts are continuing to try and achieve a new truce well let's speak to Lise wridge from unra who joins me now from Rafa uh Louise welcome to you tell us what the situation is there right now where you are yeah things are very tense here in Rafa um the last 24 hours have been a complete roller coaster of emotion even the last few days there was so much hope for uh ceasefire anybody you speak to here the last week the last few months every every day all they want to know is when there is a ceasefire coming and it's what everybody has been hoping for so to wake up yesterday morning to the devastating news that leaflets had been dropped and an evacuation order was in place it really Spread spread a lot of fear across the community um I'm currently in Western Rafa but across Eastern Rafa people started to move but even outside my window I was able to see people starting to take down their makeshift shelters start to pack up and start to leave Rafa so there's a lot of fear spreading throughout the day you could see more and more people starting to to move starting to leave um and then last night you know out of seemingly nowhere you know for myself the first I heard of it was screaming and cheering out of the window um I was completely overcome with with emotion everyone around you know you could see women and children hugging each other crying families coming together just this outpour of relief that people have held for so long at the hope of a potential ceasefire uh and then today this morning very subdued very quiet as the day has gone on I've seen again more and more Vehicles move out of the Rafa area as people are packing up their things and leaving so there is a sense of fear and Chaos now obviously this is a a minute by minute hour by hour situation developing um but clearly people are hearing the situation at the Raffa border crossing and now deciding to to leave once again and and tell us what the aid situation is like because more Aid had been getting in in the past few weeks hadn't it what's this Aid situation there now so there is now no Aid entering the Gaza Strip the Raffa Crossing is the biggest and the only entry that unra the the largest humanitarian agency here in Gaza has been using and now there is no Aid able to get in and in addition to that there is also no fuel so fuel is really what the agencies need to run this massive humanitarian operation across the Gaza Strip fuel is what's needed to to run the trucks to get the aid to the people who need it fuel is needed in the generators to run the hospitals and and health clinics that are remaining and not damaged and destroyed so without this Fuel and without this aid supplies the aid operation here is is simply going to ground to a Hal what is the aid operation like at the moment um we continue to do everything we can our colleagues are providing Services unra runs Health Centers across the Gaza Strip um even in North Gaza we have some very heroic colleagues who have maintained running these Health Services throughout the war so we do our best to provide these these services and provide what Aid we have but it's very concerning to know that this border crossing is is closed and that there is no foreseeable Aid entering anytime soon okay thank you very much for telling us about the situation where you are Louise wridge from unra who is in Rafa thank you well let's get more on this with our correspondent in Jerusalem yolan now yand welcome to you what are the authorities there saying about why they've closed the crossing or taking control of this Crossing uh between Egypt and Rafa and about the IDF operation in Rafa so the Israeli Army has put out footage that shows these Israeli tanks rolling into this key crossing the Rafa Crossing between uh Gaza and Egypt it says it's taken operational control there um and it's dealing it says with Hamas uh terrorists infrastructure to use its language in that area it says it's killed 20 Hamas terrorists um overnight and that it has also found three uh tunnel shafts um and it's linking operations around uh this part of Rafa to the rocket fire that it says uh came from this area Fried by Hamas um on Sunday which killed four Israeli soldiers close to the Kem Shalom Crossing leading to the closure of that important Crossing in the south of the Gaza Strip as well um now at the moment when we're taking briefings from the Israeli military they're stressing that this is a very precise it's a limited uh operation they're not putting a time frame on it um they said too that they are working to reopen the Kem Shalom Crossing um as security allows and tell us more about this potential ceasefire deal which Hamas said it supports Israel says it goes a long way from meeting its demands we understand that unofficial talks are still going to take place today in Cairo what more do we know about that well at the moment this ceasefire deal is really hanging in the balance because of the different positions we had you know that declaration from Hamas was quite dramatic saying it agreed to what the mediators have proposed uh Israel coming out quickly um and uh denying that this was The Proposal that it had signed up to saying that there were um differences from its core demands but we also have had confusingly some officials coming out and saying No this is actually very similar um to the proposal that was put forward by Israel itself at the end of last month um it does seem really that the fundamental difficulty for Israel is signing up to any kind of a phase deal of a ceasefire and hostage release that will ultimately lead to an end to hostilities an end to this war before in the eyes of the uh Israeli government it has achieved its War aim of dismantling Hamas in Gaza it said that is necessary to have a victory in this war
