thousand of Israeli soldiers and civilians are being held hostage as part of an unprecedented attack by Palestinian militants on Israeli territory Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his country is at War his government says the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched more than 2,000 Rockets into the country killing at least 200 people and wounding nearly a thousand officials in the Gaza Strip say at least 198 people have been killed there in retaliatory Israeli strikes The Barrage of Rocket fire from Gaza into Israeli territory began just after Dawn with explosions heard on the streets of ashalon s darat is one of the towns thought to have been infiltrated by militants with the latest on this fast escalating conflict his our Middle East correspondent you land now and a warning you may find some of her report upsetting Israeli party goers from an overnight Rave running for their lives Israel's nightmare scenario armed Palestinian militants at large in southern Israel it's thought that dozens entered some cutting through the perimeter fence from the Gaza Strip in the town of stot residents hid as Fighters drove in there was shooting and the Israeli casualties began to mount in a dramatic turn videos were also shared of Israelis being taken into Gaza as hostages the day had begun with intense barrages of Palestinian Rockets some reaching as far as Jerusalem but the worst damage was in the town's closest to Gaza this was ashalon Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu met top security officials since this morning the state of Israel has has been at War our first objective is to clear out enemy forces that infiltrated and restore the security and quiet the communities that have been attacked the second objective at the same time is to exact an immense price from the Enemy Within the Gaza Strip too leaders of Hamas the islamist militant Group which controls Gaza now living overseas was shown watching the unfolding news and praying in Gaza there were celebrations after an Israeli tank was captured and stolen Israeli military vehicles were driven in but soon the deadly pounding by Israeli war planes began the Israeli military saying it was targeting Hass sites and in Gaza 2 the hospitals have now been overwhelmed many Palestinian families have fled from their homes and are seeking safety in un run schools after this unprecedented surprise attack Israel is calling up military reservists it said Hamas will pay the price for its actions and the fighting goes on the question now can it be stopped from spreading to other Palestinian areas and The Wider region youan now there will let's bring you the latest figures coming into us from Gaza the health Ministry have told the BBC there that 232 people have been killed and 1,790 have been injured well let's go live now to our Jerusalem Bureau bureau chief Joe floto who's following all the developments and Joe also in the past few minutes confirmation from the Israelis that at least 200 Israelis have been killed in those attacks today bring us the latest yeah so the the casualty figures coming up on both sides there there's still fighting going on so we're just coming off of an Israeli military briefing and they're confirming that there is ongoing gun gunfire in some of their military installations and border crossing points on the Gaza Strip which uh has taken them hours to retake and they still haven't completed that process they estimate that hundreds of militants managed to break out of Gaza and storm several locations near the Gaza Strip in Israeli towns and we've seen this chaos unfold during the morning hours with people being taken hostage a number of people killed and we've seen extraordinary videos of Israeli civilians being dragged away by militants supposedly into the Gaza Strip and we can confirm that there are dozens we think of hostages now being ta held by militants in Gaza H there's there's so much to talk about Joe um I just want to ask you about the military operation because also in the past few minutes the Reuters news agency were reporting a military spokesperson Israeli military spokesperson saying we are prepared for an escalation in the north now um geography wise a lot of these attacks happened in the south of the country what do you think that's going to mean what they're doing there is trying to reassure people and send out a message to Israel's enemies outside the country that they are prepared for a war on several fronts the main concentration of military effort at the moment is in the Gaza Strip so they are amassing hundreds and thousands of soldiers they've called up reservist and they are preparing for a big ground operation into the Gaza Strip they've made no secret of that it will take them a while to plan that in the meantime they are bombing Gaza Strip and that hence the casualties that we're seeing being reported out of Gaza but to the north of the country is Lebanon and Hezbollah is a well-known militant organization that runs pretty well that country and controls the large area of the south of that country and has had a war with Israel in the past and they have voiced their support for Hamas today and within their control within the the the areas of control of Hezbollah are also Palestinian milit milit factions who have in the past fired Rockets out of Lebanon into Israel so Israel Israeli military is saying they are prepared for any eventuality but make no mistake what they're planning at the moment is a massive attack on the Gaza Strip using thousands and thousands of soldiers we just don't know when that's going to happen Okay and politically Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has in the last 20 minutes or so said he's invited the opposition leaders ya lapid and Gant to join a national Unity government what's that going to mean well I think at times like this in Israel you often get very very Stark political differences set aside uh for the sake of national unity and that's what we've seen this evening this evening those politic those opposition figur really don't like Netanyahu they've they've been bitter political Rivals but they are going to sit in a national Unity government Benny gance is a very very senior military offic former Chief of Staff and will for part of that government but this is a a very divided country at the moment politically we've seen protests continue for most of this year because of U of political um decisions made by Netanyahu that haven't been agreed with by lots of the population here but at the moment this country is reeling in the shock of of what has never been seen by many many people living in Israel you have to go back probably to the Yom kapore War about 50 years ago before you get anything remotely close to this if you think about the war between Hezbollah and Gaza in 2006 we've already surpassed that death toll on the Israeli side in just one day and in in that situation we only had a tiny infiltration into Israel proper this is something different this is something that the Israeli military was supposed to stop this is not a surprise that Hamas have wanted to do this it is a surprise that they did it today and in such numbers and complete surprise is that they were so effortlessly successful for hours and hours and have reached havoc and now they hold in their possession we think dozens of hostages both military and civilian
