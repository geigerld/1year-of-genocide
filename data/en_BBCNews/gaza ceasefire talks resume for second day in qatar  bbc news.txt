hello I'm Lauren Taylor we start in the Middle East Gaza ceasefire talks are due to resume in Kat after what a Us official has described as a constructive first day of discussions on Thursday Israeli representatives are attending but Hamas which runs Gaza has stayed away accusing Israel of changing its terms since previous rounds of talks a Hamas official also reiterated that any agreement must achieve a comprehensive ceasefire a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the return of the placed on Thursday the Hamas run Health Ministry reported that the number of Palestinians killed in Gaza has passed 40,000 although Israel disputes the figure later the families of Israeli hostages still held captive in Gaza following hamas's October the 7th attacks gathered to demand a deal to secure their release with several thousand marching in Tel Aviv a little earlier our Middle East correspondent Yulan Nell gave me a sense of how the seire talks have gone so far well we had a White House spokesman say late yesterday that they had got off to a promising start the Israeli media this morning has been talking about guarded optimism saying it's a positive sign that the Israeli delegation that was sent the negotiating team uh decided to stay overnight despite what they see um as some security risk in Doha and that they are continuing these talks with us cat and Egyptian mediators uh today now Hamas as we were saying has not sent a delegation along to the these indirect talks um but of course Hamas leaders are present in Doha and what mediators have been saying is they have ways um to get messages back to Hamas um so this is not seen as as being um the obstacle that it may appear to be and you land in the meantime development on the West Bank Israeli political leaders including Benjamin Netanyahu and two far-right ministers have condemned a large group of Jewish settlers who went on the Rampage in a village in the occupied West Bank setting houses and cars on fire settlers some of them wearing masks were armed with batons rocks and molto Cocktails as they descended on the village of jit at least one Palestinian was killed another seriously injured and it's a reminder that youan that there's violence quite often in the West Bank that is less well reported than events in Gaza that's right although we've had these strong comments coming from Israeli leaders the president calling it a pogram for example um this is by far you know far from an isolated incident um we have the UN AA agency which has been monitoring attacks on Palestinian civilians by extremist settlers saying that since the start of the war in Gaza they have um found something like 1,250 attacks by settlers um on Palestinians and there have been on top of that you know something like um 17 18 Palestinian communities where people have been forced by by settler harassment away from their homes um those communities in some places um having uh settlers move in setting up a temporary outposts there those are uh sort of seeds of settlements um that are not even authorized by the Israeli authorities all settlements seen as being illegal under international law we had the White House also coming out quickly to condemn uh what is happen saying that such violence against Palestinian civilians was unacceptable and must stop there have been lots of complaints from the International Community from Israeli NOS as well there is a sense of impunity when it comes to a lot of these attacks uh you do not see prosecutions by the Israeli authorities let's speak now to Nomi bakov a Middle East expert and Associate fellow of International Security program at chattam house who's in our Westminster Studio thanks very much indeed for being with us I just wonder what your impression is of the the talks that have restarted in Doha and the progress so far and How likely it is that there'll be some kind of a a concrete outcome this time round thank you very much Lauren for having me um on the show this morning I think that the talks are very serious I think we're at a critical stage we're at a make or break stage and I think that is known not only to the three mediators Qatar Egypt and um the us but also to Israel and Hamas and therefore um we are at a um pivotal moment a Breaking Point and I'm cautiously optimistic I think talks are going well and the lines have been drawn dra they're very very clear and hopefully there will be an outcome of a an agreement on a framework uh it's not unlikely that all the details will be ironed out today but it is very much my hope and the hope of the mediators and the parties that a framework will be agreed and thereby the implementation will be what is going to um need further discussions Beyond today now Hass are not attending directly but they are based Doha some of the some of their political uh fellows are based in in Doha so they presumably will get some of the feedback from the talks do you think it makes any difference that they're not uh directly attending no I don't actually I think that given that the Hamas leadership is based in Doha they are essentially a part of the uh negotiation but in in any event the Israelis and the Hamas Niks are not sitting in the same room with the negotiators so they are being um updated regularly by the mediators and feedback is coming in so I think yes they announc that they're not sending anyone but they're actually there what do you expect in terms of any kind of retaliation from Iran or hisbah for the uh killings of the of isma Hanah and also the hisbah commander recently there was some talk that perhaps if a ceasefire in Gaza were achieved that might be be taken off the table do you think that they will still go ahead anyway with some kind of form of retaliation well I think everything hinges on the outcome of these current negot negotiations so um hisbah have vowed to um retaliate for the assassination of H shuker for which Israel took responsibility and um Iran have vowed to retaliate for the assassination of isma Hanah the political leader of Hamas on their soil you know into Iran two weeks just over two weeks ago that said um there have been tremendous diplomatic efforts both behind the scenes and openly to ensure that no retaliation takes place um at and that a chance is before a cease a chance for a ceasefire agreement is being given and the Chance is now so I think everyone everything hinges on the outcome of this particular negotiation if an agreement a framework agreement will be reached I don't think we will see an Iranian and Hezbollah immediate retaliation if an agreement is not reached on the other hand then I think we're all doomed and I think we're going to see a very serious coordinated uh retaliation with between uh um Iran Iran's many long arms proxies in the region and hisbah noi Yakov thank you very much indeed for joining us thank you thank you Lauren
