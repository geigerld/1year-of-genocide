at 10 the worst single Mass killing of Palestinians in the Israel Gaza War so far hundreds are dead after a blast at a hospital chaos and horror at the scene much of the building has been destroyed a panic to treat the injured thousands of people were Sheltering at the hospital having fled Israel's bombing campaign targeting Hamas they thought they were safe now gazans once again count the cost of this war Israel denies it was responsible blaming Palestinian Islamic Jihad Jordan Egypt the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia condemn what they say was an Israeli attack the Missile hit the hospital not long after dark Allah you can hear the impact the explosion destroyed Al akley hospital it was already damaged from a smaller attack at the weekend the building was flattened very soon video was posted from Gaza of bodies laid out near the ruins of the hospital so many dead and the size of the explosion together looked to be having a profound impact on what was already the most dangerous crisis in the Middle East in a [Music] generation the wounded were taken across Gaza City to shifa hospital the Israeli Army's First Response said hospitals were highly sensitive and not targets of its military and urged caution about what it called the UN verified claims of a terrorist organization that statement will not be believed by Palestinians and by millions of others in the Middle East who see these images the wounded and the dying pouring into shifa from alaki arrived at a hospital already overwhelmed by thousands of casualties from Israeli a strikes it was already struggling to treat patients after Israel Cut Off fuel water food and deliveries of medical supplies Jordan and Egypt condemned Israel for a dangerous escalation Jordan said the International Community should pressure Israel to stop its attacks to prevent what it called wide cycles of violence as Fury and fear gripped Palestinians Israel denied that it was responsible we would not deliberately Target a hospital now my information that I have just received from the highest Authority because I asked about this I know you would ask me about this is that all indications are that this was not Israeli ordinance but this was rather a Hamas rocket that fell short now I want to explain this from past conflicts with the terrorists in Gaza we know that on average about 33% of the rockets that they shoot at us fall short and land in Gaza pictures posted on social media show many children among the casualties in Gaza so many people needed treatment that the corridors of shifa Hospital were packed the destruction of alaki hospital is also spreading fear among the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled to gaza's Southern border with Egypt after Israel told them to leave their homes there's 8, people here at night it's usually rockus it's loud people are you know running kids are running around tonight there is silence absolute silence you can't hear a thing the people are just in absolute shock about what's happened it's really really shocking and and I just don't know what to say I have no words anger spilled onto the streets in the Occupy West Bank the other part of the Palestinian territories that's separated from Gaza by Israel since Hamas attacked out of Gaza on the 7th of October there had been fears that mass casualties caused by Israel's response could ignite West Bank towns that have been the center of unrest for well over a year the young men on the streets and Palestinian armed groups in the West Bank will not believe Israel denials the latest from Israel's prime minister blaming what he called barbaric terrorists for the attack the attack is a seismic event in a war that might spread elsewhere in the Middle East there are reports that the Palestinian president has canceled a meeting with the US president who's due in Israel tomorrow morning on a mission that was aimed at easing the plight of Palestinian civilians and who will now walk into an even deeper crisis let's just pick up with Jeremy boen our International editor um if we can and I just want to make the point Jeremy that obviously this is a shocking event tonight that we've all seen both sides um are putting forward competing claims about who is responsible trying to get at the truth of this is going to be very difficult indeed yeah it will do uh will be Clive and of course more than anything it's an appalling tragedy for the hundreds of people who were killed the thousands who were injured their families in a place where civilians are already going through uh a terrible ordeal now in terms of the different assertions that are being made uh Israel very quickly denied it had anything to do with it even more quickly Arab countries blamed Israel it wasn't just Hamas blaming Israel it was uh Egypt and Jordan who have peace treaties with Israel it was the United Arab Emirates which normalized relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords it was Saudi Arabia who until all this started was talking to the Americans about normalizing relations with Israel so that already is a sea change in the the the complexities of politics in the Middle East and I think that the way that this is going already the sheer volume of casualties on top of all the other people in all the other people all the other civilians in Gaza who've been killed I think that is enormously dangerous and inflammatory and I think as well that uh the consequences of this could be very serious
