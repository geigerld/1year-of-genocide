this is the Delk pedrol station here in the Israeli city of ashdod and as you can see this is the damage caused by a Palestinian rocket strike this morning it struck about 7:30 or 8:00 in the morning and look at the fire that started at these pumps here they're almost entirely destroyed and the fire spread right up to the ceiling have a look on the roof there and that black that soot and if you look down there here's the damage the rest of the petrol station two more pumps were knocked out the glass has been shattered a paramedic I've just been speaking to says that six people were injured one seriously that person was taken to hospital and this may be one of the most serious strikes from Gaza to Israel uh in recent days Palestinian militants have fired more than 500 Rockets towards Israel many of them have been intercepted but for some reason the rockets that were fired here this morning were not intercepted so it shows that despite Israel's air strikes despite its intention to stop Rockets rocket fire continues to land here in Israel
