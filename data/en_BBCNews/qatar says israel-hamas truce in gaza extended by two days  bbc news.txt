well let's turn to those developing lines that have just been coming in because katar says deal has been agreed to extend the truce in Gaza for another two days there's been no confirmation yet from Israel but that is being reported by the Reuters news agency also the AFP news agency a fourth exchange of hostages for prisoners appears closer after Israel notified relatives of those about to be released so let's head back to Tel Aviv back to Anna Foster and Anna things appear to be moving after some delay they are Matthew as we were discussing just a few minutes ago as well it is the qataris who have made that announcement about the extension in this ceasefire we've also had a statement now from Hamas on their official website Hamas declaring that it has agreed it says with katar and Egypt it doesn't obviously mention Israel it says it has agreed with katar and Egypt to extend the temporary humanitarian truce for an additional 2 days under the same conditions that were reached before and as we were discussing you know katar are very much the people who were driving this you can see there that tweet uh on X on your screen just now the state of katar announces as part of the ongoing mediation an agreement has been reached to extend the humanitarian truce for an additional two days in the Gaza Strip This is Majed alansari who's the official spokesperson for the qari ministry of Foreign Affairs um as we were saying Matthew we were discussing this this just in the last 10 minutes or so weren't we saying that you know it is very much something that we we expected because the momentum the the mood music the messaging that was coming out from parties like Egypt who also sit around the table was strongly that the parties were in favor of this happening we reflected that that from the beginning of this deal being put in place there were Provisions that enabled it to continue for a little bit longer there was a longer a list of Palestinian prisoners uh who would be eligible for release um that was published then was needed 150 names would have covered those four days but they published the names of 300 Israel had said that they would be prepared to extend the ceasefire for an extra 24 hours for every additional 10 hostages who were released now interestingly Matthew for the first four days of this deal we saw uh 13 hostages a day um what Israel had offered for the extension was 10 a day but it seems to they're talking about the same conditions as previously so that means we would expect to see over those additional two days 13 Israeli hostages freed each day in return for 39 Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails they do it on a 3:1 ratio but we do now have that confirmation from the qataris that that has been agreed and that that ceasefire which would have ended at the end of today at the end of day four will now continue for two further days making this a six day day agreement in total Anna it is uh well the weather is much poorer today and there are fewer people in the Square but I know you've been talking to hostage families throughout the last four days give me a sense of uh where many of those people are because for many they will have seen those scenes of reunions be uplifted by that pleased for those families but of course so many of the families still awaiting the return of their loved ones not on any so far that's right and actually Matthew that's that's a really pertinent question because one thing that has been common of all of the hostage families that I've spoken to and and particularly hostage families who knew that they have male relatives who are waiting to be released who were never going to be part of this deal because this deal was only ever going to involve women and children and when you speak to th those people who are waiting for male relatives they were you know they were were really pleased about the deal because they said look any release in it opens the door to something further if we can achieve successful releases of hostages then even though we know that our loved ones are not part of this deal it shows that it can be done it proves that there is ground that can be worked on that there's a foundation there for this to be extended and I think this this further two days of this deal um shows that that you know they they were right to have to have that level of Faith now we're still looking at at a a relatively small number um you know there was originally around 240 hostages that were being held of a a variety of different nationalities so what this doesn't do is is you know is is fully release all of those hostages but but the family's opinion is is a really important one and and you're right to focus on that Matthew because they've also become a very close-knit group as well and in fact the the joy and happiness that you see from some of those families even when the relatives that are being released are not theirs because they've met each other they've they've held vigils together they've held protests together they they've you know met these new people become very close to them and they feel that joy as well for their new friends that they have have seen their relatives released but I think for every step along the way for every release it offers a bit of Hope and and hostage families will be feeling more of that again tonight Anna Foster once again there in Tel Aviv thanks very much we'll be back to you in a short while
