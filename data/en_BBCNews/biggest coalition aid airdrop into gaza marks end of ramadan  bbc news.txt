now on Tuesday nine countries took part in the biggest Coalition Aid airdrop in a single day into Gaza the scale of the delivery was time to Mark the end of Ramadan 14 aircraft delivered 10 tons of food and essential Aid in an operation led by the Jordanian Air Force the UK was among the participating Nations Britain's foreign secretary David Cameron said thousands of people in desperate need would benefit Israel's been under International pressure to allow more Aid trucks access by land and work is continuing on a maritime air Corridor our diplomatic correspondent James landel joined the Royal Air Force flight delivering Aid to Gaza at an Airbase in Jordan piles of humanitarian Aid stacked into individual pallets adorned with their own parachute all of it Bound for Gaza on the tarmac 14 military aircraft getting ready for the largest Coalition airdrop since began last month a special delivery to Mark the end of Ramadan inside pilots and Crews from nine Nations being briefed on the Operation Safety a key concern in the small airspace over Gaza outside the RAF plane is loaded each pallet containing flour rice sugar beans baby food oil and water the basics for a meal this the raf's sixth airdrop so far it is not that much but I tell you what it's the effort that counts as in every little helps um I'm quite proud and privileged to be involved in this s of mission but is it enough will it meet the needs of the people in Gaza the aircraft's carrying 12 of these pallets now each of them are about a ton so that means this entire payload is worth about one truck crossing a border on the ground the air Crews here insist that cumulatively the air drops are beginning to have an impact this is a sustained effort um we've been here for 3 weeks now and we're we're continually delivering um with the aid um the people of Gaza are very grateful for the efforts that we're going to and we'll keep delivering and keep delivering until we can't give them anymore in the air we fly the short distance to Gaza then we're over the Drop Zone the pilots are satisfied no one's below and the back ramp lowers these air drops are expensive and inadequate a symbol of the failure to get Aiden by other means but we're told they're better than nothing and they are making a difference 12 boxes out all On Target on the Northern Shore these air drops can be dangerous people have been crushed in the Stampede to get to the pallets but there's little that can be done from the air so today the Skies over Gaza were filled with parachutes Israel said more Aid trucks are getting through but how many is not clear this aid from the air will not fill the Gap but the air Crews involved hope believe it is making a difference to so many facing famine on the ground James land lbbc news over Gaza
