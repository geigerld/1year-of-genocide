let's turn to the Middle East now where Israel and Hamas are being pressed to accept a ceasefire proposal outlined by President Biden the US says they have every expectation that Israel will accept a ceasefire proposal that would begin with a cessation of hostilities for six weeks in Gaza a surge of humanitarian Aid and an exchange of some hostages for Palestinian prisoners as pressure grows so does the fighting in Gaza Palestinian media reporting a series of Israeli air strikes on refugee camps on Sunday in which they say about 20 people were killed feda alaraj is in Rafa and she told us about the current situation there the situation in Rafa is is unbelievably um horrific I can't really describe it in words hundreds of thousands of people are displaced yet again like we were displaced to ra um people are going back to places that has no water no facility is no access whatsoever but they are fleeing literally for their lives uh in terms of food like um uh the markets are better than than other days however the prices are still super high the access to cash uh liquidity is extremely difficult the use of banking apps or banking transfers is also not an option because of difficulties in telecommunication and internet access so even if we have a little bit more food than usual in the market it's still extremely difficult to get when you ask me about the seire proposal to be super honest I stopped caring I stopped following these news for me it's just another proposal in a series that has failed so so far because to be honest it seems that all the W put together uh fails to hold Israel accountable or even less to just manage to stop them from what they're doing here I'm concerned that I will not have a future to be worried about at all so that gives you an idea of daily life and Rafa at the moment but nonetheless this dpy proposal is on the table now here's the view of what needs to happen for that to progress from our International editor Jeremy bar well they have to say yeah we'll do the deal but also there are a lot of granular details that they would have to go through like for example the ratio of released hostages to prisoners what kind of prisoners what might they have done and what sort of hostages as well old people old people and women including female soldiers those sorts of calculations uh the proposed proposal that Biden laid out which he said of course and it's been repeated by his officials that it's a it's an Israeli proposal it's what he said um is in it there are six week blocks basically where this would happen now uh of course the issue is um is the politics on both sides whether it's acceptable or not the Hamas have always said they're fine with the ceasefire as long as the ceasefire means the war is over period and Israel gets out of the Gaza Strip and from the Israeli point of view since Biden made his speech uh the prime minister's office has made it clear that what they're concerned about uh is sticking with their objectives which is the dismantling and destruction of herass as a political and military force and that of course as an objective has been criticized because how do you actually Define all of that and as well as that one other thing of course it's the Israeli political Dimension which is that Mr Netanyahu is reliable is is his government depends on the votes of extreme Jewish Ultra nationalist parties who made it clear that they're not at all interested in these kinds of deals in fact what they want to do is even go in there set up a government in Gaza and settle Jews in a lot of the territory as well to pick up on one of those points then Jeremy when you you hear Israeli defense minister yov Galant he's been speaking in the past hour or so backing up uh Mr Netanyahu saying we not accept the rule of Hamas and Gaza at any point at any stage does that mean that the ceasefire is just a non-starter when that that's the perspective of Mr Netanyahu uh well that phrase nonstarter has actually has been used by his office in the context of their their wider objectives yes Israel is prepared to have a SE f once we've managed to they would say destroy uh destroy hamas's rule in Gaza and from the Hamas point of view they know that in this kind of asymmetric Warfare between a powerful State and a militia group uh Victory from the militia group is survival uh and it's the fact that that they they're still there at the very end of things and the point being made by a lot of observers including in a an interview that's come up um today with the former prime minister former Army Chief of Staff Former Defense Minister uh eood Barack and he said look Israel is saying that when they've done Rafa that'll be it he said no it won't be it they have to send troops elsewhere into the Gaza Strip the point is is that it turned into an Insurgency or is turning into an Insurgency in other words there will be men with kalashnikovs and Rocket propeller grenades popping out of holes in the ground perhaps for months firing them at Israelis and the fact they can fire them is what for them counts as resistance and a continuing fight and for Israel might count as not fully eradicating uh Hamas the you know close allies of the Prime Minister have said that this might go on for the the rest of the year or longer Jeremy what's your view of America's influence right now and President Biden you made the point that he has said you know this is an Israeli proposal obviously trying to put some more pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu there but where do you think he's at with us well I I think I think Biden's quite conflicted because his instincts are to back Israel to the hilt but he has an appalling relationship like other um American Presidents particularly Democrats have had with uh with Benjamin Netanyahu uh from the very beginning he's been offering them advice he said look America's got your back we will back you up and they've been doing that sending over vast amounts of Weaponry plus absolutely invaluable diplomatic protection in the UN Security Council a vetoing resolutions calling for ceased Fires for example um and at the same time Netanyahu basically has not been taking his advice because he calculates that he can speak over the head of the president to Israel's allies of which there are many in the US Congress but Biden's problem is it's an election year and the polls are saying that he's used he in what will be a close election he's losing vital votes because of what's seen as um uh a support of Israel that's gone above and beyond what America should have done for one of its allies that Israel critics would say have sacrificed the moral High Ground it might have had on the 7th of October and that Mr Biden by continuing on one hand to say look don't use these very heavy weapons in civilian areas and then on the other hand transporting loads more heavy weapons 2,000lb bombs and the like to the Israelis uh that that his protestations therefore seem unconvincing and Hollow but I think the time has come now he said himself in that speech he said look this war has got to end and the argument he and he said there will be people in Israel who won't agree with this but the argument that he makes is that Hamas cannot do another 7th of October attack and so that should be it but from netanyahu's problem apart from the fact that he might lose his Coalition over it which for him is a big big deal uh he's defined Victory as the eradication of Hamas and if they stop now well clearly with the senior leadership of Hamas in Gaza uh still um at Liberty and with their their their Fighters opening up up on Israeli soldiers when they get the opportunity then clearly Hamas is still there
