00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 align:start position:0%
think we'd have to go in and physically
 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.670 align:start position:0%
think we'd have to go in and physically
remove<00:00:55.559><c> the</c><00:00:56.000><c> Rockets</c><00:00:56.520><c> the</c><00:00:56.640><c> missiles</c><00:00:57.239><c> and</c><00:00:57.399><c> the</c>

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.990 align:start position:0%
launching infrastructure it's the only
way<00:00:59.480><c> I</c><00:00:59.559><c> could</c><00:00:59.680><c> see</c><00:00:59.800><c> it</c><00:01:00.000><c> being</c><00:01:00.239><c> quiet</c><00:01:00.600><c> anytime</c>

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
way I could see it being quiet anytime
 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.559 align:start position:0%
