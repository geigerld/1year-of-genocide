the United States has tonight launched a drone strike in the Iraqi Capital Baghdad killing a senior leader of an armed pro-iran group three people were killed in the attack including a commander of the group that us officials say was behind recent attacks on us bases in Iraq and Syria in a moment we'll speak to our International editor Jeremy Bowen in Israel but first oliran is in Baghdad for us tonight and Alla you try to get close to the scene of this attack this evening what happened well this was an attack at 9:30 in the evening Sophie there were three audible explosions we could hear them at our hotel and this is a time when people are out on the streets in Baghdad when cafes and restaurants are open now we got to the scene pretty quickly there was a security presence already there of Iraqi police and we tried to approach the burnt out wreck to speak to people and ask them about what they had seen and heard and we were very very quickly surrounded there was a lot of anger a lot of hostility in the crowd uh people telling us we were not welcome because foreigners were responsible for what had happened for the attack on the Iraqi commander and therefore we as foreigners were not welcome at the location now we were not harmed we were able to pull back to an area where even more security forces were arriving and members of Iraqi SWAT teams and then a crane came in to take away the wreckage of the car and the crowd actually started following now there have been calls tonight from uh Shia paramilitary leaders pro-iranian militia leaders for their supporters to come out on the streets to show their anger there have been calls also for retaliation specifically one militia leader saying We Want Blood for Blood now us Central Command has said this was a necessary strike to protect American lives and that they would not hesitate to take further measures in the future but we've already we've already had one very angry response from the Iraqi military saying this is a threat to sovereignty and to Safety and Security in the country and it's hard to see how it can do other than increase the level of tension here Allan with the very latest there from Baghdad thank you well let's go to our International editor Jeremy Bowen who is in Jerusalem Jeremy just put in context how significant this escalation is tonight well it's clearly a serious escalation though the Americans are saying this is really about stability in sending a message to Teran it all depends what happens when the inevitable retaliation occurs and whether they do get as all is said Blood for Blood and whether that blood is American because that will then uh prompt another American response without doubt now the whole region is a flame and here in Jerusalem The American Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has been meeting uh Palestinian president mahmmed abas and also the Israeli Prime Minister uh Mr Netanyahu and he's been trying to pull off Mr blink a diplomatic miracle if you like to close the gap between Israel's position on a ceasefire in Gaza and the position held by Hamas now as well as that there's concern about what's happening north of here on the border with Lebanon where there has been an increasingly intense war going on since October the 7th and Israel says that if hisbah the pro Iranian group in Lebanon doesn't pull back from the border then it will take even more action and I've been up right up to that Frontier Israel's border with Lebanon feels isolated and empty in Matula Israel's most Northerly Community the only residents left are mobilized Army reservists here they're surrounded on three sides by hisbah Iran powerful Ally in Lebanon one of the men who didn't want his face shown pointed to his brother's positions mile and then to the north is half a mile the border with leanon and then in the east of us it is half a mile definitely can can turn into a big war and a big war with hisbah it's not like Hamas the real army very trained greatly equipped great intelligence and they have a lot of experience real experience in Syria Israel released video of their attacks and what they said were hisb positions tens of thousands of civilians on either side of the Border have been evacuated the war there is intensifying yeah more urgent for Anthony blinkin is a ceasefire in Gaza but prime minister Netanyahu doubled down calling for total Victory and dismissing the h Mass response to the US ceasefire proposal the US Secretary of State still believes a deal is possible and at the agq of the rivals of Hamas the Palestinian Authority he repeated to president Mahmud Abbas that America wants a Palestinian state which Israel's leader opposes and reminded Israelis later that their suffering was no justification for killing Palestinian civilians that cannot be a license to dehumanize others the overwhelming majority of people in Gaza had nothing to do with the attacks of October 7th and the families in Gaza whose survival depends on deliveries of aid from Israel are just like our families their mothers and fathers Sons and Daughters Gaza is the key to stabilizing the Middle East this is the occupied Goan Heights another potential flash point where the borders of Israel Lebanon and Syria meet over on the Syrian side you can see ruins from previous Wars Anthony blinkin warns this is the most dangerous moment for the Middle East since 1973 without a ceasefire in Gaza the risks that a wider war will intensify remain very real Israel has heavily reinforced its northern Borderlands this is a former Syrian base occupied by the Israelis since 1967 inside the ruin the head of the Regional Council a retired Colonel Was preparing for the worst if we go from here to where we going to hia then they they bomb Us in hia then we go to T Aviv then Bas in in t AV people prefer to move by night on the most exposed roads in Northern Israel in places shielded by blast prooof concrete walls don't think of this war on the Lebanese border as a side sh to Gaza it could become even worse this is the most dangerous the most unstable Frontier in the Middle East at the moment what started as a low-level War back in October has been intensifying but all sides know how much worse it could get not just causing great destruction in Israel and in Lebanon but it's also got the capacity to ignite the region the fate of the whole Middle East not just Israel's empty evacuated Northern towns depends on breaking through the shock and hatred of War so far the diplomats are fighting a losing battle Jeremy bow
