tens of thousands of people have fled Northern Gaza and many still remain after the Israeli military gave him 24 hours to leave the area before it launches a major ground offensive they were ordered to move South of the Wadi Gaza as as Israeli troops prepare to hunt down and Destroy Hamas which is regarded as a terror organization by many Western governments including the UK around 1,00 people have died so far in Israeli air strikes on Gaza according to Palestinian officials limited raids in Gaza have already taken place and there are reports that the bodies of some Israeli hostages have been recovered the hostages were snatched a Week Ago by Hamas militants in raids which have left 1300 people dead our reporter Nick Johnson has the latest details fleeing for their lives those living in the north of the Gaza Strip heading south 1.1 million people roughly the same size as the entire population of Birmingham were told by Israel they had 24 hours to leave their homes it happened to our grandfathers now it's happening to us Muhammad says it's raising the ghosts of the past the bombs still fall tearing buildings and families apart oh I want my daddy this little girl [Music] cries Israel says it's already launched some localized ground raids inside Gaza while it readies its next move a warning from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu we are striking our enemies with an unprecedented power our enemies have just begun to pay the price I can't divulge what comes next but I can tell you this is just the beginning the UN Secretary General urged both sides to protect civilians even Wars have rules International humanitarian law and human rights law must be respected and upheld civilians must be protected and also never use the shields it's exactly a week since Hamas gunman Ram paged through southern Israel families still coming to terms with the lives lost this memorial for Tom godo killed while protecting his wife and three children during the attack on a kibot at least 150 Israelis were kidnapped families of the victims leaning on each other for support katia's son among those missing thing we are very anxious our hope is that our child comes back we cannot think otherwise our child has to come home a deep sense of for boing the ratcheting up of this crisis seems inevitable Nick Johnson BBC News well we're now joined by Lord Mark Malik Brown former deputy Secretary General of the UN and current president of the open Society foundations thank you for joining us we've been discussing the proposal put forth by Russia to call for a ceasefire what's your feeling on this proposal do do you think there's any chance that a ceasefire might be implemented I mean it'd be wonderful if there could be a ceasefire and you know the Brazil Brazilians who chair the security Council this month have also got a much more balanced resolution which begins with a condemnation of Hamas for its attacks on Israeli citizens and then goes on simly to call for a ceasefire to allow proper humanitarian access and support to civilians at risk in Gaza and you know I I would love to believe that the security Council can can come together around that but in fact there are a pretty wide range of views at the moment with some Western countri us particularly you know certainly calling for humanitarian restraint but also you know feeling and their correct in law that Israel has an absolute right to uh you know strike back at Hamas which it does um and by putting that first and foremost it's inhibited its ability to the US has inhibited its ability to also demand a ceasefire and respect for the rule of law and the and for humanitarian law so you know the trouble is a lot of Israel's friends are a little ambivalent at Best in their messaging you know recognizing Israel's right to self-defense and then leaving very much in second place uh respect for uh the civilians at risk and and so it it's tragically hard to see how we get quickly enough to a point where both sides pause hold back and try and allow a little space not just for humanitarian protection but for the beginnings of diplomacy as well Lord Malik Brown then what do the discussions that are going on at un headquarters in New York tell us about the the health the strength of the United Nations in general is there any prospect that the UN as a body can really Institute peace between the Israelis and the the Palestinians well look I think the Secretary General who you know has been criticized quite a lot lately for a fairly sort of weak performance at the recent UN General Assembly when he sort of acknowledged his organization was broken has had actually a good first week of this crisis he has an article in today's New York Times which is very balanced which uh calls for a suspension of the violence and uh humanitarian protection and acknowledges the longstanding wrongs against both communities against Israel Israelis and against Palestinians and the need for both uh to to have a political voice and to arrive at a political solution uh to their decades long uh confrontation and but the security Council as I say while I think it's a happy accident that this month it's chaired by Brazil a country which is always trying to find peace and a m way to any conflict it's been criticized we trying to do that in the case of Ukraine and Russia but I think that's exactly the skill set we need in the chair of the council at the moment but you know so and and you know similarly the humanitarian Chief at the UN has spoken out strongly against the risk of the risk the one million Palestinians who are being pressed by Israel to move to the south of the country the Red Cross has come out strongly so you know there are a lot of principled moral voices speaking up but you know to the real import of your question will it lead to an early resolution of this I suspect not this you know a terrible crime was committed last weekend and I suspect Israel will not be satisfied until it is you know militarily uh disarmed neutralized Hamas but what Israel needs to remember and what the UN needs to keep saying is there may be a military solution to Hamas that is not a military solution to the Palestinians uh for the Palestinian people there has to be a political solution and that's been postponed for decades and each time there's a crisis like that this it seems to get kicked further back into the long ground Lord Mal Brown as as you're speaking I just want to to bring in an alert that we've just received um from AFP they're saying that Saudi Arabia has paused talks on the normalization of ties with Israel can you reflect on that development where does that leave Israel now that those those talks that have been going on for quite some time now fostered by the United States with Saudi Arabia have been paused well I I think this would was anticipated it would have been impossible for Saudi Arabia to have continued them at this time uh you know it is in recent years been quite quiet on the issue of Palestinian rights but when uh the events of this week unfolded it you know raised its voice much more clearly in defense of uh the Palestinian people and it would be just in terms of uh the Optics and politics of the region impossible to press on uh in any effort to to to normalize relations with with Israel at the very same time that Israel was seen as attacking Palestinian Arab civilians uh in Gaza but I don't know whether in the longer term I mean I think this is now up to Israel whether it wants to close that door forever which would be the result of a which will happen I think if it makes a long-term occupation or long-term milit milary intervention uh into Gaza or whether it recognizes the need to contain its military action in as Surgical and brief a form as possible so that it can get this back on track because for both Israel and Saudi Arabia the stakes are high it would be a reordering of of the Middle East in a dramatic way and I think uh you know there will be a desire to try once the fighting is dies down to to try and recover this negotiation okay really good to hear your thoughts on the Diplomatic front Lord Mark Malik Brown former deputy Secretary General of the UN and current president of the open Society foundations Lord Malik Brown reflecting there on the news that Saudi Arabia has paused talks on normalization of ties with Israel that information coming to us from AFP and we'll bring you more on that when we get
