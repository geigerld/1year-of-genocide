Israel's war cabinet has met for a second time in less than 24 hours to discuss how to respond to Iran's unprecedented drone and missile attack the government has not made public whether a decision had been reached during the late night meeting but reiterated that there will be a response meanwhile the White House has described Iran's attack on Israel over the weekend as a spectacular and embarrassing failure nearly all of the more than 300 missiles and drones were shot down earlier s shahata from BBC Arabic explained what we've learned about Israel's next moves this is no decision was announced yet but uh the agreement within the cabinet is about a response uh the uh military Chief of Staff Mr hery halvi said the Iranian attack will be met with a response but the discussing the uh the scale and timing of the response because this will affect if will be escalation or how the Iranian respond because Iranian said what Israeli done to strike the Iranian Consulate in Damascus was a strategic mistake and what we what we the Iranian done was like a self-defense so in this case that's it but Israeli think it's damaging its reputation as Superior power in the uh in the Middle East so to be attacked on its soil by all of that even the damage was minimal inside the Israel it looks like a damage for its reputation as a super superpower so there is pressure on the cabinet and on the Mr Netanyahu to make a response however there is pressure also from United States and other like United Kingdom and Mr Cameron the uh foreign secretary the British foreign Ministry uh secretary said should be Israel should be smart it was a failure so they Tred to minimize the effect of the Iranian strike because the damage was minimal so they are the Israeli between uh two pressures one from inside and from outside respond or not and this like situation will be escalating if there is a response according to America and other allies to Israel that was BBC Arabic s shahata well let's speak to our Middle East correspondent who is in Jerusalem your land at Nell your land it's good to have you now what more are we hearing from Israeli officials I mean we're not hearing anything much on the record uh but a very clear message has being being sent in general that they will um retaliate for the unprecedented Iranian attack in the early hours of Sunday morning um we had the Israeli military's Chief of Staff uh going to the ne Team Air Base it was one of the the few sites um that was actually hit by ballistic missiles um in that attack um it suffered minor damage um and he was addressing the Air Force pilots there and saying to them that uh really that attack the use of so many um missiles and drones uh could not go um unmet and he was also complimenting them on their capabilities and their preparations um should their uh Services be required as part of that retaliation um of course there are other means at Israel's disposable they could uh go for something sort of more in terms of asymmetric Warfare uh the likes of uh the stuck net computer worm that we saw in the past that was used to effectively uh disable key parts of Iran's uh nuclear program uh this has been a shadow War that's gone on for so many years between Israel and Iran uh but now what's happened in recent days has really uh pushed things into the open it's of course causing so much concern uh for world leaders uh they are trying to uh persuade Israel to exercise restraint um and the real dilemma of Israel's war cabinet is how to send a powerful message to Iran uh but at the same time uh not escalate things in the region in an extremely dangerous way now Iran has been uh claiming that it gave advanced warning about this attack uh but as far as Israel is concerned how much of a a blow is this how how serious an attack or line do they feel has been crossed I mean certainly they say that um Iran has broken all red lines this was the first time that Iran had launched a direct attack on Israel from its own territory um but at the same time uh there is a real effort um by world leaders and of course uh here in Israel to to to Really look at this as having been a success because the attack was thwarted 99% of the missiles and drones that were launched were uh brought down and there was an alliance of Israel and the us the UK even Jordan in the region um and and others including uh the French that really helped here and that showed you know Israeli leaders have been pointing out that there is uh a strategic Alliance there can be Regional cooperation uh to counter the threat from Iran Iran has been putting out signals we saw it again overnight when the Iranian foreign minister and the Chinese foreign minister spoke that Iran itself does not want an escalation it considers now that it has retaliated for its first of April um the the 1 of April attack that it suffered in Damascus when there was an air strike that killed seven members of the Revolutionary guards at the Iranian consulate building uh in Syria um and the Iranians have been trying to say that what happened was their limited response uh for that deadly attack right really pains how volatile the situation is in the Middle East right now yoland Nell thank you so much for that update
