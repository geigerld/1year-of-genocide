because the humanitarian situation remains dire cancer patients say they're being denied exit for life-saving treatment through the Rafa Crossing to Egypt despite their names appearing on authorized evacuation lists in parallel fees charged by an Egyptian company arranging evacuations from Gaza have rocketed during the war becoming unaffordable for most the BBC's larara El gabali worked with producer haa albad on this report I'm on my way to the border crossing hopefully I will find my name there and be able to travel God willing this is s's third time at the Border in as many months she was being treated for leukemia when the conflict began leaving her and almost 10,000 other cancer patients in Gaza without treatment despite her name being on evacuation lists for the sick and the injured she was turned away at the border I read that my name was published on the RAF coordination groups my name was on the departure list twice I have been to the crossing point twice for no reason I was turned away Sahm's name appeared on this list for evacuation to Turkey on November 19th but border agents on the Palestinian side turned her away saying the Turkish Envoy wasn't there to receive her but we found that that wasn't the case MAA asoi was being treated for breast cancer and was on the same evacuation list ASM she was allowed to leave to Turkey for treatment that day and was even able to bring her two daughters with her after I got through the crossing onto the Egyptian side I saw the Turkish Consul waiting for us and I knew I was going to Turkey we've spoken to two other cancer patients who say they've been turned away at the border despite their names being on evacuation lists officials in Turkey told the BBC that they are not involved in approving the exit of patients from Gaza and that they are willing to treat as many patients as they receive only 600 cancer patients from Gaza have managed to leave since October 7th Israel vets who is allowed to leave Gaza the Israeli Ministry of Defense told us they have no restrictions on the number of patients allowed to leave for medical treatment Palestinian border authorities declined to comment on Sahm's case but it seems there are other ways to leave Gaza a lucrative Monopoly has emerged from the war with one Egyptian travel agency Hela charging Palestinians $5,000 per person to exit Gaza within 1 to 2 weeks this is more than four times the average annual salary in Gaza this man says he had to pay a Hela employee an extra $300 to get his family on the evacuation list we've hidden his identity they weren't letting anyone in if you wanted to go in you had to pay to be lay so then you could pay the $5,000 the fee was $5,000 for an adult and $25,000 for a child for Palestinian passport holders he is one of 10 people who told us they made extra payments of up to $4,000 to Hela employees to get their families evacuated but it seems the best connected in Gaza can leave without paying at all we found the names of Palestinian citizens on an evacuation list meant for Egyptians one of them told us they were helped to get on the list by someone with political connections neither Hela nor the Egyptian foreign Ministry responded to our questions in Gaza time is running out for Zim whose cancer is spreading we are uing now my medicine is finished I'm so tired I can hardly see in front of me no blood tests or anything my chapy ran out a long time ago without the money or connections many patients like sahm have been left behind
