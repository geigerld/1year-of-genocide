well as I mentioned we've also been taking a closer look at the evacuation Corridor south from the northern tip of Gaza which has been opened once again today and our reporter Merlin Thomas from BBC verify has been looking at that Corridor and what the journey South entails Israel has been ordering civilians in Northern Gaza to move South for their safety as they continue their offensive in the north but what does that mean for civilians of Gaza well the Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated areas on earth now there are over a million people people living in the northern part before this conflict started and the Israeli military have been telling people to move South using this specific Road Salah it's one of the two main arteries connecting the North to the South and we've seen some of them some of these people moving south as you can see some of them are carrying White Flags children men women carrying with them all the possessions that they have now this footage was filmed by the AFP news agency on Monday they spoke to one of those Guardians on the road about her experience it was so scary we saw tanks from both sides we didn't see soldiers just tanks we held our hands up and we kept walking there were so many of us we were holding White Flags it's true that we were scared but finally we made it through so how has the Israeli military been telling them these are some of those pictures of the mass drops of leaflets now these white specks you can see here are those leaflets dropping down from the Israeli military onto the ground and they had messages urging locals to move to the South for their own safety now they've also been posting messages on X for example this one today the Israeli military posted in Arabic that the main road here for evacuation the one we've just been talking about would be open between 10: in the morning and 4: in the afternoon local time yesterday the Israeli military posted a video on X showing the civilians walking on salahadin road now we've just paused this video here so so you can see an Israeli tank in the foreground we've managed to verify this using the shape of the buildings and the road composition as approximately 3 km north of worthy Gaza the what the Israelis consider to be the boundary between the North and South of Gaza we've also found this satellite imagery taken yesterday showing some of the stret of the road and if you look closely you can see here the outlines of people on the road moving down the road down south but if you look elsewhere in the image you can also see the damage to the buildings and the rubble and the debris that Spilled Out onto the road and this is what those people will have had to cross and finally if you look here you can actually spot an Israeli tank here too right next to the road which these people will have had to walk past we've also been analyzing satellite imagery captured on the 31st of October and the 3rd of November and using both of these we've been able to assess the amount of damage on the road and the buildings alongside it so every single Dot here every single red dot here represents damage of some kind to the road whether that's craters on the road to the tarmac of the road or buildings damag close to the road we can't tell exactly when this damage occurred but let's take a closer look at these two areas here this one here you can see a crater on the main road itself this is what people will have had to pass and this here you can see some buildings here in the middle destroyed and the debris that's scattered onto the road that people again will have had to cross now we don't know how many people have used this road to move to safety the UN suggested that thousands have moved on one single day but the question remains as the fighting continues in the north how many more desperate people will have to make this Choice Merlin Thomas from BBC verify looking at that evacuation South and the UN has estimated that one and a half million people in Gaza are now displaced well a little earlier I spoke to our colleague rushi abalu our correspondent inside Gaza he's in the southern part of Gaza in Khan Unice and asked him whether he had seen evidence of more people moving south today thousands of people arrived today since the opening hour was a bit a little bit bigger from 9:00 until until 4:00 but this journey is really miserable for the people I met a couple of them today who arrived to this Camp here in Naser Hospital people were walking for about 3 4 kilometers because there is no access for cars or any sort of Transportation so the people have to to walk I saw a father who's carrying his son over his shoulder in In The Heat Of The Sun uh which it's unusual weather here in Gaza in in November and it's really about 30 degree in Gaza but yes People Under The Sun were walking carrying their their kids there some of their belongings if they can and they made this journey into South why because the fighting in Gaza City is really intensified taking very serious fight near the alotz hospital in in Gaza it's this it's a t Hawa area it's a neighborhood in the southwest of Gaza as the tanks Advance very close to the hospital and people there very few people remain in the area and communication is really hard but I was talking to someone who flee this morning and he said it was a real gun battle in the in the area most of the buildings around that neighborhood from the beginning of the Israeli attack on on Gaza following the Hamas crossb attack this area was heavily bombed from Air for days and now it's been bombed from sea and from artillery units in the ground the the picture that I saw is really showing hundreds of targets has been like destroyed in this building this area is considered you know the most of the healthy people they live here it's it's quite a new area that was built 25 years ago most of the buildings are seven story building like compound in the area most of the building were hit either completely flatten to the ground or hit some of the great damage to some of the building the fighting also intensified near Beach camp Beach camp is the only refugee camp in Gaza City with about 60 70,000 people live in that camp most of them were left but people were still there and people were many bodies are under their houses according to health ministry here fighting and that direction is north west of Gaza it's all around the coastal the coastal road where all of the fighting is going on but also the tanks are advancing from another another position which is south of the city so now most of the tanks are surrounding significant part of the Gaza City and they are advancing High into the AL hospital where about 14,000 people are taking the hospital as shelter as well as 100 patient yesterday the hospital said that they can't move people they can't move patient from the hospital because there is no Road around it is not damaged
