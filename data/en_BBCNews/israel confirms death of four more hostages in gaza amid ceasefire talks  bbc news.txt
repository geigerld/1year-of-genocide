Israeli military has confirmed the deaths of four more hostages in Gaza three were Israeli Nationals and one a joint British Israeli National who was named as nadav poell their bodies were recovered in southern Gaza all had been taken by Hamas during the attack last October the precise details of their deaths is not known the Israeli military spokesman Daniel hagari made the announcement earlier today we shared the devastating news with the families of 8 5year Old amiram Cooper one of the founders of kibuts n Ro 8-year-old K Perry from kibutz n Ro 8-year-old yor metzgar from kibutz n Ro and 51-year-old Israeli and British citizen from kavell from kib that their loved ones were killed a few months ago during Kamas captivity in Gaza and their bodies are still being held by Hamas we assess that the four of them were killed well together in the area of kanun during our operation there against Hamas the information we confirmed by the relevant bodies after assessing new intelligence that we gathered over the last few weeks that was Daniel hagari there well the US says that it has submitted a resolution to the UN Security Council calling for the implementation of the three-stage Gaza C ceasefire and hostage deal unveiled by President Biden last week the first step of the peace plan is an initial 6 week ceasefire as negotiations are held in tandem eventually leading to an end in the fighting and the freeing of all the hostages and the final stage would be the Reconstruction of Gaza without hamus in power our Middle East correspondent Lucy Williamson has been speaking to people both inside Gaza and in the Israeli town of stot On the Border with Gaza to gauge their reaction to the new plan the price of gaza's war is rising as its cities crumble the price of Peace too high for leaders on both sides Israel said it had bombed more than 50 targets since yesterday but Hamas is still fighting here and hopes for the new ceasefire deal were mixed Hamas should raise its demands and seriously adhere to the conditions they set which are the people's demands Hamas accept the deal it's enough enough of what we lost we urge Hamas to stop the war Israel's prime minister is negotiating on two fronts his farride allies say he must continue the war until Hamas is destroyed or they'll bring down the government he's insisted that his conditions for a ceasefire haven't changed we have gone a long way to return the hostages while keeping the war's objectives in mind primarily the elimination of Hamas we insist that we will achieve both it's all part of the plan not something I've just added but Hamas has said it won't free more hostages without a guarantee the war will end tonight Israel learned that four more captives were confirmed to have died himim Perry yuram meta amiram kooper and British Israeli nadav Powell after almost 8 months of War much of Northern Gaza lies in Ruins but Israel's prime minister is struggling to end the war because he hasn't achieved his War goals he hasn't brought back all the hostages he hasn't destroyed Hamas the US President says Hamas is no longer capable of carrying out the kind of attack it did on the 7th of October but Israelis living here by the Gaza border say they still don't feel safe this is the last time yarin saw her neighborhood trapped in her home in stot by the Gaza border as Hamas gunman ran through the streets you know if my midle she and her three children fled to Jerusalem the next day as sees fire now she says won't be enough to send them home we will free hostages but few F years from from now your life will be you will be the next hostages you will be the next people that get murdered that the women that R the the all this will be happen again this is fire will kill us ending this conflict rests with the leaders of Israel and Hamas locked in a war for their own Survival Lucy Williamson BBC News stot well let's speak to our Middle East correspondent Yan now who's in Jerusalem for us hello land I understand there's an investigation that is being held into the deaths of these four hostages why is that so the Israeli military says the circumstances are still not clear uh which led to the men's deaths um earlier this year it appears during Israeli operations in Khan yunas in southern Gaza of course that was seen very much as being a stronghold of Hamas uh as Israeli Ground Forces moved in there um and the Israeli military is promising a full and transparent investigation into exactly what happened we did have last month Hamas saying that nadav Powell um the British Israeli citizen who was killed um had died of his wounds uh that he sustained in an Israeli air strike in April um of course that's not something that that could be verified we've only just had uh his death being uh confirmed um but you know the way that this was phrased by the Israeli military is that it is looking at all Poss possibilities into how the men and how the men were killed okay the United States uh telling us that they have submitted this peace plan uh proposal ceasefire proposal to the UN Security Council a lot of confusion as to who has said what and who's going to do what just take us through that yolan yeah so in this un Security Council proposal put forward by the US it's really um calling on Hamas to accept the three fa deal that President Biden laid out on Friday really presenting it as an Israeli ceasefire plan to bring the hostages home um and we had Egypt coming out saying that Hamas was looking at it positively although um it has not given an official response the confusion really comes on the Israeli side because uh just within the Israeli governing Coalition it's a fragile governing Coalition we've had very uh mixed messaging um those on the the far right two key ministers have said that they would be prepared to topple the government if there was agreement to what was called a reckless deal and then we had the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu really coming out talking to an Israeli parliamentary committee saying that um he would not um go for this um unless it meant there would still be full victory over Hamas a full dismantling um of Hamas it would not mean uh the end of the war and he was really suggesting it was possible for Israel to in effect agree to the first first uh stage of the plan go for that see many of the most vulnerable hostages being returned home during a 6 week ceasefire and then uh resume the war of course if that's the case it's something that it's very unlikely that Hamas would agree to it okay youand thank you very much indeed thank you
