thousands of young survivors from the Nova music festival in Israel are facing significant mental health challenges two months after the deadly Hamas attacks on October the 7th more than 360 partygoers were murdered there and another 40 were taken hostage there's concern that the scale of psychological support needed is greater than the state can provide so now trained volunteers are setting up their own centers to offer that help well our correspondent Anna Foster has visited one region in the north of Tel Aviv Their Eyes Were Hollow they they didn't look alive they couldn't look at us they could they would shake they couldn't eat they couldn't drink the evil that these people met is incomprehensible and and I told them early on as as dark the darkness you saw we're going to bring the light we're going to help you believe in yourselves and in others again let me show you exactly what people come here for because there's a whole section you can see on these bean bags people they come out and sometimes they talk or they can use it as a quiet space if they want to there are different workshops that people do again they don't always need to be talking about what happened to them that day or what they feel sometimes it's just a a way to focus on something to to keep your hands busy or to keep your brain busy and it's a place where people can talk they can get therapy sessions they can really have an opportunity in this space surrounded by people who went through the same thing as them to to work through some of the trauma of that day I'm leor galb um I'm 24 from beta and uh I survived the massacre that happened at the an NOA Festival um at 6:30 uh in the morning we started hearing Rockets uh flying above our heads started running towards the open field U we didn't know where we're going we didn't know what's happening we just heard automatic gunshots uh all around us um and then we managed to uh get inside Yuda and galit's car they had a big car and they were also running away from the massacre uh and they basically saved us they got us to safety and that's what happened to me and that's a lot for anybody to go through and and so you come here here and how does being here help you process all of that it's been a hard time for me listening to music since the Nova festival and since like it it's almost have been two months uh and I only feel comfortable hearing music with the concerts um and with the the artists that come here and um I really feel that the therapists are here to help and to listen and to be here with us itamar Cohen is a clinical psychologist he lives in London but flew here as soon as he could to help what kind of stories are people telling you about what they they saw and they lived through that day um people here seen tremendous amount of pain um some of them were extremely close to not being here um really people that been chased that needed to run through you know if you would say a mindfield they didn't know where it comes from and what about you how are you because obviously these stories that that you're hearing and I know this is your job but they are really distressing stories here all the therapists are working together we have time to see process to speak about the challenges to bring ourself in our vulnerabilities our fears so we have a space to to work that through and and to strengthen each other and that's that's quite a lot in these times so it helps you as well oh tremendously Anna Foster reporting there
