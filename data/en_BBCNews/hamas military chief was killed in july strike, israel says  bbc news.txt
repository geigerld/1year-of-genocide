so we begin with uh breaking news from the Middle East the Israeli military says it's received intelligence in the past few hours that confirms that the head of hamas's military Wing Muhammad Dave was killed in Gaza last month Israel's defense minister Yol gal yev Galant says his death is a significant milestone in the dismantling of Hamas Muhammad da was targeted in a strike on a compound in the hanun area on July the 13th the Israeli Army said at the time that another Hamas Commander was killed but said it did not have final confirmation on the fate of Dave well Hamas said that he survived the attack but did not provide proof it comes as tens of thousands of people are attending the funeral procession in tran of Hamas political Chief Ismael hania who was assassinated in the Iranian capital on Wednesday Iran has threatened a harsh punishment for his killing which it blames on Israel we can speak to our correspondent our Middle East correspondent yolan Nell who's in Jerusalem uh yolan can you just tell us the significance of this announcement that uh Muhammad Dave was killed in that attack yeah I mean there's the timing first of all just after we've had the news of these other two uh targeted killings in the past couple of days the Israeli military ping out this short statement confirming that in this strike in the south of Gaza uh two weeks ago it did in fact uh kill um this man he was long at the top of Israel's most wanted list Muhammad Dave um and really is seen as an architect of the 7th of October attacks the head of the Hamas military Wing uh in Gaza and somebody who really had a leading role in the organization for something like 30 years had been very much involved um in building up that network of tunnels in which he was believed to have continued during the war uh to command um many of the the Hamas military activities he was also very much involved in in building up its its bomb making capabilities but he was somebody who was so very much a shadowy figure he very rarely um was seen uh um and really you know didn't appear uh in public even just his voice I know that he was in the past the subject of several Israeli assassination attempts I remember during the 2014 War standing on the rubble of his home where his wife and two of his small children were killed but where uh he survived um we're just getting some footage yand um that I just want to bring to our viewers this is IDF uh aerial footage that uh claims to show that uh July the 13th incident where um the uh IDF is saying that Muhammad uh uh Dave um was killed um and presumably presumably that moment that he was killed there that we are seeing um Israel's defense minister yev Galant has has said this is a a significant milestone in the dismantling of of her Mass um what do you think could be the then the implications of this being revealed I mean it had been suspected that he was killed but really the facts um were unclear and we've had um a picture that yav Galant the defend Minister put out um on social media where he is shown um Crossing off the picture of Muhammad Dave from uh the Hamas command list the list of people that um Israel is really going after in in Gaza and I think a lot of focus now will be on what happens to Yahya sinoa who is the leader uh of the Hamas political Wing in Gaza also seen as having really masterminded the 7th of October attacks he uh now stays at the top of that wanted list but I think Israel has really wanted to show uh its own public and the world that it is determined to go after those who carried out those unprecedented um attacks um that killed something like 1,200 people last year Israel also believes that by putting this pressure on Hamas um ultimately it will make it more possible to get to a ceasefire and hostage release deal that it can agree to uh yoland for now thank you very much let's uh speak to our security Cy correspondent Frank Gardner for more on this so Frank we we heard that Iran has uh vowed Revenge after um the the death of uh Ismael hania and and now this has been announced what what do you think could be the potential escalations here well I think it's pretty news for ceasefire talks it's very good news for Israel this is somebody who as Yulan says that they've been after for some time Muhammad Dave is a hugely significant figure he's been described by the Israel is today by Israel as the assama bin ladin of Hamas so um I'm not quite sure that that's an accurate description because he was a military commander rather than the sort of necessarily the kind of intellectual brains which was more yaka sinoa but this is somebody who they've been targeting for a very long time as Yan says has been hiding in tunnels he's somebody who they would have liked to have killed right at the beginning of the whole Gaza uh ret iation operation for the October the 7th raid um and along with yaka sinoa he's right at the top of the tree that they've been trying to cut down to try to dismantle hamas's military operation Muhammad Dave was 58 he was born in 1965 in Khan Yunis the same place that he has reported to been killed in and he's been leading the what's known as the aadin Kasam brigades which is the military WI of Hamas now I remember that Hamas is a prescribed terrorist organization by many governments um and therefore some people in Israel certainly don't make any distinction between its military or its political wings but nevertheless he's very much he was very much the military commander on the ground in Gaza while is hania who was killed in tan in that air strike was the one shuttling around based in Doha doing a lot of the negotiations a lot of the talks what do you make of the timing of this announcement Frank do you think this is information that has just come to light to the IDF or do you think there is a a a strategy and the timing of this information being released it's hard to say I think probably you need to be in Jerusalem to know the kind of intricacies of that but certainly um Israel is is lashing out in all directions at the moment it's basically trying to send out deterence to those who are attacking it or uh tending to attack it that there are punishments for this that there is a cost with this so they've hit the houthis in Yemen they've hit Heda Port because the houthis have been sending explosive drones towards Israel and one of them was able to get through and reach Tel Aviv um they've hit Hezbollah they've hit the senior Commander there in beut uh even though Western governments have said please don't hit beut don't trigger a huge great big war across the Lebanon is Israel border but nevertheless they did that in a calibrated targeted strike I think some people are going to be asking if they're able to eliminate somebody in one of these targeted strikes albe it there are civilians probably killed alongside that why is it taken the deaths of 39,000 Palestinians in this 10mon long Gaza operation when there's simply after dismantling Hamas as a military organization so it's been a fairly weapon that the Israelis have used to hit Hamas so far what do you think will be the wider implications across the world I'm particularly thinking about the the US response uh to this news well the US has been very supportive uh of Israel's military aims they've been a lot less supportive and increasingly uh concerned at the rising number of Civilian casualties at the what they consider to be the unaccept able High number of Civilian casualties caused by Israel's operations in in Gaza and at the same time there is rising concern in the UN and the International Community at what's going on in the West Bank that tends to get ignored um in all the uh action that's going on on the Israel Lebanon border and also in Gaza but what's going on in the West Bank is um according to uh International workers that I've spoken to Aid workers and others it's pretty bad in terms of the um appropriation of Palestinian land uh the persecution of Palestinians been having their Olive Groves burnt that they have farmed for decades and the in there have been plenty of recorded instances of the Israeli police and military simply standing by or even assisting as settlers um attack Palestinian communities there so all of that is feeding into sense of hopelessness um so while Israel is certainly will be Israelis will be congratulating themselves today on the deaths of of Muhammad and um sh in hisbah in beut and to to some extent is malania as well um nevertheless it doesn't change the fact that the Israel Palestinian situation has yet is a long way off being resolved um and that's that that's the fundamental driver of this conflict that there is still no independent self-governing state for the Palestinians they are still occupied and that's feeding into the violence Frank Gardner we appreciate your assessment on that thank you very much
