and we begin with events in the Middle East where Israel appears to be trying to gather international support following the Iranian air strikes but has not so far at least carried out any direct military action in response instead Israel is calling for more sanctions on Iran which itself has warned Israel against attempting any retaliation following those drone and missile attacks which Iran says were a response to an Israeli attack on its diplomatic mission in Syria Chief International correspondent Lee duet has been sending us updates from Jerusalem Israel says it is now launching a diplomatic offensive the Israeli foreign minister has written he says to 32 countries around the world urging them to impose even more sanctions against the Islamic Republic of Iran the foreign minister Israel Katz posted this on X formerly Twitter saying Israel that Iran has to be stopped now for it is too late and that is the message that's also being sounded by Leading senior military officials here in Israel including the chief of staff leftenant General hery halvi he said that Israel would have to respond he made the comments by visiting the Neva team Airbase in southern Israel where some of Iran's missiles did actually hit in the early hours of Sunday morning although Israel says there was limited damage Israel says only a handful of missiles actually got through of the 350 suicide drones and Cru and ballistic missiles which were fired by Iran Iran says its retaliatory strike was in response to Israel's attack on its diplomatic compound in the Syrian Capital Damascus on April the 1st Iran's foreign minister Amir abdan has reiterated that message in a telephone conversation with the un Secretary General Antonio gues saying that Iran acted in legitimate self-defense Iran too is calling for restraint saying it doesn't want this to escalate into a wider War we're going to look at the Peril in this moment but just to remind you that this tension takes place in the midst of the ongoing Israel Gaza War it's the 193rd day of war and today there are reports fighting in the Gaza Strip and most particularly in bet hanon in the Northeast there are also reports that more Aid is now getting into Gaza from the north we're getting reports on the ground and that is what Israel is saying that news is being greeted with relief for many many weeks now a agencies have been warning that more than half of the population of Gaza is facing acute hunger well let's now cross to the Qatari Capital Doha to join Miranda kamrava who is the director of the Iranian studies unit at the Arab Center for research and policy studies welcome to BBC news thank you leas good to be here of course you are following every uh Twist and Turn of this escalating crisis between Israel and Iran how would you describe this particular moment well the Israelis crossed the red line by attacking Iran's diplomatic compound in Damascus and then the Iranians crossed uh another red line uh by attacking Israeli soil and so we're at a very uh precarious in fact dangerous moment where we're likely to see an Israeli retaliatory strike for Iran's retaliatory strike and so the Vicious Cycle is likely to continue unfortunately this moment seems to underline the the dangerous differences in perception Iran is saying this was a very limited a very calibrated a strike it caused limited casual limited damage for Israel of course it was a reckless strike which breached its security and must there must be a retaliation and that is what is going to fuel this conflict is it not absolutely and in fact uh I think uh we do see that the Iranians did hold back they had to somehow retaliate for the attack on their uh Embassy compound and so as far as they're concerned deterrence has been reestablished and now they're saying that if Israel attacks Iran again or Iranian interests or Personnel uh there will be more of this kind kind of retaliatory strike of course netanyahu's political predicament inside Israel don't allow for restraint and we've seen Netanyahu have a penchant for overreaction he's also under pressure from the right flank of his own cabinet and so unfortunately as you mentioned we're at a precarious and very dangerous moment indeed and the speculation now seems to be that even though there are disagreements within the War cabinet and we are hearing that the cabinet may meet again today some of the former U military generals saying we should we should we should retaliate now others saying let's build our International and our regional Coalition first because they are emphasizing that this Coalition the support Israel is receiving at this moment that matters too absolutely and uh also crucial is the support that the United States will give to is Israel both diplomatically and uh militarily and we've uh heard very loud and clear messages coming out of Washington that is that the United States would not assist Israel on an attack uh uh on Iranian soil and so I think that's also given some pause to Israeli military commanders do they really want to go it alone uh knowing that Iran has this so-called axis of resistance that it can activate when it feels very threatened Marin comad thank you very much it's always good to hear your perspective no doubt we'll hear from you again as this crisis continues to unfold and as I mentioned uh during that uh discussion that we are hearing reports that the war cabinet will meet again today this will be its third meeting since uh that unprecedented attack in the early hours of Sunday morning what is absolutely clear is that uh Israel has decided it will respond but will it retaliate by attacking Iran directly that would also be unprecedented after Decades of a shadow war and covert operations will it attack some of U Iran's proxies and Lebanon Iraq Syria uh or even indeed in Yemen or will they wait and build a coalition these these are questions which matter and they matter to the Future stability at this region in the midst of what is already a very very volatile time as our world affairs correspondent at least you set there with the latest lines uh from the Middle East
