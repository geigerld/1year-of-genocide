now in New York the United Nations General Assembly has voted overwhelmingly for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza the Palestinian Envoy to the UN called the vote an historic moment Israel said a ceasefire would only benefit Hamas to the detriment of gazans though it's non-binding analysts say it acts as a powerful measure of international opinion 23 countries in including the UK abstained Israel and the United States are two of just 10 countries that voted against the ceasefire President Biden earlier said Israel was losing International support because of what he called its indiscriminate bombing of Gaza let's go live to Jerusalem now and speak to our correspondent yolan Nell good morning yoland has there been any reaction there to this so far this morning I mean things already looked very much like they were going in this direction so we had a lot of strong reaction in advance from um Israel's Ambassador uh to the un uh from Israeli officials um really insisting that you know the world cannot tell Israel close allies cannot tell Israel to go after Hamas to dismantle it in Gaz on the one hand and on the other hand call for a ceasefire this has been the consistent message from Israel in recent days but it will be very aware that this is in intense diplomatic pressure now and also worrying for Israeli leaders to see uh some of the the differing opinions that are coming from uh the US its closest Ally as well you know of course from the very beginning the US President Joe Biden he he arrived here soon after those awful 7th of October attacks to show solidarity with Israel um at the UN Security Council it was Washington that vetoed any attempt to get such a a ceasefire resolution through just last Friday Friday um but these remarks made on the campaign Trail by uh President Biden saying that um really Israel was starting to lose International support because of what he called indiscriminate bombing that use of language um was very strong and there's also been admission from uh the Israeli Prime Minister there have been differences of opinion we've also had uh Mr Biden coming out saying that Benjamin n Netanyahu must change his Hardline government um and he must ultimately accept Israel must ultimately accept that it cannot say no he said to an independent Palestinian state that is something that hardliners in Israel's government vehemently oppose okay thank you so much Yan Nell in Jerusalem for us well let's now talk to Jason Lee who is country director at save the children in occupied Palestinian territory Jason thank you for being on the program um so we were just discussing the outcome of uh the United Nations uh latest resolution there as it were but in terms of what you're seeing and experiencing on a day-to- byday basis in Gaza they will not see a difference will they fortunately no the situation is bad and getting worse it is dire we have now 1.9 million people that's 85% of the population that are homeless they're displaced they have nowhere to sleep no access to food to water to critical health care that that they need and also there are no sanitation facilities available and half of them are children the situation is getting worse every single day every day that the world Community does nothing nothing and sits and waits the price is that children are paying the price again this war is disproportionately affecting children the international pressure is increasing on uh the Israelis but uh prime minister Netanyahu says he will continue with the military uh campaign the thinking is they've got weeks a window of weeks in order to achieve what they trying to achieve but I mean every day is such a long time isn't it for for Gaza for the people who are suffering there children do not have weeks there is no time it rained again last night which means that there's so much pressure on the camps that are set up here the tents that there will be soon overflooded there is no sanitation facility the risk of a public health outbreak chalera um we already seeing jaund dislike symptoms appearing amongst the population and especially with the cold weather children are more susceptible to pneumonia so children do not have weeks yeah and and we completely appreciate that so so what talk us through what you're able to do at save the children uh what Aid are you able to get in who have you got on the ground not enough we are not not able to get enough Aid we are restricted by the fact that the number of trucks coming in is not sufficient to keep the 2.3 million people alive we do not have enough Personnel humanit Personnel to come in to actually reach those populations in need and most of all we do not have free movement throughout all of the Gaza Strip there is not unfitted access for humanitarians to do our job we need to get to all areas of Gaza from the north to canun to areas of the South it is critical that we are allowed in my own teams are displaced and unfortunately on Monday night on Monday morning sorry I lost one of my team members his four children his wife and 30 members of his extended family because of an air strike Jason I'm so sorry to hear that that is so difficult to have to handle on a day-to-day basis and our thoughts are with you at save the children thank you for being on the
