in the second biggest city in the Gaza Strip say they've uncovered nearly 200 bodies buried in the courtyard of a Hospital alas Han nunis had been at the center of an Israeli military operation until 2 weeks ago the World Health Organization has previously said bodies were buried within hospitals under Israeli Siege but Palestinians have accused Israeli forces of killing some of the victims the Israeli military said it was checking the reports Israel accuses Hamas of using medical facilities as command centers well for more on this story let's speak to our Middle East correspondent yoland now y land first of all what can you tell us about these reports that the US could put sanctions on one Israeli Battalion called netsa Yehuda yeah so this has not been officially announced by the us yet but just the reports alone have got alarm bells ringing for Israeli leaders and we've had them coming out saying that this is not fair in a time of War uh the Israeli military insisting that this particular unit a combat unit that's historically mostly operated in the occupied West Bank acts in accordance with international law and you have the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that he would act with all his strength um to try to stop this from happening um but really what is involved as far as we understand is that um the US would prevent this particular unit um if plans go ahead um from receiving from benefiting from US military assistance which of course amounts to billions of dollars uh given every year here to Israel now there is existing us legislation um that stops uh foreign military uh units which are found to have committed human rights violations from receiving uh US military aid and there's been a review that's been carried out and that the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has been looking at the results in the past few days to see how military units in Israel comply now this particular uh unit that we know of um it's come up a lot in the news in the past it's a unit that is made up mostly of ultra Orthodox Jewish men and it was originally designed to bring more religious men into uh into the army because many of them are um don't have to because of uh of there have been exemptions that have been in the past for um for religious men serving in the Israeli military so it is tended as I said to OCC to work in the occupied West Bank uh one of the big cases that um was really highlighted a couple of years ago was when it was involved in setting up um a military checkpoint not far from ramala there was a Palestinian American man close to 80 who was detained he was bound and gagged and found dead um by people from his village later um and there was a big investigation into what exactly had happened here with the US really pushing for that because of his uh US citizenship um in the end the Israeli military did not find grounds for a criminal investigation um there were some officers who were reprimanded um but there's continued to be pressure around that case that has has come up um on in uh in Washington and your land just briefly looking at the situation in Gaza and those reports of bodies being found around the NASA Hospital what is the reaction to those developments so I mean really what's happened in the past few weeks since Israeli forces pulled out of Khan unun this big city in the south of the Gaza Strip um people have been going back trying to find about 2,000 people who are thought to be missing mostly under the rubble um and they have been searching particularly in the grounds of the nasal Hospital the main hospital there um we have heard of about 50 or so bodies being found in the past day or so in an open grave there and there have been some delays in in Excavating the grounds because of the lack of heavy machinery and this adds to um further numbers that have been found there uh previously um there are now close to 200 bodies that have been found of course identification is is proving very difficult and we're hearing from local people that there were elderly and also uh children among those who were found dead as well as uh many young men the Israeli military said that it acted in a precise and limited operation when it went into the Nur hospital um said that it was acting against Palestinian government that were using the site um there were people based there that the the patients the doctors the display these people were being used as a human shield there were efforts to evacuate people from that site at the time um we're not clear if these are people if they're bodies that were covered from the hospital itself and then buried in this grave or if they also come from the surrounding area thank you military as you said it's it's looking into these reports thank thank you very much your land that's the BBC's your land now in Jerusalem there
