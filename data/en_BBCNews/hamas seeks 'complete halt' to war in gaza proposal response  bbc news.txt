the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is heading to Qatar for the last for the next leg of his latest Middle East Tour it comes hours after Hamas said it had given its former response to a Gaza ceasefire proposal announced by President Biden nearly a four T night ago Qatari officials along with those from Egypt acting as mediators confirmed the response had been received with a focus now on any Israeli response the proposed ceasefire plan which was endorsed by the UN Security Council on Monday Night Calls for a six week ceasefire that would eventually become permanent and the release of all hostages still held by Hamas in this response Hamas says the ceasefire must be permanent and Israeli forces must withdraw completely from the Gaza Strip well for more we can now speak to our Middle East correspondent Yandell who joins us from Jerusalem and your land just to start off has there been much reaction from the Israeli government to that statement by Hamas well there wasn't a formal response that came out of the Israeli Prime Minister's office we did get confirmation that the Israeli side had received a copy of the Hamas reply um but there was an unnamed uh Israeli official quoted widely uh in the media who put out a statement and said really that um this had changed all the main and most meaningful parameters in the three-phase deal that President Biden had outlined on the 31st of May and said that this amounted to a rejection of The Proposal that's on the table I mean I think what we have to wait for though is still from the mediators themselves the cateres and Egyptians say that they are ready to continue uh negotiations and the White House which is also such an important player here has said that it is studying uh the Hamas reply yand what could this mean for any plans for a ceas fire especially at a time when the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is visiting the region yet again indeed and Anthony blinkin has really been pushing for um Hamas to accept this deal also been putting pressure on the Israeli side it seems as well because although this is presented as an Israeli initiative um the Israeli Prime Minister has come out you know not sounding like he's giving wholehearted approval of this plan uh by any means and he is in a very difficult position where he's trying to keep his Hardline coalition government together and there are key ministers on the far right who have threatened to walk away if Israel goes through uh with this plan um Anthony blinkin is going to be in a really important place in katar um during the day this is a timely visit there uh katar of course not just an important Regional mediator um as a goet for Hamas and Israel but it also hosts some of the Hamas political leadership it's been really very important in conveying messages backwards and forwards and how much room for maneuver do you think there is for mediators because it seems that they've been at this for months now indeed and it does look like you know the framework that was laid out the three phases laid out by President Biden are similar to other deals that we have heard about um over recent months basically beginning with u in this case a six week truce in which many of uh Israel's most vulnerable hostages still held by Hamas and other armed factions in Gaza would be returned um and the idea is that that would then uh lead to negotiations so that you could have a longer term um what's actually called in the deal that President Biden laid out a permanent end to hostilities now this is something that Hamas has specified that it really wants it wants guarantees that phase one will lead uh to phase 2 and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces uh from Gaza but the isra I is have been saying repeatedly that they maintain the same goals in this war they want to defeat Hamas um and remove it from Power completely so it has no political and Military capabilities left in Gaza as well as to bring home all of the hostages and to make sure that the threat that they see uh from Gaza is completely removed your land thank you that's the BBC's your land now there in Jerusalem
