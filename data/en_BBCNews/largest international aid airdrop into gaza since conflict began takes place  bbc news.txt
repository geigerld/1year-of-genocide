let's turn now to the Israel Gaza war and in the latest development the biggest Coalition airdrop of Aid since the War Began is taking place to Mark the end of Ramadan speaking in the past hour the British foreign secretary Lord Cameron said thousands of people in desperate need would benefit meanwhile Hamas says Israel's threat to attack the city of Rafa in southern Gaza raises questions about the purpose of any further talks on a ceasefire in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages uh let's get the latest now from our chief International correspondent Lee duet uh lease bring us right up to date yes the long Muslim month of fasting has ended this evening at dusk and Begins the very special time of the Islamic Eid Festival the most important days of the Islamic calendar A Time usually of me seeing family and friends of eating together praying together but sadly in the midst of the Gaza war is particularly in Gaza where most of the population is now living with acute hunger there's not much to celebrate and so to lift Spirits as we've been reporting the biggest airdrop since the start of the Gaza War has been carried out 14 air drops nine Nations the whole operation led by Jordan and perhaps to try to lift the spirits of children this a drop includes sweets and toys one of the countries taking part is Britain and the Royal Air Force and our diplomatic correspondent James landale is on an RAF plane this is the biggest Aid drop yet nine Nations 14 aircraft and is been organized to Mark the end of Ramadan and that means that some of the aid that's been delivered today it's not just food and water it's also toys it's also clothes now here in this RAF aircraft we've got 12 of these containers and they they contain food water we're talking things like rice flour sugar uh baby powders tea bags cooking oil everything that's needed just to survive now each of these containers there about a ton plus or minus and there are 12 of them here in the hold now it might look a lot here but actually that's less than one truck Crossing The Bard by land so this is clearly not enough now people say no it's it it will make an impact it's better than nothing and cumulatively because these air drops have been going on for about a month now that means it's beginning to tell one of the officials said that around 1,400 tons of Aid has been delivered by air so far and they're saying that's beginning to have an impact but the bottom line is it's not enough it's a very expensive way of delivering Aid uh it's inadequate it's a symbol of the failure to get Aid in by other means but as everybody on this aircraft will tell you it's probably better than nothing
