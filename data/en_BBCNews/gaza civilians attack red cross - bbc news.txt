you can see go okay now I don't know exactly what happened there but just as the Red Cross was coming out of shed here they were attacked by local civilians I don't know why but I guess what that tells you is that after days and days of this people are extraordinarily angry and they're not thinking straight incompetent what else can we say about it we are asking them to protect us I can't understand how the r cross behave they should protect us they are dead and alive people here come and take them [Applause] out we encountered uh serious fighting going on and uh had a clear signal that it was time to leave and so uh there's a lot of fighting back down that way it's not safe so too too dangerous to carry absolutely too dangerous to carry out well that's as close as we're going to get to going into shed jaier I think this place has become synonymous with the violence of the past couple of weeks and I guess what we've just seen here now tells us that it's not just about appalling physical violence it's also about to completely traumatized people
