Israel's prime minister has said what he called the intense phase of fighting Hamas in Gaza is nearly over allowing troops to be freed up to be deployed to Israel's northern border with Lebanon where fightings escalated with the Hezbollah armed group in his first Israeli media interview since the start of the war in October Benjamin Netanyahu said he expected the ground operation in the southern Gaza City of Rafa to be completed soon but he said the war wouldn't finish until the islamist group no longer control RS the Gaza Strip here's some of what he had to say if there is an agreement it will be an agreement according to our terms and our terms are not to end the war to leave Gaza and leave Hamas as it is I refuse to leave Hamas as it is we need to eliminated well this comes as Israel's defense minister yav Galant is in Washington where he's holding talks with us officials about the conflict and about President Biden's ceasefire deal let's go to our Middle East analyst now Bastian aser who joins us from Jerusalem Sebastian good evening to you there what does yoav Galant want to get out of his trip to the US well what he wants to get out of I assume is support as much as possible from Washington for wherever Israel takes this next both in terms of what's happening in Gaza but perhaps even more importantly perhaps because this looks like this is the next stage perhaps of what could be happening in the region what uh is Israel might do in terms of hasbullah on its northern border there has been quite a lot of tension between the Biden Administration it's fair to State and specifically the Israeli Prime Minister Mr Netanyahu in recent weeks and I think that you Gallant will be trying to smooth that over but he will also be trying to put the Israeli case forward on these issues now from a perspective of Washington I think there will be very much an effort by the senior officials that he's going to be meeting to try and uh give the sense that to take what is happening on the northern border with Hezbollah into an allout conflict is a danger a risk that all sides have been warning about for months and months and that it's something that Israel could actually have very negative consequences from Lebanon undoubtedly will the rest of the region and potentially would bring the US actively into the Battle Zone so I think these will be very um intense deep talks whether the two sides will actually come to any agreement on where things go next I think is quite a big question because there hasn't been uh recently but that is very much to do with M Mr Netanyahu and his stance and I think the Biden Administration has undeniably become very frustrated that all the suggestions all the warnings that it has been making to Mr Netanyahu don't seem to have been heeded Sebastian as you were talking there we saw pictures of yav Galant arriving in DC I think we have a live shot now as protesters have gathered outside the venue in Washington where Mr Galant and Mr blinken are meeting Sebastian while we still have you let's talk more about this warning if you like from Mr Netanyahu that the conflict in Israel's North with Lebanon could escalate how much of a concern is this not just in the immediate vicinity but in the wider region massively I mean Anthony blinken the man who's about to meet you AB Gallant has made I think at least eight trips to the Middle East since October the 7th and a big part of those trips have been to go to all the regional capitals the Arab capitals as well as to Israel um to try to get as much of a consensus as possible and as much of a kind of driving force in the region as possible to avoid this ES ating beyond what is already of course a very very difficult dangerous um and and negative situation uh in Gaza these are the worst possible fears that would be realized if there was a real upscaling of the skirmishes that have been undeniably intensifying across the border between hasbullah and Israeli forces particularly in the past 2 or 3 weeks this would take both Israel and Lebanon and the Reg region into a whole new dimension uh Lebanon as there have been warnings from Israel from a military from its uh from its government could face the same kind of Destruction as Gaza has faced that has been said specifically by leaders in Israel but also Israel could suffer much worse I mean obviously October 7th the massacre was a terrible terrible moment for Israel but what hasbullah is capable of goes far beyond what Hamas has been capable of with its Rockets Hezbollah is believed to have potentially up to 200,000 rockets in its Arsenal some of those are Precision guided so they could particularly Target sensitive areas in Israel but I think more significantly there is a potential at the moment I think this is a huge if that this would ever happen there is a potential for hasb to launch barrages of up to 3,000 to 4,000 Rockets into Israel across Israel for weeks at a time if this moved into a dimension of allout conflict that would have huge consequences for the people of Israel and I think there's a great sense of apprehension not just in Lebanon over what might happen but amongst the Israeli people okay Sebastian N Middle East analyst for us in Jerusalem Sebastian thank you well Israel says it's fighter jets have struck a number of Hezbollah Targets in southern Lebanon overnight Israel says two m members of a local security team in Northern Israel had been injured one seriously by a Hezbollah missile attack and as we mentioned Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says troops in Gaza may be redeployed to the border with Lebanon Israel and Hezbollah both say they are prepared for a wider conflict as this goes on Lebanese authorities have denied claims by the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph that Hezbollah has been storing Iranian weapons in the only civilian airport in the country Beirut International Airport in response they organized a tour for journalists and diplomats to the airport to see for themselves BBC arabic's Beirut correspondent Karen torb was among them this is part of a tour of bayout International Airport it was organized by authorities to refute reports about hisbah storing Iranian weapons here the claim was made by The Daily Telegraph citing anonymous whistleblowers who allegedly said that the Shia islamist group is keeping arms and missiles at the airport we think it's just a psychological and media War you must remember the talk about weapons of mass destruction in irq it might be different but it's part of the psychological warfare the article is ridiculous and unprofessional Beirut Airport is the only civilian airport in the country in 200 during the war between Hezbollah and Israel it was hit flights in and out of the country were halted there are fears today that this could happen again what could be different this time is that hasbalah has also threatened to retaliate in kind in case Israel strikes Lebanese strategic positions and it has released a video it said was filmed by one of its drones showing possible Targets in Israel as threats and counter threats intensify the front in southern Lebanon Northern Israel Witnesses constant escalation am it concerns that this could become the main front in the war Karen torb BBC News beut
