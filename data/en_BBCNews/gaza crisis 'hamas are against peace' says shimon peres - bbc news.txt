Hamas even theoretically even consumption they they are against negotiations they're against talking they're against peace they are for Terror we have nothing against the people but none of us neither the Palestinians nor us can live with Terror look we left Gaza willingly unilaterally we took out the 22 settlements we have there the 8,000 settlers by force we handed over to the Palestinians a free open Gaza which is a beautiful strip of a of a beautiful beach they could have developed it for tourism for fishing for agriculture we don't understand frankly why are they fighting what are they shooting what are the reasons we left what is the purpose they want to be free they are free there are people critics of the present government who say that their voices are being drowned out and that they're not being heard and that Israel is in danger of losing its democratic tradition is that a fair comment I was for the unal withdrawal from Gaza actually supported Shan that was the least expected person to do so he made a very tough decision and I supported him when I did it I thought my God we're going to releve the kazian people we offer them the best without any conditions we didn't ask anything in in town and people say what if they'll start shooting at us I says look why should they now I have my problem to explain they say why did you agree to it and the furthermore say if we shall do it in the West Bank it may happen the same look we have to give some answers not only to the terrorist but to mothers and children around Gaza that every night they have a rain of missiles over their heads why what for if these talks in Egypt fail uh these talks that are being moderated by the Egyptians between Israel and the Palestinian factions would you support this government and those who want it to go back into Gaza militarily and to defeat finish the job against Hamas no I don't think it will be necessary and I think we should look for a better solution than that we don't want to raise the Flames we don't want to increase the number of victims who wants it who wants it and look uh it's very symbolic that The Negotiator between now the Hamas and US is an Arab country and we trust the Arab country We Trust edpt we don't have any problems contrary to the protesters and the one cannot say that Egypt is particularly for Israel and against the Palestinians it's nonsense but Egypt is for peace and Against Terror and this is the question and that what we have really to fight for and change the situation now people say it's becoming worse I don't know you know 50 years ago nobody here believed that we shall ever have peace with Egypt we have nobody belied that we shall have peace with Jordan before Syria we have nobody believed that we can do anything with arat we did so all the pessimists have a short memory and all The Optimist have a long memory and a good hope and I'm going to change it because some articles or some demonstrators I think I'm right not them I seek peace I don't seek war I don't want to to kill anybody for me when I see a child being killed it's a tragedy a human tragedy but there were 400 children killed in Gaza I mean that that's an awful lot I mean that is why I don't know how many suppose but why because they use them as a shield the journalist we there saw it tell me what Would You Do You See with a child on a teras and somebody shoot at you and other men who shoot El has a child on on his lab what would you do you cannot simplify it it's not our preference it's not our choice but that has been one of the reasons you mentioned I only ask because you mentioned the the protests in London and in Paris that has been one of the reasons why these protests were so big this time do you think Israel has been stung by the level of criticism of its of its my criticism about them I never heard him tellas to stop shooting then they supposed to start the demonstration why were they quiet when they saw that Rockets are flying over the houses of aots that is really totally devoted this I didn't hear their voice maybe if they would raise then their voice we wouldn't have now to see this uh confrontation again
