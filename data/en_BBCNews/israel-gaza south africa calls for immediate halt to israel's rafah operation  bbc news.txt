let's turn to the ha now where South Africa is asking the un's highest court to instruct Israel to stop its offensive in Rafa these are live pictures from the international court of justice the hearing is the latest intervention by the South African government in its legal case against Israel it says as well as direct military attacks Israel is starving Palestinians in Gaza by obstructing access to deliveries of food Fuel and medicines Israel has insisted it is acting in accordance with with international law it has dismissed the South African case as a baseless blood Lial South Africa's legal team have been outlining their case and have accused Israel of breaching the Court's previous orders with impunity Israel is escalating its attacks on Palestinians in Gaza and in so doing is willfully breaching The Binding orders of this court Israel similarly breaches The Binding resolutions of the United Nations security Council erroneously believing from the lack of counter measures by the International Community that it is exempt from having to respect international law we've heard assurances that Israel was doing everything in its power to avoid civilian deaths as it exercised its claimed right of self-defense we've heard boasts that Israel's Army is the most moral Army in history and we've heard denials that there is famine in Gaza for months people particularly in the west have appeared unwilling to accept that the accusations are true how could people who look like us and sound like us possibly engage in anything like genocide we'll listen into more of those proceedings in just a moment first let's get the latest from our correspondent Anna hollan who is at the ha and following all the developments there for us Anna welcome to you just remind us first of all why South Africa is bringing this case any country that's a member of the genocide convention has a responsibility to ensure there are no violations of that con uh convention that's one but uh secondly South Africa sees parallels between aparte South Africa and the situation that Palestinians in Gaza are facing right now we're an hour into this hearing uh and as you heard there South Africa's legal team have been laying out their arguments they're basically asking for the judges here at the un's highest court the world Court as it's often referred to to issue three emergency measures you can't hear any protesters this time round although it's the fourth time uh South Africa has made this request to the court for an order for Israel to cease hostilities uh and to immediately withdraw um but that's because this hearing was held so uh so quickly uh which is an indication of how seriously the judges here are taking this so as well as uh asking the court to order Israel to immediately withdraw from Rafa um the South African legal team have said that uh un investigators humanitarian Aid organizations and journalists must be allowed in to ensure the provision of food water medical supplies but also uh so that if there are any violations of the genocide convention taking place that evidence can be gathered for any future trials they've also asked the judges to order that Israel report back to the court within uh a week on how it's implementing any measures I just want to give you some of the detail though that we've heard in court um from the lawyers for South Africa so uh lawyer vau Jones said uh vau low said Israel's actions in Rafa are part of the end game this is the last step in the destruction of Gaza uh they also talked about aparte and also made a link between what's happening now in Rafa and what happened in serin in so far as Rafa is being seen as the last safe zone for Palestinians in Gaza and South Africa says if Rafa isn't protected it will make it very difficult if not impossible to rebuild Gaza and preserve Palestinian life in Gaza now and in the future Israel of course we should say will have a chance to defend itself in court tomorrow H it will also have two hours um Israel's legal team is in in court uh you can probably hear the rumble of engines outside uh the the peace Palace now waiting to take people away this is a hugely contentious case it's probably the most sensitive case the icj has ever dealt with which is why it's generating so much attention and South Africa has said there is no other option um this is is the Last Hope and that's why they are applying to judges here at the icj to issue these uh emergency measures to protect the Palestinian life in in Gaza okay Anna thank you well let's listen in now to those proceedings a lawyer for South Africa is making further arguments story of every Palestinian who is suffering at the hands of Israel's Relentless genocidal campaign indeed this court has held in Bosnian genocide that quote it is sufficient to examine those facts that would illuminate the question of intent or illustrate the claim by the applicant of a pattern of Acts committed against members of the group such as to lead to an inference from such pattern of the existence of a specific intent end quote in these submissions I show show that Israel's genocidal acts against Palestinians in Rafa form part of a continuing escalating pattern of conduct across Gaza that provides persuasive and consistent evidence of Israel's genocidal conduct in light of these new facts South Africa seeks an order from the court the only order that will clearly protect what is left of Palestinian life in Gaza it seeks an explicit order that Israel cease its militaries military activities not only in Rafa but throughout Gaza turning then to the genocidal acts in my remaining time before you I will highlight the following features of the genocidal campaign by Israel first Israel has continued to kill Palestinians in Gaza including women and children at an alarming rate second as a result of Israel's Onslaught Palestinians in Gaza are facing what the under Secretary General of the UN has described as the worst humanitarian crisis he had seen for more than 50 years third Israel's systematic targeting and bombardment of hospitals and medical facilities and its throttling of humanitarian Aid has pushed gaza's medical system to collapse fourth Israel's direct attack and Siege of gaza's biggest hospitals has led to the uncovering of mass Graves evidencing Israeli massacres of Palestinians seeking shelter and medical treatment finally most recently Israel has intensified its attacks in the north while pressing on with its rougher offensive leaving displaced Palestinians nowhere safe to go I will take these in turn the first feature of the genocidal conduct killing since South Africa appeared before the court on 11 January 2024 at least 11,500 Palestinians have been directly killed by Israel the majority of these casualties are of women and children in an enclave where nearly 50% of the population are children this Onslaught has occurred despite the binding orders issued by this court and The Binding Security Council resolution on 25 March 2024 demanding an immediate ceasefire for the month of Ramadan in fact as UNICEF pointed out a double digigit number of children were killed within hours of that resolution two mothers and four children are killed every hour unra head Philipe lazarini says there are no words left that can do any justice to the people people of Gaza the numbers of dead and injured defy comprehension at least 35,000 Palestinians killed and 79,000 injured with 10,000 more reportedly missing or under the rubble up to 1.7 million displaced most multiple times and More than 70% of all housing stock in Gaza and more than 80% in parts of Northern Region damaged or destroyed that's where we are going to leave proceedings at the international court of justice just a reminder that Israel will have its turn to respond tomorrow if you'd like to continue watching that coverage just head to our websites
