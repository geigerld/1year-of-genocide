to the Middle East now an Israel's defense minister has said it is an opportune moment to reach a deal on the release of hostages held by Hamas talks are being held in Cairo with Qatar mediating one of its spokesmen has expressed cautious optimism meanwhile Palestinians who've returned to the city of K Yunis in Gaza have spoken of the devastation they found after months of intense fighting Israel says its troops have pulled back from the area in southern Gaza to prepare for the next stage of the conflict more than 300 Aid trucks have entered Gaza that's the highest number in a day since the start of the war our midle correspondent Lucy Williamson reports from Jerusalem for months Han Yunis was a city of targets its apartment blocks and hospitals seen by Israel as hiding places for Hamas residents returned today searching for their City Homes inside the concrete mountains as Israel continued talks with Hamas on a ceasefire deal the destruction is huge kanun has been destroyed it all needs to be rebuilt now it's not suitable for animal to live in let alone human being I wasn't expecting this destruction our biggest request is that they withdraw from our land it's better for us to have tents on the of our home rather than being displaced Hamas launched Rockets from KH yunes the Army said even as its troops withdrew it hit back with air strikes Israel's prime minister has promised total victory in this war but Hamas is still fighting and the withdrawal leaves just a skeleton Israeli presence across the middle of the Strip This is being presented as a temporary tactical withdrawal and that buys Benjamin Netanyahu more time under American pressure to agree a fire deal and pressure from his own cabinet to keep the war going he's framing this as a pause not an end in the fighting keeping both foreign and domestic allies on track we are working constantly to attain our objectives first and foremost the release of all of our hostages and the achieving of total victory over Hamas this Victory requires entering Rafa and eliminating the terrorist battalions there this will happen there is a date returning residents to their homes could smooth the path to a ceasefire deal but it could also help those in Israel who want to continue the war Israel is facing tough us demands to move refugees out of Rafa before any ground offensive there a day after the Israeli withdrawal it's clear how much the face of Han yunes has changed much less the face of the war Lucy Williamson BBC News Jerusalem well I spoke to my colleague Hugo bisha in Jerusalem a little earlier about the prospects of a successful ceasefire hostage deal yeah it's very interesting Samantha because yesterday the qataris who have been you know mediating these negotiations and even the Israeli foreign minister they said there was cautious optimism that uh a deal was possible but now Hamas is saying that there is nothing new in this proposal that the offer on the table doesn't meet their demands and essentially they have three main demands they want a permanent ceasefire in other words the end of the war they want all Israeli troops out of Gaza and they also want displaced residents to be allowed to return to Northern Gaza now in the past the Israelis have rejected those demands as unacceptable they say that this would only give Hamas the opportunity to regroup but there is a lot of pressure for deal to be reached especially from the Americans so the head of the CIA is in Cairo for those talks and there is a lot of pressure at home as well on the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach a deal especially from the families of the hostages 133 hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza essentially they say that time is running out to save those hostages they say that the uh Israeli strategy of trying to put military pressure on Hamas to negotiate hasn't really worked but at the same time the prime minister is also under pressure from uh some of his Hardline allies who are against the idea of making concessions they say we need to finish the job we need to destroy Hamas so I think it really shows how difficult these negotiations are and we still don't know whether uh major obstacles in those talks have been resolved yeah and meanwhile here you go more Aid is getting in the largest amount since the war started 6 months ago how is that operation going is it getting to the people who desperately needed and do we know if that will continue yeah so the Israeli said that yesterday more than 400 trucks were allowed to enter Gaza they say that this was uh the largest number of uh trucks with uh aid supplies uh that entered Gaza since the beginning of the war and obviously this only happen after a lot of pressure again especially from the Americans following that deadly attack on the aid Convoy so the Israelis were under a lot of pressure to uh allow more uh humanitarian assistance into Gaza we know that there have been warnings of famine especially in Northern Gaza and now the Israeli saying that they have uh you know allowed more trucks into the territory so this is part of the plan part of the measures that have been announced by the Israeli military by the Israeli authorities to improve uh you know the level of humanitarian assistance uh for the popul a of Gaza and obviously you know we're talking about those ceasefire negotiations that are happening in Cairo uh the Hope here is that a deal uh is going to result in at least you know in a pausing hostilities that would of course allow more humanitarian Aid to reach those Palestinians uh who are you know in desperate need in parts of Gaza
