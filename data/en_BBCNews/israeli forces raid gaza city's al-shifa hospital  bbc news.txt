well meanwhile the Israeli military says it's taken control of the AL shifer Hospital in what it called an operation to thwart terrorist activity the hospital is in Gaza City in the north of the strip the Israeli military said troops came under Fire and that 80 people were detained and others killed including a senior commander of hamas's internal security service well these are images from the raid you can hear those gunshots can't you there Witnesses described heavy exchanges of fire around the site where thousands of displaced people are currently Sheltering and Medics are also still working with patients who are being treated well gaza's health Ministry said Israel was committing a war crime let's hear though from an Israeli government spokesperson now this morning the IDF conducted a precise operation to thwart terrorism in the shifa hospital area footage shows terrorists firing from deep within the shifa complex our forces engaged the terrorists tens of Hamas terrorists have been detained in the shifa hospital well the spokesperson there was talking about these images have a look they were released by the IDF who say they show troops coming under Fire it's a short clip that doesn't confirm the time or sequence of the events Gaza Health officials have repeatedly denied the accusation that Hamas Fighters operate inside or underneath alifa and other hospitals well these pictures here show the aftermath of that raid the Israeli military said there was no obligation for medical staff or patients to leave and that the hospital could continue its important functions but several medical staff inside the hospital told the BBC El electricity had been cut and they'd been instructed by the Israeli military not to move prohibiting them from properly treating their patients well International Medics who've worked in Gaza say the Medics need to be protected I do not believe the idea have provided any credible evidence since October the 7th and indeed before then that these hospitals were being used as uh Hamas command centers uh I've been in shifa hospital on many occasions I've spoken to people who I've known for many years who work there a and I I do not believe there is any evidence to suggest that Let's cross live Let's cross live now to Rafa and speak to James Elder spokesperson for the United Nations uh Children's Fund uh James thanks for joining us here on BBC News and let me just ask you first of all for your reaction to what we've been saying today about the potential famine that is going to hit Gaza very hard in the coming months yeah it's hitting Gaza I mean we might wait for an official classification Mariam but the reality is that won't mean a lot to people on the ground here we are now seeing children dying of starvation of malnutrition normally Maran Mal nutrition is an underlying cause it's not what kills a child a child will die from something like pneumonia to see a child die from malnutrition because you've heard all those numbers they're terrifying we've never seen anything like this before in Gaza as per that IPC the classification on famine we've never seen a classification as severe as this one for this many people a percentage of people but Maran when you drill it down to a child a child who is dying of malnutrition in a hospital they'll look for vein they'll look for it in the arm the body will have constricted highly traumatic have probably look for a vein in the head and eventually the child will die we are seeing this our very real fear is we're going to see it on a scale that we've never seen before what do you think now needs to happen to turn the tide because Aid agencies are saying aren't they or at least Antonio gues said that it's not too late to turn the tide and the Secretary General is dead right the frustrating thing is it's not that complicated it requires more land routes and there are land routs within kilometers of where I am uh you know more land routs to get Aid in you know it's yes we see air drops we see now Ships coming in the ship that it came in will be the equivalent of 12 or 13 trucks today as I came back into Gaza I passed hundreds and hundreds of trucks so we need the facilitation of those trucks by the occupying power who has a lead legal obligation facilitate them get them in flood Gaza with the food that literally is just a matter of kilometers from me maram and of course a ceasefire ceasefire would enable people to breathe again for the trauma they I mean you probably can't hear the drones they are Relentless there is a trauma that is hitting children here just as hard as the food deprivation so cease fire and get the trucks that are so close and yet so far get them across to the families who so desperately need them James we've just been breaking some news in the last half an hour that Israel is sending a delegation to Washington to talk about a potential uh military operation that has been moted for a while now by Israel into inside Rafa just give people who are watching this a sense of what that would mean to the over a million people who are inside Rafa right now if there were to be a military operation there of any sort that's mindboggling it's it makes my body shake uh you you see Rafer it's very hard to walk in Rafa there are informal settlements and stra and Tents and anywhere someone can move to because they were told to move here three or four times having had their homes bombed or being evacuated under incursion or an offensive from a shelter they are in so it's very hard to move in rappa it is a city of children 600,000 plus children twice the density population density of New York City but no highrises everyone's on the ground and offensive in that area I mean it's it's terrifying it's offensive to imagine so we just hope that calm heads can Prevail because that would be utterly devastating for children and we have seen some horrendous devastating for girls and boys of Gaza okay James Elder from the UN thank you very much indeed for joining us live from Rafa
