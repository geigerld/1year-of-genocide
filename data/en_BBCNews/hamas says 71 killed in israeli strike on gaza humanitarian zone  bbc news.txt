gaza's Hamas run Health Ministry says the number of people killed in an Israeli air strike near the southern city of KH Unice has risen to at least 71 nearly 300 more are said to have been injured the attack happened in the masawi area of hunis the Israeli military has designated this area a safe Zone urging Palestinians to seek shelter there it says the strike was on a Hamas a fenced Hamas area and described most people there as militants these pictures are of the moment of the blast an eyewitness has described the scene to the BBC saying it was like an earthquake doctors at a nearby Field Hospital are reported to be struggling to cope with the scores of casualties well here's the BBC's Nick beak with more on the strike this is an area where Palestinians had been told by the Israeli authorities that they would be safe it was a designated so-called safe Zone but clearly what's happened is there's been a huge air strike here what's clear is a lot of people have been killed and that figure could rise sharply it would seem you talked about some of the video we saw some of the video there and it really shows a very graphic and distressing scene this huge plume of smoke an indication of just how big the blast was this air strike was the damage it did you've got families digging a amid the rubble you've got other relatives being consoled blooded casualties being loaded onto stretchers and in the nearby Q8 field Hospital completely packed chaos there some people some people being treated on the floor it appears some children are injured as well no word yet from the Israeli Defense Forces officially but interestingly the Israeli uh military radio station is citing defense sources three defense sources saying that this was a very significant strike now we don't know if that's significant in terms of the loss of life which clearly a lot of people have been killed here or whether it was very significant in that as has been the case in previous strikes the Israeli military have targeted Hamas individuals and we've seen lots of people die as a result of that and we do know there has been Fierce fighting in this area in recent days just talk us through what's been happening you Han Unice is right in the south of the Gaza Strip where the fighting has continued as well as in Gaza City which is gaza's biggest city and other parts of the strip as well with people being reported killed every day so this is the reality I mean there's one District of Gaza City itself where the authorities said that they recovered 60 bodies after a very intense 48 Hours of military operations by the Israeli government of course the government here says that the mission to destroy Hamas continues and won't stop until it's done all the while these peace talks are going on but no indication that they made a huge amount of progress this week in the conversations in in Doha also there were some talks uh in Egypt as well and this is The Bleak reality this is the horror what we of what's happening and I think the images we're seeing today speak for themselves Israel's Army Radio has said the target of the strike was the Hamas military Chief Muhammad Dave well Hamas has denied this let's bring in our Gaza correspondent rushi abulu who is in Istanbul rushi what are you hearing yeah still no confirmation denial from Hamas about this they said what happened is a a war crime committed by Israel targeting innocent civilian in the so-call safe Zone what happened we have been talking to many sources in the area there was the the main strike that hit a building which house some uh you know uh Food Distribution Center Then followed by about four or five secondary air strikes around around the the area one of them was targeting also a a civil defense uh car that rushed to uh rescue the the people so it's very complicated sort of area because the area where uh west of canun it's called alasi it's the area that designated as a safe Zone with about 700,000 people they live there very crowded area that why we have seen this huge number of casualties about 71 confirmed killed and over 200 people were injured doctors are struggling in three medical centers uh to save people lives the number of patient and the number of injured arrived very quickly to the hospital is huge and and and doctors are trying to cope with the situation about Muhammad Dev he's the command military commander of Hamas he's been targeted four or five times by Israel he was seriously injured back in 2014 uh War there is no confirmation yet from Hamas about him but this is the highest ranking uh name or military Chief and he's the one who followed the 7th of October attack by Hamas he made this speech and uh he was addressing the the people afterwards so it's quite significant if he's the Target it is very significant the area is significant because it's the safe Zone and the number of people killed is a huge in the city and we were just showing a a picture of Muhammad Dave back in 1996 so a very old image but just talk us through what we know about him he was you know a mastermind behind most of the Hamas attacks for the last 25 30 years Muhammad de is is is a well known they call him the the chief commander of the military Wing he was until recently during this war when the Israeli intelligence released fresh picture of him everybody thought that he was half a person like he used to have a lot of rumors about him that he's he lost his hand in one of the he lost his eye he lost his his wife and his brother and Israel tried to kill him many many times I remember for the last 20 years covering this conflict I have covered at least four or five times when Muhammad de was was a Target they tried to kill him after the Hamas kidnapped gilad Shalit in 2006 they tried to kill him in the 2009 war and they killed his wife and his family members in 2014 in a house in Gaza City and he was badly injured so Israel has been hunting for him for a very long time and if they good him I think it's it's significant is he would be the highest ranking person killed in this world and Ry while we have you we're just going to be showing some live pictures now in K Unice there you go um that is near to the blast sites near to uh the hospital there you can see that there are a number of people walking around on the streets um we're hearing since the start of the war 38,000 people according to the Hamas uh Health Ministry have been killed what are eyewitnesses saying to you uh you've been speaking to some people on the ground the um uh the Israeli military saying that the strike was on a fenced Hamas area uh others saying that this was actually a safe zone for Palestinians are you getting an a clearer idea of where this strike took place yeah just to explain the alasi area is like a small strip of land in the eastern western part ofun is near the beach it's agricultural area with a lot of farms and uh back in October and November and December Israel said this is the area is called the safe Zone they were uh you know ordering people from RAF from kanun from all around the Gaza Strip to go there because it's safe the area is like twice the size of hro airport and it's very densely populated area with thousands of tins are there and many of you know small makeshift houses were set up in the in the area the area is really crowded and according to Witnesses what happened is like earthquake is about three air strikes using you know fighter jits in the area and about three four secondary strikes maybe used drone or quad cter drones in the area so it's quite big strike in a a significant area where very crowded place near a market near you know a food distribution center many civilian casualties in the area we have seen image of people digging in their bare hand trying to get their uh you know loved ones from under the the rubel in the hospital there's too many civilians we we have seen footage of wom children are among those killed in the area well as I said Hamas officially deny Hamas officially said this is a war crime and Israel is responsible for killing innocent civilian in a safe Zone Witnesses are reporting as I said many civilian casualties are among the people who were killed in the area very conflicting report about the number very conflicting report about the situation for the injured very serious injuries are still in the hospital but the overall number is still 71 killed and over 100 200 people injured okay uh rushy uh there are Gaza correspondent with the latest well um we are just getting some more information in uh the Israeli uh Israeli official has confirmed Hamas military Chief was the target of the strike this is according to an Israeli official the IDF struck Muhammad Dave and Rafa Salamar ahead of the Khan Unice Brigade who were some of the masterminds they say behind the 7th of October Massacre now they they're saying that this strike was carried out uh within a fenced area where according to its information were there and only Hamas terrorists no civilians as I say this is coming from the IDF and we'll bring you some more on that as soon as we get it with our correspondents in the Middle East
