hello I'm Lucy gray the Israeli military says it's striking Hamas Targets in all parts of the Gaza Strip as well as Hezbollah Targets in Lebanon an IDF spokesman said it was hunting commanders of the Palestinian militant group and attacking infrastructure meanwhile the Palestinian red cresant says the area around the AL kuds Hospital in Gaza City has been under heavy bombardment by Israeli forces our Middle East correspondent Yulan Nell reports shrouded in darkness the Gaza Strip is pummeled from the air by Israeli air strikes with flares raining down to Mark targets and by day the devastation and the huge human cost is clear it was the subject of a briefing given to the UN Security Council last night according to figures from the Palestinian Ministry of Health some 40% of the more than 8,300 people killed in Gaza were children the true cost of this latest escalation will be measured in children's lives those lost to the violence and those forever changed by it more than 420 children are being killed or injured in Gaza every day a number that should shake each of us to our core more than 3 weeks after Israel endured its bloodiest ever day of attacks it's been expanding its military operation to obliterate Hamas which controls Gaza Israeli tanks are now slowly advancing and the Israeli Prime Minister rejects any idea of a truce calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas to surrender to terrorism to surrender to barbarism that will not happen overnight a glimmer of hope for Israelis celebrating after a soldier said to have been rescued by the Army in Gaza was brought home some 238 hostages Israelis and foreigners snatched on the 7th of October remain captive earlier these three Israeli women had been shown in a video put out by herass when I saw the image of Danielle on TV my heart almost stopped my wife and I were on one hand shocked but on the other hand we felt reliefed that we saw her alive and that we see her until today we didn't know anything about her entire neighbor neigh hoods in Gaza are being rendered unrecognizable this fifth war in 15 years is the most brutal yet and Beyond the fighting conditions grow tougher by the day Aid agencies saying that a small increase in the supplies now getting in isn't nearly enough yoland Nell BBC News Jerusalem well there are reports a 100 Aid trucks will be allowed into Gaza in the coming days but the unra spokesperson Juliet tumer says it's a fraction of the help that's needed the trucks that have been coming into the Gaza Strip by the way not every day are far from enough um before the war Gaza received 500 trucks including of humanitarian Aid so what we're having right now is really a trickle Trickle and does not correspond at all to the huge and increasing humanitarian needs on the ground in Gaza and in terms of the amount of people that you have in Gaza it's many thousands isn't it people that have worked for you over the years um what are they telling you from on the situation on the ground about how they're coping well every day our sadness deepens with um confirmation that we keep getting that another colleague is yet gone um yesterday we lost Samir he was with his family and uh he was killed with his eight children and his wife 64 leagues of ours at Andra have now been killed in just over 3 weeks in this war in the Gaza Strip 64 gosh and are they are the are the people who who remain there are they able to carry on their work now I mean we've been hearing some agencies having to to really just give up because the situation is so dire no we have not given up we have not we have 13,000 people who have been working with us uh in the Gaza Strip we are the largest an agency in the Gaza Strip one of the oldest that have been working in Gaza with the Palestinian communities teachers doctors Engineers um support staff counselors psychologists you name it I mean it's a it's a very um big presence for us at Andra in in the Gaza Strip and we have been working with the Palestinian communities now many many of our staff have been impacted themselves due to this war many have become displaced many have lost loved ones many have lost their own homes um many of them are just exhausted they have been living in un shelters for weeks on end now many however continue to be on the front lines giving the very little assistance that we have um being with the communities that we serve and fulfilling their humanitarian mandates when we say these are unsung heroes we mean it Andra staff in Gaza are our unsung heroes and they are the glimmer of humanity as we sink into our Darkest Hours Juliet tumer there talking to me she's from the UN agency which looks after Palestinian refugees let's speak to Abdul Basir Hassan our reporter from BBC Arabic in Cairo and I was listening to a military spokesperson for Israel talking to the BBC in the last half hour saying that there could be a hundred trucks of Aid entering from Egypt into Gaza by the end of this week how feel feasible is that in your opinion well sources at the Rafa Crossing just told us minutes ago that another 60 tracks have already passed through the Egyptian gate the Egyptian side of the uh Crossing into the Zone which Israel decided to be the point where inspections are taking place loading and unloading the tracks which and the change would be there these 60 uh are now uh uh together with another like 30 5 are being still at this point didn't move to Gaza from yester night yester night 60 entered uh to that point only 26 of them later at the night bed to the uh Enclave now at the point there are 94 tracks at the loading and loading uh and unloading and inspection point which is almost like uh 60 M away from Rafa Crossing according to Egyptian sources yes there are a there is a significant rise in the number we have been talking over the last days about uh 14 15 16 20 tracks to yesterday and today we are talking about 60 and 60 today as well this came in fact after a call between a conversation between Egyptian president and and US president uh Biden which he said more tracks will be allowed in and we have heard uh reports from yester night that the state department spoke about the possibility of busing fuel to Gaza but no date was set for this for for the fuel tracks to to bus on so far we are talking about food medicine and water mainly and uh there is an expected uh trip today to uh to the Border by the Egyptian prime minister something new might happen there we don't know exactly uh why he would be there but there is also an important meeting here in Cairo between Ana Chief Philip laini and the Egyptian foreign Ministry there could be like a talk about the uh needs of the uh of the STP especially after the uh complaints that whatever the number of tracks busing on it wouldn't amount to the uh bad needs of the uh uh besieged strip uh so therefore we might expect from today's meeting more numbers to be divulged on what should be coming in the next days that's interesting that they're discussing the possibility of taking fuel in because of course Israel says that it it won't allow fuel to go into Gaza because of the concern that it could ends up in the hands of Hamas and this is very important but still we are talking about reports from the US side no mention of this from the Israeli side or even from the Egyptian side or even from the international organizations working in the STP or either here on the Egyptian side they are in bad need there were calls that and warning that unless we they get Fel as soon soon as they can the services and utilities are using fuel might collapse and the the services are offering for the needy in Gaza Strip might uh come to a standoff therefore still food is an essential need for the gazans and therefore we hopefully after the uh Egyptian Israeli and could be the US contacts over the last hours there could be like a breakthrough soon so therefore we are waiting for this significant change if it happened okay thank you very much Abdul Basir Hassan our reporter there in Cairo let's talk more about the military operation that's underway and speak to Anna Foster our correspondent in southern Israel and Israel's military talking about how it's hitting all areas of the Gaza Strip now and saying that it's had a large amount of exchanges on the ground with Hamas can you give us an update of what's happened overnight and this morning so far Anna that's right Lucy well the Israel Defense Forces have said this morning that they have struck more than 300 Hamas Target inside Gaza in the last 24 hours or so and you can see and hear really the ferocity of the battle that is going on there we're hearing constant air strikes and and outgoing artillery fire from here in Israel and the pictures that the Israel Defense Forces are releasing now show their infantry troops uh deep in inside Gaza you know they're they're on the ground at the start of this they were going in and coming out again but they very much dug into their positions now uh we're seeing tanks on the on the beaches of Gaza there and we're seeing this this increasing push from north to south of the strip as they try to eradicate Hamas you Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli Prime Minister has been very clear that uh that this is a military operation that will continue until Hamas is defeated until Hamas has been either destroyed or or forced out of Gaza altogether and you see the continuing military operation which which seems to be getting stronger every day moving towards that eventual end but it's also worth saying that that because we're seeing and hearing so much activity does not mean that this will be over quickly we heard from the Israeli home front command last night they said this will take this will take weeks if not months it is a a very slow uh slow progress uh towards their eventual goal of destroying Hamas and meanwhile the humanitarian situation in uh Gaza deteriorates we have been hearing uh some positive news though in that the US and Israel talking about how there may be around a hundred TR trucks of Aid entering into G are from Egypt by the end of this week and we were just hearing from our reporter in Cairo talking about how maybe 60 trucks have gone into the inspection Zone uh at the border there so that would be a big increase from what we've seen so far wouldn't it it would but they've said this before and it hasn't come to fruition just yet for the last several weeks there's been a lot of highlevel diplomatic conversations going on about how to increase the number of trucks that go in and you remember in the early days for for several days days you know we we heard that trucks will go in today trucks will go in today and they didn't now there is a lot of work going on behind the scenes No Doubt a lot of high level diplomatic talks pressure from the likes of the US which is Israel's biggest diplomatic and and military ally um certainly that is something that is being worked towards the Israel Defense Forces have said in in several of their briefings now that that is something that is being worked towards but I think until we actually see those trucks Laden with Aid passing fully through the raff of Crossing and into Gaza uh it's all just words really rather than actions and I think when you look at those those images that we saw over the weekend of increasingly desperate people in Gaz are actually breaking into to a un Warehouse you know they were kind of carrying away these big bags of of Wheat and and boxes of basic supplies like like sanitation and hygiene kits it shows you how difficult the situation is there is a real need for much more humanitarian Aid to be getting in there and I think that's where you see the difference between the conversations that are happening the words and what is actually you know what we're actually seeing there on the ground let's talk a bit about the hostages because we saw yesterday this um release well the Israelis managed to free uh an is Israeli soldier and she's been reunited with her family we also saw that video uh of three hostages being held by Hamas and really messages from the relatives of these hostages for the Israeli troops to keep these hostages at the Forefront of their minds as they are uh going into Gaza yeah you can see exactly why the hostage families would be saying that because when you see the intensity of what is going on here in Gaza and and people are looking at that and knowing that their family members their loved ones their friends are somewhere somewhere inside that narrow strip being held by Hamas and Hamas are being pummeled as they are by Israel you can see why the hostage families are really concerned about their welfare and they have been speaking uh with a joint voice and very loudly calling for you know ongoing dialogue with Israel's defense minister yoav Galant with Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli Prime Minister the families were also talking about some sort of potential hostage swap that they would support you know there are thousands of Palestinians being held in jails in Israel the hostage families are talking about a swap and it was something that uh when the leader of Hamas in Gaza yaka sinoa spoke for the first time a few days ago he also talked about is it something that that Israel will entertain the idea of I don't know it's hard to say they've done prisoner swaps before but I think what is is crucial right now is is that ongoing pressure that the hostage families are are putting on the government and particularly when as you quite rightly say there we saw that that video of three hostages being held inside Gaza clearly speaking under duress from Hamas it you know that part of this story that thread of this story is is really present right at the Forefront of of Mines here in Israel all the time and that is why you see that continuing pressure uh from the families and and from you know ordinary Israelis as well for the government to do everything they can to to get those those people released and huge International pressure on Israel to consider some sort of pause or some sort of ceasefire in this but as you were saying you know benjin Netanyahu has been so strong in in his rejection of that idea hasn't he that's right the Israeli message is clear they say that what happened on October the 7th you the brutal and merciless killing of of more than 1,400 people many of them Israelis but for all kinds of different nationalities in these Southern communities here like the one I'm I'm speaking to you from now you know he is he's very clear that that that cannot cannot be acceptable and that the source of those attacks which is Hamas in Gaza needs to be eradicated now the reason we see the likes of the UN General Assembly the UN Security Council at Israel's allies Around the World perhaps asking for these ceasefires or humanitarian pauses often isn't because they are they are telling Israel that it can't defend itself that they're very clear that they support Israel's right to self-defense it's the presence of the civilian community in Gaza which I think is is giving rise to those requests more than two million people live inside that very small strip of land that you can see behind me more than half of them have been told to leave the North and move into the South because the north is where the fiercest of battles are happening so you now have this this desperate displaced civilian population many of them women and children who are losing their lives who are being killed in this ongoing bombardment so that is why these diplomatic talks are ongoing um about the the civilian population about the humanitarian the growing humanitarian issues inside Gaza but equally that is why Israel is is so clear from its part that it will continue to do what it needs to do to to defend itself and and to ensure its future security
