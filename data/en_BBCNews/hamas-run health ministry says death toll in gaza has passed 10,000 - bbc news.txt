effectively divided Gaza into two parts North and South 11 un agencies and six humanitarian groups have called for an immediate ceasefire urging Israel to protect civilians and allow more food water medicine and fuel into Gaza they also called on Hamas to release the hostages captured on October the 7th some Aid continues to get through a Royal Jordanian Air Force cargo plane has dropped several

region Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has left anchora after holding talks with the Turkish foreign minister and the country CIA director William Burns is now in Israel urging greater effort to avoid civilian casualties and the White House has said that vice president Cala Harris will discussed the conflict in a phone call with unnamed foreign leaders today well our Middle East correspondent yolan Nell has the latest opening fire Israeli forces say they're advancing on the ground in Gaza helping direct fighter jets they've hit some 450 Targets in 24 hours the military says meanwhile a hospital car park serves as a makeshift mour Place Health official in Gaza say some 200 people were killed overnight about 1 and a half million are now displaced many have left the north for this Tent City here in the South for some like Mina ales and her family vehicles replace lost homes we came here in Hope of finding safety but this doesn't exist when you're sleeping you'll hear Rockets overhead there's no security amid growing destruction the heads of un agencies put out an unusual joint statement condemning the spiraling number of lives lost and torn apart on both sides in the past month now in Gaza they say an entire population is besieged and under attack denied access to the essentials for survival bombed in their homes shelters hospitals and places of worship this is unacceptable Aid is is still only trickling into Gaza overnight Jordan says it resorted to an airdrop of medical supplies for its filled Hospital on the ground fewer lorries have entered than used to come into Gaza on an average day it's difficult to find drinkable water food is limited now in the market even in the South area the AIDS are entering I mean it's it's limited it's a it's a DOT I mean it's not enough at all to to uh to fill the gaps on a diplomatic Blitz the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin was in Turkey on his last Regional stop trying to block an escalation in this war Washington is trying to persuade Israel to back a pause in fighting when it comes to humanitarian pauses we're engaged with the Israelis on the particular practicalities of that one critical aspect though is seeing progress on uh on hostages that's something we're uh intensely focused on but we also believe that a a pause could help uh advance that proposition as well this lunchtime another protest calling on Israel's government to bring home the 240 or so hostages being held by Hamas another reminder of the anguish brought by this war yoland Nell BBC News Jerusalem well the heads of all major un agencies have issued a rare joint statement calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza after last night saw some of the most intense fighting since the War Began anra say that the 88 people working for them have been killed since the 7th of October the highest number of un fatalities ever recorded in a single conflict well let's speak now to Juliet tumor anra director of communications and obviously I'm so sorry to hear about what's happened uh to your colleagues in terms of the ability of your people to work in Gaza at the moment can you tell me about the conditions they're working under I don't I don't think we can hear have line Sor sorry can you hear me now yeah start again Juliet Sorry yes thanks thanks I think it's only by a sheer miracle that our staff on the ground in Gaza the unsung heroes of the humanitarian team in Gaza it's only by miracle that they continue to push and they continue to deliver assistance under such harsh circumstances they themselves have been displayed some more than once they have lost loved ones and obviously colleagues like you've said 88 colleagues of ours um they are completely stretched as our resources and supplies run out and the Israeli government uh is not moving on these calls for any kind of ceasefire even a pause at the moment this I was just talking to a spokesperson for the government earlier saying unless the hostages are released we won't consider this pause that you're calling for it it seems that they're not moving moving on that right now look there should be a ceas fire it's we're actually it's it's it's far it's overdue it's overdo we're too late it's been one month of Hell uh nearly 10,000 people are reported killed more than 4,000 children we lost 88 under our colleagues um the situation goes from bad to worse by the minute our shelters are overflowing they're overflowing with people we are currently hosting 700,000 people in our shelters some people are being forced to sleep on the on the floor because we ran out of simple things like matrices so we got to have the ceasefire we also have to have this steady flow of humanitarian supplies that come into Gaza since the Convoy started on the 21st of October what came in is only 6% of what Gaza used to get every single day what when we say it's a drop in the ocean we really mean it it's a drop in the ocean yeah on the issue of fuel and obviously Israel has said that it doesn't want to allow fuel into Gaza because it could end up in the hands of Hamas what can you say to Israel to convince them that that that wouldn't be the case Andra is asking for fuel we have been asking for fuel for one month Gaza has not received any fuel for one month we he need it Andra needs it the humanitarian the largest humanitarian organization in Gaza needs fuel we need it for our cars for our trucks for our medical facilities how can you Ure how can you ensure that that fuel if it was allowed in to you how can you ensure that it wouldn't end up in the hands of Hamas it's coming to us it's coming to be used in un marked cars and trucks it's going to un marked facilities and medical um medical centers it's coming to Andra we will use it for humanitarian purposes we Andra the largest humanitarian agency in Gaza we saw um yesterday this air drop by the jordanians uh didn't we is that something that could be possible uh for other countries for other organizations perhaps this airdrop of medical supplies it went into the Jordanian field Hospital didn't it inside Gaza it's a last resort it's a very very expensive operation to do air drops um the UN rarely does it we've done it recently in Syria in an area that was under heavy heavy Siege we've done it once in Iraq in one of the mountains in the remote areas it's a last resort and we don't think that it's actually necessary in the context of Gaza because there are plenty of other ways to get in supplies including by Road well thank you very much for talking to us I really appreciate your time Juliet tumer there from anra which is the the agent focusing on Palestinian refugees thank you let's go live to Southern Israel now because we can speak to our correspondent Mark Len and as you were saying earlier a really intense night and an intense morning Mark talk us through what's been happening yeah we've heard much of that intense military activity Lucy from where we are we're about 3 kmers about a mile or so uh from the Gaza Strip and all morning we've been hearing the the frequent thud of outgoing Israeli artillery on the ground from here but also huge plumes of smoke billowing up after the uh the air strikes that have rained down on the Gaza Strip particularly around Gaza City which has now been completely encircled uh say say the Israeli def Defense Forces as they try to sever this the the Gaza Strip into a northern part of the strip and a southern part of the strip is Israeli media are reporting that Gaza that the Israeli troops could enter Gaza City within 48 Hours uh once they get in there will be more of course intense Street to Street fighting they're encountering we know mines and booby traps on the streets and of course they would face some of those deadly Hamas tunnels it's estimated that Hamas has dug up to about a thousand tunnels uh sprawling underneath Gaza and Gaza City very much thought to be the center of that um so meanwhile the the the road that that basically B that goes from the north of Gaza to the south of Gaza the main artery running through the strip has been open today uh to try to encourage some of the civilians that were Sheltering in the north to take that Road South but many of them are still feel that it's still too unsafe to take that that road and and we understand that up to 400,000 civilians could still be Sheltering in the north of Gaza the north of the Gaza Strip and meanwhile Mark the intense negotiations continue and the Diplomatic front Anthony blinkin uh finishing off his tour of the area and and still pushing to get a humanitarian pause agreed by Israel to allow more Aid in but he doesn't seem to have had any Joy on that front yet has he well well not overtly no I mean the Israeli Prime Minister has said there will be no humanitarian pause until there is progress on the 240 or so Israeli hostages that were seized by Hamas more than four weeks ago now one idea that has been moted by yosa Burell the eu's foreign policy Chief this morning is that potentially um if uh Hamas were to allow uh the Red Cross the icrc international commit Committee of the Red Cross to access the hostages then maybe could the quid pro quo could be a humanitarian pause but at the moment there is no sign of that being being agreed to um Anthony blinken did say as he was leaving Baghdad last night before he went to Turkey today that uh us and Israeli teams are working together to try to address the pract work through the practicalities of of a humanitarian pause so even though Netanyahu overtly and publicly is being very rigid on this I suspect that behind closed doors it is rather more nuanced um because it is clear that uh you know if Israel is going to get any make any progress or any any Headway about the release of these hostages uh it's not going to come while the while the bombardment continues okay thanks very much Mark loen for us there in southern Israel let's just show you some pictures from Jerusalem these are family members uh relatives of those who have been taken hostage in Gaza holding a protest outside the Israeli Parliament there in Jerusalem
