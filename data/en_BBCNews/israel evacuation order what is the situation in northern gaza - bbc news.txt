now let me tell you about the latest in terms of on the ground there in Gaza because the UN Regional relief agency Ana says that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have displaced in the last 12 hours nearly a million almost half the territory's population in the last week let me tell you more from that statement because there is more detail coming in they're talking about uh the Israeli order as well to Le leave that northern part of the territory uh this the full statement there that's available online let me take you through it because there are significant new detail they've called on the Israeli authorities to protect all civilians who've been Sheltering in un under premises across the Gaza Strip including those in Northern Gaza and Gaza City despite the order they say for more than a million people to actually move they say that many people pregn pregnant women children older people people with disabilities will not be able to flee the area they have no choice they say and they must be protected at all times Wars have rules this statement says civilians hospitals schools clinics and un premises cannot be targeted we're sparing no effort to Advocate with parties to the conflicts to meet their obligations under international law to protect civilians including those seeking refuge in H shelters and it goes on finally to say at the end of this statement this is unprecedented what we're seeing this war should be no exception protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure including un buildings applies to this conflict too so uh a long statement there from ANA about their assessment on the ground in terms of the people displaced but very clearly articulating that many people won't be able to to move won't be able to follow that Israeli instruction and absolutely underlying the point that they say that un premises cannot be targeted if those people do not move and follow that deadline order from the Israelis well uh let's reflect more about what is happening on the ground because Mahmud shalabi is in Gaza is the Gaza director for medical aid for Palestinians he spoke to us about what life is actually there in at on the ground at the moment life is really miserable and dire the situation is really tense where I live I live in the north of Gaza and uh one of the governorates that the Israelis have asked uh the peoples to flee from uh yesterday I am one of the people who did not flee um uh their home and I refuse to do so because there is no place that is safe in Gaza even in the southern parts of Gaza where many of my colleagues have went and where many of internally displaced people are located right now it's really unsafe just yesterday at around 400 p.m. one truck full of internally displaced people was direct directly targeted by the Israelis and 71 people were killed in that Direct Hit of internally displaced people so there is no place that is currently safe uh right now I am talking to you uh because I have a generator that we bought years ago and I managed to have some fuel uh leftt over fuel from like the fuel station where I live so I am one of the few ones who can actually connect to the outside world and tell you about the situation right now in Gaza we do believe that it is unsafe to move right now to any place in the southern parts of Gaza as I told you there have been uh many air strikes uh uh since yesterday and early this morning uh one of the areas of the safe areas in the south of Gaza Strip is kanun uh a colleague of mine Liv lives there he has hosted six families of internally displaced people uh this morning at 7 A.M an air strike happened next to his home and they are trying to extract dead bodies from under the rubble so as I told you there is no place that is safe right now uh yesterday we were also given as Palestinians a safe passage from like the early sunlight until like around uh like 6:00 p.m. or something and that happened during the time in addition uh if you also uh see what's happenening during the night in those areas in the southern parts of Gaza there have been many air strikes and many houses destroyed over the top of their residents there have been no warnings such as like in previous escalations where they would throw a you know drone missile on top of a building to warn the citizens that they have to flee their homes nothing uh yes yesterday one of my colleagues at Medical Aid for Palestinians his name is Muhammad his house was destroyed while he was in there with his six children and wife they managed to escape miraculously but they lost some of the extended family members they lost he lost his cousin and uh the situation has been really dire he he stayed in a shop like the neighbors opened the shop for them to stay there during the night and at the early sunlight he went to shifa the largest hospital in Gaza Strip he described the situation for me the the hospital it's self is full of internally displaced people because they don't find any other place that is safe to go to just a snapshot of the latest on the ground there in Gaza
