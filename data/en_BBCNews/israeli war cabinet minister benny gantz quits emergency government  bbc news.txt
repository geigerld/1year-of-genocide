the US Secretary of State is embarking on another tour of the Middle East in an effort to boost support for a ceasefire in Gaza it is Anthony blinken's eighth trip to the region since the war between Israel and Hamas began last October during the three-day visit which begins in Egypt he'll urge Arab leaders to pressure Hamas into accepting the draft peace deal unveiled at the end of last month by President Biden meanwhile Benny gance one of the most senior members of the Israeli War cabinet which was set up after the Hamas attack last October has resigned from the group he had threatened to stand down unless he felt there was a post-war plan for Gaza with a deadline set for yesterday he told reporters he wasn't satisfied and this is the moment he confirmed he was standing down unfortunately nany is preventing us from approaching true Victory which is the justification for the painful ongoing price in this is why we quit the national Unity government today with a heavy heart yet we feel that it is the right decision we are now in the midst of a campaign that will impact the fate of Israel Generations ahead in order to guarantee true Victory this coming fall when it will be the oneyear anniversary of This Disaster we should go for elections and reach new a new government I call on to n set a date for elections well let's go live to Jerusalem now and join our correspondent there John donison good morning John so what's the reaction been to this so far well look I think this is a significant moment but it's not going to bring the government of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu down because his Coalition still maintains its majority in the parliament but you have to remember that uh Mr gance joined the government and the war cabinet uh in the wake of the October the 7th attacks as an act of unity and what this shows now is that there is no Unity on how the war is being conducted in Gaza and in particular as you said in your introduction in terms of a postwar plan it also removes a relatively moderate figure and Mr gance is a man with vast military experience uh from the cabinet and someone I think who was particularly well respected by the Americans and I think what people think could happen here is it will see the government shift to the right those more extremist elements within the Israeli government could have more say in particular itamar Ben gavier the security minister uh he has already said that he should replace Mr Gant in the war cabinet and he is someone who completely rejects the idea of any sort of ceasefire deal with Hamas so what does this mean for President Biden's plan that was presented at the end of last month Anthony blinkin is in the region again and his uh his hope is to try and persuade Hamas to come on board but now Israel what Israel thinks about that plan is changing presumably yes I mean Mr blinken is going to be trying to put pressure I think on both sides he's due uh in Cairo and then in Israel uh a little later uh but he's he's got a tough job and those ceasefire talks don't really seem to be getting anywhere at the moment and the danger is that if for Mr Netanyahu that if he uh agrees to go ahead with this ceasefire deal deal which he has suggested uh he would do the of course the Americans are calling it an Israeli plan then the likes of Mr benav who I mentioned earlier have said they will pull out of the government and that would bring the government down and it would mean fresh elections and that is something that Mr Netanyahu is desperately trying to avoid so um it's going to be fascinating to see what unfolds uh in the next few days but I don't think people are holding their breath for any sort of ceasefire deal soon okay John for now thank you very much indeed John donison there in Jerusalem for us
