for the families of the Israeli hostages the worst possible news today three of their loved ones shot and killed by Israeli soldiers in Northern Gaza mistaken says the IDF for Hamas Fighters the bodies have since been returned to Israel and two of the victims were identified today as yotam Haim who was kidnapped from kibutz kafar AA and Samar Talala who was abducted from kibutz Niam the family of the third hostage has asked for the name not to be revealed just hours earlier the bodies of three other hostages were recovered in Gaza two of them Israeli soldiers Nick Bea and Ron Sherman just 19 years old and also 28-year-old Aliyah tadano who'd been taken by Hamas from the Supernova Music Festival there is still plenty of fighting in Northern Gaza this is video that was taken from Southern Israel on Friday morning Palestinian sourcers are also reporting air strikes on KH Yunis and Rafa in the South with children reported to be among the casual IES in Jerusalem the Iron Dome was forced into action again the first rocket attack to Target the city in weeks but some positive news on the aid front today the Israelis say they are reopening the Border checkpoint at Karam Shalom for Aid to go through into Gaza before the conflict 60% of goods would Transit through that checkpoint the UN had been pushing for it to be reopened a decision welcome by the White House National Security adviser Jake Sullivan who is visiting the region Mr Sullivan who met the Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas today called it a significant step joining us tonight at liutenant Colonel Jonathan krias he's a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces thank you very much liutenant Colonel for being with us um can we start with that rather upsetting news that we've had in the last hour or so that uh three hostages shot and killed by the IDF in Northern Gaza uh after mistaking them as Hamas Fighters what do you know about that operation yes what I can add to your correct um description of the very sad and tragic event is that a third um hostage that was mistakenly killed by Israeli troops has been his name has been approved for public release he was Alon shamis from Kar AA who was also abducted on the 7th of October and his family has of course been notified and they have approved the release of his name and of course the IDF has expressed our deepest regret towards the families of those Fallen Israeli hostages we are investigating the matter we have already issued uh lessons and directives for our troops on the ground in order to minimize the chances of this happening again and of course we will continue to operate relentlessly in order to defeat Hamas despite this horrible and sad event and we will not be deterred or delayed and we will continue to fight Hamas until it is defeated and until security is returned to Southern Israel I'm sure that the details around it will be subject to to an inquiry is there any further information you can give us as to why they were mistaken for Hamas Fighters were they in the vicinity of Hamas Fighters were they dressed in a Palestinian way was there any was there any other explanation for why they were shot and killed yes uh one of them is well there's actually two one relates to their clothing they were dressed in civilian clothing and probably in a similar fashion to what we have seen Hamas combatants Hamas Fighters or terrorists that have been fighting on the ground against Israeli troops all over the Gaza Strip in sajia where this happened and in other locations as well we've seen Hamas Fighters with RPG grenade launchers in their hands and AK-47s and IEDs dressed in civilian clothes and that adds complexity to the uh situational awareness of our troops and the second thing is that before and after this tragic mistake occurred there were clashes between Israeli troops in the area and Hamas combatants and that apparently was also part of the reasons for this very sad mistake this misidentification by Israeli soldiers terms of the other three bodies that were recovered the the way it was reported was that special forces had gone in and recovered them does that suggest that Hamas is keeping hold of these bodies and that they they had to be taken back by force they weren't they weren't dumped they were they were being used as a as leverage yes all of our 132 remaining hostages are being used as leverage both those that are alive and we know that many are still alive and those that we presume are dead some we know for sure were taken corpses of soldiers that were taken when they were already dead on October the 7th and many We Fear are now dead because of various things that happened Hamas abuse and violence um and yes we know that Hamas cynically holds on to each and every Israeli that they have Dead or Alive civilian or military woman or man and we have 1777 women still left in Hamas captivity women and children left in Hamas captivity and as I said for the last 70 days these 132 Israelis are now in Hamas captivity it's more than two months uh and you're still not in control full control of Northern Gaza um another rocket came across the border today there's been more intense fighting which would suggest Hamas still has an ability to control its troops there is a a command and control structure are you talking weeks or months yes you are correct in what you're saying Hama still has command and control they still have the ability to conduct some levels of operations less so in the north but still more so in the South we will continue to operate and degrade their military capabilities until they are totally disintegrated that is our Focus all all over the Gaza Strip and I wouldn't want to put a time limit on our operations I will say that it will we will operate as long as it takes and we will fight as long as we need to because we understand that our Israeli civilians more than 100,000 Israeli civilians that have been forced out of their homes back in the kibuts that were assaulted on October the 7th they have not yet gone back to their homes and they will not go back to their homes until it's safe and it will only be safe after mass is dismantled and after their Commander control and combat capabilities are totally disintegrated and that is what we will do in in political terms there's a lot of talk at the moment about some of the daylight that's appearing between the Israeli government and the way the the White House wants this operation to run um President Biden wants the IDF to transition to a more targeted phase uh phase of the operation but according to us intelligence nearly half the Munitions that Israel has used in Gaza have been unguided missiles otherwise known as dumb bombs how can you assure people you're taking the greatest care with civilian life if you're dropping bombs that cannot be precise yeah that is not really accurate part of what you're saying is accurate part of it isn't and that report that CNN report that uh was referencing us intelligence Anonymous sources that um didn't um State their names for their claims but uh those claims aren't really accurate because they do not take into consideration addon kits that are added to ordinary bombs in order to turn them into what one what Layman usually call Smart bombs or accurate bombs and they are a very large part of the weapons that we have been using um I think that we will have an official explanation hopefully shortly for that so-called report where we will shed more light on it but what I can say categorically and I've been saying this we have been saying this from the beginning of the operation and we stand by it today as well we distinguish between militant and between combatant and non-combatant we try to use the smallest available weapons in order to achieve a military objective and we strike only when there is a clear military necessity to strike those are the guidelines that we started out with those are the guidelines that we continue to to do today and I take use a very sad another sad Israeli example to shed some more light on how what cautious we are in using um fires there was a sad incident two days ago two and a half days ago of 10 Israeli soldiers that unfortunately were killed in a Hamas Ambush inside the house um and they're from the Golani Brigade and they were killed in an ambush and uh there were many claims inside Israel by bereaved families and others who were asking the IDF why don't you just carpet bomb and and bomb everything there and why do we have troops going into houses and searching our response was that we use military force were applicable and according to the mission in this case it was a search mission where our troops went in in order to find and understand what happened we could have bombed the house from the beginning without going in which would feed into those theories that you just referenced but we didn't we searched it on the ground because we apply our Force according to the mission and what needs to be accomplished okay uh well that's some context behind uh the operations leftenant Colonel Jonathan conri is always grateful for your time thank you than you for having me let's speak to hugoo who's in Jerusalem for us tonight um can we just start very quickly by how the families have reacted to this news uh about the the three hostages killed by the IDF yeah Christian so we understand that there's a March now in Tel Aviv and some relatives and some families are now marching uh to the headquarters uh of the IDF the Israeli military I was in Tel Aviv few days ago talking to some relatives and Friends of these hostages more than a 100 people who remain in captivity in Gaza and uh obviously there was you know always the risk that as the Israeli military goes ahead with this military offens that some of the captives could be killed by the Israeli Army I think what makes this case more tragic is that this wasn't an air strike that destroyed a building and uh these captives were killed they were shot dead by soldiers on the ground who mistakenly identified them as hostages so uh a tragic incident in the words of the Israeli military uh we had a statement from the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who described this as an unbearable tragedy and again he vowed to return all hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza even at the cost of uh their lives and he described this as a sacred mission for the Israeli military
