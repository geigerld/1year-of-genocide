a second group of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners make their way home there had been fears tonight's deal was off Hamas the group designated as a terrorist organization by the UK had accused Israel of rening on the temporary ceasefire agreement by not allowing enough Aid trucks into Gaza that led to a delay of several hours in the freeing of the hostages all this after yesterday's release of 13 Israeli captives in return for 39 Palestinian prisoners our first report tonight is from [Music] aaran in t Aviv tonight streets thronged with the demand for every Israeli Hostage to be brought home from Gaza this Gathering was called 50 days of hell and a second group of Israeli hostages reaching the Gaza border delayed by Hamas for hours but now on the way to Freedom racing into his father's arms Ohad who was released yesterday followed by his mother Karen and his grandmother ruy three generations who were held hostage ruti's husband still is as had caught up with friends his family said Israel must free every last hostage this was a belated birthday party he turned nine in captivity daddy I dreamt about going home says Raz who's four your dream came true he says we're going home soon Raz was held with her mother doron and baby sister Aviv in Gaza it's time to count the cost of weeks of Israeli bombardment the SE fire means Palestinians have been able to return to jabalia in the north the largest camp in Gaza or what's left of it we are unarmed says Mahmud mud we are civilians we don't carry weapons and we don't resist why have they destroyed our houses why are they killing our children footage has now emerged on social media of an Israeli officer in Gaza taking a different view of the destruction I dedicate this explosion to my princess Ella he says today she's [Applause] two then he blows up a building the Israeli Army has confirmed to the BBC that these are its troops in Gaza orar and BBC News Tel Aviv AA we're hearing that uh the uh second group of Israeli hostages has arrived back here in Israel from Gaza the delay of course a little bit earlier this evening threatening to shut down the whole deal tonight and that shows the fragility of the deal between Israel and Hamas it does Clive we have confirmation now that the group is back on Israeli soil at 13 Israelis eight of them children five of them women as well as four Tha Nationals and this evening we saw that delay of several hours caused because Hamas said Israel had breached the ceasefire agreement in several ways which Israel denied now we had Qatar and Egypt very quickly stepping in to mediate remove what they call the obstacles uh and the release went ahead but after a few more hours of Anguish for the families involved now we have some detail tonight of those who have been freed almost all are from a single Community kibuts Berry which was near the border with Gaza uh people may remember it was one of the worst affected communities around a 100 people were killed there H and we do know that one of those who has been released tonight is the Irish Israeli hostage Emily hand just 9 years old now people may remember her father Thomas giving an anguished interview when initially he thought she had been killed and saying in his grief that he was happy with that rather than seeing her being a hostage and tormented in Gaza he subsequently found out she was alive and tonight she is safe and well and back in Israel we know that one other child has been released a 12-year-old girl without her mother who has been kept behind in Gaza so once again tonight Clive the releases are being welcomed but there is a sense that this is bittersweet because many Israeli hostages remain behind in Gaza and it's unclear how long it will take and indeed if it will be possible to get the others home tomorrow another batch are due to be released and one more batch after that if the ceasefire holds for the four days which it is initially due to last for all right all right we'll see what happens Alla thank you all gear in reporting for us there well a second busload of Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails has arrived in the West Bank
