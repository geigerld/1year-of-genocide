Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the phase of intense fighting against Hamas in Rafa is finally coming to an end but he warned the war would not finish until the islamist group no longer controls the Gaza Strip in his first television interview on Israeli TV since the war started in October Mr Netanyahu said the end of the Rafa offensive would allow troops to be freed up to help in the northern border with Lebanon where fighting with the Hezbollah armed group has escalated meanwhile the Israeli defense minister yoav Galant has beg a visit to Washington where he is due to hold talks about the conflict and with President Biden about his ceasefire deal but Mr Netanyahu said the main objective was still to destroy Hamas before the war concludes if there is an agreement it will be an agreement according to our terms and our terms are not to end the war to leave Gaza and leave Hamas as it is I refuse to leave Hamas as it is we need to eliminate it let's speak to sebas Usha now who is in Jerusalem following developments there good to see you Sebastian so what more do we know about the Israeli government's plan now for Gaza and going forward well I think the message that Mr Netanyahu is giving there to a domestic audience was one that we've already been hearing from the Israeli government the Israeli military over the past few weeks but Rafa they very much made out that this was the last major military operation that they were carrying out uh in Gaza that that that was where they believe that the remaining Hamas battalions were where hostages were potentially and also where perhaps for leadership of Hamas in Gaza was based that's continuing uh we've had reports that Israeli tanks will be moving into the North and the west of Rafa uh we've heard from uh the Hamas armed wing and Islamic Jihad that they have been fighting back with mortar bombs and uh with rocket propelled uh um grenades and there's also fighting that's continuing in part of a center of Gaza too where Israel doesn't have full control of a particular area and in Gaza City we saw over the weekend but there were strikes uh on several locations so this this this sense that Mr Netanyahu is giving that the intense fighting is over in Gaza that may well be true but as he said and as we've heard from all Israeli officials the actual war in Gaza is not coming to an end there's no sense but the that Mr Netanyahu set himself as anywhere over key thing that he said was the redeployment of some of those troops to the northern border where the battle with Hezbollah which has stayed mostly within red lines of both sides has again been escalating and overnight there were more Israeli strikes inside Lebanon on what they said were hisbah targets you mentioned the Israeli defense minister yab Galant he's now in the US one of the key things he's going to be talking about where concern in the US and the rest of world has been Rising is over what might happen between the Israeli forces and hasbullah and how that would involve the rest of Lebanon and potentially bring the region as the concern has has been The Wider region more directly into the conflict I think that concern is probably at its highest pitch at the moment and Sebastian is there any sense of any return to talks when it comes to a hostage ceasefire deal well Mr Nar again he talked about that but I mean what he would was saying was that he isn't accepting a ceasefire as things stand which is a permanent ceasefire as a starting point now that isn't what is in the current ceasefire proposal that's a three-phase deal where confidence would be built up in the first phase where there'd be a temporary ceasefire talks would continue and then hopefully in a second phase there would be a permanent ceasefire Hamas though has continue to insist that it wants a permanent ceasefire to be nailed in from the start and there was there has been a h response to what Mr Netanyahu said last night uh to Israeli TV and saying that as far as they're concerned that shows that Mr Netanyahu is not interested in a ceasefire deal at the moment okay Sebastian
