in aid for Palestinians now that Aid is likely to go through Cyprus so the details we still don't have in full but we are expecting some sort of port to be built into Gaza and that will be fed into Gaza from Cyprus so that is what we are looking at at the moment but we've had confirmation that the UK is going to be part of that operation that President Biden announced also that we expect the EU to be part of that because the eu's Ura V line is visiting Cyprus a little bit later to talk about that humanitarian Corridor that we expect to go from Cyprus it will then go to this port that the US

now we are seeing as part of this coordinated effort very shortly Ursula Von deline is going to speak in Cyprus but first let's have a listen to what President Biden said about building that pier in his State of the Union Address last night our protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority as we look to the Future the only real solution to the situation is a two-state solution over time and I say this as a lifelong supporter of Israel my entire career no one has a stronger record with Israel than I do I challenge any of you here I'm the only American president of is Israel in war time but there is no other path that guarantees Israel security and democracy there's no other path that guarantees Palestinian can live in peace with with peace and dignity so let us take you back to the scene live in Cyprus where we are expecting the EU commission Chief Ursula Von deline to speak very shortly as you can see it's all part of this concerted effort to bring humanitarian Aid in to Gaza via the sea let us listen into what the cypriots are saying at the moment Ursula Madame President you were and I remember this very well you were a stunt vocal supporter of the Cyprus Maritime corridor from the very beginning thank you for your vision and your leadership Cyprus is deeply appreciative of the full support by you personally by the European commission as well as that of the United Arab Emirates the United States and other partners with whom we have been in intense consultations in the last weeks and months at the same time the UN special coordinator and her important mandate to coordinate increase and standardize the humanitarian assistance going into Gaza are also important elements in making the corridor a sustained long-term Maritime Lifeline for the civilians in Gaza Today We Stand United by a common Vision to alleviate the humanitarian tragedy of the civilians in Gaza here at the Joint rescue coordination Center which constitutes an integral facility of the critical infrastructures in the Amalia plan the other critical facility in the Amalia capsule is cyclopes the Center for Land open seas and Port security established in close cooperation with the United States here at the jrcc where we also monitor all sea traffic going in and out of Cyprus as we have discuss the number of migrants from Syria and lebano have been consistently increasing in recent months which is deeply concerning for for Cyprus I look forward to working with you also on this Ursula and just as we are doing today to do so in a result oriented manner with the president I also discussed this morning our efforts to resume negotiations on the Cyprus problem in line with the relevant un Security Council resolutions and the European Union law values and principles a solution to the Cyprus problem will have a resounding Regional impact as well we agree that the European Union can be a driver for developments on the Cyprus question and in this regard got we exchange views on the state of play in EU turkey relations in which the Cyprus question is of course a core component part dear Ula once again it is a great pleasure to host you and your team to Cyprus in order to deliver the implementation of the Amal initiative of the maritime Corridor for the delivery of eight in Gaza our journey only just begins welcome thank you thank you very much Mr President de Nikas thank you very much for welcoming me and my team here to laka and in particular to the Joint rescue coordination Center we're here because Palestinians and in particular those in Gaza um need all our help the humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire with Innocent Palestinian families and children desperate for basic needs and today we are facing a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and we stand by the innocent civilians in Palestine and this is why Europe is financing a major humanitarian Aid effort for Palestinians in Gaza and in the region â‚¬250 million EUR this year alone but the key challenge is to get the aid to the people on the ground in Gaza and we know the difficulties faced at the land borders in GAA be it through the ruer border crossing or through the Jordan Road Corridor and that is why today the Republic of Cyprus the European commission the United Arab Emirates and the United States of course supported by other critical partners announced our intent to open the maritime Corridor to deliver much needed additional amounts of humanitary assistance by SE together our Nations intent to build on this model to deliver significant additional Aid by SE so I am extremely grateful to you Mr President de Nikos and to the people of Cyprus for your leadership in establishing the Amala initiative it was impressive to see and to visit the different sites how it um is evolving supplementing the efforts to deliver significant additional Aid we are launching this cypris Maritime Corridor together Cyprus the European Union the United Arab Emirates and the United States and it is your Relentless work to get this Corridor up and running despite all all the challenges and this is truly inspiring we're now very close to the opening of the corridor hopefully this Saturday this Sunday and I'm very glad to see that an initial pilot operation will be launched today thus um it is the partnership that started it today with the world Central Kitchen whom I want to thank wholeheartedly for their viess and so important work Mr President inos Cyprus has always been a bridge between Europe and the Middle East and thanks to the Amalia initiative it is proving this historical role once again today I welcome the leadership of President Nikos Christo does by serving as a mediator for all parties involved and I would like to commend the particular effort of the president of the United Arab Emirates muhamed bin Zayed to mobilize support to activate this Corridor by securing the first of many shipments of goods to the people of North Gaza and I call on all the actors who have a role to play here to help this cor deliver on its potential one thing is for sure you can count on us the maram corridor can make a real diff difference in the plight of the Palestinian people but in parallel our efforts to provide assistance to Palestinians through all possible routs of course will continue as part of our EU humanitarian airbridge operation we have launched 41 flights carrying over 1,800 tons of a and we will consider consider all other options including air drops if our humanitarian Partners on the ground consider this effective but our action does not stop there we must also focus our Attention our efforts and Outreach on preventing an ignition of violence across the whole region I am in regular contact with President Alisia of Egypt and King abdalah of Jordan the situation in the Red Sea is particularly concerning with Maritime security deteriorating day after day and critical infrastructure damaged due to the repeated hooti attacks this is why we have launched the EU Naval Force operation aspas and I know that Cyprus has deployed two naval officers for this Mission and we really thank you for that Mr Mr President with as speedis Europe is acting to ensure freedom of navigation in the Red Sea working alongside with our International Partners finally a word on the day after we agree that we must start preparing today with a viable perspective and this perspective continues to lie in the two- State solution this requires an immediate humanitarian pause that would lead to a sustainable ceasefire it is clear that there can be no forced displacement of Palestinians and no blocket of Gaza but it is equally clear that Gaza cannot be a safe heaven for terrorists and that we will keep on calling for the immediate unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas Europe will continue to help build momentum for this political Horizon so thank you again Mr President de Nikos and I want to thank everyone working here at the jrcc you will play an Central role in the Amala initiative you are already playing an important and Central role overall in the region here so something comes on top of your responsibility you embody Europe solidar ity at its best and I know that the people of Cyprus themselves know what suffering and loss can feel like and therefore we in the European Union Stand By You Mr President in your efforts to resume the peace talks for the solution of the Cypress question here too you can count on us many thanks thanks thank you so that is the EU commission president and the President of Cyprus in lanica at the launch of what is a humanitarian Aid corridor from Cyprus into Gaza now the EU commission Chief Ursula Vine at the launch of that sea Corridor said that they hoped it would be open this Sunday she said that Palestinians need all our help uh the humanitarian situ ation is dire and that people are desperate for basic needs she said they were facing a humanitarian catastrophe and she said the key aim was to get Aid in and she outlined the difficulties that we know that has been happening by Road and that is why they have turned to Cyprus the UK the UAE and the US and others to bring humanitarian Aid in by sea she said it would see significant amounts of Aid being brought in as I said she said that they hope to open that this Sunday although a pilot operation will start today as you heard she thanked the President of Cyprus and also the president of the United Arab Emirates for helping to get this Maritime Corridor up and running she called on everyone to help deliver it saying that it can make a real difference for Palestinians at the end she also again called for that humanitarian pause in the fighting and eventually a ceasefire she also again re itated the call for all the hostages being held to be released the President of Cyprus who you saw there said that they were United in the common vision of bringing Aid into Gaza he added that our journey was only just beginning let's go straight to yolan Nell who is our Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem so yoland it is all coming together we had President Biden talking about this port we then had Lord Cameron the British foreign secretary saying the UK would be involved and and now we've got the full details from the EU commission president and the President of Cyprus that's right and actually it's a couple of months ago that we really started hearing a lot more from Cyprus about this proposed uh SE rout to bring in aids to Gaza and Britain has shown a lot of interest in that uh Lord Cameron in particular uh prior to this announcement by the US what's really new now is the time frame that's being brought on this um new kind of emphasis on the project as a way of hurry in Aid uh into Gaza and it comes after Lord Cameron that the foreign secretary had said that really Israel's allies were losing patience there have been calls now for for some weeks for an increase in the flow of Aid we've got the UN warning of mass starvation in Gaza so this looks like a plan now that could be in place potentially for the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and as the are the Israelis as far as we know going to cooperate with this ins Cyprus and what role will they have in checking all of that Aid well the idea as we understand it is that there would be a screening process that could take place uh in Cyprus um with Israel overseeing that and actually um we already had a couple of months ago um one of the Israeli ministers in Cyprus looking at a test of a screening process there uh but then we didn't hear too much more about it so the idea seems to be that this is coordin ated with the Israelis um and then the aid is brought in once it's been screened U into Gaza there isn't a deep sea port in Gaza so what we're looking at here is the construction of some kind of temporary Pier now it's not been made clear and the logistics of that or how Aid will be stored in Gaza how it will be distributed afterwards um it seems perhaps private contractors uh the UN might be involved uh but a lot more details still to come on this um but what is clear is there's a lot of coordination a lot of enthusiasm uh for this de deal it looks like some kind of concrete step uh for all these different players in the region in Europe in the US uh something they've been looking for to try to have a positive announcement really especially after we've had in in past days um the failure of truce talks uh in Cairo through Egyptian mediators with a Hamas delegation to achieve some kind of breakthrough to have a Tru steel which would allow um in Ramadan as had been hoped a big surge Aid going into Gaza uh in exchange for Israeli hostages coming out and also Palestinian prisoners being freed from Israeli jails those talks will still continue but this is another initiative that can be taken in parallel yolan Nel in Jerusalem thank you very much I know you'll go off to try and get more details of how this Corridor will work
