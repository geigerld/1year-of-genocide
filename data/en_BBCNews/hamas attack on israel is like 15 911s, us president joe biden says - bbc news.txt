I know the recent of terrorist assault on the people of this nation has left a deep deep wound more than 1,300 innocent Israelis killed including at least 31 American citizens by the terrorist group Hamas hundreds hundreds of young people at a music festival the festival was for peace for peace gunned down as they ran for their lives scores of Innocents from infant to elderly grandpar parents Israelis and Americans taken hostage children slaughtered babies slaughtered entire families massacred rape beheadings bodies burned alive Hamas committed atrocities that recall the worst ravages of Isis unleashing pure unadulterated evil upon the world there's no rationalizing it no excusing it period the brutality we saw would have cut deep anywhere in the world but it cuts deeper here in Israel October 7th which was sacred was sacred Jewish holiday became the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust it has brought to the surface painful memories and scars left by Millennia of anti-Semitism and the genocide of the Jewish people the world watched then it knew and the world did nothing we will not stand by and do nothing again not today not tomorrow not ever to those who are living in limbo waiting desperately to learn the fate of a loved one especially to families of the hostages you're not alone we're working with Partners throughout the region pursuing every Avenue to bring home those who are being held captive by Hamas I can't speak publicly about all the details but let me assure you for me as the American president there's no higher priority than the release and safe return of all these hostages to those who are grieving a child a parent a spouse a sibling a friend I know you feel like there's that black hole in the middle of your chest you feel like you're being sucked into it the survivor's remorse the anger the questions of faith in your soul starting at staring at that empty chair sitting shiva the first Sabbath without them there the everyday things and small things that you miss the most the scent when you open the closet door the morning coffee you shared together the bend of his smile the perfect pitch of her laugh the giggle of your little boy baby for those who have lost loved ones this is what I know they'll never be truly gone there's something that's never fully lost your love for them and their love for you and I promise you you'll be walking along some days and say what would she or he want me to do you smile when you pass a place that reminds you of them that's when you know when a smile comes to your lips before a tear to your eye that's who you know you're going to fully make it that's what will give you the fortitude to find light in the darkest hours when terrorists believe they could bring down bring you down bend your will break your resolve but they never did and they never will instead we saw incredible stories of heroism and courage Israelis taking care of one another neighbors forming watch groups protect their kibuts opening their homes to shelter survivors retired soldiers running into danger once again civilian Medics flying across rescue flying rescue missions and off-duty Medics at the music Festival caring for the wounded before coming victim before becoming a victim himself volunteers retrieving bodies of the dead so families could bury their loved ones in accordance with Jewish tradition reservist leaving behind their families their honeymoons their studies abroad without hesitation and so much more the state of Israel is born to be a safe place for the Jewish people of the world that's why I was born long said if Israel didn't exist we'd have to invent it while it may not feel that way today Israel must again be a safe place for the Jewish people and I promise you we're going to do everything in our power to make sure that it will be 75 years ago just 11 minutes after its founding President Harry S Truman in the United States of America became the first nation to rec recognize Israel we've stood by your side ever since we're going to Stand By Your Side now my Administration been in close touch with your leadership from the first moments of this attack we're going to make sure we have what you have what you need to protect your people to defend your nation for decades we've ensured Israel's qualitative military Edge and later this week I'm going to ask the United States Congress for unprecedented support package for Israel's defense we're going to keep Iron Dome fully supplied so we can continue standing Sentinel over Israeli Skies saving Israeli lives we moved US military assets to the region including positioning the USS Ford carrier strike group in the Eastern Mediterranean with the ussi and now are on the way to deter to defer further aggression against Israel and to prevent this conflict from spreading the world will know that is Israel is Israel is stronger than ever and my message to any state or any other hostile actor thinking about attacking Israel Remains the Same as it was a week ago don't don't don't since his terrorist ATT terrorist attack took place we've seen it described as Israel's 9/11 though for a nation the size of Israel was like 15 91s the scale may be different but I'm sure those Horrors have tapped into so some kind of Primal feeling in Israel just like it didn't felt in the United States shock pain rage an all consuming rage I understand the many Americans understand you can't look at what has happened here to your mothers your fathers your grandparents Sons daughters children even babies and not scream out for justice Justice must be done but I caution this while you feel that rage don't be consumed by it after 9/11 we were enraged in the United States while we sought Justice and God Justice we also made mistakes I'm the first US president to visit Israel in time of war I've made wartime decisions I know the choices are never clear or easy for the leadership there's always cost but it requires being deliberate it requires asking very hard questions it requires clarity about the objectives and an honest assessment about whether the path you're on will achieve those objectives the vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people hamash uses innocence innocent families in Gaza as human Shields putting their command centers their weapons their Communications tunnels in residential areas Palestinian people are suffering greatly as well we mourn the loss of innocent Palestinian lives like the entire world I was outraged and saddened by the enormous loss of life yesterday in the hospital in Gaza based on the information we've seen to date it appears a result of an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza United States equivocally stands for the protection of civilian life during conflict and I grieve I truly grieve for the families who were killed or wounded by this tragedy people of Gaza need food water medicine shelter today I ask these R cabinet I met with for some time this morning to agree to the delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza based on the understanding that there will be inspections that the aid should go to civilians not to a Israel agreed the humanitarian assistance can begin to move from Egypt to Gaza let me be clear if amas diverts or steals the assistance they will have demonstrated once again that they have no concern for the welfare of the Palestinian people and it will end as a practical matter it will it will stop the International Community from being able to provide this Aid we're working in close cooperation with the government of Egypt the United Nations and its agencies like the world program and other partners in the region to get trucks moving across the border as soon as possible separately I ask Israel that the global Community demand that the International Red Cross be able to visit hostages I just demanded that the United States fully a just demand that the United States fully supports today I'm also announcing $100 million in new US funding for humanitarian assist assistance in both Gaza and the West Bank this money will support more than 1 million displaced and conflict affected Palestinians including emergency needs in Gaza you are a Jewish State you are a Jewish state which you're also a democracy like the United States you don't live by the rules of terrorists you live by the rule of law when conflicts flare you live by the law of Wars what sets us apart from the terrorist as we believe in the fundamental Dignity of every human life Israeli Palestinian Arab Jew Muslim Christian everyone you can't give up what makes you who you are if you give that up then the terrorists win and we can never let them win you know Israel is a miracle a Triumph of faith and resolve and resilience over impossible pain and loss think about October 7th the Jewish holiday where you read about the death of Moses a tragic story of a profound loss to an entire nation a death that could have left helpless hopelessness in the hearts of the entire of entire nation but though Moses died his memory his message his lessons have lived on for generations of the Jewish people as well as many others just as the memory of your loved ones will live on as well after reading the story of moses' death those who observe the holiday began reading the Torah from the very beginning the story of creation reminds us of two things first that when we get knocked down we get back up again and we begin a new and second when we're faced with tragedy and loss we must go back to the beginning to remember who we are we are all human beings created in the image of God we with dignity humanity and purpose in the darkness to be the light unto the world is what we're about you inspire hope and light for so many around the world that's what the terrorists seek to destroy that's what they seek to destroy because they live in darkness but not you not Israel nations of conscience like the United States and Israel are not measured solely by the example or power we're measured by the power of our example that's why as hard as it is must keep pursuing peace must keep pursuing a path so that Israel and the Palestinian people can both live safely in Security in dignity and in peace for me that means a two-state solution must keep working for Israel's greater integration with his neighbors these attacks have only strengthen my commitment and determination and my will to get that done I'm here to tell you the terrorist will not win Freedom will win so let me end where I began Israel You're Not Alone the United States stands with you I told the story before and I'll tell it again of my first meeting with an Israeli Prime Minister 50 years ago as a young Senator I was sitting across from gold of May a at her desk in her office and she had a guy named guy who later became prime minister sitting next to me just before the 1973 yam kapor war and she flipped the maps up and down telling me how bad things were and how terrible they were all of a sudden she looked at me and she said would you like a photograph I looked at her she got up from her desk and walked out into that hallway I think it's Marble forign walked out the hallway we walked down there were a bunch of photographers standing in front of us we're standing shoulder toosh shoulder without her looking at me she said to me knowing I'd hear her why do you look so worried Senator Biden and I said worried like of course I'm worried and she looked at me and she didn't look she said we don't worry Senator we Israelis have a secret weapon we have nowhere else to go well today I say to all of Israel the United St isn't going anywhere either we're going to stand with you we'll walk beside you in those dark days and we'll walk beside you in the good days to come and they will come as you say in Hebrew which I'm not going to attempt to do because I'm such a terrible linguist I'll say in English the people of Israel live the people of Israel live Israel will be safe secure Jewish and Democratic state today tomorrow and forever may God protect all those who work for peace God save those who are still In Harm's Way thank you very much
