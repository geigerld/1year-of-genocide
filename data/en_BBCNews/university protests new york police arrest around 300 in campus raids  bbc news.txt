a very good evening the confrontations between Pro Palestinian protesters and the police are continuing on campuses across the United States 12 protesters were arrested this afternoon at the University of Wisconsin in Madison as police cleared an encampment there tensions are also high in Los Angeles where overnight counter protesters attack Pro Palestinian demonstrators on the campus footage from the scene changed people using sticks and poles to attack a makeshift barricade that had been put up around the encampment police did eventually respond to what the University's Vice Chancellor described as horrific acts of violence let him go let him go there were scuffles too in New York where police arrested dozens of pro Palestinian demonstrators who were HED up in a building at Colombia University and they removed a protest encampment a total of 300 people were detained at Colombia and City College elsewhere in the city the speaker of the US House of representativ Mike Johnson said the authorities needed to be called in what are University officials waiting on what do they need to see before they stand up to these terrorist sympathizers and that is exactly what they are what's worse though is that Colombia's choice to ignore the safety of their Jewish students and appease anti-semites has inspired even more hatefield protests to pop up across the country and what we're seeing right now is people wave Hezbollah fles flags and and Hamas Flags their homemade signs supporting what happened on October 7th it's outrageous the president of Colombia University Manu shafik who's been under immense political pressure in recent days has appealed for a period of calm we regret the protesters have chosen to escalate the situation through their actions said a statement we made the decision early in the morning that this was a law enforcement matter the NYPD were best positioned to determine and execute an appropriate response but this is not confined solely to New York protest that began organically some weeks ago has now spread to 20 different states and over 30 universities there were dozens of arrests at the University of Texas this week protests from coast to coast Riot police on the grounds of ivy league universities Yale Harvard Berkeley the George Washington University in DC it is spreading into a national movement with protest reappearing in places where they have previously been cleared so let's go first then to our correspondent Emma vardy who sent this from the UCLA it's been a political mindfield for universities over the last few weeks of course trying to strike that right balance between upholding uh Free Speech protecting students on campus who just want to go about their day and and then dealing with the claims of anti-Semitism from some Jewish students as well and all of those tensions really boiled over here last night it seems that what happened happened at around 11:00 last night here the pal prop Palestinian demonstration the encampment here there was a surge of counter protesters that led to Violent clashes between these groups of of rival protesters there were wooden barricades that were then picked up and used as As Weapons there was fireworks thrown uh over the crowd and and there had been a relatively small number of police on site at that moment so the university called in at the Los Angeles Police Department the LAPD and of of course they then suddenly rushed to try to break up this violence but by then it it had really escalated and it took police a number of hours to separate those protesters what there is now behind me is that encampment as I say from the pro Palestinian demonstration which remains there outside the central the main library of UCLA but it's now uh the Rival demonstration by pro-israel supporters is separated by some iron railing so everything feels a lot calmer now but it's a very strange atmosphere for a university C campus and many students and lots of teachers arrived here to get today some of them had driven quite quite distances they told me and then pretty frustrated to find that all classes were cancelled and at UCLA there was particular frustration uh because many students today would have been taking midterm exams and had got here especially for that some they told me stayed up all night revising the night before just to to come in and find nothing happening here today well let's cross from West Coast to East Coast Nom ikbal is at Columbia University for us this evening that statement from the Columbia president man ship shaik it's rather interesting because what we've seen is that where police have been taking down encampments protests have sprung up again and now she is appearing appealing for that period of calm noria it remains to be seen whether she'll get it well at the moment Christian it is pretty calm and peaceful I mean as as calm as New York City can be I guess uh it's still noisy of course but it's nothing compared to obviously what it was last night where New York police seem to carry out this coordinated raid on encampments in different parts of the city there are several universities here uh Colombia is almost like the the main Hub it's the the focal point for these Nationwide protests other encampments have been inspired by uh by the pro Palestinian supporters here but president shafik has been under huge pressure from right-wing politicians who say that she's not doing enough to crack down on these protests and then also from many of the the student protesters themselves who are really angry at what they say has been a heavy-handed approach uh the police did go in on April the 18th if you remember uh and then there was a fear by some students that it could happen again uh there was this deadline that was set on Monday for 2 p.m. for them to clear out uh it kind of passed without incident but then we saw the raids happen last night uh but president shafik is is saying look I'm I'm not against your cuse I'm against uh your actions and I think what really it came down to was there's a there's a distinction between protesting and disruption and when we saw that building being taken over that uh was the point where the police felt uh sorry the president felt that the police had to come in when you say it there's a distinction between protesting and disruption is that how Republicans it because I listened to the Senators this afternoon and they didn't seem to be making that distinction I mean people are entitled under their first amendment rights to go out and protest about a war they have concerns about and yet they they were talking about little Gaza and supporters of Hamas they were all being characterized as one which the pro Palestinian supporters say is just not reflective of their movements I mean I've spent time in the encampment speaking to them there are lots of Jewish supporters among them and some of the students have have made this sort of point to me about how uh really conservative politicians Republicans particularly have been for years going on about uh free speech on campus free speech on campus and uh cracking down and Council culture but they say it's simply because they don't like this particular speech that actually if you look at uh you know the concept of free speech in America that they are allowed to protest they are allowed to peacefully Pro protest so you know a lot of them very angry but you know as many of them say they're not surprised at the the the right-wing politicians view on this I think what many of them are frustrated by is uh they feel that the president uh sort of caved into that president shafik was in front of Congress a couple of weeks ago and she was questioned by Republicans over what is she doing to crack down on anti-Semitism uh but uh look um students uh they say these protests aren't going to end and it's worth mentioning that this was going on before October the 7th there is a long history of uh people here who've been protesting against the Israeli government and Israeli policies uh but for now the protests have abated it remains to be seen whether they pop up again just looking at these pictures of UCLA I mean are these people that are attacking the encampment are they students or are they professional agitators and people who are putting the universities there as a focal point I mean are these people from Los from wider Los Angeles that are getting involved in this well this is one of the points that certainly here the New York uh city mayor Eric Adams has made he says that there are these outside agitators to quote what he said that have come in and caused this trouble um but a lot of the students here don't really buy it they say that they want to see evidence of of of that um uh because they feel that the whole movement has been tarred by these accusations the police just haven't given us any information on who these individuals could be uh so at UCLA there is also speculation and reports that again it's Outsiders that have come in uh maybe from different groups to try and cause trouble for each side and that uh extreme extremists I guess on both sides are not representative of how students on both sides feel but as I say we've just not been given any details yet on who exactly the police thinks that these outside agitators are and where is Joe Biden on this what what is the president saying about the protest it's a difficult one for him because of course the the youth vote is is very important within his Coalition well President Biden's been across this the whole time and he has said that students have the right to free speech but he's also been very critical of the pro Palestinian protest saying that uh uh he completely condemns anti-Semitism as I say the the movement has denied that and again today uh the the White House spokeswoman released a a statement saying that people are allowed to to protest free speech is allowed it's when you start destructing start obstructing but you're right it's a difficult spot for him it's very unpredictable challenge because at best I think he will probably hope it's a distraction especially as we head towards the election but at worst this could really gain momentum I mean he's pretty much heckled at lots of events he turns up to the State of the Union Address in March uh his moate had to be rerooted from the capital to the white from the White House of the capital is a pretty short route because of pro Palestinian demonstrators who had staged a sit in on the road so um and I do ask a lot of the students is this going to affect your vote come November many of them are not committed to that they say that they don't want to think too far ahead to the election that right now what they're concentrating on is trying to to ra a voice for people suffering in Gaza namia thanks for your time this evening
