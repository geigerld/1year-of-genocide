00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%

00:09:54.839 --> 00:09:57.750 align:start position:0%
that direction but I think the key to

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.069 align:start position:0%

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.670 align:start position:0%
phase it says it will happen uh but it
certainly<00:10:14.600><c> may</c><00:10:14.760><c> not</c><00:10:15.000><c> happen</c><00:10:15.360><c> today</c><00:10:16.360><c> so</c><00:10:16.600><c> I</c>

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
certainly may not happen today so I
 

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.470 align:start position:0%
certainly may not happen today so I

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
think for now uh Israel has got its
 

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.069 align:start position:0%
think for now uh Israel has got its
