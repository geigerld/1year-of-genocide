a very good evening Hamas leaders have said they have agreed to a ceasefire proposal put forward by Egypt and Qatar the new spark celebration in Gaza but it may be premature the Israelis are saying tonight the deal is not acceptable because they had agreed with the Americans as far back as February a deal that has now been softened what we know about this proposal is that it sets out a three-stage process each lasting 42 days the first would lead to a release of 33 hostages in return for Palestinian prisoners and a partial isra Israeli withdrawal the second would lead to the release of all other living hostages there were thought to be about 128 still alive and the third phase would see a return of the bodies the Israeli defense minister said this morning that the decision to expand the assault on Rafa had been taken because Hamas had rejected their ceasefire terms so this has come as a surprise to the Israeli government let's go then live to Jerusalem our security correspondent Frank Gardner is there bring us up to speed if you would Frank on the action there in Jerusalem Christian things are moving incredibly fast here almost every minute there is a new update and the latest I should tell you is that a senior Palestinian official unnamed uh has told our correspondent one of my colleagues that one of the things under consideration and this is quite extraordinary is that Hamas is even considering a long-term cation of hostilities in other words giving up the arms struggle now they haven't committed to that yet and it would they would need to see this deal go through and for the truce to work so there's an awful lot that could go wrong before then but um these are quite momentous times here so although I've been urging people to kind of temper things you know there's an awful lot that could go wrong there are hardliners in the Israeli cabinet who don't want any kind of a deal with Hamas who simply want to see a hard Israeli military push into Rafa that eliminates Hamas once and for all in their eyes there are others including down the road from here protesters who are lying down in the street demanding a deal a ceasefire deal to get the hostages home now the latest version of this deal as we understand it is that it's going to come in two phases and the first phase um would see after 11 days a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces um there would be release of the remaining female Israeli soldiers military people who are in captivity and I should just correct something that was in your queue earlier it's not unfortunately 128 still alive in Gaza it's of 128 it's believed around 34 are probably dead so we're talking about 90 plus hostages still thought to be alive in Gaza somewhere held by Hamas and or its associates so so for each one of those it's complicated process this so bear with me for each one of those female Israeli soldiers who were released um there would be 50 uh Palestinian prisoners released women from Israeli jails including some with life sentences um and this is really about confidence building it's a stepbystep process um and the ultimate aim is to have a sustained period of calm and no hostilities now that's a heck of a big ass because um there will be enormous suspicion here in Israel that Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad or any other group isn't going to stick to this that there's going to be Rockets lobbed across the border and then Israel will say right the whole thing is off so there's an awful lot that could go wrong but the prize is there now out in the distance at the top of the hill people have just got to March up that hill to get to it just quickly Frank is there anything in the terms that have been agreed and as you say some of the detail is is quite difficult to get our heads around at this this point but is there anything you've heard there that the Israelis weren't expecting yes I mean one of the uh things I should add is that um what's being talked about from the Palestinian side is an end to the blockade in Gaza now that could be something that if that means uh demanding free passage for Palestinians to go in and out of Gaza to Israel and that's that's not clear if it necessarily does entail that but if it's that there's no way I can see a Netanyahu government agreeing to that because they have kettled everybody into Gaza Strip they say for security reasons in the past to stop suicide bombers who have come through that border and blown themselves up at bus stations in Tel Aviv but the people of Gaza live in intolerable condition you know it's it's the it's been called the O biggest open air prison in the world and it's an unsustainable situation in the long term Frank Gardner in Jerusalem thank you very much indeed for that well after the news broke and shortly after the Israelis had rejected the agreement the US Department of State spokesperson Matthew Miller was asked what happens next here's what he had to say so I can confirm that Hamas has issued a response we are reviewing that response Now And discussing it with our partners in the region as you know director Burns is in the region working on this in real time uh we will be discussing this uh response with our our partners uh over the coming hours we continue to believe that a hostage deal is in the best interest of the Israeli people it's in the best interest of the Palestinian people it would bring an immediate ceasefire it would allow uh increased movement of humanitarian assistance and so we're going to continue to work to try to reach one
