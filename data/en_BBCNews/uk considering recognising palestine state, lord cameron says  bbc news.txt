the foreign secretary Lord Cameron has suggested Britain is ready to bring forward the moment when it formally recognizes a Palestinian State he told a reception at Westminster that the Palestinian people had to be given a political Horizon to encourage peace in the Middle East well let's get more on this James landel our diplomatic correspondent is here with me really interesting these comments James and and you were there listening to David Cam and so to just tell us more about how he framed this essentially what he was saying is that something has to be done to start to political discussion so not just the immediate short-term talks to try and end the fighting now but actually something that can start unpicking a political process and his suggestion one of the suggestions was he said look you know there are lots of preconditions Hamas has to stop fighting it has to be guaranteed no longer a threat the leadership have to leave Gaza Etc but he also said on the Palestinian side some movement has to happen to try and give an incentive to Palestinians to engage in a in politics rather than fighting and his idea was to say look why why don't you have the recognition of a Palestinian State not as the end outcome of long-term solution to the Middle East crisis but something that would be part of the negotiation so it's more immediate as as as he said it provides a political Horizon for Palestinians now that is a change in the British position the British position was always you know we'll support you know two State solution at some point he's just saying well maybe we bring that earlier it's really interesting and certainly the timing of it is also interesting would the UK consider doing this unilaterally no I mean the minister was asked about this in the house of comms today he made it very clear this is not something that's going to be done unilaterally is a straightforward you know oneoff thing this is clearly something that Mr Cameron wants to do with allies uh but what he said and it's certainly not going to happen tomorrow um there has been some criticism in the House of Commons about this some conservative MPS have said you know this whole idea of re would be rewarding Hamas for the atrocities of October 7th I think the government's position is this is not that this is not anything immediate it's just saying in the future when those negotiations potentially if they happen maybe you bring forward that process to give Palestinians some confidence that in Mr Cameron's words uh that there is irreversible progress to a two-state solution and really briefly I mean you are talking about longterm because obviously in the immediate and the short term I mean the number of obstacles to actually getting to that place are just enormous enormous there's very very little trust and that's why Mr Cameron is in the region again his fourth trip since he's only been in post for two and a half months he's in Oman um just trying to keep everybody talking for all the problems that are many at least there are conversations going on at the moment James SEL thanks very much for taking through thank you
