hello I'm aai masiri welcome to the program we start in the Middle East the aid organization World Central Kitchen that's based in the US says it's immediately suspending its operations in Gaza after an air strike killed seven of its workers the organization says those killed are from Australia Poland the United Kingdom a dual citizen of the US and Canada as well as a Palestinian in a statement it said the Convoy was hit as it was leaving the de B Warehouse after unloading Aid and that it had coordinated movements with the IDF it said quote this is not only an attack against wck this is an attack on humanitarian organizations showing up in the most dire of situations where food is being used as a weapon of War this is unforgivable of course Israel denies that it is using food as a weapon of War now earlier Australian prime minister Anthony albanesi has confirmed one Australian woman zi francom was among those killed Graeme Satchel has this report the bodies of Aid workers being taken to a hospital in central Gaza they worked for the charity World Central Kitchen they were traveling in Armored Cars branded with their charity logo when they were hit by an Israeli air strike the charity says seven were killed from all corners of the world Britain Poland Australia America Canada and Palestine hey this is and we're at the the smiling face of Australian zie Franken one of those who lost their lives she'd been working in Gaza helping to organize the supply and preparation of food the Australian government is demanding answers the truth is that that this is beyond uh Beyond any reasonable circumstances someone going about providing Aid and humanitarian assistance uh should lose their life this is a video produced by the charity it is one of the biggest providers of food Aid in Gaza and has delivered more than 42 million meals since last October in a statement the Israeli military said it was conducting a review at the highest level to understand the circumstances of what it called a tragic incident but the deaths have been condemned by the founder of the charity Jose Andres he said the Israeli government needs to stop this indiscriminate killing it needs to stop restricting humanitarian Aid stop killing civilians and Aid workers and stop using food as a weapon in the Syrian Capital Damascus the clearup has started after an Israeli air strike on Iran's consulate two senior commanders of the Iranian revolutionary guard were killed in the attack it is the clearest sign yet that this conflict is escalating the Iranian Ambassador in Damascus hinted at retaliation definitely the Zionist regime knows better than anyone that such crimes and violating international law will have its response in an appropriate time the deaths of foreign aid workers in Gaza will put international pressure on Israel governments around the world will want assurances that Charities and their staff can operate safely Graham Satchel BBC News well let's look closer at that attack in Damascus that strike in Damascus and speak to Dr Alam senior lecturer in politics and international relations on Iran and the Middle East at the Australian National University uh thank you for your time now Muhammad zahi was uh the senior Commander the main senior Commander there that was uh that was apparently killed in that attack could you put that into context for us how high profile a figure he is in Iran well General zah was involved in in Iran's activities in in the region since 1980s he's the the top uh revolutionary guard Commander uh uh responsible for coordination between Iranian backed groups militias in Syria and Lebanon um and of course his Deputy also uh was killed uh amongst five other revolutionary guard members uh this is perhaps the the the the the top assassination since uh assassination of General kasm suan in Baghdad in 20 early 2020 uh what what makes this uh incident even more important is that has happened in Iranian consulate which is considered as Iran soil in Damascus uh therefore is a violation of international law however it seems also that t Aviv is well determined to drag Iran into a war and in doing so they um they they they hope to achieve the following uh objectives one is to involve uh United States in the region uh and to confront Iran perhaps directly and also to unite the fragmented political and societal um um uh Spectrum inside the country the the division between prime minister Netanyahu and uh and the and people we we know that the demonstrations have been uh ongoing uh and also to to divert the attention from what's going on in Gaza well Dr Sal to that point uh and given the fact that there are all these fears of an escalation of this war what options do you think Iran would consider uh I would say uh Iran knows very well that Tel Aviv wants to dve Iran into war uh and they benefit from this uh act if happens uh therefore for they won't directly retaliate uh uh and they if they will do it through their proxies in in Iraq in in Lebanon or in Yemen uh the the direct kind of conflict between Iran and Israel is it would be catastrophic uh and therefore Iran knows very well that U um that this should not happen and and we know that there are channels that Dr s apologies uh do you mean then when you talk about its proxies and also you mentioned Lebanon there that Hezbollah could be a vehicle in some way for a response yes of course Hezbollah is extension of Iran's security Doctrine in the region and it's it's actually designated to to to to defend Iran and uh rather than any other places therefore um uh it depends I mean the National Security Council in Iran uh last night have made the decision we don't know what the decision might be but uh we may know that uh uh that hisbah would be involved in in such retaliation uh in one way or another soon uh the the the question is that there are channels that that tan and Washington are are are in touch uh it seems that United States has been blamed by tan U and United States also uh have uh declared that they have not been uh uh in involved in such attack and and there there are hopes that United States and Iran may solve this problem somehow uh Bey the curtains all right thank you so much Dr Alam s for that perspective now you you'll remember the beginning of this program we started with the news that the world Central Kitchen and Aid organization has said that it's suspending all its operations immediately in Gaza and that's after they said an air strike has killed seven of their aid workers now let's go live to Jerusalem and our Middle East correspondent yolan Nell for more uh yoland what's the latest on that quite a lot of detail given in the statement from World Central Kitchen saying that it's seven Aid workers uh that have been killed they British Australian polish us and Canadian national dual national uh and Palestinians as well uh killed in an apparent Israeli air strike in Dar balah which is in the center of the Gaza Strip and uh the US charity uh saying that um these workers and its team were in a convoy of three cars uh two of them armored and they had been coordinating their movements with the Israeli military they were leaving a warehouse in that City having just unloaded something like 100 tons of food a that had just been brought in by sea of course this is a charity that's been very much involved um in opening up the new Maritime route between Cyprus and and Gaza and bringing food in that way um now the CEO of the organization eron Gore said this is an attack on unforgivable the Israeli military has not confirmed this strike it said it's carrying out an indepth examination of the highest levels to understand the circumstances of what it calls a tragic incident and your land what position does this put Israel's allies in allies like the United States the United Kingdom uh allies who potentially have Nationals who've been killed in this strike we've already had the Australian prime minister coming out um and demanding that those responsible for this be held accountable and saying that um Australia has spoken to the Israeli government as a result of one of its citizens um being killed uh this is really something that will have further repercussions for other Aid work um happening in Gaza and it involves so many countries because of the different nationalities of the aid workers involved the it's a US charity we've also had the National Security Council um in the US coming out and talking about this as being a tragic incident and saying that it too is looking for answers
