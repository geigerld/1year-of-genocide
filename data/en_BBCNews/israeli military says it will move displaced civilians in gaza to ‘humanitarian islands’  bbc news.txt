Mana Foster here in Jerusalem now Israel has said that it plans to move displaced Palestinians from Rafa at the southern tip of the Gaza Strip into what it's calling humanitarian islands in the central strip ahead of any military ground offensive that would happen in rafan this has been reported this morning by the Associated Press not a huge amount of detail of what those humanitarian Islands would look like or how exactly they would work but rear Admiral Daniel hagari has quoted as saying that they would have temporary housing and they would have aid for something like 1.4 million Palestinians who are currently in Rafa at the moment as I say it's right at the very southern end of the Gaza Strip it's where more than half of the population is now Sheltering and it's a place where Israel has said that it needs to carry out a military ground offensive because it says that in order to achieve its stated aim of fully removing Hamas from Gaza the only way to do that is to Target hamas's remaining surviving leadership they are believed to be in and among those civilians who are Sheltering in Rafa now now of course this remains a an operation which has questions attached to it certainly the use of the word islands is an interesting one because the central part of the Gaza Strip uh has been left severely damaged by months of Israeli ground and air attacks people who live there have left their homes they'd be going back to those areas but of course the buildings that they were living in many of them are not left standing and are not habitable anymore which is why you see down in Rafa at those thousands and thousands of tents that people are living in the flow and supply of Aid is very limited of course Rafer is the the main route by which Aid gets into Gaza at the moment by Road and there's continuing pressure on Israel as well to try and actually increase the amount of humanitarian Aid that's going in now on those humanitarian Islands the US Secretary of State Anthony blinken has said that he has yet to see a plan or details of a plan from Israel about how they would protect civilians during a military ground offensive in Rafa but he also said that it was important to see a plan to make sure that civilians were moved out of Harm's Way and we're also looking today at the progress we've been following it uh here on BBC News over the last couple of days the progress of what would be the inaugural ship to use this new Maritime Aid Corridor that was announced by the EU last week and has been set up between Cyprus and Gaza now a Spanish uh ship the Open Arms run by a charity set off from Cypress on Tuesday it's towing a barge with around 200 tons worth of meals that have been provided by World Central Kitchen uh important to say though that when it arrives in Gaza there are a lot of challenges that it will face now we know that it is approaching the coast but in terms of an actual time scale of when it might arrive and start Distributing that Aid World Central Kitchen uh before now have said they've been reluctant to give a an official timetable and you can see why why because there isn't a port or or proper Jetty or dock or anything like that on the coast of Gaza at the moment so what world Central Kitchen have been arranging actually in Gaza is the building of this temporary Pier to try and receive the aid from the ship actually using in some cases uh rubble from destroyed buildings to try and build some sort of structure that this barge could come up to and then they could unload the aid now that is the first problem of course the second issue that they will face is how when you are surrounded Ed by so many desperate people around 300,000 or so believe to still be in the northern part of the Gaza Strip how you securely and safely and fairly as well managed to distribute that Aid among the people who were so desperate for it and we've seen Aid convoys swamped by people in the last few weeks there was that occasion where more than a hundred people were killed around an aid Convoy where IDF soldiers opened fire they said that they felt threatened by the crowds we saw some people actually crushed under the wheels of the trucks that were carrying the aid so we know that even as that Maritime Corridor uh starts to build and more ships start to come in that those issues will remain and of course the scale of the need uh is is not diminishing in fact it's it's getting greater all the time and that is why the International Community say that they are continuing to put pressure diplomatic pressure on Israel to allow more and greater volumes of Aid in
