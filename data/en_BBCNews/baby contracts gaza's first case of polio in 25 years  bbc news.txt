you're watching BBC News let's turn to the latest developments now from the Middle East the un's defense secretary Lloyd Austin says he has spoken to his Israeli counterpart to discuss a range of issues in the region including the ongoing exchanges of fire on the Israel Lebanon border and the need to finalize a broader ceasefire deal well it comes as un officials have confirmed the first case of polio in Gaza for 25 years with the disease partially paralyzing a 10-month-old baby the head of the world Health Organization has said he's Gravely concerned that efforts are underway to roll out a vaccination program in the coming weeks well let's speak live to our correspondent in Jerusalem wah Davis who's there and we let's start with the final part of what I read out there is a considerable alarm at that development there of polio in Gaza not just from the who now we've heard from other un agencies today confirming what had been suspected that polio was now present in Gaza it's been confirmed today that a baby has been infected with polio and has been partially paralyzed and of course polio is a highly infectious disease and the big concern is here given the San sanitary conditions given humanitarian crisis in Gaza that it could spread very very quickly it's one reason why the UN has called for for a ceasefire not just for military reasons but to actually allow more vaccines to be brought in and for those vaccines to be distributed effec itively Israel has pushed back um a couple of times in in last few days on this saying that a number of well hundreds of thousands of vaccines have already been sent into Gaza but of course the problem is that with such a large displaced population with people living in such difficult conditions and with a war going on it's very difficult to administer uh most if if not all of of those vaccines so some vaccines we learn have gone in again in in the last 24 hours but with this confirmed case of and with the potential for a much bigger spread that is another one of the the considerations here and why some people are calling for a cease fight so those vaccines can be delivered and administered in terms of those ceasefire negotiations again all the pointers pretty bleak as it stands how close are we or how far away are we to getting any sort of deal well the honest answer is that we just really don't know there are conflicting reports coming from uh around the region according to Hamas officials who've spoken to the BBC now Hamas are not actively part of these talks in KIRO there has been no progress they have received nothing updated they have received nothing uh as far as they concerned that persuades them that a ceasefire agreement is any closer there are unconfirmed reports in parts of the Israeli media that they are perhaps close to a breakthrough and perhaps a new proposal will be delivered by the negotiators to Hamas who aren't part of the talks what we do know is that Israeli Egyptian and American negotiators are in Cairo the sticking points from the outside might not seem to be that big the biggest contentious issue seems to be what Israeli troops would remain in which parts of Gaza in the event of a ceasefire there's an area the Border area between Egypt and Gaza where perhaps both the Egyptians and Hamas would want the Israelis to leave from Israel uh through Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated it wants to retain some sort of Israeli presence in the area at the end of the day it depends how much both leadership the Hamas leadership in Yaya Sina and the Israeli Prime Minister in Benjamin Netanyahu how much they're prepared to compromise uh in order to achieve a ceasefire and of course the return of the hostages but uh not much concrete news coming out of Egypt as we speak we Davis there in Jerusalem thanks a lot for that thank you
