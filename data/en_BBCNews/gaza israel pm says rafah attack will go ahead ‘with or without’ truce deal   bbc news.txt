Hamas leaders are considering a new Middle East ceasefire proposal from Israel the deal includes a 40-day truce in return for the release of some hostages it would also allow for displaced families to return to Northern Gaza it's reported to involve new wording on restoring calm to Gaza that's designed to satisfy hamas's demand for a permanent ceasefire a source close to the talks told the BBC the new proposal from Israel is significantly different from previous offers the US Secretary of State Anthony blink called this deal extraordinarily generous that view echoed by the UK's foreign secretary Lord Cameron all the pressure in the world and all the eyes of the world should be on them today saying take that deal it will bring about this stop in the fighting that we all want to see so badly according to Israel 133 hostages are still being held by Hamas and Gaza at least 30 of them are presumed dead mediators from Egypt Qatar and the US have been attempting for weeks to broker a deal to bring another pause in the fighting now One Source has told the BBC they are cautiously optimistic about the prospects of this deal being accepted in a development though Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that Israel will carry out an offensive against Hamas and Rafa regardless of whether or not is fire deal has been reached well as those negotiations take place fighting continues in Gaza we've seen smoke rising over the center of the strip earlier today as airr hit the territory the health Ministry said there had been a further 47 deaths in the last day it says more than 34,500 people have died since the conflict began almost 7 months ago following the Hamas attack on Israel on October the 7th our Middle East correspondent yanell is in Jerusalem this Hamas delegation that was in Cairo meeting Egyptian and katri mediators uh left late yesterday and we understand that they're now in consultations uh with the top Hamas leadership um Arab media suggesting that they will get back to the mediators um by the end of tomorrow with their response to the latest deal that's on the table now uh feeding into all of that we do have these new comments by uh the Israeli Prime Minister on the one hand he's reiterating what he's said now for many weeks that uh Israel is still determined to go into Rafa in the very south of the Gaza Strip to eliminate Mass battalions there uh that they'll do that with or without a new hostage deal but obviously the timing here is of the essence this is a very sensitive moment um and there are fears that you know anything could Scupper um a new deal at this point are you we're just seeing pictures there of Benjamin Netanyahu the war cabinet continues to meet of course how much domestic disagreement is there and disagreement within the cabinet about what should happen with Rafa I mean within the overall cabinet of of the coalition government led by Mr net yahu you do have some really deep divisions now and um those on the far right have really been saying that Israel needs to prioritize going into Rafa um in order to win this war um one uh farri right Minister bezel smrd said the government had no right to exist uh if it didn't prioritize that and then in response we had Benny Gans who's a member of the war cabin is more of a Centrist um coming back uh saying that the government had no right to exist if it blocked a hostage deal uh so you can see there is that Dynamic going on the latest comments by Mr Netanyahu do appear to put him more on the side of his far-right ministers but he's also going to be under a lot more International pressure in the coming hours as we're expecting the US Secretary of State Anthony blinken uh to come to meet Israeli leaders uh the US and others have really been uh pushing for a new deal at this point that would bring home um Israeli hostages and in exchange um have a sort of six day uh six week ceasefire uh in the Gaza Strip um and we've had you know various uh Western leaders coming out saying that this is something that that is positive um Arab ministers supporting that as well Yan we've already heard from Mr blinkin who said that the US has not yet seen a plan that gives us confidence that civilians can be effectively protected in Rafa how would you judge the US influence on Benjamin Netanyahu at the moment and their leverage well the US position is very much that uh really because of the number of people in Rafa down along the Egyptian border that have been displaced by the fighting something like 1.4 million people crammed into a very small area that means that no uh ground offensive can really take place um effectively there it's going to be impossible to move that many people um in a way that you know Israel can go in with the force that it wants to to go after what it says of four Hamas battalions that are still based in that City it's the one part of the Gaza Strip where there has not been a full ground offensive up to now um but it's really not clear just how much uh leverage the US has over Israel of course we know that on the international Stage IT consistently uh Shields Israel uh that it is a major donor has just recently approved approved billions more dollars in military aid for Israel um but you know Israel has consistently made clear that when it comes to issues of its own security um it will very much take advice uh from the Americans we know that there have meetings been taken place um to try to discuss alternatives to a full ground Invasion o of Rafa with Israeli and US officials but in the end Israel says it makes its own decisions you Le now there
