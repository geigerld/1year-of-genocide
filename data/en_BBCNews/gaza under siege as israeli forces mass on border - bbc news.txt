Israel continues its mass mobilization of troops hundreds of thousands on the southern border with Gaza the widespread expectation that a ground offensive across the frontier may be coming but the UN is calling for essential supplies to be allowed into the territory where the humanitarian situation is deteriorating rapidly as Israel enforces a Complete Siege the very latest from right across the region with our International editor Jeremy boen in the southern town of biri the Israelis have made a lot of progress in getting their troops prepared for that moment if and when and probably when the order comes to invade Gaza in the fields and Farms On the Border wire Israel's combat soldiers are creating jumping off points to invade Gaza late this afternoon at kibuts B regular units and some of more than 300,000 mobilized reservists were preparing for the order to move in that most Israelis believe will come the buildup that we're seeing here is certainly the clearest evidence that I've witnessed that Israel is preparing for a ground operation in Gaza and if you add this to the formation of a war cabinet you can see the direction they must be going in Israel's allies are gathering Anthony blinken the US Secretary of State is flying in overnight from Washington American Support includes weapons and moving an aircraft carrier battle group closer to deter Iran's allies in Lebanon from joining the war the United States has Israel's back we have the back of the Israeli people we have their back today we'll have a tomorrow we will have it every day James cleverly Britain's foreign secretary was already here in in Israel at a Frontline town near Gaza I'm not going to speculate on what support we might want to give I'm here to find out I'm here to find out what practical support we can give to Israel the foreign secretary was hustled into a shelter when the sirens went Israel has the four square support of its allies after the massacres perpetrated by Hamas in their safe rooms millions of Israelis are praying waiting often frightened now that assumptions they had about their safety have crumbled their government says what it's doing in Gaza is defending them but only a few miles from this family in ashalon Israel's Onslaught raises questions about whether it's breaking the laws of war in Gaza Israel has caused immense damage in only 5 Days International humanitarian law obliges belligerence to protect protect civilian lives Israel says all this is legitimate self-defense against Hamas but it's also cut off supplies of water food Fuel and power to more than 2 million people and killed hundreds of civilians outside the main hospital in Gaza City Allah alfan sits with the bodies of his entire close family they'd moved twice to escape the air strike until one hit their borrowed apartment at 4 this morning I've lost my father my brother my uncle two cousins two other family members and my pregnant wife I'm the only Survivor he said we've done nothing Israel insists Hamas is to blame for the suffering of Palestinians but accusations that Israel is answering the war crimes of Hamas with ones of its own have started back in Israel videos are still emerging from the Hamas attack last Saturday security cameras showed two women trying to escape a Hamas gunman somehow he misses them armed Israelis arrive and the man who wanted to murder them either Retreats or is killed and at AAL hospital near Tel Aviv signs of the tension in Israel a visiting government Minister gets a furious reception a nurse yells they've been helped by every kind of Civilian but the government has given them nothing the military buildup might steady Israeli nerves and the defense minister said tonight we will wipe Hamas off the face of the Earth Jeremy in BBC News in southern Israel well Palestinian media say the only Power Plant still operating in the Gaza Strip has now stopped working after running out of fuel and as we've been hearing there are more than 200 targets that have been hit by the Israelis in air strikes overnight and these images show the level of Destruction this is the remal area before the strikes and this a light image of the same neighborhood which came through yesterday and has been located by our colleagues at BBC verify more than a thousand people are now known to have died and a quarter of a million have been forced from their homes well Gaza is of course Under Siege and Communications are extremely difficult but we can talk now to our correspondent rushi Abu alouf who's live in Gaza City for us tonight rushi just tell us what the last few days have been like living in an area under siege and under constant bombardment from the air yeah I can see I have been witnessing the heaviest air strike in my 20 years covering of this story it was by far the heaviest I've been witnessing what the destruction in this remel neighborhood it's the for a very long time this neighborhood is been the safe heaven for most of the G and most of the streets in this neighborhood was was destroyed I was among the families who were like suffering on during that days but the humanitarian side of the story is is is moving in a very significant way when we have when when like two million people lost the electricity today we are talking about the essential services such as Medical Services Water Supplies Food Supplies are being suspended because of that the humanitarian Corridor for letting food and medicine and fuel into to Gaza is a must is a call from every Palestinians that why we understand tonight from a senior Egyptian official that Egypt is working closely with other countries and contacting Hamas and Israel to try to find a a draft of six hour to allow goods and fuel to come from Egypt into Gaza and rushi what about the suggestion the possibility of a ground Invasion we heard from Jeremy boen that the more troops are massing on the border with Gaza uh acrossing Israel how are people feeling about the possibility that there could be a ground Invasion this is the most worry for the people people in Gaza are fear this because they have lived through a ground Invasion before back in 2014 we have seen Israeli tanks in refugee camp we are talking about a camp in the North like when 100,000 people live in a very small tiny piece of land if people are already ex exhausted by 3,000 air strikes and 1100 people died o only from from what soldiers and tanks are engaging in Street to to Street and house to house fighting with Hamas in Gaza with two million people living in this tiny piece of land okay we'll end it there rushi Abdul Al thank you very much indeed for joining us live from Gaza where Communications are obviously incredibly difficult to establish and to maintain
