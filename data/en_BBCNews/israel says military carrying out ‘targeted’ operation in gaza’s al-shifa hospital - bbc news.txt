hello welcome to the program I'm Katherine banga we start with the developing situation at gaza's largest hospital in the last half hour the Israeli military has confirmed its operation against Hamas at the alifa hospital is still currently underway Israel says the hospital conceals an underground Command Center used by Hamas which is designated as a terrorist organization by the United Kingdom United States and several other countries it's the claim doctors there deny meanwhile in the US the White House and the Pentagon say they now have intelligence that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad are operating from tunnels below hospitals including alifa and that they're also storing weapons there it's the first time they have backed up Israel's claims to this extent despite its new intelligence the US says hospitals and patients must be protected in a tweet the Israel Defense Forces said we can confirm that incubators baby food and medical supplies brought by IDF tanks from Israel have successfully reached the shifa hospital our Medical Teams and arabic speaking soldiers are on the ground to ensure that these supplies reach those in need the Israeli military said it its actions at alifa are precise and targeted the Gaza Strip has been under sieged by Israel Defense Forces since Hamas launched its attacks in Israel on the 7th of O October our correspondent in Gaza Rishi Abu ALU has spoken to an eyewitness at the hospital I made another contact with eyewitness inside the hospital he said he saw six tanks within inside the hospital and about 100 Israeli commanders soldiers they St the main emergency department of the hospital he said uh one person of them was speaking in Arabic shouting at the people don't move don't move and then they entered the the hospital after 4 days of besieging the hospitals with tanks from all around it and cutting AIS in and out today the BBC was told by two eyewitnesses inside that the Israeli soldier are storming five buildings of the hospitals the one of the witnesses he just told the BBC that I saw six tanks and about over 100 Israeli Commandos unit entering the main Department emergency room and they were shouting in Arabic don't move don't move he said there was some shooting around and they they they fire a smoke pomp in the outskirt of the of the hospital and then they started to move inside well thousands of people are believe to be in the complex here's more from our correspondent yanel who's in Jerusalem we're still relying on some eyewitness accounts from inside the hospital uh that tell us how in the dead of night Israel forces entered um there were they say uh six tanks that went through into the front of the compound U more than 100 Commandos some of them masked who were shouting in Arabic don't move don't move as they entered the emergency department um this account from an eyewitness whose um report we can't independently verify at the moment um but you know it's very clear that Israeli forces are on the premises working there there was also um someone from the Hamas ran Health Ministry who was speaking a short time ago in another television interview who said that Israeli forces had gone down into the basement of the hospital this of course is where Israel has been saying consistently that it believes that Hamas has an underground uh tunnel complex it's been using as well as some of the buildings of the hospital um it says as a kind of command and control center that is denied by Hamas but also um by the medics who work at the hospital um yesterday interestingly the US for the first time uh came out and said that it had its own intelligent sources uh corroborating those claims from the Israelis uh we haven't seen any sort of visual proof up to now um made public uh that this is the case um but the White House also said that hospitals and patients must be protected Ed and we think that within the shiffer hospital right now there are accounts vary but between 2 and 4,000 people uh the biggest number are people who went there originally uh to take shelter but there are also of course doctors and and patients who are being treated uh some of them very vulnerable uh including more than 30 premature babies who were taken off of the uh out of incubators because of the lack of power um and that's been a big focus of intern National concern with suggestions they could be evacuated that haven't um really come to any fruition Israel has been saying consistently that it is willing to allow staff and patients uh to flee from the shiffer hospital in recent days because this standoff has been going on for some time uh but what Palestinians have said is that Israeli forces fired at some of those people um who were leaving that it was too dangerous also to move those most vulnerable patients well that was the BBC's your land now in Jerusalem well for more on this story let's go live now to Juliet tumor director of communications for the UN works and relief Agency for Palestine uh refugees and uh Juliet I just want to start by asking you what you make of events happening at aifa today we are watching with horor we're watching these reports with absolute horror uh medical facilities should be protected at at all times but this is yet another indication that no place is safe and no place including civilian infrastructure like hospitals like un facilities have not they've not been spared during this war and Julius I want to ask you about uh something specifically to do with the UN in Gaza we're getting reports from Reuters news agency that a source a humanitarian Aid source has said Israel has given approval for 24,000 lers of diesel fuel to be used by trucks for un operations in the Gaza Strip can you confirm this no I cannot confirm this I like you saw the Reuters report and uh I can confirm that no fuel has come into Gaza to dat perir the statement that we put out last night we confirmed that no fuel has come into Gaza since The War Began it's been five weeks now and in fact we at anra are on the verge of uh having a significant reduction in our operations and in some cases if we do not get fuel um we will be forced to stop some of our operations that are life saving so but is there are there ongoing negotiations is there a possibility that an announcement could come soon allowing you to get fuel into the Gaza Strip there has been negotiations for many many long weeks now about the issue of fuel it is very simple fuel has been used as a weapon of war in uh in in Gaza people have been deprived of basic Services due to the lack of fuel we at anra have been calling to get an urgent shipment of fuel for the past three weeks and it has been falling on deaf ears and this is obviously putting a lot of pressure on us as the largest humanitarian agency to do our work without fuel we cannot work it's very simple it's very very simple just tell us about the humanitarian situation in Gaza we know what's happening in the north the ongoing fighting in the South we hear it was a particularly rainy night and it was quite difficult for a lot of people there in Gaza overnight yes look the rain is going to make um really desperate situation far worse um including for people who have been displaced which is now more than 34s of the Gaza population they have been forced to leave their homes 800,000 of those are in un shelters they are overcrowded we do not not have fuel again so we cannot provide things like heating or clean water this is why it's absolutely critical that fuel comes in and it's not a one-off shipment by the way there needs to be shipments of fuel on a regular basis on a daily basis and the amount that we need to run the largest humanitarian operation in the Gaza Strip
