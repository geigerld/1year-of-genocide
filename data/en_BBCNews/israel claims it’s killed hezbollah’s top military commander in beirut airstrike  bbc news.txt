Israel has carried out an air strike on the Lebanese capital bayout in what it says was a targeted move against a commander of the militant Group hezb which is backed by Iran the strike happened in a heavily builtup neighborhood one woman was killed and emergency services are still looking for survivors Israel blames Hezbollah for an attack last weekend in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights during which 12 young children died the group denies involvement from Lebanon here's correspondent quainton Somerville Israel's response came just before Sunset a drone attack three strikes on a building in beut southern suburb of daa the explosions could be heard across the city an attack that Lebanon has been bracing itself against for [Music] days the target a hisbah commander Israel blames for the attack on Maj Del Shams in the occupied Golan Heights Emergency Services here are still working to rescue the injured at least one woman died and dozens have been left wounded it's not known if the commander was killed this is the building that was struck by an Israeli drone we believe uh three rockets hit the building as you can see this is quite a heavily built up civilian area but Israel says it had the Hezbollah Commander it holds responsible for the maal Shan's attack in its sights reports about whether he actually made it out alive but we do know there's been at least one woman killed and a number of people uh injured here tonight uh this area of Southern beu was the same area in which a Hamas official was targeted and killed by Israel back in January this year the big question now though is what comes next because Israel has said its response would be severe and it said it would take a number of days so this strike tonight here in Beirut may not be the end of it a new footage has emerged tonight of Saturday's attack in the Golan children playing quietly then an air raid siren there was no time to take cover it left 12 Dead all children and young adults watching a nearby football match Hezbollah which has fired thousands of rockets and missiles into Israel in the last 10 months denies it was behind the attack the Iranian backed group stands shoulder toosh shoulder with Hamas but it's far better armed and its Fighters more formidable the conflict here was mainly contained to border areas and Military targets the unwritten rules of this almost War but Saturday's attack on the Golan on civilians has pushed Lebanon and Israel to the brink the United States and others have been working to contain things how Hezbollah responds to tonight's assassination attempt and what Israel does next next will determine whether War here is inevitable Quenton Somerville BBC News Beirut well the White House says that an allout war between Israel and Hezbollah is not inevitable but as you heard there there are widespread fears of an escalation our correspondent Paul Adams is in Jerusalem for us now and Paul what's your assessment of the situation tonight look Rita this was clearly a very Target attack Israel didn't just lash out after the events of the weekend it took 3 days to pick a Target and then went after that Target it's also quite noticeable that they have not issued any changes in terms of the home front instructions to civilians uh no indication that the there is an anticipated uh significant Hezbollah response that is interesting uh Israeli officials are quoted as saying that the ball is now in hezbollah's court I think the Israelis are convinced that this has been successful in fact in the last few minutes they've issued a statement saying that they do indeed believe uh that F chuker their intended target is dead in fact the statement gives a long account of his history of involvement in attacks against Israel stretching way back into the 1990s so I think they feel that this uh was a very very deliberate very precise strike Israeli officials have been saying as Quint mentioned that Israel's response would be tough but that it could go on for some days so it may not be an end of the matter and obviously Israeli officials who've been meeting late tonight will be very keen to see what the response is I should just point out one other development which is that there have been explosions that have targeted pro-iranian Shiite militias in Iraq to tonight now we don't know who was behind those attacks uh possibly the United States possibly Israel but when I spoke to a senior Israeli military official over the weekend about Israel's likely response he did point out he was at pains to point out that that all of this could be traced back to Iran
