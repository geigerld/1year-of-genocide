in the Middle East Israeli media is reporting that a local leader of hamas's military Wing has been killed in an Israeli air strike in the occupied West Bank Palestinian media confirmed the attack saying four other people were also killed when a vehicle was struck near the city of tulup comes as the US says it's stepping up America's military presence in the Middle East deploying additional warships and fighter jets as Regional tension grows the Department of Defense says it aims to strengthen protection for US troops in the region and Israel in response to Growing threats from Iran and Iranian packed Fighters while Iran and its allies have promised imminent retaliation against Israel an announcer on Iran State tv said on Friday night that in the coming hours the world would witness extraordinary scenes and very important developments while the announcement came after a funeral ceremony in Qatar for the Hamas political leader Ismael hania who was killed in Iran on Wednesday Hamas and Iran have outow revenge for the strike that targeted Mr hania although Iran and its allies have blamed Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not claimed responsibility for his death let's speak to our correspondent intell Jenny Hill hi Jenny let's start with the American uh preparations talk us to what we know about what they're doing yeah the US has said that it will be sending an extra Squadron of fighter jets to the region um as well as warships stating that America's commitment to Israel's defense is quote Ironclad now it's not the first time we've seen such a scenario perhaps you'll remember that in April uh Iran fired more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel Israel was able to intercept them shoot them down with the help of the Us and other allies nevertheless it is a reminder of just how dangerous and significant this moment is I'm here in Tel Aviv on the beach front where it all looks and feels very relaxed people getting on with their daily lives but people here are uneasy we know that Iran has vowed along with its proxies revenge for two assassinations that of the Hamas political leader and a senior Hezbollah Commander everyone knows something is likely to happen but it's not clear what that retaliation will be what kind of scale we'll see or indeed when it might happen so this is a country on high alert um a number of International Airlines have suspended flights to and from Israel and ministers in the Israeli cabinet were sent home this weekend with satellite phones um for use in the event of an attack which throws out any kind of communications Network um as you know there's urgent diplomacy going on right now to try to stop Israel war on Gaza which began um following the October 7th attacks from exploding into a region wide conflict and that's why the US's intervention now is not only about um providing help to Israel militarily but also focusing on ongoing efforts to try to diffuse the tension um the Pentagon spokeswoman said yesterday um that they still think escalation is not an inevitability um America urging all parties in this to look at potential for a ceasefire um it's worth remembering of course that you know there are two groups of people um in all of this whose voices have become somewhat lost in the geopolitics people in Gaza because don't forget Israel's war on Gaza goes on there were people killed there last night in a number of strikes um those people know that right now a ceasefire looks very remote and then there are the families of Israeli hostages who are being held captive by Hamas in Gaza still they know that a chance of being reunited with their ones um it's greatly diminished right now um one potentially positive note Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli Prime Minister has sanctioned an Israeli delegation to travel to Cairo potentially as early as this evening for ongoing negotiations on a possible ceasefire but as I say right now tension is high the world is watching the Middle East and hoping that a crisis can be averted and Jenny just briefly could you talk us through what we know about the events in the West Bank there yeah um it reports suggest that um a local leader of hamas's military Wing in one part of the West Bank so not a senior figure um has been killed in an Israeli uh strike um it's also I think serving to illustrate the fact that normal daily events are going on here as you know um the Israeli Defense Forces are committed to dismantling Hamas it's struck it's leadership so they keep going after any Hamas um anyone within the leadership chain although we we believe this chap was very Junior within that particular structure also worth pointing out that the daily exchange of fire um from Hezbollah and Southern Lebanon and the Israeli defense fors in Northern Israel continues you know um people talk about an escalation there's already a lot of violence going on um on an hourly daily basis um in this part of the world the fear of course that any escalation could see that violence explode into a very um different level Jenny thank you very much for that we're going to take a look at the wider geopolitics now we can speak to mun Abu Noah retired Jordanian Air Force General thank you very much for coming on the program thank you uh talk us through your reaction to the US at re sending the reinforcements through this is sort of a a demonstration at the same time putting pressure uh on hisbah Iran uh and to prevent a wider uh escalation of the war so that's what's uh but will this change the his and Iranian regarding the retaliation of hania killing that was a great insult for Iran so I think the retaliation is coming I I can't de to end with this uh uh situation probably in two weeks time that's normally the Iranian patient for the call and they calculate everything carefully before committing anything and what kind of what do you expect from the retaliation what kind of decisions will Iran be making I think it's going to be different like uh the previous one shooting 300 missile or the ballistic missile same time they will use this uh mainly in high value Target or center of gravity Target in Israel uh everything will be calculated not to expand or widening up to a regional conflict because if this happen and nobody can control that in a way uh there will be a catastrophe in in the Gulf area mainly with these all Field closing B Mand and Heros by Iran the whole world will be stopped in that matter and I think the American they need more troops uh uh like three to four carrier in in the area and almost 400,000 Soldier to conduct such a war and I don't think the alliance America cannot conduct a war in the region with no Alliance and and I don't think with the diplomacy ET trying to contain the matter and uh not to widen up the escalation this is the main thing okay and as Iran calculates its next step and other countries in the region wait for that what is the role of other countries in the region which countries specifically will be saying what to whom here the Middle East is shattered country they the attack and uh same time Iran and its Alliance Brooky uh they want to finish this job and you know stop the war in Gaza hisbah said stop the war in Gaza and will stop the attacking Israel that's the main thing and I don't say I don't see that the war in Gaza will stop or a ceasefire will reach because uh without without knowing exactly what's the day after in Gaza Israel is committing a genocide and gazan people C the whole world so that so uh it would be difficult and I think this is if it stayed like this this will be an endless war and Forever War that's the way I see it it's very hard to fight ideas and the gazan and the paltin and it's from generation to generation they will k carry on resisting that Israel is became sort of uh I'll say it clearly a threat to a regional stability and Security in our part of the world they have to go for diplomacy solve the problem ceasefire on G Etc otherwise tension violence extremism will will build up in our part of the world AB Noah thank you very much for coming on the program thank you thank
