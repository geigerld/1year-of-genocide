turn to the Middle East and there have been developments in ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas with both sides continuing to review proposals Egyptian mediators have arrived in Israel and local media reporting there's been notable progress in finding common ground in Gaza itself the Hamas run Health Ministry says at least 50 people have been killed in Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours this was the scene in Rafa on Friday night the BBC has learned that British troops could be deployed on the ground in Gaza to help deliver Aid via a new sea route Aid would be delivered from Cyprus on large ships before being transferred into trucks and smaller landing craft the floating Causeway would be several hundred met long and anchored firmly into the sand the United States has decided not to put American boots on the ground a diplomatic correspondent James landel is following the developments from Jerusalem well this week Katherine the American defense um Department gave a long briefing to uh official media in America about how this new Maritime Aid Corridor would work but there was a big hole in the plans and that's because the United States has made it very clear they are not going to put us boots on the ground in cyp in in in Gaza they are not going to drive those Aid trucks off the landing craft onto the the floating pontoon or Causeway when it's established and onto the beach into a secure Zone on the beach uh in Gaza so someone's going to have to do that the Americans said an unnamed third party would do it they said it would be a significant partner of the United States a nation not some private military company and my understanding is that one option being considered by the British government is that British troops would drive those trucks now I should be very clear no decision has been made the issue has not yet reach the prime minister's uh desk the mod is not commenting nor is the Israeli Army but the British have been very closely involved in this operation's planning from the very beginning both in American headquarters in Florida and also in Cyprus a British ship is going to be used as a dormatory for hundreds of American Service men and women involved uh and even the the British hydrographic office has been giving detailed information to the planners about the the nature of gaza's Shoreline so it is a possibility it is an option the British forces will drive those trucks onto the the beach in Gaza In Harm's Way but it is just an option no decision has been taken and James looking at the situation in Gaza we're hearing of notable progress in terms of mediation talks between Israel and Hamas do we have any detail on how those talks are proceeding well I'm always cautious about being hopeful and disappointed and progress and stalled in these kind of negotiations CU they're just long and difficult what we do know is that the talking is continuing uh Egyptian officials were here in Jerusalem yesterday we know that Hamas uh overnight has said that they have received the latest Israeli proposal we know that there's a big conference taking place in Saudi Arabia this weekend under the egis of the world economic forum and there's a possibility of some parties talking to each other in the sidelines of that of that conference I think the idea is that there is going to be another attempt to see if a deal is possible for a ceasefire for some hostages to be released for some Palestinian prisoners to be released before any military operation begins in Rafa in the south of Gaza against Hamas Fighters that Israel says are HED up there in tunnels so it's another attempt to try and make some progress we'll see whether it does because thus far it's been very very difficult for both sides to try to bridge the divide the BBC's James landel in Jerusalem will let's speak to Chris Parry a former British Royal Navy officer thank you for joining us on BBC News how would an operation like this work well uh what we have to imagine is that the coast L Gaza doesn't have any port facilities and so if anybody can remember what D-Day was like we had mury Hubers and we had peers and pontoons that were leading from deep water into the shallow Zone and also the shore and what this is called by the Americans is called Joint Logistics over the shore jlots and it's it's essentially a floating Pier that enables you to put heavy trucks and also other loads ashore from uh ships that can only go into deep water and there'll be real questions about the safety of any troops that could that would take part in an operation like this how would their safety be guaranteed well during the construction of this pontoon Pier U people are going to stay in raw Fleet auxiliary Bay which is a 15,000 ton auxiliary ship that works for the Royal Navy um I think we've heard already that a third party is going to be driving these trucks I sincerely hope it isn't British troops we know that there's endemic criminality in Gaza itself which dominates all Aid and supplies that are going in and I suspect the interface would best be served by uh an Arab country rather than uh any British troops going ashore so I suspect we're going to be limited to doing what is offshore and the truck driving and all the other things are best placed amongst those who are understand the local culture and can deal with it and as we've seen obviously during the course of the war um in Gaza there is the possibility of mistakes as happened with the aid workers with the world Central Kitchen do you think that would be a factor in the government's decision in this and what are the consequences if there is a mistake and British troops are injured well as I said I don't think British troops will be involved um so I think there'll be but if they're on the ground in Gaza there's a potential for anything to happen they won't be and that's my point I think they'll be offshore uh on the installation and that'll be clearly demarcated um so the Israelis know that I don't think the Israelis or anybody else is going to be deliberately attacking uh the Pontoon or the aid suppliers offshore unless they intend to do so and I think there'll be instant retribution uh on anybody who tries to do that uh
