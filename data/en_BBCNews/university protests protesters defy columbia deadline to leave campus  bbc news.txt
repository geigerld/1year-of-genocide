now let's stay with Israel's military campaign in Gaza and look at the protests against it that are sweeping across college campuses in the US Nationwide rallies during which there have been hundreds of arrests are showing no sign of stopping at uccla a pro Palestinian encampment has grown in size in recent days as has a group of pro-israeli counter protesters on Sunday there were skirmishes between the pro Palestinian and pro-israel groups after a barrier separating the two sides was breached let's hear from a protester there we heard about the counter protest showing up uh they're trying to show up saying that um this this part is just full of hatred um so we're just here to counter them uh we want to show support to the US protesters who have been here um in their cabins uh well the White House has insisted demonstrations must remain peaceful here's the National Security Council spokesman John Kirby speaking to ABC we certainly respect the right of peaceful protest uh people should have the the ability to to air their their views and to share their perspectives publicly but it has to be peaceful uh we'll leave it to local authorities to determine um how these protests are managed but we want them to be peaceful protests and obviously we don't want to see anybody hurt uh in the process of peacefully protesting uh but again the president understands that well the students are calling for their universities to boycott company ianes and individuals with ties to Israel major protest camps and demonstrations were first seen at Colombia University in New York since then though they've spread across the United States take a look at this it shows the universities with the biggest protests the University of Southern California has canceled its graduation ceremony on what it says as safety grounds in Austin Texas the governor ordered state troopers to arrest demonstrators there have also been hundreds of arrests at universities in Texas Atlanta California and Virginia these pictures you're seeing here are from Virginia Tech well our North America correspondent nomia ikbal is currently in Columbia University in New York for us and nomia Columbia University administrators have ordered students participating in the campus encampment there to disband or face disciplinary action have they disbanded it looks like judging from what's Happening behind you that they haven't they haven't uh yes the encampment is behind me and students Got a notification around about midday to say that there was this call for them to disband by 2: p.m that came from the president of the University president shafik who's under Fire uh by students uh because of the way Riot police went in last week uh she's also Under Fire from right-wing politicians who say she's not doing enough to stop these uh protests on campus which they have claimed anti-semitic something that the pro Palestinian protesters have completely denied but what's happening at the moment is that you've got uh students and they're not part of the encampment they are other students who have joined in support of the students inside the encampment and they're sort of circling around if we can just have a look that they some of them are walking around um and they've been chanting the demands uh which is Boycott divest and sanction uh sort of outlining what it is the students want essentially the students want uh Columbia University and this is the same demands that students are making at other protests around the country they want their institutions to effectively cut economic and academic ties with Israeli institutions and I've been speaking to students all weekend and they say all those demands have to be met but the president of this University today said that the negotiations have uh failed uh which means those demands aren't being met and they and the University president the administ ators want the students to essentially clear out they have said they're going nowhere and just as we were coming in we saw the police asking up barricades we saw one police officer with zip ties I did ask them what is the plan do they plan to go in and arrest students again of course they they said no comment uh so right now the situation is you know students have have been very kind of the ones I've been speaking to not just here but NYU as well a campus that's a university that's 30 minutes away they are feeling tense but also they are adamant that they're not going anywhere until their demands are met but the university wants them out particularly by May the 15th here which is when it's graduation day
