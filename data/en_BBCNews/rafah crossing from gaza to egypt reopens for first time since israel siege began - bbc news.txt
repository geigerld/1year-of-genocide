we start with the latest developments at the Rafa Crossing in southern Gaza where the first ambulances carrying the wounded from Gaza are entering Egypt take a look at these these are pictures showing these ambulances coming through it's thought 88 injured Palestinians and around 500 foreign Nationals will be allowed out in the very first phase of this movement out of Gaza into Egypt the UK's foreign office says it understands the Raffa Crossing will be open for controlled and Tim limited periods to allow specific groups of foreign Nationals and the seriously wounded to leave in the meantime Hamas says that seven of the civilian hostages it took from Southern Israel last month were killed in Israeli air strikes on the jabalia refugee camp in Gaza on Tuesday it says three were foreign passport holders Israel hasn't commented as yet on the Hamas claim well meanwhile the Israel Defense Forces have released this footage of Warships with missile capabilities in Red Sea which they say are there to strengthen defense efforts well for more on this developing story Let's cross live now to our correspondent in southern Israel Anna Foster Anna maram thank you it's been a a morning where we heard really in the early hours that the Rafa Crossing was expected to open for around about 80 seriously injured Palestinians and several hundred foreign passport holders to actually pass out of Gaza into Egypt through the raff of Crossing now it's worth saying that this is something that has been discussed more than once and there hasn't been an evacuation of this type so far in this more than three and a half weeks of war the only people we've really seen leave Gaza have been four hostages who were released by Hamas and one Israeli soldier who was said to have been rescued in a in a mission there a few days ago so we watched this morning as crowds of people gathered on the Garen side of the crossing and again it it is a a slow and an often painstaking process we saw the ambulances lining up waiting to take people and as is so often the case with this it's such a fast moving story we also had Communications that were lost again in Gaza in the last few hours so really trying to piece together how many of those people were going to be able to leave there is a list that has been published and it was published and finalized before now of foreign passport holders whose names and nationalities had been checked and they were told that they would be allowed to leave we've heard from the UK foreign Ministry just in the last few hours that they believe that that is going to happen in a staged process over a number of days but details are still really very thin at all and what we're not seeing just yet that's not to say it won't happen but what we're not seeing just yet is large numbers of people actually through that Crossing on the other side now our correspondent in Gaza rushia Abal is uh on the uh the Gaza side um and we'll hear from him and also as well these live pictures to bring you from my position here in southern Israel where you can see these continuing strikes over Gaza you can see smoke in the air it is one reason why people are of course trying to leave Gaza in numbers and rushi Abu Alo H gave us the latest from there from his side of the crossing this morning this is the Rafa Crossing around 400 500 people are waiting here to cross this is the first people who have dual nationalities and they are waiting for the Egyptian to allow them to cross I have the five officers uh passport Control Officers who are inside now the Palestinian side of the of the terminal they said they will process first about 8 to8 injured people with serious injuries they will process them first and then they will start allowing Nationals we understand from like local Authority here that about 7,000 people who are registered as dual National in in Gaza and they will be allowed to cross to the other side of the border to the Egyptian side uh 500 beer day so this uh process is going to be long and it will take time and uh but until now in the place here in ra we haven't seen like any police any Hamas ran police controlling the area we haven't noticed any problem yet the crowd is still small and they are relatively manageable they are waiting in this whole here the terminal is in this side so once the Egyptians are approve call the Palestinian side they will be Crossing into the other side of the Border this is a very significant development giving that the crossing was closed totally closed like since the beginning of of this war it was open for like two days in the beginning and after that Egypt shut the crossing because they said Israel bombed uh the this Hall we were able to see some footage about the damage we understand that the uh some heavy machinery were inside last week and about 10 days ago they were fixing the the damage there today is going to be a test for this Corridor Egypt want to take as much wounded people as possible to help the the Palestinians getting a treatment in Egypt because the hospital in Gaza are overwhelmed by the number of of casualties and the shortage of fuel and Medicine
