for weeks now there have been talks and anticipation around a ceasefire deal to end the conflict in Gaza and for weeks those talks and that anticipation has led to nothing could there be a breakthrough this evening President Biden's been speaking in the last few hours and he said Israel had submitted a comprehensive new proposal for a ceasefire to end its war with Hamas the plan would involve the withdrawal of Israeli troops from populated areas of Gaza as well as the release of Israeli hostages the president said the proposal has been sent to the Palestinian side and he urged Hamas to accept it let's have a listen to more of what the president had to say for the past several months my negotiators of foreign policy intelligence community and like have been relentlessly focused not just on a ceasefire that would ever that would inevitably be fragile and temporary but on a durable end of the war that's been the focus of durable end of this war one that brings all the hostages home ensures Israel's security creates a better day after in Gaza without Hamas and power and sets a stage for political settlement that provides a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike President Biden speaking earlier at the White House while joining me now is our Middle East correspondent Hugo Baga Hugo what is different in this new proposal that's come from Israel because of course for weeks now we've been hearing of different offers and deals from both sides yeah regini so this proposal is very similar to a proposal that was put forward by Egypt which has been acting as a mediator in in these negotiations so it is a three-phase proposal uh the first phase is a six- we uh ceasefire that would lead to the release of uh some of the hostages who are now being held in Gaza uh and that it would see negotiations uh happened for a permanent uh ceasefire so we know that yesterday Hamas said that it would not engage in negotiations uh before the end of the war and uh and we've seen that here in Israel the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected any idea of a permanent ceasefire in Gaza uh before uh the end of the war so and before he could achieve the the goals of the war so it's very interesting that this plan has been announced by President Biden he didn't mentioned uh prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and also you know we know that this is very likely to be unpopular with uh some supporters far-right supporters of the Prime Minister who have rejected the idea of reaching a deal with Hamas they say that uh the war must continue until Hamas is defeated and also until all the hostages are freed because they say that mil pressure is the only way to bring the hostages back and I think the president described this deal as a truly uh historic moment and he said uh that uh you know he urged Hamas to accept this deal he said that this deal was presented to Hamas by qat which has also been acting as mediators in these negotiations and so Hugo what comes next then we wait for a response from Hamas yeah I think now you know the ball is on hamas's Court and uh we are you know waiting to see what kind of reaction is going to come from uh Hamas uh we're also waiting to hear from uh prime minister Netanyahu from senior Israeli officials uh the speech by President Biden came after the start of the Jewish holiday here so I think it's going to take a little bit of time uh before we hear from some key Israeli officials but again uh prime minister Netanyahu has been under pressure from the families of the hostages who remain in capital AC ity in Gaza and also from uh International leaders to try to present a proposal uh for a a a ceasefire and on the other hand Hamas has also been you know under a lot of pressure to accept the deal because obviously you know we've seen that uh you know the the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues more than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of this conflict so now a new proposal being put forward by uh by the Israelis according to President Biden so I think now we're still waiting to hear what kind of reaction is going to come from Hamas here go Bea in Jerusalem thank you very much for that and we're just hearing uh from the Israeli Prime Minister's office a statement here that's come into us by the Reuters news agency which says the Gaza war will not end until all goals are achieved including the return of all hostages and the destruction of Hamas we'll bring you more reaction from all sides to those proposals which have been announced by the White house to the program
