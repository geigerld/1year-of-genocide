Israel's military says it has killed a senior Hamas Commander Adel mama in an overnight strike in central Gaza the BBC has not been able to verify the Israel Defense Force claim that he led an attack on a kibuts in southern Israel on the 7th of October in Israel the New Year began with air raid sirens in Tel Aviv and other areas after Hamas launched more rockets and there was no letup in the air strikes hitting Gaza with at least 24 people killed but Israeli tanks have pulled out of some parts of Gaza City ahead of a planned troop ruction our Middle East correspondent Yulan Nell is in Jerusalem she gave us more details about last night's Hamas rocket attacks so it was just after midnight local time people in Tel Aviv have been seeing in the new year and there were these Air Raid Sirens that went off as a barrage of rockets uh Hamas used its longer range M90 Rockets were fired towards Tel Aviv also were parts of Southern Israel um now Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system was quickly in action there with a thuds of uh interceptions bringing down those Rockets but really a very Grim start to the new year uh meanwhile in Gaza itself in the dark we had scenes of Rescuers scrambling in the rubble of B buildings that had been newly flattened by Israeli air strikes um some 50 people killed in the latest air strikes in Gaza City about 20 of them people who are taking shelter of the alaka University we understand um also in the Center and in the south of the Gaza Strip fighting there remains extremely intense Julet tumer who's director of communications for the United Nations relief and works agency known as unra and give us a little bit of an impression of What It's Like on this first day of 2024 there thanks uh so much Happy New Year look not much difference um the the air strikes and the bombardment continues and with that uh crowds and crowds of people continue to head south in search of safety that sadly has not existed for almost three months now across the Gaza Strip and in in your estimation when Israel says that it plans to well that the conflict could continue throughout the year what does that do to particularly children's psyche perhaps I think to everybody psych um the the continuation of of the war and any int ification and expansion is going to mean more suffering everywhere more loss and more grief it is time for a ceasefire what about shelter how how are you getting on with providing shelter for you have been forced to move from one place and then had to move again yeah well umra right now is hosting 1.4 million people across our shelters in the in the Gaza Strip people continue to come to these shelters and they are overcrowded mainly in the South so some of them have been just um forced to live wherever they can including out in in in the open and um they are um they're very very um difficult conditions across um these um these shelters and there needs to be much more um supplies coming in to help uh people in in need and on that issue of supplies there are reports of negotiations going on behind the scenes to try to get to a point where more can can come in can you explain to us the logistical and the security concerns at the moment you have to overcome when you do bring material in look it's a very complex humanitarian operation in in the Gaza Strip yes there isn't much suppliers coming in so that's for sure there's also the bombardment itself that stands in in the way uh there's also um hits against uh humanitarian facilities and humanitarian workers including the recent shooting that we had against one of our convoys but there's also high high levels of desperation of hunger among people in in in Gaza uh which means that every time we go and provide Aid especially in areas that we're not able to reach as much as we should people just come to our trucks they take stuff uh and they start eating it then and there and so this is why it's absolutely fundamental that there's a humanitarian ceasefire we know from the shortlived pose from a few weeks ago that we managed to bring in more supplies that we managed to um get into other areas that were restricted previously and that people finally had some rest fite
