British prime minister Rishi sunak has landed in Tel Aviv starting a two-day visit to the Middle East Mr sunak is expected to meet his Israeli counterparts Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli president Isaac Herzog for what he said on his arrival here he hoped would be productive meetings this after urging Regional leaders to avoid further dangerous escalation we'll be speaking in a bit to our chief International correspondent Lee ducet about what Mr sunak hopes to achieve here in Gaza meanwhile Egypt has agreed to let humanitarian supplies in via the Rafa Crossing an initial Convoy of around 20 trucks of Aid are expected to enter Gaza after a deal announced by President Biden but none of this is likely to happen until Friday announcing the agreement the US president warns that the aid convoys would be stopped if any supplies were confiscated by Hamas which governs Gaza and is labeled a terrorist organization by the UK and the us we can bring you live pictures now of Gaza it is around 10:00 now in the morning there Israel's military says it hit hundreds of sites in Gaza over the last 24 hours including in the south of the Gaza Strip in the last half hour it says it's been targeting herass infrastructure with the latest here's our correspondent weira Davis as trucks carrying Aid queue on the Egyptian side of gaza's Southern border the UN and international Aid agencies have become increasingly alarmed at the unfolding humanitarian crisis on a visit to Israel that lasted barely a day while reaffirming his steadfast support Joe Biden also pressed the case for aid for gaza's 2 and a half million Palestinian citizens many of whom are struggling to get access to food water and medical supplies then on the plane home the president told reporters that a deal had been reached Egypt had agreed to let an initial 20 trucks in through the Rafa Crossing this has been a very uh blunt negotiation I've had and uh so we want to get as many of the trucks out as possible there's I guess 150 or something there not all of them will go the first trch if there's a second trch see how it goes the aid will be delivered under un supervision with the president saying it might not arrive until Friday there was also a warning that it will stop if any is taken by Hamas which had been one of Israel's main concerns we've said and the Americans have said there have to be safeguards in place to make sure that Aid goes to the people it's supposed to go to now Hamas are the only people in Gaza with guns and it's not like if they come to an oil Taker and say come here there's much that you can do about it but there have to be Arrangements in place to make sure that that doesn't happen both Israeli and Palestinian officials are still blaming each other for a huge explosion at a Gaza hospital that killed almost 500 people President Biden had earlier said he believed Israel's version of events as the dead were buried the blame game continued and tensions rise ahead of what many assume is an inevitable Israeli ground invasion of Gaza and with almost 200 hostages held by Hamas inside Gaza there are concerns that direct Israeli action might jeopardize their safety their families will have taken some comfort after President Biden said he'd also discussed their plight saying he could not reveal details but there was no higher priority than that safe return there will be more diplomatic visits in coming days including rishy sunx today supporting Israel's right to self-defense but also urging restrain with civilian populations when as expected Israeli Ground Forces do go into Gaza W Davis BBC News Jerusalem from Gaza now we turn to Israel's northern border with Lebanon there have been further crossborder exchanges of fire between Israeli forces and hisb militants in southern Lebanon the Israeli military said rockets and anti-tank missiles had been fired into to Israel from Southern Lebanon it said it responded then with tank fire and a drone strike Hezbollah is backed by Iran it said two of its Fighters were killed on Wednesday and another was wounded these border skirmishes have raised concerns in Israel that it could face a two-front war we can cross live live now to our correspondent Anna Foster who's on the Israel Lebanon boundary Anna good morning to you how how does it feel where you where you are at the moment because we talk about crossborder skirmishes we're still talking about uh exchanges of fire of course between uh Israel's Mighty military and Hezbollah which uh has a huge Arsenal itself that militia in southern Lebanon so the potential there for escalation is huge and that's what both sides are thinking at the moment right yeah you're absolutely right and that is why there is so much concern when you compare the the size of heesa the number of Fighters it has the amount of Firepower it has um to its allies Hamas down in the south hezar is a huge threat on this northern border and that is why Israel have moved so many of their troops so many armored vehicles and tanks and you see them when you travel along this border as I've been doing for for several days now what you see is empty communities you see towns and Villages within 2 km of the Border that have been evacuated almost completely evacuated there are just soldiers there now and some local security teams at you see right along the roads where uh Israel have have really done what they can with their military to shore up this border and it's also worth saying as well you know it's interesting the point you make that this is this is always a tense place it has been for years but while we're talking about what's going on this in the South around Gaza we see those constant rocket attacks from Hamas and similarly we've seen the Israeli air strikes it doesn't normally happen like this on this border yes it's tense but you don't normally see these constant exchanges of fire you don't normally see these these engagements like this and this is a a really worrying upturn and I think that's why you're seeing so much International diplomacy focusing on this border Joe Biden when he was uh he was here yesterday the US president he said very very clearly very explicitly in his press conference to any uh hostile actor or state that is planning to attack Israel don't don't don't that's why they put aircraft carriers in the Eastern Mediterranean that's why the UK foreign secretary James cleverly is coming in parallel with that visit from the British prime minister Rishi sunak but he will go to Qatar turkey and Egypt and and his mission is very clear as well it is to try and stop this conflict conflict spreading and becoming a a regional War absolutely anab as you say while Israel has um emptied out places where Israelis are living close to that border with Lebanon it is moving more troops up to that border to what extent do you think we are in a situation where Hezbollah feels it needs to be seen to be doing something because of that tense situation in Gaza those pictures seen around the world of the suffering of Palestinian civilians bringing uh people out into the street in protest across the Arab world including into Lebanon and Israel feels it needs to to be seen to be firing back and to what extent are we really on the edge of a possible escalation difficult to say with certainty Anna of course but the sense where you [Applause] are yeah it is it's a really key Point Catcher And I think there are two two things at play here one is these constant exchanges of fire across the border because they are to an extent limited they tend not to to to focus on on civilian infrastructure they tend to focus on Military posts that they are they describe it as sort of the the agreed Rules of Engagement on the northern border as it were the problem will be if something goes wrong if there are a large number of Civ civilian casualties on one side or another a misstep almost and and that could risk inflaming tensions the other as you rightly say is at what point does Iran essentially because Hezbollah is backed by Iran and Iran are the ones who really will will make the decisions about what Hezbollah does but but you're right to say what could that trigger be now I think the main thing that has been discussed is this Israeli ground operation into Gaza which we've been talking about for for well over a week now which hasn't happened yet but I think a lot of people might see that as the trigger point I think the explosion at the hospital in Gaza again I know there was a lot of concern the day before yesterday when that happened because people thought will that be the inflammatory moment but the rhetoric that we are hearing from Iran and and what we're seeing you in terms of what they're doing the Iranian foreign min has been touring the region he's been in Beirut talking to hezbollah's leadership um they've been on social media saying the time for political Solutions is running out um that they cannot stand by and and watch Palestinians in Gaza be treated this way um and I think that is why there is there is so much tension that you know the I think the accepted belief that that a big moment could again be something that that that I say forces I mean it doesn't Force but in in their minds it would force Hezbollah Force Iran to get involved in this conflict and and that is what is causing so much worry here absolutely Anna we can't overemphasize can we how much the sense here uh and across the Middle East is that we are in a very perilous situation uh where escalation could be round the corner and we will be looking at all the Diplomatic efforts a bit later in our program for now thank you very much Anna Foster on the Israel Lebanon border and we can now turn to uh the Israel Gaza border um we can join Le ducet uh right on the border there uh in southern Israel Le we were just talking to you Anna there about tensions in the north of course in the south things remain tense at this very heightened sense uh ever since militants from the Gaza Strip crossed over into Southern Israel uh killing 1,400 people taking 200 hostages into to Gaza where they remain now and Israel's military saying they've continued striking Gaza overnight into this morning as well yes Israel's uh there's been no let up in Israel's military operations heavy bombardment overnight people living in Gaza have spoken of the non-stop bombardment since the beginning of this crisis living under the attacks night and day there were reports this morning uh that people living in residential blocks were told to leave and that those blocks were destroyed and so more families are on the streets now looking for shelter yesterday the United Nations expressed concern that there was still bombardment in the south of the Gaza Strip which is where Israel had ordered more than a million Palestinians to flee flee from their homes in the north for their safety and protection um Israel said but they're coming under bombardment too but I think this morning Kya so many gin will be hoping against hope that that news that President Joe Biden has secured an agreement from Israel and Egypt to get the first Convoy of trucks some 20 trucks in all coming through that Raffa Crossing bringing some of that desperately needed Aid 20 trucks is not enough but at least it is a beginning and that is what they'll be hoping as they struggle to find shelter water food and at this in these hours um as you say the the the idea is to let uh water uh food and medicines into the Gaza Strip so needed as as the UN does keep emphasizing Israel though involved you know in in brokering that agreement to allow in the a trucks says fuel is not allowed into the strip the concern says Israel is that fuel could be diverted by Hamas inside Gaza how needed is fuel it's needed sort of for uh pumping water right and water to salination as well yes it was striking that when the United Nations the spokesperson for the un's relief and works agency unra which is the main agency helping Palestinians um in in other pal in the other Palestinian territory in the occupied West Bank but also in the Gaza Strip when they listed the Urgent needs uh life-saving needs of the people of Gaza uh she emphasized that it was fuel that was Des really needed yes to pump the water our our viewers may remember that some days ago uh during a phone call between prime minister Netanyahu and President Joe Biden who was then in Washington it was announced that there was an agreement that water could go into the southern uh Gaza Strip but then the next day we were told by the United Nations that the pumps only worked for 3 hours which not enough for the more than a million gazin desperate uh water in the of of the Gaza Strip and of course you do need as you mentioned electricity to be able to to to pump the water supplies and that's needed in the north of Gaza too so many families uh couldn't leave wouldn't leave and there's hospitals in the north as well so much is needed and so much is needed now um Lee finally how does this work practically a much needed Aid if it starts coming in the US said not to expect those Aid convoys uh to start entering the Gaza Strip till um earliest tomorrow Friday and is then brought to people uh inside Gaza what about their safety though because Israel is continuing its air strikes of course there's renewed talk about a possible ground offensive Israel is still saying it wants to destroy Hamas in the Gaza Strip so how to separate the civilians H and keep them safe while these military activities continue given what has happened so far what we've heard from the Egyptians so far it seems clear Egypt won't open the Rafa Crossing unless it has guarantees that Israel will not bomb it the rougher crossing the only way in and out of the Gaza Strip um has been bombed at least four times since this crisis erupted Egypt has said it needs to keep its staff Manning that passage safe earlier air strikes by Israel destroyed some of the buildings so today they're going to begin the work first of all in this extraordinary moment there's the very ordinary details of road safety President Biden said there are potholes in the access roads so his team is on the ground they're working with some repair teams they're going to try to fix the roads so that's the first element of safety making it sure the trucks can safely reach the crossing then there is the issue of being absolutely sure there's an iron CL clad guarantee that that first Convoy we understand 20 trucks won't come under Israeli fire one once it enters Gaza uh we haven't got all the details but we would expect that Palestinian Health officials civil servants the United Nations other Aid agencies will quickly become involved in trying to distribute that Aid because as we've been reporting Israel has made it absolutely clear as did Joe Biden if any of that Aid is diverted by Hamas it will stop but as you know K it must be very difficult to distinguish who is Hamas and who is not everyone has been uh seeking shelter but certainly it doesn't want it to go to the the military Wing isin Al kassam um and we should also emphasize that Israel has said that it will allow Aid only through that Crossing that no Aid will enter from Israel until all of the captives nearly 200 captives Israeli non-israeli 30 nationalities were told come home free Le duet on the Israel Gaza border thank you very much indeed that was our special International corres respondent Lee duet talking about the conundrum of how to get much needed Aid into Gaza
