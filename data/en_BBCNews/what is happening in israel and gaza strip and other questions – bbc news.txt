hello I'm maram masheri it's time now for your questions answered over the next 15 minutes we'll be answering questions that you've sent in about the Israel Hamas conflict which has now entered its fourth day well this drone video shows the scale of Destruction reaped across the Gaza Strip over the past few days Israel's Army claims to have hit a further 200 Hass Targets in overnight bombing Israel has ordered a total blockade of Gaza cutting off food water and supplies the UN Human Rights Chief says The Siege is illegal under international law while the World Health Organization is calling for the establishment of a humanitarian Corridor well to answer your questions I'm joined now by the BBC's Middle East analyst Sebastian Asher and joining us from Jerusalem as BBC correspondent formerly based in Gaza John donison hello to you both and thank you to you both for joining us today Sebastian let me start with you we have a question from alimu jalo in Guinea and they say why is the United States supporting Israel with all the killing done in Gaza it's a very understandable question it's one that many people ask uh from all around the world and I mean I think in this particular instance at the moment the US is certainly not alone in this because of what Hamas has done because of the atrocities that have been carried out at the moment it's being uh seen by most governments certainly most western governments to be honest a lot of Arab governments and so on around the world as a terrorist act that will change almost inevitably as The Siege on Gaza grows but a wider context of that is the US has essentially yes it it gives uh huge financial support to Israel it gives almost 4 billion dollars most of that goes in military hardware most of which comes from us companies it vetos motions resolutions at the UN Security Council which criticize Israel now the US itself as government's change essentially has stayed pretty much the same position it sees itself and it tries to present itself as an evenhanded mediator in the conflict and essentially adhering to the idea that a two-state solution is what is needed under President trump it changed slightly but with President Biden it's gone back to that but from the Palestinian perspective they believe that that just isn't the case but it isn't evenhanded uh that it is essentially so closely allied with Israel not just in terms of the support that it gives but also I mean in a political sense I mean the us as a democracy sees and I think most American citizens see Israel as a the only functioning democracy similar to the US in the Middle East they see it as a Force for good for that reason of course there's a large Jewish population as well uh in the US which has a big say in elections and very few politicians want to say anything that that goes against what they have to say so I I mean I think that the US has to some extent um tried hard to get a solution to the conflict there have been several incid I mean back in 2003 was was the closest for its come to the two-state solution talks have stalled but there is this sense and I think it's a very understandable sense not just from the Palestinians but but more widely that its its finger is far more weighted towards the Israeli side and the Palestinian side despite the fact that it will condemn some of Israel does and most recently with the current far right relatively far right Israeli government under under under uh Benjamin Netanyahu there's been some of the strongest criticism so far from the US of an Israeli government but at the moment that is all in abeyance at the moment the US would be 100% behind Israel Sebastian thanks for that John let me ask you a question put to us from Carol Fenton and she says what will it take for Hamas to stop trying to annihilate the whole of Israel what compromise uh would be enough how can peace be achieved without Mutual understanding and respect for both sides I don't think it can and I think that's why uh there has been this intractable conflict now for decades and decades and I think Gaza is important because until some sort of uh compromise as you say can be reached with heras in Gaza you are never going to have peace in the Middle East and I I think at some points over the last decades when there continues to be this talk from Western countries the United States Britain the EU uh of the the the goal being a two-state solution uh but Hamas because so many countries regard Hamas as a terrorist organization who they're not prepared to talk to not part of the discussions it was always fanciful really to think that there could be a two-state solution until Hamas were part of that deal and they have not really suggested uh that they were ready to accept the existence of Israel uh as a state alongside a possible future Palestinian State uh that's been new nuanced at times over the years but essentially Hamas says it wants uh the land uh between the River Jordan and the Sea so all of what was historically Palestine it's interesting what John said there Sebastian I want to ask you about this I've had a lot of emails about this from people the terrorist organization Hamas why is it that news organizations like the BBC like ITV like sky like a number of other organizations do not use the term terrorists when describing Hamas militants I think it's uh I mean there are a number of reasons I think one of the reasons is that when you are broadcasting to a world audience uh you want your perceptions the way that you are are are are are are dealing with the story not to look as if you are taking any particular side and calling a group a terrorist group will always look that way and people will always be demanding for this cause or that cause that it's called terrorist or that is not called terrorist so I so I think the BBC feels that the best way that it can maintain a sense of of of of some form of objectivity of not looking partial is to do that I think it becomes difficult ult when there are acts atrocities that are carried out I mean I think the way that is often found around that by organizations like the BBC is to speak of Acts of Terror or to have the voices of people who are denouncing it as terrorism but not itself using that term but yes it comes under criticism I'm sure you and I John as well I mean we have these discussions both professionally but also personally you know a great deal of the time and from the Palestinian perspective I I mean again uh many Palestinians just would I mean I mean they would feel I think if we described Hamas as a terrorist group they would feel that that was in a sense a kind of total rebirth to them I mean they see it as a resistance movement and they would see I think it as being like the us but we no longer being even-handed if if we took that let me ask you another question Sebastian this is from maragold Robbins in France and maragold says the US and Europe defend Ukraine why are they not defending uh Palestine well I I mean there's more Nuance to that question isn't there I mean without getting deeply into Ukraine I mean Ukraine was a situation that suddenly erupted what we're talking about and what John was talking about there is a situation between Israel and P but has been going on for decades and it has you know it has shifted in its balance time and time again Ukraine you know was was was at least at the start almost clearly from most perspectives an invasion by Russia that Ukraine was resisting and I think that Clarity at that moment made it simpler for governments to respond in that way whereas the issue between the Palestinians and the Israelis is one which is so embedded in so many different phases that it's harder for governments to come out with such a black and white position but I mean you can't gainsay the fact that the European Union that the UK the US I mean all of these countries to provide financial support to the Palestinians and have done I mean the US has been though again it blows hot and cold has been one of the main supporters financially of the UN a agencies which essentially keep the Palestinians going as much as uh that is achieved both in in Gaza and in occupied West Bank so I mean I think with all of these things Ian it's a very boring answer but there is you know a great deal of nuance to this and I think we as journalists have to try and stay with that as much as possible rather than just going with the main thrust of a story at one particular moment and try and stay as true to that as possible and try to make you know an audience uh uh care about that aspect of a story rather than just immediately go one side or the other I don't know what John thinks about that well it's interesting I mean I uh covered uh two short Wars in Gaza when I was based there in 2012 and then I came back in 2014 and one of the things that struck me was um for example the United States provides a lot of the military support to Israel that causes so much of the destruction in Gaza uh and at the same time you know uh a lot of the EU Britain France Etc offers a lot of support to Israel in dealing with Hamas in Gaza but then it is also those same countries who uh support Israel who are then having to pay time and time again for the Recon Construction in Gaza and it was a really depressing situation I suppose that what there was a sort of pattern of every two three years there is another war in Gaza and things will get rebuilt and then things will get destroyed again and I think what Israel has said this time is they they want to well both sides actually Hamas has said they want an end to the status quo they want to change the dynamic and I think Israel now in its retaliation feels that it wants to do the same and change that status quo in its Favor John thanks for that Sebastian we had another question here from Damen Armstrong and Staffordshire uh saying why is financing to military aid required and needed by Israel a relatively rich country against the Palestinians well I mean it's not simply against the Palestinians I mean the the the military support that's given to Israel is meant to defend it against all potential threats I mean from an Israeli perspective we've heard from the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for years and years but he sees Iran as the major threat uh and that's a view that is shared not just by the US and much of the west but also increasingly by a lot of Arab countries but it's a very valid question and it's actually a question that has been raised within Israel uh quite regularly that it's almost I mean it's different voices obviously uh that that that that and for different reasons and perhaps for their own you know political motivations but bring up this in a sense you know why should Israel be beholden it it's it's a rich country essentially it's a country that that you know that is that is extremely developed why does it need $3.8 billion from the US um and does that make it you know just a satellite of the US and I think that that is an issue uh that at the moment again will be put in a bance a bit because we're seeing the US actually offering more Military Support to Israel in this particular situation and also they're bringing warships to the region so again I mean these issues which really need to be looked at you know very very seriously and with a Long View made which actually affect the long-term future in terms of support for Israel the billions of dollars I mean there's lots of criticism inside the US why are we sending almost $4 billion to a country that's that's rich when we have huge problems in the US that need to be addressed but that you know several billion dollars of that could surely be more usefully uh spent in the US let's take you very briefly both of you to live pictures uh coming into us uh from Gaza and I just want to update people on what the latest lines are before we move on uh we of course have had the uh Israeli forces saying that they have targeted 200 Hamas targets overnight and they are continuing to Target Hamas targets through the day our correspondent on the ground rushi describing it as Like An Earthquake the Damage Done uh by these bombs and air missiles being thrown from Israel this is the scene live in Gaza for those of you watching now Sebastian let me ask you uh another question from a viewer this is an anonymous viewer and they say I'm an avid viewer of BBC News Channel I like many others are concerned about the war Hamas has engaged on Israel um my question is although Hamas instigated this war against Israel by breaching its borders is it fair or could it even be a war crime that Israel has stopped food medicines and fuel getting into Gaza and that is an anonymous question well this is a story actually that we've been dealing with just now the uh un uh human rights Chief urk has just issued a statement in the past hour saying that to uh have a Siege like this of a civilian population is against international law it's a breach of international La he hasn't quite put it as um a war crime um but it I mean saying very very strongly uh that this is something that is not acceptable under international law and you know I mean the rhetoric we're hearing from Israel and I mean John obviously is very much across that as well is so much against that at the moment I mean it's so strong I mean you're hearing both from politicians and the people that they want there's an appetite for this total Destruction of Gaza so in that context I mean this sense that a Siege of Gaza this denial of food this denial of water and remember it's already under blockade has been under blockade for 17 years there's already huge I mean the water situation is is absolutely dire in in Gaza the electricity situation all of these are already sufficiently bad for Gaza to have been described you know as one of the poorest uh uh uh uh places in the world one of the places where the conditions of Life are pretty much at their worst so what is really happening with Israel is it's just tightening that squeeze rather than bringing a Siege from nowhere um but the way things are at the moment the dynamic we're looking at doesn't look like these sorts of warnings from internation Community from the UN are going to be heeded by Israel certainly not now generally again John can can can follow this that there has been this recurring pattern where Israel hits Gaza hard and then after several weeks sometimes months the international you know outrage over the numbers of civilians who are being killed reaches such a point that Israel feels that it has to end it's it's it's it's it uh uh to end its operation I think under these conditions after what's happened on Saturday in the last couple of days I think we we aren't necessarily expecting that to happen anytime soon John what's your take on it having spent obviously a good amount of time in Gaza what kind of an impact is this total blockade having well one thing I would say just adding to what Sebastian was saying there is um you know this is on a completely different magnitude of the wars the escalations in violence that we've seen in the past I was just looking back in 2009 there were 13 Israelis killed in that short war in 2012 I think it was six Israelis here we're talking more than 900 and potentially up to 150 hostages taken so Israel is feeling it has the right frankly to do whatever it wants and I don't think it's going to listen uh to the UN humans right Chief I don't think it's going to listen to UNICEF I think it feels that it will have the backing of its public to do everything it wants I mean okay you go to the um the blockade which as Sebastian says has been in place in some form uh from Israel and also Egypt to the South for 17 years and certainly when I was there and the last time I was kind of regularly going into Gaza was in 2013 it was bad um at period there were periods when I was living there where virtually half the food you were getting coming into Gaza was coming through tunnels you know you'd open a can of Coke and it was covered with dust on the top coming in from tunnels uh from Egypt at times uh those restrictions have eased and Israel has let more stuff in uh and uh more exports out but the the big thing I think that is important is that about half of gaza's population is under 18 it's a very very young population and there are many many people in Gaza who have never left you know so they've never met an Israeli so there's no interaction between the two sides no understanding of the other point the other side's perspective and I think that is what is really really difficult to overcome John donison in Jerusalem thank you so much for answering questions today Sebastian aser in London with me thank you both of you for answering viewers questions today and as always thank you the viewer uh who've been sending these questions to us we'll leave you with these live pictures of Gaza City bye-bye
