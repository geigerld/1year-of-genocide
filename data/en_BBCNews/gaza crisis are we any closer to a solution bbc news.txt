does the world really want a solution I I'm not seeing any real effort to say wait a minute why haven't we had a solution until now and what can be different this time around here's a couple of encouraging things first of all you have a United Palestinian delegation in Cairo uh you have the the leader recognized by the world president abas you also have Hamas and other factions there I think that's positive going forward if that can be encouraged second L the Egyptians seem to have shifted in the course of this conflict from pursuing a vendetta against Hamas they have their own domestic struggle with the Brotherhood they saw this as an extension of that domestic problem they seem to have shifted to a position which says maybe it's better as a new Egyptian regime that we prove we can actually be useful as a mediator but other than that we're not seeing that much that is encouraging very important your your your last segment some people tend to think ah this whole problem is rockets that began a month ago right much bigger issues can you resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict RIT large and can one end this situation where garans are living in an open air prison is enough pressure being put on Israel by the US in particular to come up with some kind of viable solution to actually sit down and come up with something well of course we we're just off the back of nine months of us sponsor said peace talks people will remember that Secretary of State John Kerry shuttled back and forth intensely uh during that period that ended late March early April nothing came out of it and I think that what you have is the problem that continues to this day that the Israelis really don't feel they have to make this choice there's almost an impunity that Israel has gotten used to I would argue it's a luxury that doesn't really serve the Israelis because they get dragged in further into Gaza they themselves don't have a future I don't think until the Palestinians have security have freedom have their rights the Americans don't seem to be doing anything to change that equation neither do the Europeans because we just heard from Mustafa bhushi again here on BBC World News something that we hear from Palestinians all the time if there was not occupation there would be no resistance this effect they say would be solved in terms of the aggression coming from Hamas is that even viable or possible that the occupation could end of course the occupation can end and of course until there is an end to occupation the human nature is to say wait a minute if someone's denying me my basic freedoms I'm going to do something about it I would rather people did what Mustafa barouti uh calls for which is nonviolent resistant sanctions on Israel rather than Rockets but as long as the occupation continues of course there'll be resistance an equation an incentive structure has to be created for Israel whereby it's more costly to continue the occupation than it is to end the occupation we know how to do that we've had examples in the past like South Africa those aren't being applied to Israel it's sad that this is what might be necessary but by now it seems that that is what will be necessary
