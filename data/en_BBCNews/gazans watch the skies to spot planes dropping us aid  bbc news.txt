we start with the war between Israel and Hamas as International pressure mounts for Action to address the prospect of imminent famin among Palestinians in Gaza we're following a number of developments the US is said to have authorized the transfer of billions of dollars worth of bombs and fighter jets to Israel in recent days the package reported by The Washington Post and Reuters comes despite growing calls for US military aid to be linked to changes in how Israel conducts the war it's just just days after the un's top Court the international court of justice ordered Israel to allow the unimpeded flow of food Aid into Gaza Israel says un allegations that it's blocking Aid are wholly unfounded the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed to send officials to Egypt and Qatar in the coming days for a new round of talks on a possible ceasefire in Gaza in the past 24 hours both the UK and the US Military have aird dropped Food Supplies into Gaza our BBC Middle East correspondent Lucy Williamson was on the US plane Aid drops into Gaza are expensive inefficient and increasingly controversial these ready prepared meals from the US Army are being flown more than a thousand miles from a US Airbase inq there's plenty of food just a short drive from gaza's borders but this American Aid is being flown right across the Middle East 80 crates of food on board two c17 transport planes dropped into a population the UN says is on the brink of famine it's not perfect we know that there's upwards of 2 million people who need food on the ground who are hungry innocent civilians who didn't ask for this conflict and we're dropping meals in the tens of thousands but at least it's something so does it feel like a drop in the bucket maybe a little bit but if you're a family on the ground who got some of this Aid it can be a lifesaver 12 people were reported to have drowned this week trying to retrieve packages from the sea six others crushed in a stampede what are you doing to try and mitigate those risks literally everything we can so I know you spoke with the colonel earlier we use a shoot that falls at a slower rate to give the gozin more time to see the parachutes and make sure that they're out of the way we also have assets overhead that clear the drop zone so we will not drop if there's any sort of grouping of people there after 3 hours in the air the ramp opens on gaza's devastated Coastline they just open the Hat ready to release the aid down into Gaza there's no organized distribution system down there very it goes a drop of Aid in an ocean of hunger getting Aid in this way is a last resort but a growing number of countries are doing it how much do these I catching flights relieve pressure on gaza's civilians and how much the pressure on governments elsewhere Lucy Williamson BBC News Kata well our correspondent yourand now is in Jerusalem and she told me more about the US weapons transfer to Israel so according to these uh reports in the Washington Post and voits as well they're quoting unnamed US state and defense Department officials and they're saying that more than 1,800 2,000 pound bombs uh some 500500 pound bombs and 25 F-35 fighter jets have been uh authorized uh in this latest uh uh set of uh military uh Aid assistance coming across uh to Israel now a lot of this has already um been initially approved uh by Congress but the reason this is uh so interesting in terms of the timing uh just after a visit by the Israeli defense minister yev Galant to Washington is that really in recent days we have seen um tensions deepening between uh Israel and the US um and you that really uh reached the the lowest moment on Monday after you had the us exstension at the UN Security Council uh when it came to a resolution being passed on a ceasefire in the Gaza War for the first time Israel was very angered about that and there have been these calls um from senior Democrats in the US and from other groups of society like Arab Americans uh suggesting that if um military weapon supplies transfers to Israel were not going to be cut then they should be limited or they should be conditioned uh by the Biden Administration uh that doesn't seem to have happened yeah I mean it's really interesting isn't it we've spoken over the last couple of weeks about the relations uh being strained and just as you say there widespread calls for this um the the two to be linked that um that that military aid should be linked to the um humanitarian Aid to Gaza but that doesn't seem to be the case indeed and the the White House has been saying that it supports Israel's continued right to defend itself we know that the Israeli defense minister in the US had been uh talking to Washington about um its declared um aim to keep uh Israel with a what's called a qualitative military Edge uh in this region um and also talking about not just Waging War in Gaza but the prospect of a possible escalation on Israel's northern border where there have been um in recent months these near daily cross border exchanges of fire with the powerful Lebanese armed group Hezbollah that was your land now reporting from Jerusalem
