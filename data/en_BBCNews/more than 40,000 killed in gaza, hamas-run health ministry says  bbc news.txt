now to Gaza and some important figures that have emerged the number of Palestinians killed by the Israeli offensive in Gaza has passed 40,000 amid renewed efforts to broke a ceasefire these figures according to the health Ministry in the hamus Run territory which does not importantly distinguish between civilians and combatants The War Began after Hamas fighter stormed into Southern Israel on October the 7th of last year killing about 1,200 people and seizing 251 Israel says more than 300 of its soldiers have died in the fighting since um so those figures a very important U Milestone past their 40,000 is uh what the Hamas run um Ministry is now reporting Barbara plasha reports and a warning that viewers may find some details in this report unsettling it took early two months to to dig his family out of the wreckage of their home he was the only one who survived the strike can I could see my father under the rubble but I couldn't extract him at first because he was under two columns of cement and the ceiling would have collapsed he decomposed in front of my eyes my mother's body was inside the house but when I tried to go to see her I felt smothered and had to leave he's looked after Now by his grandfather in a shelter for Orphan and widows carrying on with the task of living his mother father brother and two sisters are among the 40,000 reported killed in the Gaza War the number is overwhelming each loss is a raw and individual grief experienced again and again in places that are supposed to be safe Israel says it hits civilian INF structure because Hamas is operating there Hamas says it isn't the International Community condemns civilian deaths and the killing goes on more than 10 months of War have turned Gaza into a destruction Zone displaced most of its people many are sick and hungry in the southern city of hunis they've been forced to flee a continually shifting front line we are tired of this life she says death is better than this death is a constant presence Samy kawar still has his family and whatever else he could carry with him but this graveyard was the only space he could find in a shrinking humanitarian Zone we have fled from dying to be among the dead meaning we are the Living Dead the truth is no one really knows what to say back at the shelter the orphans have been given another chance at life how much of a chance though without at least a ceasefire the future looks as dangerous as the present Barbara PL user BBC News Jerusalem well let's now to speak to Jenny Hill who is in Tel Aviv Jenny uh these figures striking indeed and no doubt as added impetus as if it were needed to attempts to strike a peace deal yeah you're quite right this will lend a new urgency um to the negotiators who are gathering in Doha trying to hammer out that ceasefire and hostage return deal um 40,000 plus deaths now reported by the gazen Run Ministry of Health um it's worth of course emphasizing that Israel does not allow International journalists including the BBC into Gaza so we can't independently verif y that figure but um the the numbers given out by the Ministry of Health um are considered credible by the World Health Organization although Israel has repeatedly disputed them um Hamas um and the Ministry of Health have always said that the vast majority of those killed and injured in this war are civilians Israel told the BBC quite recently that around 15,000 of the people killed are in its view terrorist that's the word that it uses but you know once again it's a reminder of the ongoing suffering of people in Gaza we learned recently that some 60% of the buildings in the strip have been um significantly damaged or destroyed um so a reminder to the negotiators who are in Doha that this is all about human lives Jenny what are the prospects now um for some sort of deal given the backdrop that we are seeing and uh the risks associated with not striking a peace deal well those negotiators know that the stakes quite simply couldn't be higher quite apart from trying to bring about an end to that war in Gaza most here consider that a ceasefire and hostage return agreement will stop that conflict from boiling over into a much wider Regional allout War as you know these talks are coming at a time of extremely high tension in the Middle East the US has been really pushing to get this deal across the line um the director of the CIA is expected to participate in the talks there's been a lot of urgent diplomacy gone on in recent days Israel itself has sent a high level delegation to the talks um among the people represented are the Chiefs of both the intelligence and Security Services now Hamas says it won't participate either Direct or indirectly to date it hasn't ever sent people to participate directly the current stance is based on its protest that as it says Benjamin Netanyahu has introduced new conditions uh in addition to existing proposals they say that's not on um he denies that but um Hamas will be kept informed we understand by mediators mediations of course led by um Qatar and Egypt so those talks are expected to go on it's hard really to say what outcome we're likely to see one of the unknowables here is the impact on those neg negotiations of a change of leadership at the top of Hamas following the assassination of the group's political leader isma hania in Teran a couple of weeks ago um we've seen a successor appointed in the shape of uh Yaya sinoa um he's believed to still be in hiding in Gaza he's also widely considered to be a much more Hardline character than his predecessor
