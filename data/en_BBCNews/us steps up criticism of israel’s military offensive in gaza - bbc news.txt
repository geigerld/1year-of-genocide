Washington has stepped up its criticism of the way Israel is carrying out its military offensive in Gaza the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin said there is a gap between promises to protect civilians and what is happening on the ground Israel maintains that it's taking steps to minimize harm the un's top Aid official has said there's no longer any meaningful humanitarian operation in southern Gaza but officials say there are promising signs that an Israeli border crossing Karem Shalom could soon be open to improve the flow of Aid it comes as new images appear to show dozens of Palestinian men stripped their underwear with their hands tied behind their back being held by Israel Defense Forces these images are at the beginning of Jeremy Bowen's report a warning you may find them disturbing video emerged this afternoon of Palestinian men taken for inter interrogation BBC staff recognized the town of bet lahia in Northern Gaza and we've geolocated the video there too Palestinian diplomats said these were Savage images evoking Humanity's darkest times the Israeli Army said only that suspects were being interrogated posts on social media said the men had been Sheltering with their families at a un school and that others were killed during the Israeli raid in this photo the men have been moved to another location which we have not been able to verify one of the captives diar alh halut is a journalist he was forced to leave his disabled daughter according to the newspaper he works for in London earlier at Israel's parliament a prominent government supporter told me that only Israeli forces can control Gaza not the independent Palestine the Americans want I think that when we talk about uh two-state Solutions we are solutions we are um using three words and three lies it's not two it's not a state and it's definitely not a solution so what's the answer an everlasting occupation first occupation is not the word you cannot be you cannot one cannot occupy his own land Israel is not an occupier in Israel because that's the land of Israel so what about Gaza again that's the land of Israel land of Israel you cannot be occupying it we're not occupying it from anyone in Gaza civilians are lost in the rubble of Israeli strikes so far the world is not close to controlling the powerful chaotic forces Unleashed by this war the UN Secretary General saying International Peace and security is in Jeopardy is demanding an immediate ceasefire a Palestinian leader told me that the US and UK must not veto the next ceasefire resolution the United States of America and Britain now has the key if they oppose a resolution about immediate ceasefire they will not be complicit only with this aggression they will be a participant in these war crimes they have to approve the ceasefire immediately because what is at stake is the life of 2.3 million people now half of them are children without a political solution this conflict will go on when if Israel declares victory in Gaza the war will not have a neat ending two opposing forces are at work here on the one hand pressure for ceas fire on the other the determination of the Americans and the British to give Israel the time it needs to achieve its objectives and one Western Diplomat I talked to was thinking about perhaps another month now the UN Secretary General wants to hurry that process up by putting pressure on them them and also shaming them into taking action sooner as gaza's food cues get longer the UN says it cannot run a Dependable humanitarian operation with hungry people jumping warehouse fences Israel says World Peace requires gaza's Liberation from Hamas and that will take Force Jeremy bow BBC News Jerusalem well earlier we mentioned that the US Secretary of State Anthony BL issued a new warning to Israel about a gap between intent and results to protect civilians in Gaza here's what he had to say um as we stand here almost a week into this campaign in the the south after the end of the humanitarian pause it is imperative it remains imperative that Israel put a premium on civilian protection and there does remain a gap between exactly what what I said when I was there the intent to protect civilians and the the actual results that we're seeing on the ground well we can go live now to our Gaza correspondent RTI Abu Alo who's currently in G in Istanbul sorry um rushi just bring us up to date what are we hearing about the fighting that's been happening overnight in Gaza yeah the fighting is been intensified in two different area the first one is in the north it's jab refugee camp it's the biggest refugee camp in in the entire of Gaza trip out of eight camps jabalia is the biggest about 250,000 people used to live in the camp many of them or hundreds of thousands of them will lift the the area but according to the local Authority run by Hamas there about 100,000 people are still in the camp most of them now they they they live in un and government school they are taking the UN school as as shelter the humanitarian situation is really very serious in the north since none of the aid that come from Egypt into Gaza Strip is reaching the north because the Israeli tanks we understand from sources there are surrounding the the camp from the four Direction the access in and out of the camp is completely shut all of the hospitals inside the camp are out of service except very small Clinic run by the Palestinian red Cent and we just he from a journalist who was one of the one of the very few remaining inside the camp he said that for about three hours there was very heavy bombardment around the camp and in the camp City Center another video he shared in social media showing a huge destruction in the amamos and a building in the camp City Center also he said that the Israeli tanks are are firing gas and smoke pumps inside the shelters where thousands of of Palestinians are taking the UN school as as shelters again the communication with the northern Gaza is almost unvisible and very few people who still having Israeli sin cards are able to send some of the picture but it's very hard to verify some of the footage that been seen and some of the information are getting from the the camp but it seems that the situation is very in in jabalia camp this morning also about four or five air strikes in kanun hunis is the second biggest city in the southern part of Gaza where also the Israeli tanks are advancing towards theunis City from East and from North we understand that there was some movement for the tanks on the northern part of of kanun and also the the humanitarian situation is also very difficult inun with hundreds of thousands of people are taking hunus as as a as a shelter they back before the seire they were told by the Israeli Army to leave their homes in the north and go to kanun and now the focus of the Israeli operation isn't so very confusing for the people they don't know where to go some of them they they went to the west and some of them they are now far south in in RAF City near the border with Egypt thank you very much rishy abalu our correspondent our Gaza correspondent who's now in Istanbul thank you for joining us well we can go live to Jerusalem and our correspondent there yoland now yoland thank you for joining us um let's talk about the Karem Shalom Crossing because Israel says it's going to open this Crossing that it has into the Gaza Strip just how significant would this development be well it's really hope that this will streamline uh the movement of aid from Egypt into Gaza um where of course people now are desperately short on on basic supplies and what we've seen since the breakdown of that truce one week ago is really the number of lores dropping from about 200 Lor loads of Aid going into Gaza each day down to fewer than 100 and so the UN Egypt others have been calling really for weeks uh for Israel to open its Kem Shalom Crossing at least for the screening um of goods to take place the security checks which Israel demands uh the Kem Shalom Crossing is where prior to the war in Gaza most of the supplies that went into the Gaza Strip each day hundreds of lur loads of supplies were going in and so it is really customized for those inspections to take place so we understand this development is due to take effect uh within days and it's something that Washington has really uh been demanding uh has been negotiating for for weeks thank you very much that's our correspondent there your land now in Jerusalem thanks for joining us
