and the United Nations has called for a full investigation into the death of an American Turkish dual citizen in the occupied West Bank on Friday the spokesman for the UN Secretary General reiterated that civilians must be protected at all times eyewitnesses and Palestinian officials say Israeli soldiers shot 26-year-old isor ESG ADI in the head as she took part in a weekly protest against the expansion of Jewish settlements in the town of beta near the je National was rushed to a hospital but later pronounced dead well let's speak to our diplomatic correspondent James landale hello there to you James uh just tell us a bit more about this incident well as you say it was a weekly protest uh near Naas against an illegal settlement uh where there have been these protests um you know for a long time uh against the settlement uh that has been made by uh some Israelis in an area that even the Israeli government says is an illegal Outpost uh so it's quite a regular place for people to demonstrate and protest and anyway this young woman um this young American woman um aona esgi AI who's just literally just graduated from Washington University in Seattle had recently arrived in the West Bank she was taking part in this uh protest and uh during that protest uh it reached a stage where the Israeli forces fired it's what I would to say with two shots and one of those shots uh hit uh Mesi in the head and uh she was taken to hospital H where she later died the IDF say that they are reviewing this incident uh they say that shots were fired against what they called uh a man who was instigating uh Violence by throwing rocks uh the organization which which has run this protest denied that it was violent in any way and said that uh Mesi was 200 meters away from the police from the soldiers when this happened so either way you know there will be different accounts of what happened uh but clearly a young American woman with Turkish Origins um has died uh as a result of this incident okay and and like you said she is a jeel national what's Washington what comments have Washington made on this incident well the Americans so far have said that they think it's a deeply disturbing killing uh that's the the message from the white house uh they've also said that they've asked the Israelis to um investigate the United Nations have called for a full investigation and the family uh have asked they say that an Israeli investigation would not be adequate to use their language they say they have asked uh President Biden to order a full independent an investigation to try and get to the bottom of precisely what what happened because you know people die very frequently in the West Bank as a result of shootings between clashes between both sides uh and sometimes there are investigations sometimes there are not and it is often very very hard to get to the bottom of precisely what happened and the problem here is that any kind of so-called independent investigation is going to have to rely on the acquiescence of the Israeli authorities and that's not always forthcoming and there has been a significant amount of increase uh increase in violence in the West Bank uh James just just talk us through the latest developments Well the West Bank is an incredibly violent place and has been ever since uh hamas's attack uh on Israel in October 7th last year well over 600 almost almost 700 Palestinians now have died in the West Bank so not in Gaza in the West Bank as a result of violence much of it involving clashes between Israeli settlers uh and Palestinians clashes that are quite often ignored beted by Israeli forces in the West Bank uh and it is a source of huge concern in Western capitals and amongst diplomats that the West Bank violence spirals out of control and triggers uh another Uprising some diplomats talk about maybe another front in a war which began on the 7th of October but has long spread outside of gaza's borders and so that is the fear here that is why Western capitals the United Kingdom the United States and others keep putting sanctions on Israeli settlers who they believe are conducting illegal operations and they are putting pressure on the Israeli government to do more to restrain these settlers who do not have the full support in any way of Israeli Society but whom the is at the moment the Israeli government led by Benjamin Netanyahu depends on their support and that's why violence like this continues in the West Bank James landale thank you very much indeed
