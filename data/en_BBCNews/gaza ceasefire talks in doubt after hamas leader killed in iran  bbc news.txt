we begin in the Middle East where two separate attacks in the space of just 12 hours on the senior leaders of two iran-backed groups have raised fears of a wider regional conflict Hamas says its political leader Ismael Han was killed during a visit to Teran early indications suggest that he and his bodyguard died when a rocket hit the house where he was staying Hamas has accused Israel of being responsible and describe the killing as a grave escalation well hours earlier Israel said it had killed a senior Hezbollah figure in a strike in Beirut the movement has confirmed that far shukra one of its top military commanders was in a building targeted by Israel but hasn't confirmed his fate Israel said he was responsible for an attack that killed 12 young people in the Israeli occupied Goan Heights well let's start this hour with this report from yanel State media in Iran reporting the assassination in its capital of this top Hamas leader a VIP guest isil hania had been in tan along with the heads of other Regional armed groups backed by Iran for the inauguration of the country's new president but these were to be his last ever public appearances in Gaza today news of the killing worried many Palestinians about the implications for ending nearly 10 months of war with Israel if the leaders die the political leaders where are we going children are dying the elderly are dying the youth are dying no one is looking out for us I hope this will be the last assassination and God willing the war will end after this assassination we are all tired isma hania was from Gaza but had recently lived in katar he was seen as more pragmatic than Hardline Hamas leaders still in the Palestinian territory and have been overseeing talks on a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages now hostage families fear a setback I don't know how this news affect the deal but I wish I really wish for all of the forces around the world that We Gather in order to bring our people back home I hope our politicians will know to make these news into the release of the hostage just hours before the tan attack Israel had targeted a senior Hezbollah commander in the Lebanese Capital beout it said he was responsible for a deadly rocket strike in the occupied Golan Heights last weekend fears were already running High about the possibility of retaliation and a wider War now with a ran announcing three days of mourning for ish and vowing a harsh and painful response the Middle East is even more on edge Yol anell BBC News Jerusalem well our correspondent barara plet aser is in Jerusalem now Israel never comments on these types of assassinations and I asked her whether this time was any different not so far no and again in the most recent briefing with the prime minister's office the spokesperson was asked and he said we're not commenting on this incident um but we do know that after the October 7th attacks which were led by Hamas the Israeli government had said that they were going to Target all of the Hamas leadership including the political leadership so they have kept that uh threat current uh throughout the past 10 months and there was a strike against a political leader the deputy political leader in Beirut in January so I think the entire region and probably uh most other people do believe it was the Israelis who carried it out there was a brief moment on social media when a a picture of is is hania was posted by the government press office here with with a a graphic saying on his graphic across his face saying eliminated but that was taken down very quickly so clearly the Israelis don't want to um own this uh publicly uh but as I said they had been uh they had been saying that they would be targeting the leadership the question really is now why they would take this particular opportunity especially when Mr hania had been very heavily involved in ceasefire talks uh that many were hoping would result in at least a pause in the conflict in Gaza yes there is that obvious question about why now now and the implications on exactly what you've just mentioned but are there is anything being reported about how exactly this attack was done yeah we don't know exactly how it was done we do know that it took place at 2:00 in the morning according to Iranian media and also that it was very precise because there were other Hamas leaders in the building as well as a leader of Palestinian Islamic Jihad and they were not hit it was very much aimed it seems at ishia which means that the Israelis had very good intelligence about where he was uh perhaps because he was attending an event that had been pre-organized the inauguration of the Iranian president so maybe they had time to get Intelligence on it the the Iranian media initially reported that it was a missile fired from outside the country but there have been other reports saying that it was a rocket fired from a nearby building which would implicate uh that that which which suggest there was some inside help for the attack but we don't have any confirmation of exactly how it was carried out that was Barbara plha let's speak live now to General Amir aivi who's the founder of the Israel Defense and security Forum General welcome here to the program what is Israel's strategy here well isra strategy I think from day one is very very clear there is a clear goal of War to eradicate Hamas as a military entity and governmental entity Hamas has a attacked unprovoked killed 1200 Israelis raped women decapitated head of children took hostages burned people alive and this organization cannot exist anymore not in our region at least and step by step the IDF is destroying Hamas militarily and also targeting the leadership of Hamas which are all vicious terrorists do you think it brings peace any close because the region has been on the brink for a very long time taking out anir there on Iranian territory killing a senior Hezbollah leader in Beirut There Is that real risk of this tipping over into a wider War isn't there we are in war and in war you need to First Win decisively and then talk about peace just as but not a wider war that is what the Americans have been warning against various allies have been warning against a a wider conflict does this EDG us closer to that wider conflict well I think that you know and I've s I've been saying that for the last two years to the American Administration and I'm saying it also to the British uh government if you want to stabilize the Middle East you need to show strengths you need to POS a credible military threat on Iran you need deterrence we have a globe not just the region the whole globe is is completely destabilized so the Americans the Americans are wrong when they keep urging Israel's prime minister not to escalated is that what you're saying I'm saying that Israel needs to win decisively on all fronts the Americans are wrong if they think that appeasement works with Iranians with this terrible regime they are wrong if they think appeasement works with theala it's not going to work we need strengths we need to win decisively and after we'll win we can talk about Solutions and peace agreements and so on peace agreements will come in the Middle East following a decisive win of Israel then we might see peace with Saudi Arabia we might see maybe an alliance a coalition that's many stages that's many stages ahead I just want to ask you about the immediate do you think this brings any closer the release of those hostages I think that H only really military pressure is going to bring the leadership of Hamas to the point where they agreed to a deal they have rejected everything that was offered for months and months they don't show any willingness to release hostages and and the chief of staff of Israel the Minister of Defense the prime ministers are all saying the same military pressure this is what will bring us the hostages by the way this is what brought us the hostages at the beginning when we put a lot of military pressure but you've also been sending teams to negotiate and he was the principal negotiator sorry can you ask again I was saying you've also Israel been sending teams to negotiating katar and he was hamas's principal negotiator who is there now left to negotiate with well they see have khed Mas which they can send they always have somebody to replace but the leading leadership will be targeted eventually all of them also sinir which is hiding somewhere in the ra region maybe kanun and the IDF is seeking to find them I think that the Palestinian Society are fed up of Hamas I'm hoping that they will understand they have no future with a terror organization terrorizing them using them as human Shields and taking them their food from all the Foodies that is coming from Gaza I think it's time to get rid of this organization J we have to leave it there but thanks for that perspective joining us here on BBC News
