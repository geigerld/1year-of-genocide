well in the United States at least one person was arrested when demonstrators calling for a cease fight in Gaza protested outside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee on Wednesday night the US capital police said six of their officers suffered injuries after being pepper sprayed and punched the demos organized has said at least 100 participants suffered injuries with us on the program tonight the former US ambassador to Egypt Frank wizner who served for many years in the US state department Ambassador you're very welcome to the program thank you for being with us um the splits in the United States over what is happening in Gaza are starting to come to the four uh you just heard from the anra representative there saying we can't get the aid to where it is needed in Gaza uh from Tomorrow onwards because we don't have the fuel how difficult does this make it for the White House particularly in terms of its relations in the region this is a terrible situation however you look at it and from whatever advantage point you begin the White House is in a tight corner so is the government of Israel so is uh the population of Gaza we're all in a terrible terrible fix and I can only hope that the uh problem we're facing right now will be somewhat alleviated with the notion of a pause and Then followed by the delivery of fuel and in increased amounts of humanitarian Aid but the stories that we're all listening to are just horrific there's no question about it and it impels everyone to double down and do what's possible to bring alleviation to this Dreadful situation well I want to talk about that because it seems the Biden administration's strategy was to keep the Israelis close hug them close support them build up political Capital so that they could restrain them when the time was right but that's not paying off is it the Israeli War cabinet has certainly welcomed the support and now is resisting the political pressure to pause how problematic is that for the president well you're speaking about a a negotiation that is ongoing between Washington and Jerusalem and I really cannot tell you what exactly is happening but I know what American policy is and that is to bring uh a situation this current terrible situation to alleviate the suffering that's underway to get the hostages out to bring humanitarian assistance in to pause the combat in order to enable this and then to move on Beyond to a different outcome that's American policy where we're actually at any given moment in our dialogue with the Israelis or with with any party I I obviously I just don't know president Herzog the Israeli president said in an interview with the financial times today that Israel can't leave a vacuum in Gaza after the war and will need a very strong force to prevent Hamas from reemerging uh if we pull back he says then who will take over President Biden said again yesterday that a reoccupation of Gaza would be a mistake what from your perspective and you know the region so well what from your perspective would Gaza look like in the aftermath of a war well this is of course the central next question not the final one but what takes over in Gaza if there is an end to open hostilities um and all I can tell you at this stage is there are no easy answers uh the Israelis should not stay in Hamas would not be in a position to manage the territory no no uh UN agency has the strength to do that the Palestinian Authority is too weak to take that on no Coalition of Arab governments is going to put themselves In Harm's Way without a political context and step into the Gaza nightmare so we don't know the answer to your question it's a profoundly important one at this stage and with combat still in an intense phase uh it's hard to answer that Ambassador good to have you on the program this evening thank you pleasure to have been with you thank you around the world and across the UK you're watching BBC News
