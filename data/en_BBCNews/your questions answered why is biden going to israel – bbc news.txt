hello and welcome to your questions answered on BBC News we call it yqa for short uh we've been looking at what you're searching for on the BBC website about the Israel Gaza war and so for the next few minutes we'll try and get you some answers with our team of correspondents so with me to answer some of them our security correspondent Frank Gardner and our Middle East analyst Sebastian user nice to see you both thank you for being here also joining us our Middle East correspondent Tom bakan who is in Jerusalem welcome to you too as well Tom Frank let me start with you because one of the most obvious questions right now and we've had this news confirmed that President Biden will travel to um Israel why is he going what can he do there this is incredibly unusual it normally takes weeks if not months of planning for a US president to make an official visit like this the Secret Service will deploy first weeks in advance searching everywhere that he's going to be with sniffer dogss wrecking the route that he's going to take for Air Force One to come in at this critical Time Shows just how seriously and how concerned the White House is about this war spinning out of out of control the US has two concerns one is the fact that there are clearly a huge amount of Civilian casualties that these are not so-called surgical strikes an awful expression but you know they understand Israel's need to respond to the atrocities that were committed in southern Israel on on October the 7th but they want Israel to show a bit of restraint which it doesn't appear to be showing much of at the moment and the second is they're deeply worried about it spinning out of control about it sucking in drawing in other countries notably Iran and its proxy force hasb in southern Lebanon yeah let's talk to Tom bman who's in Jerusalem and and Tom I wonder how this will be viewed there um how will this visit go down in Jerusalem well it's going to be uh absolutely critical for Benjamin Netanyahu this visit because remember actually before this uh crisis and War Began Benjamin Netanyahu was in serious political trouble this country had had unprecedented uh protests for nearly a year against his Hardline Ultra nationalist government now in the course of that Benjamin Netanyahu hadn't had an invite to the White House as uh since he was elected late last year and for Israeli Prime Minister that was becoming deeply embarrassing for him it was leading to lots of questions because Joe Biden was uh basic basically pretty angry about the uh Ultra nationalist makeup of Benjamin netanyahu's government he didn't like it he certainly didn't want to reward Mr Netanyahu with a visit to the White House so politically this is really important in terms of sort of bolstering what we now have is an emergency wartime government in Israel opposition figures have come in and this is the most visible signal you can get that Mr Biden is absolutely backing the state of Israel uh in a time of what they see as historic crisis so it really matters and as Frank was talking about those two absolutely key objectives it's also a signal to Iran you know we've heard the rhetoric absolutely ratcheting up in the last 24 hours from the Iranians talking about the potential for you know a clear escalation trying to deter an Israeli ground Invasion uh into Gaza so this is about security uh Global Security and it's about the uh political support for Israel at the moment Tom stay with us um a few more questions to ask you uh over the coming minutes but let me bring in Sebastian at this point and and and Tom raised the point there didn't it it's this idea of you know um unconditional support unequivocal support um does that embolden Israel and and and I guess is there a point when that starts to run out that unconditional support I mean emboldening Israel is one way of looking I think uh in terms of the influence that the US has on Israel I mean this blows hot and cold to some extent I mean what is true that whatever the nature of a US Government whatever temporary fallouts they may have within Israel as as Tom was saying that as President Biden has had with Netanyahu over the past few months when it comes down to it America stands 100% with Israel I mean it sees Israel as essentially almost a projection of itself in the Middle East the only democracy in the Middle East as they always like to say a sping the values that the US Prides itself on uh and is a key Ally regionally in all the conflicts and and and and and problems but that there are there conditions as such I mean what the US has wanted to do is to portray itself also as a relatively evenhanded mediator between Israel and the Palestinians in order despite the slight hiccup when President Trump was in power but over the past few decades the two State solution at the moment there's no real momentum in that process whatsoever hasn't been for some years but there's been talk about that again all around from the US and beyond that this could be an opportunity when the war is over to look at that because we've seen the abyss and this might be the only way out of it so in terms of conditionality there I mean the US has criticized Israel most regularly about the settlements the settlements I mean clearly are seen internationally as the biggest obstacle to any kind of peace to any kind of setting up of of of two states the way they've developed over the past 20 years has meant that more and more of a territory that would have been Palestinian is now going to be more and more difficult if there ever is a resolution on that to actually hand it over to remove the settlers so there have been a lot of fallouts over that and there's been more criticism over that under the Biden Administration certainly than we heard under President Trump back more to what we are used to but as I say when it comes down to it and as Frank was saying there I mean this is both about what President Biden wants to achieve in the way this conflict is is going but also wants to make a huge gesture of solidarity with the Israeli people um Frank on the other side of this conflict is Hamas um and interesting that warning coming from Iran this morning saying that uh Israel will not be allowed to act in the Gaza Strip without consequences warn of preemptive action they say in the coming hours why is Iran such a backer of Hamas um well both are dedicated to the destruction of the state of Israel they don't think that Israel should exist even within its pre-1967 borders just to be clear the Palestinian Authority which rules in the West Bank out of rala does believe in a two-state solution is prepared to live side by side with an Israeli State um Iran has um funded supported trained armed equipped a number of proxies around the Middle East the most famous of being Hezbollah in Lebanon which is not only a military force but a political force it is the strongest element the strongest force in Lebanon if Iran and Hezbollah decided the time was right then if hasola was to unleash its arsenal of missiles and Rockets on Israel then Israel would find itself fighting a war on two fronts in the south in Gaza and in the North in Lebanon and these this Arsenal is substantial Hezbollah are probably better trained better equipped better armed than Hamas the Israel fought a war with them in 2006 I helped cover out of Jerusalem and the Israelis thought that they could win that war just from the air and they couldn't they went in on the ground with their maava tanks and they got ambushed really severely by hasbalah hasbalah really gave them a bloody nose nobody won that war it was unfinished business so that would be a very serious blow um it's not clear that hasbalah want to actually go to war with them right now that's exactly the the the the thing at the moment that the skirmishes that are happening on the border are remaining within the sort of Rules of Engagement between isra and HB hasb clearly wants to send a signal but they're getting more intense every single day I mean we just had a few hours ago four people trying to get across to plant an explosive were killed by the Israelis but they haven't said it wasb because there's Palestinian factions at work there as well and the one thing to say about Hezbollah as you say there a huge power within the leban state and they look to that as well they're not just looking towards Israel and what Iran says they also have to think of themselves as a rational player Within Lebanese context which in a sense Reigns them in a little more than say Hamas who essentially own your answerable to themselves don't forget that you've got two US Navy um aircraft carrier strike groups cruising just offshore in the Eastern Mediterranean as a warning to Iran and Syria possibly don't get involved this is not your fight stay out of it so that if Hezbollah did get involved there is a risk that I think that this would bring in the US Navy who would start using their missiles and their massive strike force of aircraft to Target Hezbollah and which would internationalize this whole conflict yeah and that is really is the challenge and when we get a sense of who are those supporters around the world just just bring us as a reminders Frank if you will who is supporting Israel right now well primarily Israel uh sorry primarily the United States as its closest Ally but also most western Nations have given it rhetorical support um often mixed with humanitarian aid for the Palestinians so Britain for example is giving $10 million of aid but is politically supporting Israel because of the the sheer barbarity and extent of that attack on October the 7th that Saturday morning um you know the the similarities with Isis but that said Western countries are now getting very concerned about the appalling death toll and the casualties and the misery inflicted in Gaza by Israeli air strikes and the blockade I I remind you people are watching your questions answer these are the questions that people are submitting online there's much more detail on all of these stories on BBC News online bbc.com newws and let's talk and let me bring back in Tom who's in Jerusalem and um Tom let's talk about what happens next one of the questions that's being asked a lot online is has Israel ever lost a war and that could be a significant question going forward well it's quite a hard question to answer that because there are those who would say inside and outside of Israel that in a sense Israel always feels itself War ever ever since its foundation in 1948 uh as a new Jewish state in this wider Arab region there have been many Arab Israeli Wars State on state between Arab neighbors and the Israelis and also since 1967 Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territory so those Palestinians have lived under occupation they will say they feel like this is a sort of ongoing war and in a sense the internally the front lines of that sort of move around it's never uh particularly calm but in terms of traditional War I mean Frank mentioned uh 2006 where Hezbollah claimed a victory um you know you had uh after uh Israel had withdrawn from Southern Lebanon in 2000 and elements of that from right back to 1982 uh Israel's invasion of uh Lebanon and driving the PLO yasa arafat's PLO out of Beirut elements of that were deeply unpopular among um Israelis but I think probably the most sort of qualified military failure that's always seen historically by Israelis is the 1973 yum kipor War now this was when uh the Egyptians and the syrians launched a sneak attack and in some senses you know this was 50 years ago this month it's had this huge resonance with the Hamas uh attack and the atrocities of this week which were so unexpected on a sort of historical level many people have thought back to what happened uh in the yapor War of 1973 although again that was states that was armies against armies it didn't have this same sense of you know civilians being the uh rather the very sort of atrocious Target of much of this um but that's often seen as a big failure by Israel a failure of intelligence although they drove back the Egyptians and the syrians and retook the territories that they had already occupied in the Goan Heights and the sin it led in effect years later to a a peace treaty and a territorial with retreat by the Israelis Tom really good to have you there thank you uh and Sebastian let me ask you this quickly um it seems maybe perhaps to talk about people just visiting the region perhaps on holiday but it's important is it safe is the question that people are searching for online can they visit the region maybe to Egypt for example or to other countries that are near Israel and Gaza um I mean I think to Egypt and what you're not going to see and and as was essentially being explained by Tom there you you're not going to see Arab states themselves involved in a direct walk with Israel over this and Egypt Jordan you know the countries that are nearest they're safe but you are going to be in a very fevered frenzy time there's going to be lots of protests there's going to be you know unrest on the streets definitely which will build as this goes on so in major cities you'd have to think carefully about whether you wanted to be there Lebanon I mean from my friends from people there I mean people are leaving Lebanon like nobody's business strangely enough they were talking about this several weeks before this happened they were saying we're expecting something big to happen don't come to Lebanon this year and people are not going uh Sebastian Frank really good to have you both with us and thank you of course to Tom bman who was in Jerusalem for us you are watching BBC [Music] News
