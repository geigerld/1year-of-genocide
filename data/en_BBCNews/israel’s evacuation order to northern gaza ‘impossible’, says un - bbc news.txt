we start with breaking news on the Israel Gaza War the Israeli military has said that more than a million Palestinians must leave the northern Gaza Strip within the next 24 hours ahead of an expected ground operation there in response the UN spokesman Stefan duer said the United Nations considers it impossible for such a movement to take place without devastating humanitarian consequences the United Nations strongly appeal for any such order if confirmed to be rescinded avoiding what could transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation well that statement has sparked an angry reaction from Israel the country's ambassador to the United Nations said Israel is just trying to minimize harm to gazans for many years the UN has turned a blind eye to the arming of Hamas and the use of the civilian population the response says and civilian infrastructure structure in the Gaza Strip as a hiding place for weapons and murder well let's turn to the scene live in Gaza right now where it has just gone 9:00 in the morning the UN said the order by the Israeli military also applied to all of its staff and those sheltered in un facilities in a statement released after a sixth night of air strikes the Israel Defense Forces said that in the following days it would continue to operate significantly in Gaza City it said Hamas terrorists were hiding in Gaza City inside tunnels underneath houses and inside buildings populated with Innocent civilians well Hamas official quoted by the Reuters news agency said that the relocation warning from Israel was fake propaganda that's the view there in Gaza right now the Israeli military has said it struck 750 military military Targets in Northern Gaza overnight let's give you a sense of the geography in Gaza here's a map of Israel where you can see Gaza and the West Bank marked what the Israeli military is saying is that everyone living in Northern Gaza should relocate to the southern end over the next 24 hours now that's more than a million people about half the population of the entire Gaza Strip Nick Johnson has more Israeli air power continues to strike the Gaza Strip buildings flattened in the blink of an eye entire neighborhoods reduced to Rubble Israel says it's dropped 6,000 bombs on Hamas Targets in Gaza over the past six days with every Fallen Building stories of human suffering [Music] we're told this girl has lost all her immediate family doctors say the entire Health System here is close to breaking point I think the whole medical sector and the health department maybe will collapse maybe in two or three days I I don't think that they can manage it the hospital is full of patients the Israeli military has called for the entire population of Northern Gaza to relocate to the South within the next 24 hours the UN says this would involve the displacement of more than a million people and that such an undertaking would have devastating humanitarian consequences Israelis are still reeling from last Saturday's attack by Hamas this video shows what remains of a kibuts in southern Israel it was here where 75-year-old David Moshe was killed by gunman his wife Adena was kidnapped their granddaughter annat describes that moment they took her through the window she's a 72 years old woman she's sick she have heart issues she watched her husband died right in front of her and right after after they got her own the motorcycle and she had to hold the terrorist that just murdered her husband they were together for over 50 years US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin seen here at an Israeli donation center promised unending American support for Israel following talks with prime minister Benjamin metan yahu is due to meet the Palestinian president Mahmud abas later the president of the European commission Ursula Von delion will also visit Israel later today in what's been described as a show of solidarity with the victims of the Hamas attacks behind the politics the people in Tel Aviv a vigil for those murdered one candle for each victim each day bringing news of another life lost Nick Johnson BBC news well we've been speaking to NAA shawa the regional country relations manager for Oxfam inside Gaza well she's one of the 1.1 million residents of Northern Gaza who've been told to leave by Israel there's so much um chaos in in in Gaza uh we managed to leave at uh at like 4:30 a.m. um we are about um um 15 people here we moved to another location South and um we we think I mean basically now asking this question is clearly puts um puts the the reminder that Israel can do whatever whatever it wants and U nobody can stop it obviously so the arrogance of of Israel is is has been like that for for decades so obviously now it's happening again and it's um simply on the news and everyone is watching while this another catastrophe is actually taking place right now and everyone is is leaving It's All About Kids elderly everyone the roads are being bombed while we were traveling now there is bombing and smelling smoke what is this madness are we going to come back to any of our homes when we were leaving we were like just looking at things as if we're not going to see them again of course it's not feasible and of course you'll have hundreds if not more of casualties and you'll have destruction and then what Bravo Israel yeah that's great the work that uh we are supposed to be doing is simply not feasible and not possible with the extent of Destruction with the that there is no uh no uh Seas fire there is no uh humanitarian Corridor there is nothing nothing is is is even discussed or or or suggested we just hear it in in in the media and discussions that that doesn't allow for any kind of response so people are simply suffering and will continue to suffer in this placement in the areas they are in in the schools or in the streets now it's going to be everywhere not only in whatever designated schools it's going to be everywhere and yes we are hearing about know no water no enough food uh all all all these things well let's cross live now to our correspondent Anna Foster who's near the Israel Lebanon border Anna it's really good to have you you're in a key location aren't you to explore what's going to happen next with the militant group heah uh that's uh located in Lebanon what have you been hearing yeah there's real concern about this northern border as you mentioned hez blah who are base across in Lebanon a very powerful uh political and military group in Lebanon backed by Iran also like Hamas in Gaza they are an organization that has been designated a terrorist organization by the US the UK uh and other countries as well now the question is whether or not if there is a ground offensive in Gaza that Hezbollah in the North in Lebanon will decide to try try and support Hamas and will essentially attack Israel from the north now this is a it's a lengthy border if you look at Gaza and you look at that area we talking about how how sort of relatively small it is down there um along here you've got basically the whole strip of Northern Israel so a lot of troops have been sent here to reinforce this area 300,000 reservists have been called up but many of them we've been seeing have been arriving on buses in cars and they are being sent along here because it is a real latent concern also when you hear the us talking about the support that they are providing to Israel uh they're sending of course their aircraft carrier their Fleet of ships they've sent initial um uh shipments this week of of arms as well and they say of course that is to support Israel uh in its war with Gaza but also they talk about additional scenarios and what that means the subtext of that is that they are preparing in case there is a significant escalation here in the north as well Anna of course the the the worries about a widening conflict are are ever present what have you been hearing from Iran and and what has Hezbollah itself been saying or doing well there've already been small incidents and I say small incidents along the border this week at any other time if what we'd seen in the last week wasn't happening in Gaza these would actually have been extremely significant incidents it would have been the main thing that we were talking about because Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad which is another islamist militant Group which is based in uh in Gaza but also in Lebanon they have fired uh rockets and missiles across this border um Israel has responded with its fighter jets which have targeted uh PJ and Hezbollah infrastructure on the other side of the Border in Lebanon as well there have been Israeli soldiers uh who were killed several days ago when there was an incursion from the north there were some gunmen who came across and in that battle to try and contain things um a senior Israeli soldier a deputy Battalion Commander was killed along with colleagues um certainly when we were here the day before yesterday there was what turned out to be a false alarm but it was a rumor of a new aerial incursion from the north we spent about 90 minutes in a a shelter with a group of local armed men who were trying to find out information what was really significant at that moment I think was what you saw on things like social media you know the the way that the rumor mill just went into overdrive instantly and it it sort of shows you how how nervous people are a lot of people along here have chosen to to leave their communities all together because when you are right on the border they have seen what's happened in southern Israel they have seen what happened when Hamas crossed over from Gaza so some people here are staying put staying near shelters staying safe but some people are choosing to leave all together while they just live in the midst of that uncertainty about what might happen next if we broaden our view Anna we know that the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is is touring the region for the next few days what countries really hold weight when it comes to possibly containing this conflict well Egypt has always been an important mediator when there've been escalations before around Gaza Egypt to often that the country that steps in and and talks with uh with Israel and with the Palestinians with Hamas and tries to to negotiate you know some sort of some sort of agreement I mean it's happened before you know tensions been deescalate that way I think when you look at what's happening now the suggestion is that things might have gone too far at this stage Israel has said that there will be a significant response to what has happened here uh also in terms of those hostages that are being held again hostage negotiations are important um countries like Qatar I mean you mentioned Iran of course you know Iran uh supports Hamas supports Hezbollah but those sorts of dialogues you know between the US and Iran for example or Iran and countries in this region it just doesn't work that way so even though there are these attempts at diplomacy going on and they're important um I think how how vital they might be how crucial they might be how much they might work is Up For Debate Anna thanks for taking us through that Anna Foster speaking to us uh from the Israel Lebanon board
