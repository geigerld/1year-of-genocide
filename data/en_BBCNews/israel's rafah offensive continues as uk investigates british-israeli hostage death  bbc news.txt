Israel has continued its air strikes on several parts of the Gaza Strip even as it continues issuing controversial evacuation orders to Palestinians the Israeli military said its troops had found many tunnels used by Hamas at the Raffa Crossing into Egypt while the Israeli Defense Forces have declared a narrow Coastal strip at al- moazi to be a safe humanitarian Zone but the UN says it has no running water or proper sanitation Israel says that since Monday about 300,000 Palestinians have already fled Rafa the US is still urging Israel not to mount a full scale assault on the city and in the north there are evacuations in the city of jabalia as the IDF says that it's been carrying out air strikes it says Hamas Fighters are regrouping there meanwhile a top EU official sha Michelle has condemned Israel's evacuation orders saying that people are being directed towards unsafe areas while the UK foreign office is investigating claims by Hamas that a British Israeli hostage has died in Gaza nadav Powell was seized with his mother on October the 7th from the narim kibuts in southern Israel Hamas claims that Mr Powell died of wound sustained in an Israeli air strike more than a month ago the Israeli military is yet to comment the UK foreign secretary Lord Cameron was asked about the claim on Sunday with Laura cburg like everyone else I watched the video on Twitter X last night put out by Hamas of nadav answering a question as to who he was and I watched that video and you just think what you know callous people they are to do that to play with the family's emotions in that way I I've met nf's family his sister and I know the Heartbreak they've been going through for over 200 days and when you see what Hamas are prepared to do you just realize uh the the the Terrible Dreadful inhuman people frankly that we are dealing with the UK foreign secretary well our diplomatic correspondant Paul Adams is in Jerusalem these were claims that emerged yesterday when Hamas as it has done repeatedly throughout this crisis released a video uh in which they said that nadav Powell who's 51 uh was killed in an Israeli air strike now we have absolutely no way of verifying that we don't know when the video that they released yesterday was shot uh we need to be extremely careful about any assertions that Hamas is making about the circumstances uh surrounding uh his death or indeed whether indeed nadav poell is dead but that is what Hamas said we know that his brother was killed on October the 7th they were both uh attacked uh on October the 7th their mother was also abducted but she was released uh later in the first of the uh uh ceasefire hostage negotiations uh the foreign office as you say is looking into this but this is this kind of goes to the heart of one of the issues that still divides uh Israel and Hamas during these tortuous negotiations aimed at getting a ceasefire organized which is how many Israeli hostages and dual National hostages are there how many are still alive how many are dead uh over the months tragically the number of uh dead hostages has risen while the expectations for the number of live hostages has uh diminished somewhat um and this is uh a very live issue because the Israelis want much more clarity about what they can expect from Hamas in terms of the release of hostages alive and dead in return for a ceasefire deal Paul will await uh any more comments from or any comments from the UK foreign office as it investigates those Hamas claims about the British Israeli hostage just in terms of the evacuations itself uh of course Flyers are being dropped where are Palestinians being told to move to they're consistently being told to go uh West Northwest to the almasi area which is an area along the coast an area that the Israelis identified right at the beginning of this C campaign as uh a safe secure humanitarian Zone uh and some of them are going further north uh to some of the middle uh areas of the Gaza Strip either way they are going to places that are profoundly unsuitable uh for human habitation uh there are no Provisions for them when they get there no one is setting up tent encampments for them there is no water no sanitation getting food and other Aid to them is increasingly difficult uh we now estimate that or at least following the Israeli announcement last night that 300,000 people have uh heeded Israeli warnings to leave that I would say something close to a quarter of the population that have been craned into Rafa in recent months are now on the move and that is just adding to the enormous pressure uh on those areas almasi and the middle part part of the Gaza Strip uh with parts of Rafa now becoming something of a ghost town so many people went down from the northern part and then from Han Yunis to Rafa uh over the months huge tent cities sprang up along the Rafa border with Egypt some of those 10 encampments are now uh emptying and emptying fast as people who have moved three four five times already uh feel that they're going to have to move again soon and they're not waiting for the Israeli military to arrive they're packing up and they're leaving because they've seen it all before so that was Paul Adams and I want to pick up with some of the points that he made with our guest Isabella tiira who's a humanitarian media specialist at action Aid UK and I know Isabella your organization is supporting people in Rafa just talk us through what people who have been leaving uh Rafa have been telling your people on the ground there well thank you for having me um yeah I mean right now in Rafa there is just absolute fear and confusion and panic on the ground um hundreds of thousands of people have already um fled these are people who've had to flee carrying their belongings under a scorching hot sun not knowing where they can go that is safe that they can um you know start a new life for themselves um remember most of these people have had to flee multiple times we're talking five six seven times already um our teams on the ground have spoken to some people who have arrived in Dera Bala which is one of the um so-called safe zones um they've described absolutely horrendous Journeys um traveling by bus while you know bombardments um took place all around them um they've talked about arriving in darala and you know having more scenes of chaos um greeting them basically with none of the kind of Essentials that they need one man told us that he was trying to um build a tent for him and himself and his disabled mother and he was you know unable to Source the materials he needed because there were they were so limited in supplying the prices had gone up so much so I mean really the situation is just utterly utterly dire right now um and there's just so much uncertainty so these areas that you described one de alala of course Al maasi Han yunice they're being described as humanitarian zones but in your opinion they don't account for that abs absolutely not I mean these are places that were already you know before these latest evacuations began were already completely overcrowded Al Moi which is a tiny strip of land which is mostly sandunes um was already home to about 400,000 people um there just isn't the infrastructure to accommodate all these new arrivals there's no one to meet them there's no one to there's there's nothing basically to give them you know it's absolutely dire um yeah Isabella in terms of action a in terms of your organization how does it operate under these circumstances on the ground where there is so much need I mean as always we're doing everything we can but there is just such difficult circumstances and things are changing day to day I mean we've had some of our colleagues and partners already had to flee Rafa so even in the last few days the situation has changed so quickly but I mean right now the the situation with um getting and distributing Aid is just incredibly incredibly difficult ult I mean in Rafa right now Rafa remember is the main area through which um Aid arrives two of the main Aid Crossings are located in Rafa um one of these the Rafa Rafa Crossing is um still closed um the other uh has kamam Shalom has opened uh but Aid is not able to be um delivered through that Crossing because of the kind of intensity of the fighting and because it's just so dangerous right now um so the humanity humanitarian situation in Raa which was already you know incredibly on a knife edge is just deteriorating um by the minute really I mean the Health Care system has all but collapsed one of the main hospitals in Rafa had to evacuate um earlier this week that leaves just two smaller um hospitals and a few other medical facilities which are you know warning that they are running out of fuel um you know due due to the sustained lack of Aid people in rraa are you know they're starving they're hungry they don't have enough um water um 10% of children under the age of two are acutely malnourished I mean it really is an incredibly dire situation and there's you know Aid organizations like ours are doing everything they can but it's it's it's incredibly incredibly difficult Isabella to thank you very much for just uh outlining the conditions of the are your team operating there across Gaza from action a UK thank you very much well there is much more on this story story further coverage of the Israel Gaza war on our website also you can just go to the BBC News app as well where we are continuing those reports as Israel intensifies its military
