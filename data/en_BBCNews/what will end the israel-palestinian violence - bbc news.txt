the u.s has called for an immediate end to the violence between israel and the palestinians as the conflict enters its second week israeli airstrikes on gaza reached a new level of intensity in the early hours of monday morning as the military targeted the homes of islamic jihad and hamas militants at least 200 people have been killed in the past week including 59 children in the gaza strip and 10 in israel so what might it take to end the violence well in a moment we'll talk to two people on either side of the conflict who belong to the same organization which is dedicated to lasting peace and cooperation but first take a look at this [Music] by okay well one of the people in that clip is osama aliwat who joins me now from jericho also joining me from tel aviv is ayala shalif who works with the sama for an organization created by former fighters on both sides called combatants for peace thank you both for joining us here on the program ayala i'll begin with you just help our audience understand very briefly what your organization aims to do i think first of all it aims to put an end to the occupation and we do it in different ways but you you bring uh sort of people who were combatants together to try and get them to work on reconciliation and cooperation just just help our audience understand that okay the movement was built by combatants who put down their weapons and they understood that violence is not a way to move forward in any way and they today the movement is is bigger and we work together in any way possible to forward this message uh summer i'll i'll bring you into this uh because we saw you in that clip there you yourself uh were a palestinian police officer you say that you've known nothing but this conflict and you started to really think about your place in it from the age of about 14. how difficult was it then to look at the other side see the conflict uh you know unfolding and and be able to say no i want peace it was hi thank you first of all for having us for paying attention to us and our work this is a big support for us for me at the beginning this conflict was something like i was built in i didn't think who's right and who's wrong all what i knew about the conflict that there are some armed soldiers and these armed soldiers are against us they come to our schools they come to our houses they demolish our houses and that's all what i knew about israel israel succeeded to show me how strong and powerful and how much they can hurt me but they never tried to show me that there is another voice inside israel there is another people who don't agree with what's going on and the minute i saw this in 2010 after a long time of being involved in this circle of violence i understood that there is another way and there is different face for this coin that israel is trying to show us and there's partners on the other side and together we can make it better because keep ignoring the story of each other keep ignoring the narrative of each other will not take us to anywhere and we have to find a way to share this small place and not to divide it into small gate to zero and there and as long as jewish people and palestinian people are not free no one will be free as long as i am not free the israelis also would not be free so that's why we are fighting together for the freedom for both sides i'm just gonna i'm just gonna bring in uh ayala because that that is quite a a strong point isn't it that no matter what happens neither side is free till both sides can live in peace exactly it is it's like uh i i the picture i always have in my head is like a prisoner and a guard both tied so one side is has has a benefit but they're both tied and nobody's free and that's our situation here and there's no way of solving it through violence only if you work together something that osama also said is just being raised believing that the other side is the enemy how do you change that mindset how do you help re-educate families and people to stop telling their children i i suppose that the other side is the enemy it's more than parents telling children it's the whole system and you said the word it's education it someone needs to be in the head of the pyramid that wants to make a change and wants to work together and then the educational system has to change and that that's what brought it and that's what can stop it uh education osama do you find when you are speaking to other palestinians when when they see the level of violence and destruction in a place like gaza that they are unwilling to to join the movement the organization actually people are afraid to join this kind of organizations because as i mentioned before israel is still controlling the land either we accept it or not even when we have palestinian authority israel can enter to any city and arrest anyone so people are afraid of putting them in this themselves in this risk and join the other side the other thing is people are disappointed actually because since the palestinian authority signed the peace agreement with israel israel is taking land beast by peace and we will give up this whole thing but we are changing lives of people as much as we can and through this change we are doing education for example when we go to harvest all of the trees for the palestinians to protect them from settlers we take palestinian children and israeli children to meet when they are young and to me to see each other as a human being and not as enemy before they go to exactly is that helping it helps a lot and i am as a responsible of the education department and combat transfer bees i give lectures to palestinian students israeli students teaching them about peace resistance teaching them about life under occupation teaching them about the both the right of the what people to live in this land and teaching them about how being playing the victim all the time will not help anyone and we should stop playing this game of who's more victim than the other and start being united together in order to save the future of our kids yeah anywhere from this place indeed i'm just going to bring in uh ayala and ayala we don't have much time left but i just wanted to ask i mean how do you feel the entire system can now change how do you think there can be some kind of lasting peace and what your organization does can be translated into something more my hope is that the the current say prime minister will be will change and it will bring a change because it needs to be systematic it helps what we do helps in in uh where we work but for the whole system to change we need to influence the whole system and if the prime minister will change if netanyahu will not succeed to make a government there's a chance that the system might change especially after all this violence that's erupted here now it's like i'm sorry but everybody everybody has to see that there's no no it goes nowhere it goes nowhere it's just going to be happening again next year or in two years a solution is needed in a deep way not not just stopping ceasefire now indeed ceasefire now but then go on and and something more lost yeah uh ayala shaliv and osama elewhat thank you both for joining us here on the program thank you
