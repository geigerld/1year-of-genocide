we begin with the war in Gaza the United States is making a major push to pause fighting in the strip with diplomatic efforts taking place both in the region and at the United Nations the UN Security Council endorsed a ceasefire proposal for Gaza on Monday and it's the first time the council has passed a resolution demanding a stop in fighting after eight months of war the resolution urges both Hamas and Israel to fully and quickly implement the three-phase plan 14 countries voted in favor and Russia abstained a US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas Greenfield says the resolution shows Hamas that the International Community is United colleagues today this Council sent a clear message to Hamas accept the ceasefire deal on the table Israeli Israel has already agreed to this deal and the fighting could stop today if Hamas would do the same I repeat the fighting could stop today Linda Thomas Greenfield there well the vote came as the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is visiting the Middle East it's the eighth time he's been to the region since the October the 7th attacks Mr blinkin is fiercely advocating for the ceasefire deal proposed by President Biden 10 days ago as part of that effort he's met the Egyptian president Abdul fat CI on Monday and has held talks in Jerusalem with the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the latest I spoke to our correspondent in Jerusalem Yulan Nell and we started by talking about the security council's endorsement of the ceasefire proposal well I mean first of all diplomatically this was very significant it's really strong International endorsement of that plan that was laid out by President Biden a three-phase plan uh back on the 31st of May now of course that was being presented at the time as an Israeli plan that's been the the US position since um but you know on the ground um I don't think this is going to lead to a breakthrough at the moment as much as we have the US Secretary of State Anthony blinken uh back in the region for his eighth tour uh since this War Began he's trying to to push both sides into a full acceptance um of this deal as he goes about his his different meetings um but you know Israel even in its response uh at the UN its representative made clear that the country military objective remains uh to dismantle hamas's military capabilities in Gaza as well as to bring the hostages home and then you have Hamas it's welcomed this vote but at the same time it it's not given an official endorsement of it either and you know Hamas is very much stuck to its position that it wants to have guarantees that there will be as a result of any deal that signs up to a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip a full end uh to the War uh that is not Israel's position andand as you mentioned it's the first time that the security Council has passed a resolution to stop the fighting what could you remind us of what this plan actually entails this ceasefire proposal well I mean this is um the most detailed plan that we've had back in March there was a resolution that went through at the UN Security Council when the us abstained but what we've had this time is its closest Ally the US actually pushing this text through to very much reflect the text um of President Biden um in his 31st of of May uh speech that came out with much fanfare so the first phase would be for a six- week truce where we'd see many of the Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza being returned home uh in return for an immediate truce and uh many Palestinian prisoners being released uh from Israeli jails the problem comes more with phase two of the plan where negotiations are supposed to continue um for what is termed a permanent end to hostilities with more of of the hostages coming out at at that stage uh particularly uh the male soldiers who who remain in captivity and the problem really is getting from that phase one uh to phase two uh Hamas worries that Israel would walk away after after phase one uh so that's really where Regional Partners come in to try to kind of give the those guarantees and Mr blinken on his trip to this region he's already been in Egypt that's another country that's inol D in mediations acting as a go between for Israel and Hamas um he's going to be in Jordan later in the day but then he'll go to katar which is another uh country which is involved in these mediation efforts that was youran now
