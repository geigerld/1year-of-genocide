uh well let's cross live now and speak to our guest on this and that is Leo cans who is an aid worker uh the head of mission excuse me for Palestine for Doctors Without Borders uh let me ask you first of all for your reaction to what has happened we are horrified but what happened first of all I want to to present the condolences for the family of the victim on behalf of msf um but we are completely horrified of what happens uh the situation in Gaza is a nightmare if we take a bit of a step step back and look at what is happening in the last months you have hospitals being targeted and literally bombed you have civilian who are being bombed indiscriminately and we can see the indiscriminate nature of the bombing because it's full of Hospital are full of children and women uh you have humanitarian head that is blocked we cannot bring humanitarian head to the north of Gaza and now the test event if you have seven humanitarian head workers being deliberately killed targeted by a missile while on a convoy to try to bring food to starving people uh in the north of Gaza there is no war for what is happening now no what's what is happening we've heard now from the world Central Kitchen that they're going to uh be for now uh not working within that region what kind of an impact is that going to have on those people who so desperately need the food this is the whole problem of what is happening now in Gaza humanitarian actors are not allowed to work properly and you know this incident this tragic incident is not isolated us as msf we had five people who has been killed in msf Convoy or in msf premises so it's not the first time that this tragic uh incident is happening and we are all the human actor are at the limits of the of the working capacity and people are being stared in the north of Gaza because Israeli government refus food to get inside Gaza and now you have the same government that is targeting the NGO that is one of the few actors that is trying to to give food to the to the to the north so it's it's a it's you know all the elements of what happening in the last months are clearly pointing out to Serious war crimes so at some point something has to be done um we we we cannot work like this humanitarian workers should always be protected this is international law and this is a basic of humanity and it seems that humanity is being buried right now in Gaza and and for several months already Leo thank you very much for joining us well the Israeli newspaper haret has run with a story that it says are from uh defense sources from the IDF which say that the Drone which bombed those World Central Kitchen Aid workers was actually targeting uh an armed Hamas member who wasn't there a little earlier I spoke to haret journalist Gideon Levy who told us more about the haret story he told us what we published obviously and I'm not sure they said he was armed they called him a terrorist but I'm even not sure he was armed and you know the definition of terrorist is a very flexible and elastic one and I don't know who he was but nothing obviously Justified this thing especially after they did it three times and they even moved those Aid workers after they were attacked the first time they moved to another car in order to save their lives but nothing is good enough for the Israeli Army and they shot them dead um what I'm struggling to understand is that you can very clearly see the world Central Kitchen logos on these cars and from what the defense sources uh are telling heret newspaper as you mentioned yourself they attacked the cars with a drone and then people exited the cars and they were attacked again look it's not an exceptional case I understand that we are all very Stone because they are Internationals but those cases happened so many times in this war that's Gideon Levy there talking to me from the Israeli newspaper haret
