the US President Joe Biden says he believes a hostage deal between Hamas and Israel is near around 240 hostages were taken on October the 7th by Hamas which is designated a terrorist organization by the UK government the White House says they are closer they think than ever before to freeing some of them in Gaza a group of 28 premature babies who were trapped by the fighting around the AL shifa Hospital in Gaza City have now arrived in Egypt via the Rafa Crossing from medical treatment our senior International correspondent oliran reports now from Jerusalem alive against the odds premature babies rescued from Al shaa Hospital parents cluster around before they are transferred from Gaza this man seems to be identifying his son nor albana has just been reunited with her twin girls I didn't know anything about their condition today I saw them for the first time since the day they were born thank God I have been reassured that they are fine then they are wrapped up for the journey across the border faces of the war in Gaza whose suffering caught the attention of the world in Egypt specialist standing by with a waiting incubator still desperately vulnerable but now safe from harm unlike about a million other children who remain trapped in Gaza in Israel families of those held in Gaza are daring to hope there will be a deal to free at least some of them this was the moment on October 7th when the hostage Oreal began here women being dragged Away by Hamas Barefoot and in Terror Arab Gil Dickman's cousin was among she's going to find a ways to make this better so this is my cousin Carmel 39 years old she's an occupational therapist she loves traveling she loves music she's a wonderful ant Carmel Gat is being held along with her sister-in-law yarden whose three-year-old keeps asking when she is coming home doesn't give us any signs of life we don't even know whether yarden and carel my cousin and her sister-in-law are alive or not the same goes for about 40 Israeli children being held hostage among them babies the children are expected to be freed if there is a deal along with some women Gil knows his loved ones may not get out now some of them are going to come before the others and they understand that some of them are going to come before carel and yardan I believe if they're there they also understand it and they want the children to come back before them for Israelis a deal may bring dozens of hostages home for Palestinians a few days respite from Israeli bombings or gearan BBC News Jerusalem so how close could we be to hostages being released our security correspondent Frank Gardner is with me the White House is is sounding fairly optimistic yeah they are I mean I've spoken to a number of people involved indirectly in this potential deal and they are optimistic but we've been here before and this is terrible for the families who have had their hopes raised and then dashed but I have to say that I think we're probably closer than we've ever been before we're talking here about an arrangement that would see around 50 to 70 hostages Israeli hostages non-combatants so not the soldiers who were captured but women children civilians released in an initial batch and in return there would be a pause of say 6 hours a day for about four days um for three to 5 days and there would be fuel allowed into Gaza now none of this is actually agreed absolutely yet but what the parties are saying is that the fundamental agreement is in place what's been holding it up is the logistics and the practicalities of it what does that mean in practice well the negotiations are taking place in Doha in Qatar but it takes time to get those messages back to the military commanders in Gaza who of course are fighting a war and they're underground so they don't get immediate answers and of course the longer this war goes on the fewer of those military commanders there are to actually answer it then you've got to gather in the hostages who are held in different places if you cast your mind back to that horrific day on October the 7th as soon as they got them to Gaza they scattered them out to different places to getting the back in and getting the Red Cross to come in and take them out it'll take time Frank godner thank you
