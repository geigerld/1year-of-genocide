well as the diplomacy continues so does the fighting as we've mentioned at least 70 people were reportedly killed in jabalia in Northern Gaza the Israeli Army said it has completed the dismantling of hamas's command structure in the northern Gaza Strip among those killed in southern Gaza is Hamza Al dadul an Al jazer journalist and cameraman who was reported to have been hit by an Israeli drone strike Hamza had been working alongside his father who is the aler correspondent in Gaza this is why pictured at his son's funeral along with other members of his family dozens of journalists have been killed in Gaza since fighting began 3 months ago one more on this I'm joined Now by Jody Ginsburg from the committee to protect journalists thanks very much for being with us do you have any more information about how this happened so what we believe is that Hamza was in a car with a freelance journalist and another um member of Al jazer staff uh and they were on the road between KH yunes and Rafa when their car was hit by a drone strike we understand understand that they were on route to an area designated a humanitarian Zone to report on on bombings in that area when the car was hit and so far it's been a deadly uh conflict to report on Ian there's obviously casualties amongst the people who live there but also on on journalists tell us about the way journalists are managing the risks there well as you say it's been the deadliest Conflict for journalists that that the committee to protect journalists has ever documented and we've been doing this work for more than uh three decades more than 75 journalists have been killed since October the 7th it's extremely difficult to manage the risks we need journalists and it's really only gazan journalists who are able to document this war because International journalists have have had very little access almost impossible to get into Gaza they're the only ones doing this work and so they're traveling to places like hospitals uh like uh uh refugee camps to report on the effects of the war but those places themselves are also under attack so so there's nowhere really safe for journalist to operate and tell us about the reaction from from Al jazer and and whether there's going to be any kind of proper accountability as as to what happened here so Al jazer have condemned this killing uh they've accused the Israelis of deliberately targeting the journalists we as the committee protect journalists continue to demand independent investigations into these deaths uh we've seen a number of cases where journalists clearly wearing wearing press Insignia where it was known that they were operating have been killed and it's really important that we see investigations that those responsible are held accountable journalists as civilians and must never be targeted uh in a war Jody Ginsburg from the committee to protect journalists thank you very much indeed for joining us thank you
