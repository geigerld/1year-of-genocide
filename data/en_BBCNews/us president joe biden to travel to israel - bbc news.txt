well President Biden is due to arrive in the region tomorrow he's expected to meet the Israeli Prime Minister then he'll travel to Aman Jordan's capital to meet other key Regional leaders but the Palestinian president Mahmud abas has tonight cancelled after the Gaza blast and Rishi sunak may also travel to the Middle East in the coming days let's talk to our North America editor Sarah Smith who's on the line Sarah um President Biden's plane I think was already in the air uh uh while this explosion and this blast took place how does that change the dynamic of the conversations he was going to have with regional leaders here it's made the situation much more complicated now president B he's actually due to leave the white house any minute now and we'll be setting off very shortly an Air Force One heading for Tel Aviv and I mean this is an extraordinary trip which was a very high Stak scamble even before the news came in of this Hospital bombing it's a visit with two purposes really and both of those two-fold missions got considerably more difficult today firstly he wants to go there to demonstrate what he calls his Ironclad commitment to Israel and to its right to defend itself now that is a position that Joe Biden has had for well over 50 years now but it is a position that is much much more uncomfortable to defend tonight than it was even just this morning the other thing he wants to try to achieve is to get Israel to ow emergency humanitarian Aid into Gaza and to put in place some kind of measures to try to protect innocent civilian lives that just looks a lot more difficult now as well because you've got the American president flying into a situation where the Hamas leader says it's the fault of the US that this Hospital bombing has happened because America gives Israel cover for its aggression he says as you were reporting the Palestinian president uh Mahmud abbas's can cancelled his meeting with Joe Biden and then at the same time Israel are going to ask him for over $1 billion worth of emergency military aid so he is arriving in a situation that was already complex and it is now considerably more volatile before he even touches down indeed okay Sarah thank you we're going to go back to Jeremy Bowen now in southern Israel uh Jeremy we're just hearing from Sarah Smith um in Washington about how all this complicates the task that Joe Biden had in trying to broker some kind of deal to get Aid into Gaza um the magnitude of this uh tragedy tonight how does that complicate things on the ground do you think when it comes to that part of what he was trying to do I think it's immensely complex I think that anyway it was a gamble as Sarah said had the President coming over here normally presidents get on their planes and turn up to sign agreements when the agreements have already been negotiated when they know what they're going into Joe Biden didn't really know what he was coming into and the Americans weren't sure because the fast moving uh nature of what was happening before the attack on the hospital now by this morning by the time he lands assuming he goes ahead and takes off well it's going to be even more complex in Lebanon that calling hisbah are calling for a day of Rage there will be more demonstrations elsewhere those countries which the Americans regard as allies are condemning Israel uh and there's and as for this business about who actually did it maybe the Americans will say that they have satellite information maybe they're watching what's going on with their you know very advanced technology I mean one thing I would say was that it was judging by the video that was posted and by the the level of casualties and judging also by the fact that the whole building appears to have been destroyed it was a very powerful missile now one thing will that will have to be established in any investigation even a really quick one over the next 12 or 24 hours is whether Palestinian Islamic Jihad who was specifically mentioned by the Israelis which is the number two group in uh armed group in Gaza whether they had missiles which had that much power in them the missiles that have been hitting here in ashalon cause pretty much minor damage so these are questions which I can't answer but which need to be answered to get some clarity on this because you know the sides are way way apart and what's really significant I think is that levels of hatred uh are growing really exponentially among people who are involved in all of this and uh one mission for President Biden when he decided to come here was to try to stop the whole thing escalating stop the whole thing spreading and as he's even preparing to get on his plane the risks of that happening have increased marketly Jeremy thank you Jeremy Bo in there live in southern Israel President Biden preparing to make what will be an even more difficult Journey here to the region uh than was the case a few hours ago
