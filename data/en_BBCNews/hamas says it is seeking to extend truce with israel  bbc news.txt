Hamas has said it would be open to extending the ceasefire with Israel Beyond Today its fourth and final day the group which is regarded as a terrorist organization by the UK and other governments yesterday freed more hostages who'd been held in Gaza including 14 Israelis in exchange for Palestinian prisoners President Biden has said he wants to keep the deal going Beyond today so that all captives can be brought home and more Aid be sent to Gaza from Jerusalem our Middle East correspondent Hugo B reports free again 14 Israeli hostages released by Hamas head home after their long or deal along with three foreign Nationals among them were 15-year-old dafina and Ella ilim eight who were finally reunited with their mom Chen Golding almog who was released along with her three children and RI KY released 51 days after being kidnapped from a festival where he was working as sound crew he followed a weekend of happy reunions aigel Aidan spent her fourth birthday in captivity the Israeli American was taken on October the 7th after Hamas attacked and killed both of her parents her family have spoken of their relief at finally being reunited it was wow couldn't believe until I saw her I simply couldn't believe it now I'm a bit more relieved not relieved completely because there's happiness mixed with missing Roy and had and there was celebrations in the occupied West Bank 2 39 Palestinian prisoners in their teens were released by Israel in exchange for the hostages the green flag of Hamas seemed flying among the crowds very happy thank God for this joy and we hope that all prisoners will be released God willing relief for all prisoners today marks the final day of the temporary ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel so far 54 hostages and 117 Palestinian prisoners have been freed and much needed Aid has been sent into Gaza now attention turns to whether this fragile truce could be extended Hamas says he wants to see an extension of the current pausing fighting in Gaza this could increase the number of hostages being freed President Biden said the hostage release was the result of intensive us diplomacy his administration he said will be working to extend the deal more is needed but this deal is delivering life-saving results critically needed Aid is going in and hostages are coming out and this still is structured so that it can be extended to keep building on these results that's my goal that's our goal the Israeli Prime Minister reaffirmed his determination to continue the fighting once the temporary ceasefire ends with about 180 people is still in captivity in Gaza the painful weight of their families continues Dr Benjamin rad is a senior fellow at the UCLA Burl Center for international relations he gave us his thought on the possibility of an extension to the current truce I think the public pressure within the Israeli Society has come to uh show the government show Netanyahu that the primary desire of the Israeli public is the release of the hostages before the even the the the destruction or the dismantling of hamas's fighting um infrastructure and so that public pressure has come to Bear very strongly so we now see efforts by the government not only to maintain the truce in the agreement but also to offer a possible extension of it in the days to come so it seems very likely Israel has two objectives number one one to return all the hostages and number two to prevent any hostage taking or attacks in the future obviously the second goal cannot be met until the first one is first satisfied to make sure that those hostages return but it is it remains a primary objective of the government to make sure that this cannot be repeated which is why Netanyahu has reaffirmed his um his position that the attacks or the operation against Hamas will continue as soon as the hostages have all been released well with me now is Muhammad from BBC Arabic Muhammad welcome to you good to see you and what else are you hearing about a possible extension to this truce which we understand Hamas is looking to extend uh good morning Samantha yes indeed it's more likely that this truce would be extended all parties are happy that this Truth uh would be extended uh Hamas announced that the katar side and President Biden said yesterday that he's welcoming that and there are efforts towards that bamin netan said he would be happy to do that as uh as um in exchange of each day of the truce 10 hostages would be release so it's more likely that this troops would be extended the people in Gaza are really in dire need for for Aid they are getting this Aid uh uh gradually but they are in dire need for for fuel there there is uh there are very little fuel is going to uh Northern Gaza and this is really uh needed uh for the for the you know for the uh for the cars to work for the rubbish to be cleared for the roads to be opened for the communications to be restored for every uh aspects of life to be return back even the sewage there is a sewage massive sewage problem that the because of the motors are not working the the sewage water is everywhere so the fuel is really needed the medical supply is really needed for the hospital to reopen the Indonesian Hospital in Northern Gaza is partially out of service to they want this hospital to return back to work the hospitals in the city of Gaza as well in a bad need to work so all parties whether the Americans the the the kataris the Israelis and the Palestinians including Hamas are really Keen for this truths to be extended for all this offer to put together uh towards a permanent uh ceasefire maybe and what do we understand about those people who are returning home we saw hundreds of thousands of garans move South as they were told to do by the Israelis to try and keep safe there are returning to the North many of them in some cases they don't have a home to return to what do we understand about what could happen if this truce isn't extended will they have to return back south into temporary accommodation uh actually we would see what is the reaction uh would be but the people of Gaza I saw pictures this morning for Gaza for the markets of Gaza people are acting as if the war is over so the markets are open they are uh buying their their stuff they are trying to put fuel in their cars but where are they getting things from to to sell H part part of that is the the aid that's coming to Gaza but this is really question a good question question to ask I I saw with my eyes markets are full with vegetables fruits and other other Goods in Gaza people are now the Israeli forces stopped from from stopping people from going north so they are returning back uh to their destroyed homes to collect their winter stuff from the rubbles I saw a man with with a hammer trying to get to a collapsing bedroom to get some some clothes from from the the collapsed bedroom he's using he's using the the the wood of the cupboard to for for fire afterwards but I want to say something if you may may allow me Samantha about about the the scenes of exch exchange hostages as this is turned to be a media war between Hamas and the Palestinians we can see that the Israelis are really Keen for for a lowkey media appearance for the hostages they are also Keen to to make the Palestinians not celebrate so much uh their their free ones especially in Jerusalem there are there are TR Israeli troops around their homes they are telling them not to celebrate that invited the neighbors to make congratulations through balconies and and and and and and windows on the contrary we can see the Hamas when they are freeing the hostages there is that friendly bond between the hostages and the Hamas fighters to the extent that the social media in the world Arab world is exploding of of humor about this and also uh and also the massive celebrations on the West Bank regarding the freed prisoners okay Muhammad thank you
