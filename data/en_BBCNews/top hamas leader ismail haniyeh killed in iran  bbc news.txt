we start this out with the breaking news the Palestinian militant group Hamas has said its political leader ishma hir has been killed in Iran a statement from the group said he was killed in an Israeli raid on a house in the Iranian Capital tan that he was staying in Israel's military military is not commenting it said the raid took place after he had attended the inauguration of the new Iranian president ishma hir had been leading negotiations with Israel and his death is likely to affect any chances of progress Mass official described the assassination as a grave escalation that will not go unpunished one of Ishmael H's bodyguards is also said to have died so let's just take a closer look at who Ishmael hir was born in the ashati refugee camp in Gaza hir was a key member of Hamas from its Inception he was imprisoned by Israel a number of times including for three years in 1989 as it cracked down on the First Palestinian Uprising at one point he was expelled to Southern Lebanon for six months in 2003 he survived an assassination attempt by Israel along with the Hamas founder shik ahed yastin 3 Years Later Han was appointed a Palestinian prime minister by President Mahmud abas after Hamas won the most seats in national elections however he was dismissed a year later after the group outed abbas's fatter party from the Gaza Strip in a week of deadly violence kir had led hamas's political operation since 2017 while living in Exile in katar he was the public face of hamas's diplomacy in Arab capitals and was leading efforts to negotiate a ceasefire deal in Gaza Han was considered to be less Hardline and militaristic than Yaya simoa who is the head of Hamas inside Gaza well let's get more with our Middle East correspondent Yulan n who is in Jerusalem and Hugo Basher who is in Beirut Yulan to you first what more do we know about what's happened well the reports are saying that this was um an attack an air strike at about 2:00 in the morning local time on the residence where Ismael hania was staying in the Iranian Capital uh he was killed along with his bodyguard um we don't have many more details than that at the moment he'd been in Iran um along with the leaders of other iran-backed armed groups from around the region uh for the swearing in of Iran's new president they were seen very prominently at that ceremony and also meeting the Iranian supreme leader and there's already been a lot of reaction to What Happened One Hamas official calling this a cowardly act saying it will not go unanswered there have been others saying that this could lead to a a dangerous escalation and this killing really did catch us uh by surprise I mean it's not being claimed by Israel when I asked the Israeli military it said it did not comment on reports in foreign media um but this came just hours after Israel said it had killed um a senior hasbalah figure in southern Beirut um somebody it said was responsible for a deadly rocket strike in the Israeli occupied Goan Heights the weekend and we'd really been braced for several days um for Israel's um retaliation there Hezbollah denying that it was responsible for carrying out that strike and it hasn't uh confirmed the death of any of its leaders um but already there had been fears that Iran could be drawn in um if uh there was a strong response to what uh Israel did in Beirut um now we've got Iran saying that its top uh Security Council is considering its reaction to an assassination um of this top Hamas leader on its own soil so this is another very dangerous moment and what do you think think this means in the immediate term for any hostage ceasefire deal I mean as you were saying is Hu was seen as being the sort of more pragmatic more moderate face um of Hamas when compared to the the hardliners like Yahya sinir um and Muhammad Dave who masterminded uh the 7th of October attacks um still in Gaza um we're not sure about what's happened uh to Muhammad de but Yak Sina is believed to still be in an underground bunker there now it's very much putting more power uh in the hands of Yahya sinwell when it comes to any kind of negotiations on a new ceasefire and hostage release uh deal um isil hania had been um really overseeing those negotiations uh through mediators he was somebody who'd been able to to travel around the region uh still and attend meetings um and it's not clear at this point who his successor will be so this um is likely to be a major setback um for any sort of uh new deal on a ceasefire and hostage release and it's not clear at this moment what it means uh for the course of the war in Gaza okay you land for now thank you let's go to Hugo Basher who is in Beirut uh Hugo what reaction has there been by Hezbollah another Iranian proxy there in Lebanon uh given that this comes just hours after one of hezbollah's senior leaders was targeted by Israel yes amantha so we had two statements from Hezbollah this morning one morning uh the uh death of the killing of Ismael Han in Iran and the first uh statement was the first reaction we had from hisbah after the attack that happened here in Beirut last night confirming that the senior Commander fuad shukar was in the building behind me that was hit in this Israeli attack so uh this is the scene here in in southern Beirut this is the Hezbollah stronghold here in the bayout capital there is obviously a very uh strong presence of Hezbollah members also of the Lebanese military obviously the streets here have been corned off and shops are closed uh but streets are getting busier here with lots of people coming to the scene uh and obviously lots of journalists here as well but we had a very short statement by uh hesah saying that emergency services are still searching through the rubble they confirmed that the senior Commander was here in the building when this attack happened last night just before Sunset but they haven't confirmed that he was actually killed uh yesterday the Israeli military said that fuad Shuka was killed they described this as a precise attack he said he was a uh the Israeli military said the senior Commander was a right-hand man to the uh Hezbollah leader Hassan nazala and he was also described as being uh the commander behind the attack that happened on Saturday in the occupied Golan Heights when 12 children were killed and uh the Israeli authorities uh had uh promised a response to the attack uh the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hezbollah would pay a very heavy price and for days here in Lebanon there was this wait for for for this uh Israeli response so it happened last night it happened here uh in this stronghold Hezbollah stronghold in southern Beirut and I think the fact that it happened here in the Lebanese capital and perhaps the first time that Hezbollah was targeted here in Beirut could be seen as a major provocation by the group we haven't seen any indication yet about any kind of plans for a retaliation but I think it's inevitable that Hezbollah is going to respond to this attack we've seen that in the past when senior commanders were killed by Israel Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets targeting military positions inside uh Israel so I think a response now is almost uh inevitable and obviously this raises fears of the possibility of a of an escalation in the hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel so far most of the violence has been contained to areas along the border between Lebanon and Israel tens of thousands of people have been forced to leave their homes because of the violence but there has been the fear that this uh violence uh could escalate to become something bigger even though the indications have been that uh Hezbollah and Israel were trying to avoid a major confrontation but again as yolan said this is a very dangerous moment yeah the Iranian leadership meeting uh imminently to discuss their response to to what extent do you think the Hezbollah response any reaction will be led by Iran yeah so Hezbollah is the main group of these Alliance of factions and forces across the Middle East supported by Iran uh the so-called axis of resistance and I think that there has been this question uh since uh October the 7th since uh the attacks by Hamas and then this response by Hezbollah the level of influence that Iran has over Hezbollah and the other factions uh uh uh in this uh Alliance I think Hezbollah here in Lebanon is obviously a very powerful force it's not only a militia but it is also a political party with representation in Parliament it is also a very strong uh social movement here in Lebanon so it does have uh a level of Independence it does have uh its own uh strategy and goals uh but there is some level of coordination perhaps with the Iranian authorities and obviously Hezbollah just like Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by uh many uh Western countries including the us including the UK and there's been the fear here uh in Lebanon that Hezbollah could be dragging uh this country into another conflict with Israel lots of people remember what happened in 2006 the devastation brought by uh the war between Israel and Hezbollah there was a lot of destru ction here in southern Beirut also in southern Lebanon and uh many people were concerned that history might be repeating itself and this is a very difficult moment for Lebanon for years the country has been going through a huge economic crisis uh around 80% of the population uh estimated to be living in poverty there's also a political crisis the the country has been without a president for almost 2 years so it is a very difficult situation for Lebanon uh and many here were concerned again that Hezbollah was dragging this country into another conflict okay Hugo for now thank you
