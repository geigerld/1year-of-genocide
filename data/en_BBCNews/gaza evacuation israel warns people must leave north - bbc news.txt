so let me just take you through where we are a week since those Hamas attacks because Israel is still urging civilians to leave Northern Gaza as soon as possible it specified two roads which can be used by Palestinians heading south well more than a million were told on Friday to relocate before an expected ground offensive Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his country's bombardment of Gaza is quote just the beginning more Rockets have been fired into Israel and Israeli air strikes are continuing across Gaza military sources in Israel say a senior Hamas Commander is among those killed Israeli forces are continuing their buildup near the boundary with Gaza while in the north of the country Israeli troops killed several people they identified as terrorists who were trying to cross the border from Lebanon and overnight Israel's military exchange more crossborder fire with the Iranian backed Lebanese group Hezbollah the US Secretary of State anthonyy blinkin as I was saying is in Saudi Arabia on the latest stop of his tour of the Middle East now Jordan's foreign minister has accused Israel of flagrant breaches of international law and warned the displacement of civilians in Gaza was pushing the whole region towards conflict let me show you the live pictures again at least 2,200 people in Gaza have been killed in the strikes over the last week and 1,300 Israelis were killed by Hamas gunman over last week and I just want to uh uh return to that Ana quote that I was telling you about a moment or two ago because those sources there on the ground from the UN saying that 1 million people have been displaced in just one week so this their latest tweet as you can just see as we pull the strap away they are talking about the Exodus they say a million people have been displaced inside 7 Days in the past 12 hours alone hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced The Exodus continues as people move to Southern parts of the Gaza Strip so that's some of the latest information coming before we move on I just want to take you to the pictures here in central London outside of the BBC and you can see huge crowds going down Regent Street uh as Pro Palestinian demonstrators gather here at the B before they will start moving towards whiteall and we've seen similar scenes uh across different parts of the world as uh people come out and those the pictures from just a slightly different uh area just around the back of the BBC is more and more people assemble here for the start of that March down to whiteall so that just gives you a glimpse of what is happening here with that at Pro Palestinian demonstration and March but let's go back to what is actually happening on the ground in Gaza because I was giving you some of the latest details coming from the UN well uh Yan egeland is the Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council he was involved with the oso Accords and facilitated talks between the Palestinians and Israelis now he talked to the BBC a little earlier and gave us his assessment of the humanitarian situation in Gaza there are hundreds of thousands of people fleeing for their life there is a not something that is should be called an evacuation uh it's a forcible transfer of people from all of Northern Gaza which is according to the Geneva Convention a war crime there is a a a a Siege on Gaza which means that people are starved there was a bombing at the Rafa Crossing which everybody is pointing to as the the only way Corridor uh possible humanitarian Corridor in into an area so I think really the the UK the US the the EU all that have rightfully said were with Israel in fighting Terror after the worst Terror in Israel's history I hope they haven't given a green light to smash a million children because that's what happening now well there's been significant diplomatic Fallout from the war Saudi Arabia says it is paused talks on normalizing relations with Israel well Lord Malik Brown is a former deputy Secretary General of the United Nations he goes his thoughts on that decision well I I think this was anticipated it would have been impossible for Saudi Arabia to have continued them at this time uh you know it has in recent years been quite quiet on the issue of Palestinian rights but when uh the events of this week unfolded it you know raised its voice much more clearly in defense of uh the Palestinian people and it would be just in terms of uh the Optics and politics of the region impossible to press on uh in any effort to to to normalize relations with with Israel at the very same time that Israel was seen as attacking Palestinian Arab civilians in Gaza but I don't know whether in the longer term I mean I think this is now up to Israel whether it wants to close that door forever which would be the result of a which will happen I think if it makes a long-term occupation or long-term military intervention uh into Gaza or whether it recognizes the need to contain its military action in as Surgical and brief a form as possible so that it can get this back on track because for both Israel and Saudi AR Arabia the stakes are high it would be a reordering of of the Middle East in a dramatic way and I think uh you know there will be a desire to try once the fighting is dies down to to try and recover this negotiation well the US secret of State Anthony blinkin as we've been seeing is in Riad in Saudi Arabia for those talks it is the latest stop of his Middle East tour let's have a list listen to a little of what he's been saying uh no country uh can or should uh be expected to tolerate what um Israel uh has just uh been on the receiving end of which is uh an attack that almost defies description and words in which more than 1300 of its people were slaughtered along with the Nationals of more than 30 other countries by Hamas Hamas is not representative of the Palestinian people or their legitimate aspirations for the future Hamas is a terrorist group its only agenda is to destroy the state of Israel and to murder Jews and it's important that the entire world see it as such at the same time as Israel pursues its legitimate right to defending its people and to trying to assure that this never happens again it is vitally important uh that all of us look out for uh for civilians uh and we're working together to do exactly that uh in particular uh working on establishing safe areas in Gaza working on establishing corridors so that humanitarian assistance can reach people who need it uh none of us uh want to see suffering by civilians on any side whether it's uh in Israel whether it's uh in Gaza uh whether it's anywhere else and we're working together to do our best to protect them I think um at the same time it's uh vitally important and I know that our countries agree uh that we work together to make sure that to the best of our ability this conflict does not spread to other places on other fronts and so I look forward to discussing that anony blinkin well with me here in the studio is our Middle East Regional editor Mike Thompson Mike uh give me your assessment of this latest L of this Middle East Tour and generally as he has moved from Capital to Capital what Anthony blinkin has been trying to do here well he's trying to get together a concerted anti- Hamas sort of uh um uh grouping here amongst Arab countries but he's having a a difficult time because with the uh number of deaths as we've just been hearing more than 2,200 and this imminent uh ground offensive that'll begin fairly soon um many Arab people are just outraged by by this and uh not just of course in the region but also as we've been seeing on our television screens right across the world and this is turning people most notably actually Saudi Arabia who he's with at the moment a key Ally who has been encouraging to normalize relations with Israel now Saudi has said as we've been hearing that talks on that have stalled this is what herass wants this is Hamas wants to drive this W yes it was one of the theories in terms of why Hamas has actually done this one of the theories was as we were edging closer to that normalizing deal Saudi Arabia crucial players it was to disrupt that and to dismantle that but in terms of uh The Wider going on and reaction in the region interesting comments too from the Jordanian foreign minister talking about the abyss that was being approached indeed yes and of course um secretary of state had talks uh with uh uh with King Abdullah of Jordan um and the country has is is very very concerned about this this this this Abyss as you just mentioned there um and and Jordan is a nation which has had strong relations with the US so this has been in some ways quite surprising and very disappointing uh for Mr blinkon this should be happening but it's really part and parcel of what the attitudes that are now sweeping that whole region and there's worry because Jordanian foreign minister was talking about the displacement of people and only on news night last night I was watching a senior former military figure suggesting that people should go over Palestinian should go over into Egypt that is a real concern isn't there that potentially here the movement of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip completely indeed I mean they're they're all going into areas which in the main are quite agricultural in the South there's very little to support people to shelter people and Egypt has made very clear that it doesn't want refugees across the border it's got about 280,000 people that fled the war in Sudan for instance so it doesn't feel able to deal with that that could change of course under a lot of international pressure uh because at the moment people are being expelled into into sort of nothingness in a way and particularly those who are who are injured and amongst them of course many uh children as well presumably that is why Anthony blinken uh continues to talk and we saw it yesterday in katar about these safe zones the discussions they're having around that to try to set up somewhere with a bit of infrastructure for people to actually go to where where are we in terms of the ability to do that well it's still very complicated to know quite where you would do that I mean there could be an area inside Gaza in the south of Gaza or it more likely in in Egypt but as I said Egypt is very worried about having temporary refugees that it fears would become permanent the other option of course is on the borders of Gaza inside Israel and in a way that might be easiest because Israel can oversee the situation and and as it's also responsible for the barrage and for the what looks like BEC coming off land offensive uh that would make sense Michael final thought because here we are a week since those Dreadful attacks from Hamas and just about everything in the region has changed fundamentally and we are we know this only at the beginning indeed and those in fact were the words that Israel has used prime minister Netanyahu has used to say this is just the beginning and you see the the the widespread concern the the outrage in the Arab world the outrage in Israel too of course after those atrocities on Saturday um but these are likely to deepen and deepen significantly as soon as that land assault uh happens because this is a very crowded area there's going to be an awful lot of life and it's going to be on both sides Mike Thompson thanks for going through all of that and Mike talking about the hostages and we were showing pictures from those events last s they
