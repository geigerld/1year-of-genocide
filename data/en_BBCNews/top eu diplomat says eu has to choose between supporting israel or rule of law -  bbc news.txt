the European Union's top Diplomat says the block will have to make a choice between supporting Israel or International institutions and the rule of law youf barell was speaking after the un's highest Court ruled that Israel had to Halt its military offensive in Rafa in response to a case brought by South Africa they've accused Israel of violating the UN genocide convention in Gaza Israel has said no power on Earth will stop it going after how us Lucy Williamson reports now from Jerusalem Israel's soldiers have been ordered to push into Raa Israel's leaders have been ordered to stop footage from both sides shows the fighting as Israeli troops Edge closer to the city center but the un's highest court today focused on civilians this those still there and the 800,000 who have fled Israel must immediately beh hold its military offensive and any other action in the Rafa Governor which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in par Israel says this is a precise and limited operation but satellite pictures of Rafa show the destruction less than two weeks after the assault today Israel's Army said it had recovered the bodies of three hostages from northern Gaza Michel nissam orian Hernandez and Hanan Blanca one member of the war cabinet said Israel had to keep fighting to return its hostages and Safeguard its citizens and would continue to act according to international law foreign criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza is growing but prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu or BB as he's known is comfortable being seen as the staunch def defender of Israel's security Under Siege I don't like B to say the least I don't think he's a war criminal it's very easy to sit miles away and criticize what's happening do you have a better alternative I don't really care about what people thinking about us you can see that if we do care about what people think us so we should stop the war no we are here we are Israel therefore it's really uh important us to have a support and we don't get it Salwa Al masri Sheltering in a tent on the coast north of Rafa had little faith in the Court's power to change her situation implement this on the ground they shouldn't say one thing and do something different today they say they want to stop the war but the massacres are only increasing the Rafer offensive has blocked key Aid routes through southern Gaza supplies brought in in Via a new US Pier quickly looted the court today ordered Israel to reopen the Rafa Crossing new battle lines in this war driven by promises on both sides to protect civilians Lucy Williamson BBC News Jerusalem okay let's speak now to Joe ban who is the professor of Middle East history at Stanford University in the United States hello and welcome to the program professor uh first off will this ruling just the latest um against going against Israel um in the past week make any mark on their next actions it won't make an immediate difference because uh all of the Israeli government officials who are responsible decision makers have said clearly they aren't going to obey the ruling uh so whatever it says uh won't be uh make a difference in the short run so what is all this amounting to um you know we had the ICC arrest warrants we've now got this um we had the Declaration by three countries um that they would recognize it was Spain Norway and Ireland isn't it that they would unilaterally recognize a pal Palestine state where is all this heading in the long term so since October 7th we've seen uh an accelerating Trend in the International Community to really for the first time uh take measures that begin to hold Israel accountable uh there's also the security Council resolution that the United States abstained on rather than veto so Israel is becoming gradually more and more isolated the United States to the extent that it without reservation supports Israel as it has been doing is also becoming more and more isolated in the medium to long run uh this will ultimately impose serious constraints on what Israel and the United States can do um Algeria you mentioned the security Council there Algeria of course the only Arab State on the Security Council is there anything that they could be doing to push this matter on they could be doing many things but by and large most of the Arab countries uh have never really uh stood up to support Palestinian rights uh Egypt uh Jordan Saudi Arabia are all authoritarian Sunni states which are effectively in an alignment with Israel uh in a front against Iran and its Regional proxies Hezbollah Hamas the houthis in y uh and that uh overrides uh all of the popular sentiment that does exist very broadly in the Arab world in support of the Palestinian people what what would override um Benjamin Netanyahu with his insistence that he's not going to stop what would stop him well Israel at least for Jews is still a democracy uh there were in the months before the Hamas October 7th attack demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of Israelis every week uh demanding uh ultimately that Netanyahu resign and those demonstrations have in the last month or so resumed and have uh become quite large there'll be another one uh tomorrow evening uh as well uh or well actually it's this evening if you're in your uh Saturday evening uh there's some possibility that that kind of public pressure uh will uh erode the legitimacy of the government and force an early election or Force the uh members of the opposition who joined the war cabinet to resign uh so this could happen Okay Joel banon Professor Joel banan thank you very much indeed thank you
