sorry it's under such difficult circumstances but sh let me start with you tell me what happened to you on October the 7th um at 6 and a half at 6 and a half in the morning we woke up there was many alarms we heard many many Rockets we know what to do in this in this situation and we went to the safe room we had a problem with the door H we couldn't close it so we sat inside trying to be very very quiet it was very difficult to do it because I have a small baby she's one years and8 8 months and two other children ER we sat like this for 2 hours and very fast we understood something else is uh happening something that we are not we don't know uh we started to hear a gunshot gunshot from outside on the window on the walls from outside we started to hear sounds and people talking in Arabs outside shouting albar we smelled things burning we heard things breaking we were terrified and after 2 hours Ohad my husband decided to go outside the safe room and to shut the door on us this was the only way to show to close the door so we went outside and waited H he told us from outside that he loves us we told him we love him at about 10:00 H the terrorist entered our house and they shoot all had we heard him screaming and they entered the safe room four Hamas terrorists with uniforms and full arms armed entered me and my three children were sitting close one to each other they started to shout at us in Arabs and they said also come come in English I understood they want to take us together to kidnap us I told my children to scream I wanted to earn time maybe the Army will come to save us so all of us were screaming but the Army was not at the K boots after a few minutes one of them pointed us with his gun and told me I shoot he didn't left us any choice so we went out of the safe room we saw Ohad sitting outside bleeding injured he told us he loves us and he told us to go with him with the the terrorists I tried to save my save my baby I put the baby on oh had I thought they would let me leave her there but they didn't they took her and they pushed us out of the house they asked me for my car my key car they wanted us to go with my car together with them but when we went out of the house I saw everything was burning everything was on fire the cars houses everything so I told one of them that the car is burning then we waited outside they were filming us I was begging them to leave the children to let them go and take only me but they didn't listen then two motorcycle were coming H they took a t my boy he's 12 to the first motorcycle and one of the terrorists that was holding my baby were sitting h on this motorcycle me and yel she's 10 were sitting on the second motorcycle with two terrorists luckily my baby was crying so they gave me the baby so itan was in front with a terrorist me Y and my baby were sitting on the the second H motorcycle we starting driving through kibuts the kibuts was destroyed was burning big horror but what was very very shocking was uh there was hundreds of terrorists in our kibuts not just terrorists there was only a also citizen from GAA that came to destroy to burn and to loot everything they could I saw children with television everything they could they took and the they started to go to Gaza through Gaza a hundreds of people going on the main road to togethera and we with with the two motorcycle were're driving through them very near to Gaza two tank of of the army has arrived they were driving tanks tanks yeah they were driving wildly and the terrorists were starting to run everywhere there was a big house our motorcycle was H falling this was the last time I saw my son aan his motorcycle I've seen him going through Gaza and since s you've not you've not had any contact any contact any news from him and is that the same for you ran your children or and Y girl were taken you were away from the house at the time I was away uh they were sleeping alone at home yil is 12 and Ora 16 um you said they were missing they're not missing they were kidnapped from their safe home from the place that they live in from their beds on a Saturday morning uh you know try and imagine anyone try and imagine your children sleeping in their beds waking up to an alarm which is scary enough as it is when you're alone at home then realizing there are terrorists walking freely outside and that was a situation um about um an hour after the attack started we started getting text messages from other members of the community we live in a small communal Community kibuts um saying that there are terrorists walking outside fre and whichever was just describing and the shabab that you were talking about earlier and um uh the boys told me that they hear gunshots outside and I started reassuring them it's the Army coming to to save them um and at a certain point uh they were on the phone to me about two hours after this it's all started and they they whispered to me on the phone yil my youngest he was 12 uh said said there's people coming in people who was whispering there's people walking in the house someone broke into the house so they were there on their Terri they yeah they were alone in the SoCal safe room like adults in in the safe room they were having to take these decisions themselves yeah well I was there with them on the phone um but yes and their father was in a different safe room and I was in a different safe room and their father was shot and they called you know um his father their father called them to to us to uh to get some help I tried uh to get some help uh sent to him but uh it was in vain all the houses in the were at the same situation at the time and uh as I said I heard I heard them saying someone's broken in and two minutes later I they I heard people speak on the phone I heard people speaking in Arabic and the door went open and the last thing I heard my youngest boy saying to me on the phone a month ago that was my last call from him he was begging for them not to take him he said I'm too young you can take me please don't take me I'm too young and they took him um and as I said they're their home you said um imagine what it's like I can't actually I've got two children myself and I I can't imagine I can't imagine what that's like um it's beyond imagination hadass five members of your family were taken um your mother 80 and your niece were murdered so you know that and you yet you you you haven't had time to grieve really because your your children sah and Aras and their father of are all missing kidnapped what what do you what what do you want the Israeli government to do because Mr Netanyahu thinks that Force is the best answer and he thinks there should not be a humanitarian pause I wonder what you think of that I think one thing I'm a man I'm a mother I'm not a political I can't give give Solutions I can't give my point of view about the act the Army act I'm a mom I can say one thing I want my children back it's the only thing I can say 7 of October my family break apart it's a black day it's a hell of a day five members of my family been kidnapped two of them been murdered already my mom she was 8 years old wonderful sweetheart warm dear lady and my niece she was a miracle girl with a autism special needs girl they've been murdered as you said I don't have the time even to gri I didn't even went to the funeral because I have to fight for the one who's still alive for my two children a as 12 years old sweet sensitive fragile boy young boy and my daughter Saha beautiful 16 years old girl te teager girl and their father I have to fight for them and I want them back Hadas we're just going to pause for a second I'm just going to say goodbye to our viewers around the world who are watching but I want to continue with our UK viewers who are who are still with us um renana how how how do you how I mean you're here it's really important to say this you come under your own own steam the three of you not without not with the is government not not anyone's urging a private initiation of the parents of the children we have 32 children who were kidnapped we uh sort of collected the children from the lists and made our own group and uh decided to initiate a visit and to approach anyone who can help us get the Children released immediately um you know we we just say kids are out of the game they shouldn't be waiting for a deal they shouldn't be and we're here um on this private initiation we came here to meet with uh qatar's Ambassador uh in the UK hoping he will enlist to the effort and he's very um he's very obligated he's given us the impression that Qatar is doing whatever they can to help and I do believe him uh he was very he was very empathetic to us uh and he's a family man and it's an unfair question to ask you because you're suffering and you are the victims here but but you'll be aware as well that there are children on the other side oh yeah lots of children as well um do you have a view on on where this goes next the only thing I can say as a mother and I you know I tell it everywhere I go I used to tell my children all the time that children anywhere in the world are children they're humans and they should be seen as ones and I'm trying to give good education to my children in regards to looking at the people in Gaza and especially the children in Gaza as humans and I'm sort of hoping that mothers on the other end of the fence see me as such but I'm not sure anymore I used to but I'm not sure anymore um I want human left I don't know there so much violence going on so much violence going on but you know my heart goes out to every child and every mother who becomes a victim of this and I think Hamas is holding two two million hostages apart from our hostages which are the Palestinians themselves and among them the children so let us just pause and have a children's time out get our children out and get the Gaza children out let's get them out of the equation do you have a view on how the media and and and the agenda in the last couple of weeks has sort of focused entirely on Gaza do do you have any frustration concern that in some ways the hostages in in the Israeli government said the UN doesn't focus enough on the hostage doesn't put enough pressure on Hamas to release the hostages do you do you have a view on that we fight all the time and we say this must be the main priority the main goal to so to save the hostage to release them I believe I believe they doing their best you know they doing they acting wisely and with with good judgment I have to believe that I want to believe that okay again I'm not politican I'm a woman I'm I'm a mom I'm a mother of course I'm terrified our children are still in the middle of the war we don't know nothing about them no information we don't know nothing they been held in a tunels in a deep underground they can't see the sky and the Sun and you know I'm sure they terrified it's one month now it's 31 days already they far from us this children never been far from us more than three two days if I'm terrified what about them you know they they don't know when they're going to see us again they they separate from the parents they can you imagine can you imagine your child just been kidnapped from his bed with pajama from his house from his safe place without shoes and just in cruy and messless way he been taken and it's very sensitive children that already have how you anxiety attacks and the anxiety and the they all anxiety because we are 20 years under bombs they very s sensitive and fragile and they you know we had a movie of my child I can't see this movie the whole world seen this movie I can't see it because it's too painful to see that M how he's been hold like this I just saw the beginning and I you know I didn't want to to watch it but I just saw his he was so helpless so helpless so terrified and so confused you know been Hing by big terrorist of Hamas can you imagine your child in this situation and then it they disappeared from our life we don't know when we going to see them again it's look like n how you said like forever forever yeah I just want to welcome back our world viewers we're in conversation with ranana Jacob sha yomi and Hades Calderon three mothers who have lost their children um kidnapped uh currently in Gaza um we we've talked a lot about what happened on the day I I I just I just want to understand you've talked a lot about your emotions but I want to understand what happens when these videos come out when some of the hostages were released do do you take Hope from that or or or does it in some way twist the knife is it is it is it worse because of those videos well let's differentiate between the videos that Kamas was sending us at the beginning which was probably well it's part of their propaganda uh and it's very violent one The Killing and the and what happened on the day all of it including the video that Hadas was talking about showing showing little children being taken from their homes I don't see them as great Heroes by doing so but if that's the way they perceive themselves that's fine if you're talking about the uh hostages released uh both of them are U the last ones that were released from our community and at least I was very um uh very hopeful after their release um because it it's you know it seems to me that maybe there is some Humanity on the other end and uh they saw elderly ladies that uh needed Medical Care and and decided to release them so maybe there is hope after all you said that you're not getting any information from the Israeli government Mark reave is coming on the program tonight what do I need to ask him I you know I don't expect them to give me any information because any information that would have been given to me would probably put my children's life at risk so even if they know something they're not going to tell 200 or so families what's going on and what they know or what they don't know so I I understand it's a very complex situation what I do want them to um to be obligated to is to to get the children out and I'm not sure this is first priority I was going to ask you that do you do you think the hostages are the first priority or is it retribution is it children not oh hostages in general but children should not be prioritized they should be first and they should be out and they should be out now you know no deals no negotiations just a timeout for children get them out but we understand the motivation that is that the war cabinet is following and we understand that the the need and the desire for Retribution but is that are the hostages as you say being prioritized in that and is the strategy right it's not for me to say you know I'm not um politician I'm not a strategic consultant I'm not a general in the Army I'm just a mother of two who are held hostage and I think it's my government's responsibility to get them out and since they are children they should be released no questions asked and that's that should be agreed on both sides um as I said children's time out on both sides listen we're we're out of time um but I'm really grateful to all of you coming in and and I'm sure the sympathies and thoughts are there from all our viewers who've been watching so um thank you for coming in
