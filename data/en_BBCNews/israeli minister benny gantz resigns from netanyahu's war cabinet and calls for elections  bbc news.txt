now a leading opposition figure in Israel's war cabinet has resigned calling on the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold elections Benny Gant had set a deadline of this weekend for Mr Netanyahu to outline Israel's longer term strategy once the war in Gaza is over Jeremy boen is here so he's a very experienced figure and probably one of the most experienced members of the war Cabinet why is he left yeah former General former head of the army one of his political allies um Isaac CT has also left with him another former General um well he said he gave Netanyahu an ultimatum 3 weeks ago to do those things to have a plan for what happens the day after so this is the quote that in his press conference he was going to say it all yesterday but he put it off by 24 hours after that hostage rescue he said fateful strategic decisions are stuck due to hesitation and uh procrastination out of political considerations he's talking about Netanyahu by political considerations he means netanyahu's desire to stay in power perhaps prolong the war when he could be doing a deal and to avoid the Reckoning with the Israeli people about the mistakes that led up to the security failures of 7th of October which a lot of Israelis blame Netanyahu for now gance is hoping that this move will start the destruction of the net Yahoo government and there will be elections and the polls say that if there were elections he would become the Prime Minister but might backfire because Netanyahu is uh reliant on the votes to keep his Coalition going of ultra nationalist far right elements who want the war to continue in Gaza who want to put Jewish settlers into Gaza and they will now perhaps have more influence
