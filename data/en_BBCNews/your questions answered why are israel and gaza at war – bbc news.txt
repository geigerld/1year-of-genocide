well the conflict in Israel and Gaza is far from simple and many people are searching the internet with their questions here with me to help answer some of them the most trending questions at least that people are asking online search engines is our Middle East analyst Sebastian Asher Sebastian welcome to you thanks very much for being with us um for your expertise before we go to those questions yes let's get some analysis on where we're at at this situation we've be talking a lot about the Raffa Crossing if you can explain what that is why it's so important and if it is likely that Israel will allow people out yeah I I mean to a degree we're in a sort of holding pattern here I mean the big story of course is when and if Israel will launch it's offensive from the north down in the south at the Rafa Crossing which is the one of the two Crossings there's one obviously into Israel this one is into Egypt is where the anticipation is at the moment and this morning we had reports that there was going to be a temporary truce to allow a very we're talking very small number of Palestinian Americans across um into Egypt so as you were saying in your introduction that there are several thousand people so at the rro Crossing waiting to go but the temporary truth has not been agreed we've actually had a statement from uh the Israeli Prime Minister's office saying that there is no ceasefire and when we talking about ceasefire we're only talking about this most limited truce in terms of down there there's been no ceasefire no sign of a ceasefire up in the north of Gaza where the Israeli bombardment has continued how has still continued to fire some Rockets into Israel so the the the the war between Israel and Hamas hasn't really change in any of its Dimensions over the past two or 3 days the efforts are of course growing to try and open up Rafa crossing the Hope being that once it's open obviously the first aid can come in the first people can come out and once that has happened it's a major first step towards allowing more people out allowing the the the the hundreds of thousands of God ains who come down from the north of Gaza where Israel is expected to have its offensive after Israel warned them that they must go obviously they're in very difficult circumstances down in the South still the blockade which has been tightened by Israel is is in place there's been a tiny easing of it but food shortages water shortages electricity Etc where did they stay all the shelters essentially are taken up people staying in relatives homes so it's it's it's a very combust situation down there Egypt uh which controls veraa Crossing does not want a huge influx of Palestinians one for its own security two it doesn't want to be seen doing what would be seen in the Arab world the Muslim world as Israel's bidding the fear the concern amongst many Arabs is that once the Palestinians have left they may never go back and Egypt does not want to facilitate that okay so let's talk about um the situation to in the northern Israel and its border with Lebanon and this group Hezbollah who have been firing Rockets into Northern Israel killed two people in the past day or so to Israelis just explain who Hezbollah are the influence they have the the control that they have in Lebanon and what they want to achieve well understand that leban at the moment isn't governed by anybody there's a caretaker government there's no president now part of the reason is the division between certain political elements and hasbullah hasbullah there's no doubt is the most powerful political military force in Lebanon it's more powerful than the Lebanese Army um it led a successful in hasbullah terms bid for many years to drive Israel out of a buffer zone that had established in the south of Lebanon Israel finally withdrew in 200000 and hasbullah saw that as a huge success for themselves and they essentially presented themselves as the only force in the Arab world that actually had won at least one Victory against Israel six years later there was um a a a a a a a problem between Israel and and uh and Lebanon which led Israel to invade Lebanon it essentially paliz the south of Lebanon which is pretty much under the control of Hezbollah and hasbullah at that time was in dodgy territory ear in Lebanon because many people blamed hasbullah for calling that Devastation on Lebanon by Israel by its actions so hasbullah tries to have this balance between its role as what it sees as key resistance against Israel but also within Lebanon of not pushing so hard against Israel that it upsets the whole status quo in Lebanon such as it is um and for example I mean unlike Hamas which is an islamist organization obviously and wants the islamist ideology to be imposed wherever it rules hasbullah has never said that in Lebanon that and it's never 100% wanted to be politically in control of Lebanon there the they uh they have Ministries they have huge clout about who's elected president who's elected prime minister but they don't want to 100% carry the can for Lebanon so it's it it's a very very difficult situation A precarious balance for Lebanon for for for Hezbollah within Lebanon and its relations outside and of course the other side of Hezbollah is that it's backed and essentially the creation to a l extent of Iran so when people worry when the Americans worry Anthony blinkin at the moment has just arrived back in Israel he was doing shuttle diplomacy around the Arab world key issue he's trying to lock down is that there's no further spillover in this war obviously every everybody looks North to hasbullah hasbullah won't take Serious action beyond what it's done so far without the say so of Iran Iran has been rhetorically suggesting that all bets could be off if things go really bad in Gaza but at the moment it's tether has Bull's power and Israel has has made it clear it does not want a war with Hezbollah and we've seen the us moving um air pane carriers big warships which is essentially a warning to other outside players who might want to get involved less about Hamas and the battle in Gaza but essentially a message to Iran really that do not cross this line we will take it very very seriously a few moments ago you were talking about Egypt about the raff of Crossing about what Israel what Egypt wants or or doesn't want people are also asking um is it safe to travel to Egypt at the moment I think you could say it's safe to travel to Egypt I mean none of the Arab states around uh um Gaza and Israel are likely to get actively involved in a war Lebanon may be drawn into it by Hezbollah as as as we've just been saying but Egypt has had the longest peace treaty back to 1978 with Israel uh it has in conjunction with Israel it is very much control the borders around uh Gaza and with Hamas it's tried to play a mediating role it's tried to bring the two factions the two main Palestinian factions Hamas and fata in the occupied West Bank together at various points it's continued with that mission it will and has been involved in mediation now to try to get a ceasefire to try to get talks going of some kind but at this stage I think that's really too early to Bear any througho you will have as you'll see across the Arab world across the Muslim World major protests in support of the Palestinians to some extent in boort of Hamas so if you were going to K if you were going to some areas where those protests are going to be very large then you know people traveling would need to be careful of that there'd be security reasons to to to have a concern of that but in terms of Egypt directly being involved in a war with Israel over this that isn't going to happen and what about Jordan people are asking is it safe to travel to Jordan just explain Jordan another neighboring country to Israel previously enemies but we've seen the uh Jordanian King also involved in trying to negotiate some kind of it's a very similar story I mean both both Egypt and Jordan I mean Jordan signed a peace deal in 1994 with uh um Israel having participated in at least two Wars against Israel 1967 and Myon kipur War but its role is in some ways more complicated than Egypt in that Egypt returned the sin have the sin returned to it from from from Israel it doesn't have a large proportion of Palestinians there either as refugees or anything else Jordan essentially it's very difficult to to gauge exactly the numbers but it still has a huge Palestinian refugee population and has a large Palestinian population beyond that who sort of identifies Palestinians as much as jordanians so it's a real Tinder books there which um King Abdullah his father King Hussein have strugg struggled you know throughout their Reigns to control because anywhere I mean if if you look outside uh the Palestinian territories the place where there's the strongest prop Palestinian feeling and the strongest numbers of people is in Jordan so King Abdullah is playing again the same role that his father did and as is happened with Egypt a mediation role because of its relationship with Israel because of the stakes being so high for Jordan and it's always been seen in the west as a very West Friendly country and it depends hugely on Western financial support in order to survive so again it will play as this story continues an important mediation role but it would also be trying very hard to keep a lid on protests within its own country not just palestin but also islamist it it has a very very strong um islamist uh forer uh politically and that has seen big protests in the past it's seen violence that could break out out as this continues if the Gs are offensive goes um goes ahead uh uh uh and there are many many more casualties amongst Palestinians than we've seen so far than the pressure inside Jordan from the people just as we'll see around the Arab world will grow more and more intense obviously we've talked a lot about Hamas who they are over the past week Israel is at war with Hamas they have vowed to crush them to wipe them out it was Hamas that launched this murderous attack on Israel in which 1,400 Israelis and other foreign Nationals were killed just over a week ago they've taken 199 people hostage explain a little bit more about the Hamas leadership because we've heard over the past few days Israel said they have killed the leader of Hamas in Gaza um but there is a differentiation between the Hamas militant Wing the Hamas political Wing let's talk about first of all about the military wing and who they want to destroy yes I mean they haven't killed the actual leader of of of Hamas they've killed some senior uh uh members who they say were directly involved in the uh assault uh on Israel so you have a you have a leadership outside a political leadership in Exile essentially um Ismael hania is is uh is the leader he moves between uh Qatar and several other countries Qatar though is his real host country and they have shown more Readiness as you'd expect from a political leadership to have negotiation have talks to some degree to move a little bit away from a founding charge of Hamas which says that it is uh uh working towards the total Destruction of Israel it's blown hot and cold but there have been times when that leadership has essentially said that it would settle if the 1967 borders were returned to and the occupied palestini territories were given to the Palestinians as a formal state that they would accept a truce perhaps a 100-year truce now that kind of conversation has died away over the past few years just as the peace process has been stalled so you have that element which is you know as in any organization like this there are different layers different strata within it and then you have in Gaza essentially a military leadership which is much much more hardore you have Muhammad de is the leader there Yahya Sina is the political leader in Gaza the administrative leader and these are people who have shown no sign of any quarter with Israel and still believe that military solution is the only way to go they still believe that they can as as they obviously try to do uh in this assault to cause so much pain so much hurt to Israel that Israel will either bow and leave and that's a greatest hope or will be pressured into compromise is probably not the right word but in giving the Palestinians more than I think anybody else is expecting the the the the political leadership the fataa leadership Etc they will at the moment feel that they've made their point I mean as you say Israel has vowed the total obliteration of Hamas but they at the moment are definitely in the lead they only are in the ascendant they have the upper hand as far as Hamas is concerned um they will be you know giving a sense but what they've done has changed the status quo that's existed all these years nothing else has done that through their actions now they will claim this is what they tried to say they haven't killed any civilians they essentially believe that anyone in Israel is a settler and is therefore guilty that's their way of looking at it again the Hamas leadership itself political leadership doesn't talk in such black and white terms so we are talking about very different um um layers within Hamas which are definitely not at odds with um at the moment but we we could see as this progresses more more of a division and at the end of this process at the end of the war I think the Hamas political leadership just as a political leadership in the occupi Westbank will try to reassert themselves in terms of looking towards a future and looking back to a two-state solution Hamas is a prescribed terrorist organization in the UK in the US the EU also so many countries around the world when we talk about the militant wing and the political side of it is that one and the same thing well I mean in the UK originally the the the the armed Wing was prescribed as terrorist and then two years ago Hamas itself as an organization as a whole was prescribed as terrorist I think at the moment and certainly in the US estimation it doesn't make any distinction but if there are going to be negotiations if there are going to be talks Hamas to some degree will have to be involved because the Hamas political leader leadership is unlikely to be destroyed unless Israel is going to go on a mission we don't know this yet but to kill Ismael hania to kill the people who who who who could speak for Hamas outside of the Gaza Strip so it is a difficult position to be in to some degree because there's no doubt that as far as Palestinians are concerned right now they see Hamas as the only viable leadership in the occupied territories as far as f is concerned as far as Pres Abbas is is concerned they're not seen as having any real say even in the occupied West Bank we're seeing there new groups New armed groups have been emerging in the past year and a half as Israel has gone in on Military raids you know almost daily there have been clashes um in response to you know a whole wave of killings inside Israel by um Palestinian gunmen we've seen these new groups arise and they and Hamas are the ones at the moment who will be calling the shots we've heard from president abas he was speaking just just yesterday saying that Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinian people he will hold to that but at the moment that voice is drowned out okay let's talk about the Palestinian people the Palestinian people live in Gaza and the West Bank and people are asking is Palestine a country was Palestine ever a country it's not formally a country at the moment there are some countries around the world you recognize it as a St but it's not been formly recognized by the UN it has a non-member Observer status at the UN it's had since 2012 uh we talk about President Abbas so I mean that gives a sense of a head of a state but it's still very much in embryo and the whole issue of a peace process was to was to set up a viable Palestinian state that doesn't exist the difficulty over that was a Palestinian never believe that what they were being offered was anything close to what they had lost so at the times when it looked close that some Accord might be made back in the early 2000s back in uh the late 1990s the Palestinians in the end rejected uh what they were offered because they believe that it just didn't didn't come near to the boundaries of what they believed they should be given it wasn't that the fata and uh uh and the PLO rejected the idea of a two-state solution wasn't that they rejected the idea that Israel should exist but they weren't satisfied with what uh with what they were being offered Palestine as a state I mean it um as an entity in the Middle East it's existed for a very very long time but it's existed under a whole series of Empires under the Roman empire under the Ottoman Empire from the 16th century until the first world war then it was a mandate under uh Britain up until 1947 when Britain withdrew and then of course there was the League of Nations decision to divide what was Palestine into Israel and into uh an Arab State Israel declared independence and then there was a war with Arab states trying to take over the whole area they lost so there hasn't been a Palestine as a country in modern times but as a name absolutely and so the Palestinian people 100% believe that they have every right to self-identify as Palestinians and why did Jewish people claim it as their Homeland well that is based partly on ancient history on the Bible uh that that was their Homeland going back you know to to the to the days of King David Etc um it had different states as uh uh uh uh that existed over various times within the framework of a Bible but in modern history there hasn't hasn't been an Israeli State what we're seeing is there was a rise of Zionism in the 19th century it was a movement in Europe which essentially was uh pushing for a safe Homeland for for for the Jewish people and Israel as being their original ancestral Homeland was where they decided to go so the settlements began from then and built and built and built so more and more Jewish people obviously were going during the next 60 70 years even before the creation of Israel so I mean you have slightly separate way of looking at it you have many of the settlers believe in the biblical sense of Israel that all of it belongs to them that everyone else is an intruder that the Palestinians came after them that they are the true indigenous population then you have many people who came from uh Eastern Europe uh who came after the Holocaust who see it maybe in a slightly more pragmatic way they see it as their safe home that was created for them yes it has the ancest side to it that they're not as committed to the idea that Judea Samaria the places in the West Bank where the settlers are has to be part of their Homeland what they're more interested in is having an Israeli State and therefore they're willing to accept a Palestinian State side by side if they can be assured of their own security with that so there is that Division I think between uh Israelis settlers and also Jewish people the diaspora so we have another question which is why are Israel and Gaza at War would you describe Israel being at war with Gaza or being at war with Hamas it's being described as at war with Hamas that's how Israel describes it that's how we're describing it essentially because I mean I mean Hamas controls Gaza no doubt about that there was an election but it goes way back to 2006 but they won they then seized the whole of Gaza by force from fata they force them out in 2007 so there hasn't really been any way of gauging how much the people people of Gaza want Hamas to be in control so Israel certainly doesn't want to look as if they are Waging War on the Palestinians of Gaza they want to confine it to Hamas and that's why Israel is saying that they're doing everything they can to try and protect Palestinians by telling them to leave so they can then have a clear run at Hamas for Palestinians they see it and many people in across the Arab and Muslim world and and Beyond see it as almost a niche distinction that the bombs that are falling from Israel the air strikes that are happening don't make a clear enough distinction between Hamas and between the people who live there so they see it as a war on Gaza as a war on the people of Gaza as we've seen time and time again they would say that this is a war on Gaza and a war on the Palestinians and a war on their desire for a statehood their desire for dignity why Israel why is Israel imposing this blockade water food Medical supplies we've just had a a update on the Reuters news agency concerning the resumption that Israel said was going to happen of water in southern Gaza uh the Hamas interior Ministry have said that that has not happened um it said that residents drinking unhealthy water posing a serious health crisis threatening the lives of the citizens and of course many people can't get hold of any water at the moment but why is Israel imposing this blockade on on all of the people the 2 million people of Gaza well this has been a blockade to degree that's been on Gaza since since 2007 and Egypt as well has imposed a sort of blockade by controlling the the entry and exit from uh the Rafa Crossing and that's essentially a blockade on Hamas Hamas which Israel see sees as its biggest enemy that Egypt also sees as a kind of enemy within the Palestinians so what we've saw when Israel responded to the Hamas assault was they tightened it they then called it a total Siege and several ministers said that we are going to stop food we're going to stop water we're going to stop electricity and the thinking behind that one imagined is to put maximum pressure on the people of Gaza on the pal um to to to try and disengage them to some extent from Hamas to show these are the consequences of what Hamas has done you are suffering them they've done something without necessarily your say so they haven't gone and and and asked you if you want this but they've done it in your name so I think from the Israeli perspective if they feel that if they put maximum pressure then perhaps they can complete their task which they've set out to be to eradicate Hamas as quickly as possible From anational perspective from an aid perspective we've heard day in day out from un Aid agencies the other agencies that this is just insupportable that in already very very difficult conditions inside Gaza have been made totally unlivable that people will soon perhaps die uh because of having to drink dirty water disease all of these issues and how can you get a large proportion of people to move from the north of Gaza the hundreds of thousands who've moved to a place where there isn't much else provided there either how can that continue and if this is going to be a war which could go on for months then quite apart from what will happen with the Israeli offensive the ground offensive the likely loss of civilian lives what about the people who are actually to some extent to some extent sheltered from that main offensive how are they going to be uh uh uh looked after and if a Rafa Crossing is not open fully to allow eight I mean there are hundreds and hundreds of lorries and trucks containers waiting to move in with aid but they can't they can't go in at the moment so as I say from Israeli perspective it's maximum pressure we are I mean they're saying this is a war like no other that we thought with Hamas this is a war essentially of extinction of obliteration the Palestinians are the ones who are going to suffer thank you very much for taking us through all that in such great detail
