meanwhile those living in haa in Northern Israel are preparing for a potential conflict with the iranian-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah the port city was badly hit during the second Lebanon war in 2006 and is expected to be a Target once again a Middle East correspondent Jenny Hill visited the city and sent this report deep underground a place of Last Resort this car park now a hospital if there's an attack on Hyer the vast bunker will shelter the sick and take in the injured when when when when is it going to happen nobody knows we talk about it a lot where in general people are optimistic we hope it's going to be in short duration there are operating theaters a Maternity Ward a command bunker and supplies to keep going for 3 days they tell us here they're fully prepared for an attack Israel insists it's ready for any eventuality and yet you can sense the unease you can feel the fear this port city is vulnerable Lebanon and hezbollah's Rockets are close by just look across the shipping Lane you can see the Border it's a taking time bomb any minute now it could be like an alarm will I die will I have time to go home to my family it will be probably drones or Miss and it will be problematic for us to evacuate H but for who opened his coffee shop 6 months ago the constant threat has dulled the fear are you afraid I'm not afraid for the mayor of hia sleepless nights he ran the city when Israel was at war with Lebanon nearly 20 years ago I'm very sad about it that there is a fork in the Middle East with their leaders are only concerned about destruction killing fighting instead of building so Hyper's doctors continue to prepare their Fortress hospital but International diplomacy is ongoing hope still perhaps they'll never have to use it Jenny Hill BBC News Hyer well let's now speak to our correspondent Hugo Basher who's in Beirut so Hugo we have The View there from northern Israel in haa how about in Lebanon where you are how are people viewing the prospect of an escalation the conflict between Israel and hezb well Katherine everybody here in Lebanon is waiting for this response from Hezbollah yesterday we heard from the leader of Hezbollah Hassan nazala uh who said that uh the group is going to retaliate after the assassination of a senior Commander by Israel uh last week here in Beirut in the group's uh stronghold in the southern suburbs of Beirut and he said this response is coming uh it is going to be strong and effective and that Hezbollah couldn't treat this assassination as any other attack so uh again uh everybody here waiting to see what Hezbollah uh is planning to do but obviously they are in a very difficult position because they know that they need to send a message that this was uh an attack uh that was uh significant for the group it happened in the group's uh stronghold here in Beirut in the capital of the country but also um they need to give a response that is measured uh so to not provoke a huge Israeli response and we know that some inside Israel are in favor of of a of an attack of a military campaign against Hezbollah tens of thousands of Israeli resid uh in Northern Communities uh remain uh displaced because of these attacks that have been happening along the border between Lebanon and Israel almost every day so there is the fear that uh this expected uh response from Hezbollah could trigger uh a reaction from Israel and this could lead to an escalation of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel and obviously uh in the last few days countries have been urging their citizens to leave Lebanon uh flights here have been cancelled uh suspended many tickets have sold out so people who want to leave the country have now very limited options but still uh there's no sense of panic here uh there's no uh there are no signs of people desperately trying to leave Lebanon but the entire country and the region uh is now waiting for this response from Hezbollah and Hugo we've heard from Hezbollah congratulating Yaya Sena on his new role as the overall leader of Hamas now just tell us a bit more about the reaction there in the region to Yano Sina assuming this position exactly so um Iran and Hezbollah congratulating uh Yahya SWA for this nomination uh many here seeing this as a uh as a sign of defiance uh because he was obviously the leader of Hamas in Gaza now he is the leader of Hamas replacing ish who was assassinated in tan so he's consolidating his power over Hamas obviously he was one of the masterminds of the October the 7th attacks on uh Israel and we also had reaction from Israel saying that this was another sign uh of the need uh to uh kill uh Yahya SWA and also to destroy Hamas now it's very interesting that he is believed to be hiding uh in uh the vast network of underground tunnels in Gaza but he continues to dictate uh hamas's actions especially when it comes to the ceasefire and hostage deal uh negotiations in Gaza so uh Anthony blinkin the US Secretary of State again said that he remained the primary decider when it came to this uh deal and the Hope obviously uh is that a deal can be reached uh for a pause uh in the fighting in Gaza also for those hostages to be released but there's also the hope that any kind of ceasefire in Gaza could help deescalate tensions across the region because again here in hollah has been saying that they will observe here in Lebanon any ceasefire in Gaza but as these tensions continue I think hopes diminishing that for now uh any kind of deal can be reached Hugo thank you that's our Middle East correspondent Hugo basa in Beirut there
