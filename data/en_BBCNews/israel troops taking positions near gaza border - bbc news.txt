Israel has renewed its warning for people in the northern half of Gaza to leave as it continues intense air strikes across the territory troops amassed on the border with Gaza ahead of an expected ground incursion the Israeli Defense Force say that they have struck over a 100 military targets overnight and killed a senior Commander militants have continued to fire Rockets into Israel towards Tel Aviv and other areas in the South the World Health Organization has condemned Israel's evacuation order it says forcing Hospital patients to relocate would be a death sentence President Biden has spoken with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and urged him to provide safety for Civ civilians amid the bombardment Diplomatic efforts to prevent the violence from spreading have been stepped up Mr Biden's Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is visiting Cairo he's expected to press Egyptian officials to restart talks on getting Aid into Gaza through the border crossing the US is sending a second aircraft carrier to the Eastern Med Mediterranean near Israel the USS Eisenhower will lead a group of ships aimed at deterring further attacks against Israel in particular from Iran or the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah well let's cross now to our Middle East correspondent yoland Nell um and yolan just talk us through uh the latest that you're hearing we've been hearing about the the intensified clashes on Israel's northern border with Lebanon and and obviously we're hearing about Israel extending this time period that it's given uh gazans to leave the north of Gaza just talk us through the developments as they've been coming in over the last few hours well earlier the Israeli military said that it was giving another 3-hour window for residents of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to make their way South along a routes uh which it declared uh to be safe and we have seen in the past couple of days now hundreds of thousands of people making that Journey some of them on foot with their belongings just in carrier bags or in rock sack s some people with um carts with donkeys other people with cars using up what little fuel they have left because of course Gaza remains under this tight Siege by Israel with no food no water no electricity and no fuel uh being allowed in now there is growing concern about the humanitarian situation uh particularly in the south of the strip where you have all of these people uh really in makeshift shelters in un schools places like that um they're extremely crowded and with no Aid getting in uh there's really very limited means for the the very limited number of emergency workers in the Gaza Strip to be able to help them another complication here is that the lack of Internet and the lack of um people with working phones so communication uh becomes more and more difficult um we know that the World Health Organization has been raising awareness of these 20 hospitals in the northern half of the Gaza Strip where it said that the evacuation order given by Israel was really a tantamount to a death sentence there are very sick and injured people there and at the moment there are there are still babies in incubators uh things like that and they're asking how are these people supposed to be moved um this is all complicating of course Israel's plans uh for for a ground offensive it wants uh as many people to leave the north of the Gaza Strip particularly Gaza City which we expect to be a real focus it wants that area cleared as much as possible before it goes in saying it's going to tackle both isra both the Hamas a military and governing capabilities and what has uh Israel been saying too there's clearly mounting pressure on it to to to provide safe passage for civilians we've had President Biden talking about an obligation to provide safety for civilians and as you say the World Health Organization really strongly condemning these calls for hospitals patients to have to move what is Israel saying in its defense well Israel is saying that it is hamas's responsibility as the government in Gaza to help people move Hamas has been telling people not to leave their homes um and when I asked the Israeli military spokesman about this um he told me that really Hamas had got cars Hamas had got vehicles that it could move people and that really it should should uh get involved here um at the same time of course yes there is Big pressure on Israel from surrounding countries um Jordan has called for humanitarian corridors there's a lot of Aid which has already arrived in the Sinai in Egypt that's Aid that could easily be taken into the Gaza Strip if Egypt was to open the the Rafa Crossing now Egypt has said it's not going to do that to allow hundreds of people who have foreign nationalities who are stuck in Gaza it's not going to allow them out until it gets some guarantees that Aid can also safely be taken into the Gaza Strip so that's the situation at the moment and we know that the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin on his trip which really defines shuttle diplomacy he's been going from country to Country around the region that's one of the the big efforts that he's involved in is trying to get the Raffa Crossing open also you mentioned earlier about Hezbollah in the north There's real concern there in the North of Israel about what could happen with new um firing by both sides um and really a lot of concern that this conflict could spread more widely in the region that's something that Anthony blinkin has been talking to different Regional actors about as well trying to get them to put some pressure on on the different players um where they have uh where they have some influence um and in the last few hours at least one Israeli has been killed and a couple of civilians also have being injured we understand by anti-tank missiles but at the moment Hezbollah is not using its longer range missiles if it gets involved that is going to really change this because it is a very powerful force with a huge arsenal of longer range weapons okay thank you very much youan now for us there in Jerusalem can hear now from our correspondent Nick Beak he spoke to us earlier from ashalon in southern Israel yes this is ashalon which is about seven miles from Gaza where this morning we've heard quite a lot of activity in the air actually there's been the distinctive Buzz of Israeli uh drones but also the the fighter pilots are going overhead and uh what they've been doing is they've been flying over us and then a few seconds later we've heard large booms bearing in mind we are seven miles away these have echoed around this part of Southern Israel so that's the situation on the ground here we've just heard from the is isi um officials that there will be a window a 3-hour window today in which people in Gaza can move from the north to the South that is along one specific route yesterday there were two routes that would were opened up for a for a bigger window these timings have very much slipped but that's what the Israelis are saying today all the while of course the United Nations saying that this is you know completely unacceptable the World Health Organization for example saying that trying to move people people from the north to the South and they is you know just not feasible and they say specifically when you look at 2,000 people they say who are in intensive care and also in maternity units they moving from the north to the South that is tantamount to a a death sentence so extremely extremely strong language from them all the while Israel saying that it's carrying out a proportionate response to the attacks by Hamas just over a week ago and that this is all part of an act of self-defense on their part be there in ashalon while a missile fired into Israel from Lebanon has killed at least one person it hit a settlement near the border between the two countries the militant group Hezbollah said it was behind the attack our correspondent Huga Bacha gave us this update from tier near the border with sou near the border in southern Lebanon so the Israeli Emergency Services have confirmed that one person was killed a Manning his 40s three civilians were injured uh in this community the community of Shula in Northern Israel near the uh Lebanese border and uh this is the first civilian death on Israel's northern border since the beginning of this war between Israel and Hamas now hasbalah said he had targeted uh this uh Community with guided missiles and they said this was in retaliation uh after the the killings of three civilians here in Lebanon they said that these civilians were killed as a result of Israeli attacks uh the Israeli Army hasn't confirmed that they were involved in these attacks and I think this shows how volatile the situation is along the uh Lebanese Israeli border I mean fears that Lebanon could be dragged into this conflict Hezbollah obviously a very powerful group with tens of thousands of rockets and missiles uh tens of thousands of of Fighters uh as well and we've seen that in the last few days Hezbollah and Israel have uh exchanged rockets and shelling so tensions are really high here in this region and I spoke to a source close to Hezbollah who said that the group is on high alert but that hezbollah's next steps will be determined by what happens in Gaza and if Israel goes ahead with this ground offensive in Gaza against Hamas so again a very tense situation uh and with a number of incidents happening along this order here I made fears again that this could become another front in this war here Goa for us there in southern Lebanon
