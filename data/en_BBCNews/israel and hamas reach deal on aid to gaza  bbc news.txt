qatar's foreign Ministry announced Israel and the Palestinian islamist group have agreed to deliver medicines hostages held by Hamas in Gaza in exchange for supplying Aid to civilians following French and Qatari mediation the United Nation says the war has displaced roughly 85% of gaza's 2.4 million people many of whom have been forced to crowd into shelters and struggle to get food water fuel and Medical Care under the deal the humanitarian Supply will leave the Qatari Capital Doha for Egypt later today the aid will then be taken to Gaza to be delivered to civilians while medicin are to reach Israeli captives more than 132 hostages are thought to be still held in Gaza live now to our Middle East correspondent yoland Nell yoland what more can you tell us about this deal and how difficult it was to come to an agreement yes so this is a deal we first heard about a few days ago and then it seems to have hit some logistical problems now those have been resolved we understand um Qatar has been the important party here assisted by the French the French saying that something like 45 of the remaining hostages are suffering from chronic diseases or need life saving medicines of other kinds uh so now those medicines have been acquired and we understand that they will be flown uh from Doha today um on Air Force jets uh taken into Egypt and then will be transferred across to G in exchange we understand Hamas has accepted that there will be a big increase in the number of medicines allowed in for Palestinian civilians suffering in Gaza right and what about the broader Aid question in Gaza I mean this is a big issue we've had the world food program coming out uh in recent days saying that people are at risk of dying of starvation just miles away from trucks full with food and they're really asking the different un Aid agencies for more entry points to be opened up to go into Gaza an easing of the very uh tight and they say laborious um Security checks uh that need to be carried out things made more streamlined also making it easier for f humanitarian workers to distribute the aid giving them some guarantees of safety because at the moment that is one of the major problems even when Aid can be gotten into Gaza you can't distribute it easily around the Gaza Strip there's so much ongoing fighting in the South there are other issues like another telecommunications blackout so it makes it very hard to coordinate with teams on the ground youand the fact that this agreement was struck is it a sign that there is hope for more diplomacy and even a ceasefire I mean what's interesting is the fact that this uh deal was announced and we just also had last night the wh house saying that uh its Middle East Envoy had just been in Kat and had taken part in very very serious and intensive discussions about the possibility of another hostage release deal uh in exchange of course that would be for uh some kind of a ceasefire um so the White House saying that it's hopeful although indicating that there's still a long way to go although the fact that the agreement includes medicines to be delivered to the Israeli hostages is an implicit admission or admission perhaps is the wrong word but it's implicit indication that they're still alive and can be located um that does appear to be a sort of hopeful sign from this and it's really a hopeful sign for the families of the hostages some of them had actually gone to Qatar to meet the prime minister in recent days and and really press uh for some kind of breakthrough starting off uh with the medicine we know of course that some of the hostages are older people uh people who were taking daily uh medicines for different health conditions um and that also there were others who were injured um and that has also been a factor a lot of concern about what's happened to them a bit of information that has come from the hostages who were released under that deal um that saw about half of the total of 240 hostages originally taken on the 7th of October uh by Hamas uh released um and uh it's been something that we've we've heard a lot about on the Israeli side um this will bring some kind of a relief for people but they desperately want uh much more to be done Goan thank you very much indeed
