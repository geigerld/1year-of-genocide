refugees have continued to crowd into Rafa close to the border with Egypt where around a million and a half people are now seeking safety we'll get the latest on the ground in just a moment but first last November we reported on the case of a young woman and her disabled brother tala and yazid in Rafa they were trying to escape but were repeatedly turned away at the border along with their mother and siblings our special correspondent fergo Kean has been following the family's story we came back to no electricity no food for today she's been a constant caring voice from within the siege and one more day closer to my brother running out of medications and we're still here tala Abu n's daily life a Relentless struggle to care for her disabled brother yazid three times they tried to escape Rafa like last November when our cameraman first met them at the border we're trying to do anything that we can to do to survive because we just I simply don't want to die at then back home amid the constant noise of drones overhead tala tried to comfort [Music] yazid and then just a few days ago we had news from Cairo they'd escaped to the safety of a flat in the Egyptian Capital tala described the moment they left I can't hear drones anymore um and I can't see I can't I'm sorry um I want to be hearing any bombings or any air strikes and and it felt really surreal but normality even being able to boil a kettle for tea has brought uncomfortable feelings this is one of the hardest feelings to talk about should tah carries the memory of the people she's left behind every time I have food to eat or I don't have to go running for water or or knowing that everything is available it makes me feel even guilty to think about everyone in Gaza the 1.2 million people who are displaced in Rafa right now but they had to leave yazd's medication had run out worsening his condition he would have a seizure every time he he bombing and it got really scary like his body and his his mind is not being able to to understand everything that's going on tala knows a world Beyond Gaza she studied in the US lived with an American Family she won a fellowship for young leaders funded by the state department but all was coming home to yazid here together in 2021 will she return to Gaza I ha don't know how long is it going to take um but I would want to be part of rebuilding it and healing it I don't think I think everyone who leaves Gaza Gaza still does not leave them the Cairo sky is safe but it's not the sky of Home FAL Kean BBC News Jerusalem let's go live now to Jerusalem and to our correspondent Paul Adams and Paul what do we know about conditions in southern Gaza tonight well R you mentioned two places in your introduction one was NASA Hospital well the situation there is very unclear the Israelis uh troops have been in there since early Thursday morning conducting searches arresting members of Staff who they believe are associated with Hamas and looking for evidence that hostages were being were being held in the hospital uh they say that they are doing what they can to keep the hospital running bringing in diesel and oxygen and helping to fix a generator Palestinian sources are saying that the hospital is absolutely on its last legs and in fact the head of the wh has said that effectively NASA hospital has ceased to function we've heard of people dying as a result of interruptions to power and oxygen so at the very least it's an extremely precarious situation in NASA hospital to the South a little way to the south in Rafa 1.3 million people are waiting to find out when the Israeli military assault will come and today a member of Benjamin netanyahu's War cabinet Benny gance said that if hostages are not released by the beginning of Ramadan that is in precisely 3 weeks then the Israeli military assault on Rafa would begin and the White House has demanded that that cannot begin unless those civilians are out of the way and at the moment there is no plan to move them
