the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has said he's hopeful that Hamas will accept what he has described as an extraordinarily generous Gaza ceasefire offer from Israel we've been hearing in the last few minutes the proposed ceasefire would be for 40 days Mr blinkin who's attending talks with his Regional counterparts in Saudi Arabia was speaking as a delegation from Hamas attended parallel ceasefire negotiations in Cairo after weeks of impass Hamas is reported to have no major issues with a revised plan approved by Israel it's said to include new wording on a cessation of hostilities Mr blinkin reaffirmed us opposition to a planned Israeli offensive on Rafa City meanwhile saying he seen no plan that protects civilians there 20 people died in the latest Israeli air strikes overnight in this moment the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas they have to decide decide and they have to decide quickly uh so we're we're looking to that um and I'm hopeful that they will make the right decision and we can have a fundamental change in the in the dynamic the UK's foreign secretary meanwhile has given more detail on the ceasefire deal on the table it does seem to me there is now you know let's be frank a pretty generous offer of uh you know sustained 40 day ceasefire the release of potentially thousands of Palestinian prisoners in in return for the release of these hostages who've now been in captivity for over 200 days um so I hope Hamas do take this deal and frankly all the pressure in the world and all the eyes of the world should be on them today saying take that deal it will bring about this stop in the fighting that we all want to see so badly and let's go live now to Jerusalem and our security correspondent Frank Gardner Frank hello to you it certainly is a critical moment uh with a real sense of momentum it seems there really is I mean although it's right at the end of pek here of Passover there is a feeling that there could be a real breakthrough here because both sides Hamas and Israel have they've made concessions there's no question about it so Hamas had originally insisted on an end to the war and Israel is not agreeing to that but it is agreeing to withdraw its um some of its forces and to allow the passage of the return of um Palestinians who were currently are basically kettled right into the south in Rafa to their homes in the north of Gaza and that's been a really key demand um they also dropped their insistence that it has to be at least 40 hostages the figure that's being talked around is a bit lower than that around 33 so there is some give here because there is enormous pressure on both sides from the CES from the Egyptians from the Americans from the French to get this deal through and remember that behind the scenes here the cabin at the war cabinet in this country Israel is divided you've got those who don't want to see any deal at all to us they want to see the Egypt they want to see the Israeli military go in hard smash their way into Rafa and eliminate the last remaining few battalions of Hamas the people that carried out the atrocities of October the 7th but the US has made it very clear they are opposed to any operation in in Rafa as it stands at the moment because they don't think that Israel is capable of protecting all those civilians that are that are currently Sheltering them so we've been hearing about this phrase uh sustainable calm uh Frank and I wonder does potentially a 40-day ceasefire represent that or something more well look what everybody's hoping for is to be able to bring an end to this thing alog together what nobody outside this country wants is to see this truth end and for the whole thing to begin all over again um now there are people um certainly in the Israeli military and intelligence and security establishment who you say look we've got unfinished business in Gaza Yahya sinoa the architect of the October the 7th attacks and others um are still at large probably in the tunnels underneath Rafa if we don't go into Rafa then it's unfinished business and it'll just pop up like a hydra's head and we'll face the same threats all over again but the sheer humanitarian the depth and pro the extent of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza being pushed to the brink of famine has really galvanized the International Community to try and end the hostilities or at least bring it bring a temporary pause to them uh and some respite and there are there is great progress on the humanitarian front much more Aid is getting into Gaza this great big pontoon is being built in central Gaza that's going to reach out in like a kind of finger out into the Eastern Mediterranean Sea for offloading tons of aid more Crossing points are opening more trucks are getting in so but that's not of course that's just a Band-Aid it's that's just a sticking plaster for the the greater problems which are PAL the Palestinians still don't have a state and there is no sign from this Israeli government that it wants to ever depart or to give them a a a kind of roote map to that's end State okay Frank thank you very much Frank Gardner there are sec security correspondent in Jerusalem and let's get some more analysis on this story now this developing story because joining us is Mark kimt former US Deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East and a former Brigadier General thank you very much for your time today and what's your reading of this intensive diplomatic activity first of all well I think there is some progress being made uh otherwise secretary blinkin would not be uh appearing at these conferences he's putting his person reputation on the line that somehow he has brokered a deal between Israel and uh Egypt and Qatar so I think we're just going to have to see as your previous correspondent said there seems to be some enthusiasm but if it's only 40 or less hostages I think we've still got a long way to go before a true and Lasting ceasefire will be in place yeah and can whatever is being talked about stop uh an offensive on Rafa we heard secretary blinken say that you know he's seen no evidence yet of solid plans to protect civilians there in Rafa well again I don't think it will stop the War I think it will delay the attack the assault into Rafa as you remember some time ago prime minister Netanyahu said before he conducted an operation into Rafa there would be sufficient uh housing food water medicine for the refugees would come out of Rafa but as secretary blinkin said there's no evidence that that has been completed yet so a long way from the sort of irreversible Pathway to a two-state solution that the Jordanian prime minister has been talking about I think there's an irreversi don't think we even have a path to the end of this war much less a two-state solution okay so um what's next then uh some sort of temporary cessation not the sustainable calm that's been mentioned no I think that's I think you're exactly right I think this will be a pause this will not be a secession uh it's clear the Prime Minister netanyahu's um objectives to not change the destruction of Hamas the destruction of the infrastructure and the return of the hostages uh this may be a milestone uh but there are a lot of Milestones that need to be accomplished the return of the hostages the defeat of Hamas and unless prime minister Netanyahu steps down those will remain his War aims and just fin and briefly you think the idea of senior Hamas figures and those responsible for October the 7th leaving Gaza do you think that's likely uh horizontally certainly not vertically uh thank you very much for your uh thoughts today Mark kimet former US Deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East thank you
