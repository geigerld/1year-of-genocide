hostage video BBC does not normally broadcast hostage video and we're not going to give the names of the three individuals who were part of this message but we have seen and heard and translated what they had to say so let us look at some of the details of what is a distressing uh video to emerge we're joined by our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams Paul what can you tell us about this video it's really hard to watch three women we have confirmed their identities but we are not as you say going to name them at the moment they are sitting in a white tiled room on chairs dressed rather as the hostages were the other day in what appeared to be Palestinian costumes and one of them speaks and she speaks with real Fury and she addresses her remarks to Benjamin Netanyahu who Israel's prime minister she says that they have been in captivity for 23 days that suggests to me that maybe this video was recorded yesterday she also refers to a press conference that the families of the hostages had given the previous day that we think was two days ago in which she says we know there was supposed to be a ceasefire you were supposed to let us all go now yes there was a press conference and yes clearly there's a lot of talk about ceasefires but nothing from the Israeli side nothing from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to suggest that such a deal had actually been struck so that to my way of thinking suggests that that's what they've been told happened they probably don't have any access independent access to information they are entirely dependent on what their Hamas captors are telling them they appear to be healthy they do not appear to have been abused or injured but the the woman who speaks is extremely emotional and she becomes almost uncontrollably emotional at the end she says that the Army was not there to protect them on the 7th of October no one arrived no one guarded us and we are innocent civilians she also says addressing her remarks to Benjamin Netanyahu isn't in isn't it enough to slaughter everyone not enough Israeli civilians killed and she just ends her remarks by saying let us go back to our families now now now it's really hard to watch it's very distressing first of all for the families uh when we're hoping they have been told about this in as careful a way as possible it would at least give them a sign that their loved ones are alive um and as you say that they look healthy but it's also deeply deeply distressing and the Israeli view on these videos and what Hamas is doing with the hostages prime minister Netanyahu has called it psychological terrorism using them to pursue their War aims yes it's hard to dispute a characterization like that this is not a video recorded you know out of free will this is a a video recorded by three women who have been held for 23 days in conditions that we can only guess at we do have a little insight courtesy of the other hostages who were released who said they were being generally well treated once they got to the side not on the way not on the way that Journey from the places where they were taken to the places where they were held was clearly extremely traumatic and everything that has happened to them for the last 3 weeks has been utterly traumatic so you have to obviously take that into account when you read these words these are the words they may well reflect some of the trauma and the anger that they themselves feel feel but maybe they also reflect some of the things that they have been asked to say we just don't know but the impact of this is going to be huge it is going to add to the pressure on Mr Netanyahu to do more to get hostages out it is going to cause yet another wave of trauma in this country where wave upon wave of trauma has already been crashing on on the population you know this this story has the has the ability to do do that to us every few days and this is just going to add to that and you know there you have three three women begging begging their government to bring them home yes just deepening the trauma of so many and it's not just the families and loved ones with the hostages is there's so many in this country who themselves are torn about what has been happening Benjamin Netanyahu met some of the families he reassured them reassured the nation that Israel has two priorities he said destroying Hamas and bringing the hostages home and his view was that this this intensifying war the ground operations would help he said the only way to bring the hostages home is not that ceasefire that the women were no doubt told to say in that video given as you say the so little knowledge but by intensifying the pressure and indeed the defense minister you have Galant made exactly the same point that is the way to force Hamas into some kind of deal it was interesting when Mr Netanyahu spoke at that press conference two days ago and he did he listed those two priorities and it was in that order destroying Hamas and bringing the hostages home clearly his main priority still as far as we can make out is to destroy Hamas the you know many many people in this country are asking how can you achieve both of those is that even remotely possible and is it more likely that the more military pressure you bring to bear the more you send troops into those uh congested areas where the hostages might be being held the more air strikes are conducted over Gaza the more likely it is that actually hostages will come to harm and indeed another statement from H Hamas was this morning in response to the latest signs of the Israelis moving in on the ground was precisely that the more you do this the more you're likely to harm hostages so this is an awful awful psychological game which the Caps are playing and they are hoping still with so many cards in their hands more than 200 people that somehow this is going to have an an impact on the Israeli government so far we have seen no sign of that is there something going on behind the scenes maybe we know that many many actors including the Gulf State of Qatar are trying very very hard to orchestrate a deal in which there could be a release of hostages maybe in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails but at the moment we have no sign that any of that is is imminent this is just going to add to the the pressure and the Despair and once again the trauma surrounding all of those questions yes and that Friday night when Israel expanded its ground operations it came suddenly uh a diplomat briefed on the negotiations through the Gulf State of katar uh Express regrets saying we were so close that but said there were still some issues in dispute and of course we know those are very big issues one of them most of all that ceasefire that the women in the video today talked about and Paul just before we came on air there were reports swirling again that even now even though there had been a fear that these talks would stop that there are really crucial discour discussions going on now as we speak in Qatar focusing we believe just on the civilians yes I I think there are conversations going on everywhere there was even uh talk of Hamas officials being in Cairo the Egyptian Capital you know again part of this complex web of negotiations and discussions which continues all the time and me it may sound almost uh bizarre to to the to the audience to think that a war could be raging and conversations could still be having indirectly between the the Waring parties about the possible exchange of prisoners but these things do happen even in the midst of of wars and so we couldn't we can't exclude the fact that something of that kind may still emerge and it may be that the Hamas people who are holding those women maybe they thought that such a thing was imminent uh you know the truth of these negotiations is being held by so few people and it's only when the deal is done that anyone gets to know I suppose the one glimmer of hope that the families can hold on to is the general view that these hostages and they're being held by Hamas also Islamic Jihad and there were reports that they were in the hands of of gazin who just went and grabbed people is that they only matter if they're alive yes they want to keep them alive they want these bargaining chips as terrible as it is to say to say that and Paul you mentioned the details of it was a a a white tiled room yeah many eyes will be on these these videos most of all their families to see for signs that of distress of the health had they lost weight how did they look did they look stressed and the women had different Expressions without going into more details but was this in if it was as widely believed in one of those deep deep tunnels it was very well pointed if you can use that word it it didn't look like cave it wasn't a cave it didn't look like the kind of tunnels that we have seen evidence of in the past it didn't look it didn't look dank it didn't look Sandy it looked clean tiled white uh so I'm sure many many eyes will be pouring over that trying to see any signs there were there were no obvious signs really about the kind of place they were being held gazer is a is a small place as you know a very small place but it's also very gested place and there are many many places where you could hide civilians and we don't know you're right we don't know who is holding who I suspect that by now Hamas being the major uh group in Gaza that if anyone if anyone has was freelancing on this hostage taking probably the hostages have been gathered and maybe sort of held centrally but you know we just don't know um and could this be the Prelude to to to any more hostage releases again it's just impossible to know but it is also just impossible to ignore so agonizing so so agonizing one of the many very tragic human dimensions of this very very ugly intensifying War Paul Adams I know you'll get more information for us on this and all the other developing stories today thank you very much for joining us on BBC News and to confirm again if you've just joined us in the last hour aasa's military Wing has released another video a hostage video on it telegram Channel we are not broadcasting the video it is not BBC policy to usually broadcast the video we're not giving the identities but we've been discussing what the three women one of the women who spokes had to say we'll continue to try to get more details not just about this video but the impact on the families on Israelis and most of all on those intense and highly sensitive negotiations to bring the hostages home let's take a look at other the other top stories this hour Israel says it has expanded its ground and air operation
