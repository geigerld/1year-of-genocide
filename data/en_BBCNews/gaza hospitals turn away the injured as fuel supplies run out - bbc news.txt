the United Nations says that hospitals and other services in Gaza which is under an Israeli blockade are running out of fuel and that its Aid agency there may have to stop working tonight if it doesn't get a fresh Supply but Israel has accused Hamas designated as a terror group by the UK government of stockpiling hundreds of thousands of liters Israel has allowed limited supplies of food water and Medicine in but Charities say that vast amounts more are needed and all of this takes place amid a bitter diplomatic grow between Israel and the UN our first report tonight is from our special correspondent fergal Keen who is in Jerusalem and has been working with teams on the ground in Gaza and a warning that his report contains some distressing images each climbing Cloud a marker of Destruction Relentless air strikes thousands of bombs dropped Hamas started this war Israel responds with devastating force it is a story of stunned aftermath and desperate searching the man was away from his home when the bomb fell he speaks to his lost loved ones wish we' stayed with her BBC cameras in Gaza captured Medics collecting the wounded the man shouts Nasser his head is open speaking of the child in his arms Mahmud badawi Daily Faces The Killing inflicted from the skies but there isn't time to stop much less show his feelings from one scene of Carnage to for there are many hard situations as an ambulance driver you get a to what's happening whether it's hands heads or bodies that are cut in many families now there's the need to familiarize their children with The Morbid practicalities of life in a war zone I have seen buddies blown apart you can't identify anyone so in case anything happened and they were blown up I would know them from this bracelet and I can collect their bodies it is not knowledge any parent wants to impart in gaza's hospitals there are acute shortages struggling to keep Services going as fuel supplies dwindle 12-year-old Ahmed barahim suffers from kidney failure and he's [Music] exhausted sometimes in the heart of it all there's good news she's okay but she's scared they call out her father is being freed from the reassurance they're all out I swear the emergency workers like Mahmud are overstretched exhausted knowing that however much they do in Gaza now it cannot be enough fergal BBC News Jerusalem well the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza now says almost 6 and a half thousand people have been killed since the start of the conflict the BBC's Gaza correspondent Rashi Abu Alo has remained working there despite the condition he's in carun in southern Gaza and earlier this evening he described the situation there yeah tonight there was Heavy bombardment around this hospital this is Nas Hospital inhan units is the hospital that is the only Medical Center that's serving half of the population now and it's in the edge of catastrophic as the Director of the hospital just told me that they have shut most of the operations and only the operation room and the life saving place and facilities are working they are struggling to cope with the situation with the shortage of fuel no fuel coming to this hospital for for for about 20 days just about half an hour ago air strike this direction about 200 M from the hospital destroy the through story building about 50 people in one go they rush to this Hospital imagine doctors have to deal with 50 casualties in one go and some of them were dead some of them were severely when severely injured so I was to this operation room and I saw how they are struggling to cope with the situation and no guarantee for how long they can keep doing this without without supplies and fuel a correspondent in Gaza there Rashi Abu aloof there's also been a blistering R between Israel and the UN over comments by its Chief Antonio gutterz that the attacks by Hamas on October the 7th did not happen happen in a vacuum Israel reacted with Fury saying it would deny visas to top un officials and calling on Mr guas to resign he spoke today of being misrepresented I spoke of the Grievances of the Palestinian people and in doing so I also clearly stated and I quote that the Grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by amas end quote and this evening Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu made another public address to the nation insisting a ground Invasion will happen we are reigning Hellfire on Hamas we have already killed thousands of terrorists and this is only the beginning simultaneously we are preparing for a ground Invasion I will not elaborate on when how or how many we can speak now to our International editor Jer jemy boen who is in southern Israel for us and Jeremy what should we read into the timing of this statement by Mr Netanyahu why say this now first and foremost I think it was aimed at a domestic audience as you've just seen it was in Israeli Prime Time and he was speaking in Hebrew uh I think that he was trying to reassert to people that he's in control the one if you like new thing sort of new thing in it was the fact that he did say there would be a ground Invasion because there have been many delays people expected it to have happened or started already uh some people are even saying that Mr Netanyahu is hesitant he has a reputation for that and that he might not even go through with it well he said he's going to go through it through with it and he used very strong language and strong language as well at the United Nations uh the uh Israeli Ambassador there condemned what the Secretary General was saying and he didn't accept the clip that the sentiment in the clip that you played there that he said that he was misrepresented that the uh the Israelis effectively only took part of his statement and criticized that and not the other part of it and having read the whole thing I think I tend to agree with the Secretary General just looking at that I think right now the Israelis do not want any criticism and they've been getting it from the UN not just from the secretary Secretary General but from un agencies and it's something they don't want because their message is they are respecting international law and the UN is basically saying that they're not and at a time when they are aware that the legitimacy of what they're doing is increasingly being questioned I think that this means that they're going to continue pushing back very hard one more thing since Mr nety who's spoke there's been an awful lot of shell noise coming from Gaza which is about there's another one there I could I don't if the microphone picked it up which is about 10 kilm in that way it's really being hammered tonight and it started artillery and air strikes just about the time that Mr nety was speaking
