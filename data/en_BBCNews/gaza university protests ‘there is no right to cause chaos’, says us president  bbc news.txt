President Biden has told Pro Palestinian demonstrators they have the right to freedom of speech but not to cause chaos he was speaking in the last hour in a TV address uh after police in Los Angeles cleared a protest camp at the University of California Joe Biden said the rule of law had to be respected by those who oppose the war in Gaza well these were the scenes overnight during the police operation hundreds of officers in riot gear descended on the camp there were loud bangs and Thick Smoke as police fired flares and stun grenades dozens of students have been detained demonstrations against the war in Gaza are continuing at dozens of universities right across the United States the president warned there was no place for violence racism or hate speech in the country including on student campuses in fact peaceful progr protest is in the best tradition of how Americans respond to consequential issues but but neither are we a lawless country we are a civil society and Order must Prevail throughout our history we've often faced moments like this because we are a big diverse freethinking and freedom loving nation in moments like this there are always those who rush into to score political points but this isn't a moment for politics it's a moment for clarity so let me be clear peaceful protest in America violent protest is not protected peaceful protest is it's against the law when violence occurs destroying property is not a peaceful protest it's against the law vandalism trespassing breaking Windows shutting down campuses forcing the cancellation of classes and graduations none of this is a peaceful protest threatening people intimidating people instilling fearing people is not peaceful protest it's against the law the senent is essential to democracy but descent must never lead to disorder or to denying the rights of others so students can finish the semester and their college education that was Joe Biden speaking from the White House as say in the last hour talk to our correspondent nomia ikbal in a moment or two but let's speak first to Dolores Quintana a reporter at the Santa Monica mirror who was covering the UCLA protest welcome Dolores to the program give me an idea first of all I know you were there overnight what it was like hi um yes I have to say that um last night and I yes I was there all night until they started clearing the camp and then I had to leave because they were telling people that they would be arrested um it was a lot calmer than it was the previous night the previous night was very frightening I'll be very honest even as a reporter none of us are safe now I spoke to a democratic strategist a little earlier on the program who talked about anarchists at many of these protests you were there just give me your assessment of those people in the encampment there at UCLA well the people at the encampment and who are students they actually are uh very nice uh they're very smart they're very organized um would I call them wild anarchists not at all as a matter of fact um they were they had had a media check-in at their Camp from the very first day so they recognized the importance of you know being able to talk to the media in a a rational and uh engaging way um you know um I think there may be a thought that somehow the violence that happened last night was the fault of the pro of the protesters who were students and it absolutely was not we were listening to Joe Biden only a short time ago he concluded that news conference saying there'd be no change in his administration's policy do you think there is any chance of a change in the universities policy these protesters have been demanding that the universities divest from links with Israel is there do you get any sense there's any movement in the universities on that key demand I think that because of the violence that happened that they're going they're going to have to do an investigation because the UC police stood by and did nothing uh when reporters were being assaulted when the students of the school were being assaulted by people who clearly did not go to to UCLA um I think it might be a slow process but I also think that these students aren't going to give up and even though the the encampment has been taken down I wouldn't count them out well that's exactly my final question I was going to ask you for your sense of whether this the is this the end of the protests or just a pause do you get the sense that those protesters will be back and are those police likely to stay in largish numbers on site on campus well I think maybe in the coming days uh right now UCLA's campus is actually shut down for Thursday and Friday they are they're only doing remote classes and they've told students to stay away from Roy quad um I believe 132 students were arrested according to ABC News which is a fraction of the people who are actually in the encampment in my belief uh the the population was kind of liquid um but I don't think that's even half of the people who are actually there so um I think that you this may be a summer of protest in the United States um to try and get colleges to divest from in particular Black Rock which is a private Equity company yes that the students believe um you know basically are contributing their money is contributing to the war in Palestine and Gaza Dolores qu I have to leave it there sorry to cut across you but uh thank you so much for giving us that assessment there of those events overnight at UCLA and perhaps what we like to see in the coming weeks let's turn to our correspondent Nom ikbal our North America correspondent she's in New York of course we saw those protest at Colombia University about 36 hours ago and nomia you were listening to the president what was your assessment of what we heard from Joe Biden well I think there was some pressure on President Biden to speak out the last time we'd heard from him was April the 22nd about the campus protests and many had felt that his comments were were pretty vague but he's trying to strike a balance he said that uh people students had the right to peaceful protest but uh uh it was about the unlawfulness uh the unlawful nature of some of the protests just looking you know obviously made some notes about what he said he said that people have the right to protest but not caused chaos his point is dissent not disorder and um we understand a senior White House official had said that the president wanted to speak out this morning given what's happened uh and given the number of violent incidents over the past 48 Hours you know we've seen uh all those TS been cleared from UCLA we've seen those signs of VI those scenes of violence on the the West Coast there's been more than a thousand arrests as well so far um but you know for the president it is complicated because there are dueling domestic and uh foreign policies here um which have sort of merged into one now and he said at the end of the the conference at the end of the speech that he wasn't going to change his policy in the Middle East that's something also he's trying to balance as well uh but I think um it it he he there was pressure on him to say something thing I'm not sure that he will have pleased um both sides in what he said briefly namia our previous guest spoke about uh she anticipates a summer of protests uh that is potentially problematic for a president in the months leading up to a presidential election yes I think at best President Biden is hoping this Fizzles away and that people forget and when I do ask students uh does this affect your vote they don't want to be drawn into that um I think at worst it continues so President Biden is's already pretty much heckled at a lot of events he goes to by Pro Palestinian supporters um but yes it is we're about 6 months away from the election we'll have to see just how much this factors into uh young people's voting remember he he needs them on side he wants to build a coalition of young voters to help him secure an election victory in November norel live for us there in New York thanks very much thank you but
