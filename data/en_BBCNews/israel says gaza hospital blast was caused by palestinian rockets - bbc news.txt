you're watching continued coverage of the conflict between Israel and Gaza and at the moment we're listening into a press conference by the spokesperson of the Israel Defense Forces his putting forward his his evidence that Israel was not behind an explosion at a hospital in Gaza City let's go back and listen that's that's the logic and about the next stages of the war I will not talk about here of the next stages of the war see Jeremy B thank you very much General uh do you think that the governments of do you think that the governments uh that condemned Israel last night will believe your explanation I'm referring to Jordan Egypt Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates think all all of the countries that you mentioned uh are watching the BBC carefully and and uh looking carefully what the BBC said and I hope after our uh uh in our our aftermath that shows it was cross checked and we took the time because we didn't want to be non-reliable and we didn't want us to infect with our credibility I hope the BBC will now share this investigation and those countries will listen to the BBC and we will also share United States a more uh intimate and also United Kingdom a more intimate review so the BB BBC can show it and those countries those Arab countries that you mentioned which is very important for Israel of course from the Abra Accords and other countries who also would be threatened by Hamas Isis ideology should understand our war what Kamas Isis did on the massacre on Saturday is not nothing to do with Islam people killed babies people killed families women were raped women were raped people were beheaded this is against Islam this is against Islam any Arab country will show me a fatwa that goes with Islam this is against Islam Hamas is Isis it's not it's not a it's not a one Terror activity it's a scale Massacre of the governs of the Gaza City of Gaza which is Hamas Hamas made a scale Massacre which is a govern it's the Sovereign it's a sovereign Massacre this is why Hamas Isis we must fight it I just follow up on that um I mean you you you're essentially saying that the these Arab governments watch the BBC and made up their minds uh they came out with their statements long before I filed so I mean I'm I'm impressed you think we have so much plout in the world but to be honest they have their own sources of information which is why they moved those statements came from the highest level foreign minister and the public I guess in in the first time because people feel empathy uh with hearing that someone bombed in hospital or when they see people are dying so they go out and do uh statements and it's okay and I'm not blaming of course they being emotional I say I think and it and it sounds reasonable but now after evidence being shown and I think it it serves Hamas Hamas is a is a terror like Isis it's media and sword he wants to go to the media he wants to be viral that creates a viral imagery so after the conversation you heard when they say it's Islamic Jihad he said okay now we're going to take the benefit out of it and we're going to show the world and and they know it's going to be viral so I'm not blaming anybody to showing it I'm just trying to now fix it because we were blamed before that that when we're to speed and and to that we we're asking are you credible we're taking the time to be credible sometime the speed defects it Kesley New York Times thanks Admiral um I have some technical questions in your footage That You released last night uh some of that footage was uh uh filmed by alzer our team assessed that uh footage and uh at least one of the Munitions appears to be traveling a different direction the one that you assess in your map it's it's traveling uh northwesterly not northeasterly as your map suggests uh second of all did you fire did the IDF fire any Iron Dome interceptors or artillery Munitions at 6:59 p.m. um uh from Israel into Gaza uh thirdly can you share the intercepted audio of the Hamas members that you um just played I think that would be important for our assessment um questions I know but we haven't got much time uh Hospital officials said that smaller strikes targeted the hospital on Saturday and that they were warned by phone by Israeli officials to vacate the hospital do you have any uh response to that um and finally is there any evidence of secondary explosions okay let's start with the first thing Iron Dome we do not intercept inside Gaza okay Iron Dome we do not intercept inside Gaza this is not an iron D issue Iron Dome is used for preventing the Rockets to being hit in Israel that's the first question second question those uh uh independent videos which we showed of the failure that you mentioned are not only the force element of the check it's not we didn't base our effects on those independent videos it's extra uh so I hear what the New York Times says and it's extra uh and the uh the reports that you mentioned about telling the the hospital to be evacuate earlier days before I will check it I do not know the answer I want to give you an answer which is uncorrect and you asked about the secondary uh explosion in the in the parking lot what again what we see here in the picture and this is which this is the the most important thing aerial munition doesn't look like that aerial munition of Israel would have caused intact to the walls it would have caused the crater okay and it makes completely logic as much as we know that most of this damage was done due to the propellent existence not just the Warhead because of the short range because the launches failed so fire after land yeah because those those Rockets should have been gone far away to Israel so you have a large existence of propellant Sky News deorah H thank you very much um question please uh you said that you believe that the um the number of casualties has been inflated can you give an assessment of what you believe um that number of dead and wounded to be um and secondly regardless how um how credible the evidence is that you show that this uh explosion was not caused by an Israeli munition your enemies are going to still blame Israel and it's the fact that many Palestinian civilians have been killed since this um military operation began are you losing the information war and given how important that is is there a a potential to maybe change Tac this is you said this is going to to be officials said it's going to be a long War are you not losing it by using so much military power on Gaza while the rans there okay we'll try to answer the second question before that because I think it's it's important the information war is a hard War it's a hard enemy to win because this enemy has built his logic very very wisely using the population as a human shield Hamas pictured himself in the world as a charity organization donating money for the poor for the poor gazen of Hamas while we see all the money that came to Hamas most of it goes to tunnels goes to this scale massacred operation all the donations from many countries in the world including Europe secondly we've SE we've seen and also unra had verified it that Hamas is stealing gasoline food and also we found in Israel during the massacre the kits of the uh medical kits were unra kits used by the the terrorists we are fighting something that is hard to explain he's using the donation that you sent he's using the unra uh possessions that are meant to go to this the poor Gaz and those poor Palestinians that were hijacked by Kamas and he's using it he took all the gazoline that could have helped for desination inside the Gaza for 6 days it could have gone gas for hospitals he took it to his own infrastructure military infrastructure military the terror infrastructures that needs this gas this is who we fighting against this is who we fighting against and we have to win this information war with evidence not with false uncredible uh uh uh statements we have to win it with evidence we have no other way we must stay moral we must play Accord the international law we have no other way otherwise we won't be a Democrat liberal Country and this is what we're fighting it's a Democrat liberal country fighting any Hamas Isis controlled gazan area with Innocent civilians Palestinians that is using them as a human shield that is the event that is the event we're fighting we have to fight we cannot live next to our borders with Hamas Isis governs that will threaten our civilians and do Massacre where you rape women beheaded the bodies kidnap babies do you understand that while we speak babies are being held in Gaza women young girls that went to a music festival of being held in Gaza dead bodies are being held Gaza old people old people some of them were in the Holocaust are held now in Gaza how come you take old people how come you take babies how do you kidnap this kind of more than almost 200 people have been kidnapped how do you do this some of them are foreigners this is what we're fighting and now they're going to show videos of those hijacks they want to terrorize the family we will not be terrorized we we have our values we know what we're fighting for we know what we fighting for we fighting for our country we fighting to be with our values a moral country that is a Democrat liberal Jewish country this is who we are going to stay here like that Israeli hostages babies in Gaza and yet you're still struggling with the information War because Palestinian civilians are being killed in Israeli bombardment but isn't it time to is there another way that's what I'm asking and can you just answer that question about your assessment on the casualties please you say it was inflated the casualties is inflation we understand from intelligence and I will not we will share it with the government uh and I don't want to say the numbers here and uh This Is Not Another Round in Gaza this is not that it's something else we understand that the mask have fallen down we are living next to Isis governing Hamas State we cannot we cannot live like that in the world it's it's a world problem not just Israel problem it's a world problem this can shift away exactly like Isis it can shift away to Arab countries and it can shift away everywhere I I would say cynically that that the G should ask mamad Salah Maran Isa why why is it happening to them and if other countries in the world can make Kamas surrender with no no conditions and bring all hijacks back to Israel show us the way you do that show us the way you do that and we will do that we understand we have no other way to fight that the way we're fighting and the times I and S has already been passed on to the Americans and to other Western allies were the Americans involved in the examination deing process and did they at any point provide you with the satellite footage that they have of the no we used only our systems Manel and we will provide all this information today uh to the Americans and not just the Americans and did you get any any know corroboration from any other source outside it and the independent video we are credible with our information with our intelligence with our system there are the intelligence is credible all along the intelligence community in the in the world with the five eyes Etc this this would be very very credible information that any country will rely on and of course our footage eory the Air Force way to review things is very very credible in the world and it those things will show credible to any liberal democracy Washington Post Shir hi so thank you for this um I have a technical question about the intelligence you got uh he said it there were people speaking who said the rocket was launched from New York d so how far were those two locations that's one um number two is what is the rationale of calling the South the safe Zone if there are still some off there to what extent it's in North with Central Target right now and the south at what point you know how what is the difference between North and South in the campaign number two and number three um you are absolutely right that money has been funneled from social uh organizations to military ones um but is it you know is Israel's goal to take up Hamas completely does that mean only military leaders does that mean people who are involved in soci program uh how how extensive is that and if that is everyone does that not just mean that Hamas is there really a difference between Hamas and Gaza in that and we start with the last question I think it's the most important one there is a completely different between the Gaz and Palestinians and Hamas as a sovereign it wasn't like that all Years everybody knows that it's a completely different thing and and most of the Gaz and Palestinians are not Kamas as a sovereign military and politically but we must take the Sovereign the Govern down that's for your first question then you asked about in the beginning in the about the intelligence we understand there is a cemetery nearby the alali mahani hospital and they probably fired for from the cemetery as they mentioned theel in the conversation and they also refer to an Islamic Jihad failure which they were are using as a propaganda against Israel and if you can remind me the other question you asked um yeah the the the logic of of considering the sou Hamas is still there you're right that Hamas is all along Gaza but most of US military infrastructure governing infrastructure are in Gaza City and his area this is why we asking to go south to W Gaza okay and that is uh it's not for it's until we finish what we need to finish in uh this area where it has governing and Military and terrorizing from this area of Gaza City and its peripheral to Israel but yes we we will attack in all Gaza by intelligence and we will Attack by in international law and before that will be based on intelligence and which we will try always to minimize the casualties of civilians as Patrick yes uh this very serious incident just occur in the hospital do you think it will delay or prevent you to launch a ground operation inside Gaza if it's actually what you're planning this is a very serious incident because the civilians were casual this is why we take it seriously this is why we took our time to be credible again this is why we took our time to be credible and we didn't jump into statements so we take it very very seriously and I think the world should hold up Islamic Jihad and everybody knows who's funding Islamic Jihad Islamic Jihad is 100% funded by Iran the Rockets of Islamic Jihad are funded by Iran I repeat it Iran funds Hamas but it does 100% for Islamic Jihad Islamic Jihad caused the casualties in the hospital in Al maani Hospital the casualties are by Islamic Jihad the rocket is being funded or delivered from Iran Iran caused this death in alali madani hospital in the end of the day
