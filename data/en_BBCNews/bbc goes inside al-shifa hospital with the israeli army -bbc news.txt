Israel has promised to provide proof to back up its claim Hamas was using gaza's largest hospital as a Command Center in southern Gaza Israeli forces have started dropping leaflets in the Khan Yunis area warning people to evacuate their homes and head to shelters for their own safety similar leaflets were also dropped over Northern Gaza weeks before the ground offensive suggesting imminent military operations may be planned for the south of the country well let's get the very latest now from my colleague Mark loen who is in southern Israel for us Mark Maran thank you very much indeed well we were going to actually uh be live with you in that headline sequence but we had to dash because there was a rocket that was just fired uh just above our heads and intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system and there was a siren that went out so we just had to take cover there I'm not sure if you can see but in the distance the very large plume of smoke there where an air strike has recently hit um a sign of just how constant the threats are here as this conflict reaches almost 6 weeks well meanwhile uh the Israeli Defense Forces continue their operation inside alifa Hospital uh gaza's largest hospital and Israel has promised to provide proof of what they say is hamas's Command Center there Hamas has consistently denied the allegations of the Israeli military uh President Biden meanwhile has said that the uh us has urged Israel to act in his words with Incredible care as Israel's military operation at alifa continues one thing has been established is that Hamas does have a headquarters weapons material below this hospital and I suspect others well our correspondent Lucy Williamson was taken inside alifa hospital by the Israeli Defense Forces a little earlier she joined us from Jerusalem Israel is really coming under pressure to prove why it carried out the operation it's carrying out in Gaza and driving into Gaza last night it was clear just the scale of its military operation there parts of the city looked as if it had been hit by an earthquake buildings completely decimated roads churned up rows of Tanks moving through the streets um so I think the scale of the operation is clear but also Israel's desire to try and show the world why it's doing what it's doing it's still very tense uh they took us right into the heart of Gaza City into alifa hospital that's been the scene at least the streets around it have been the scene of some of the fiercest fighting over the past few days uh we had to go in in darkness through a hole in one of the perimeter walls and we were taken um to one specific Department the MRI department in the hospital we weren't allowed to talk to other people not to doctors not to patients we were shown uh the the items that the IDF said they had found there hidden amongst the medical equipment but as you say um the real uh the real proof that uh Israel is under such Global scrutiny for is to provide evidence of this network of tunnels beneath the hospital that's something they haven't found yet but they did say that it's very early days there's a lot of the hospital still to search and both they and the US intelligence Community believe those tunnels are there we're in an Israeli military vehicle inside the Gaza Strip now they're taking us towards Gaza City this area we're passing through an area where the ground operation first began weeks ago now and since then the Israeli Army has fought its way methodically towards Gaza City towards the gates of the shifa hospital and that's where they taking us now we're still being told to keep our lights off are we going this way the Israeli Army has been really searching through this Hospital you can see they've had to force the door of the MRI room here to get inside they've been looking for evidence of this being a Hamas base a place where Hamas planned attacks and they say that among the things they've uncovered are more than a dozen kalashnikovs grenades personal protective equipment some of it with the the military Brigade insignia on it you can see some of them here hidden under these bags of medical supplies we're also told that there have been laptops found with some information about the hostages they also found some recent files that suggest this may have been a Hamas operating base as recently as a few days ago well there's been a lot of pressure on Israel for the humanitarian cost of its operation in Gaza not least inside the shifa hospital where doctors say they're struggling to keep alive dozens of vulnerable newborn babies without enough electricity food or water but now that Israel does have control of the hospital and is carrying out the searches it's also Under Pressure to prove to give some evidence about why it's actually there Lucy Williamson with a rare Glimpse inside alifa Hospital in Gaza there well on this side of the border the Israeli police say that they have killed three suspects involved in an attack on a checkpoint in Jerusalem at least four people were shot including one who was critically injured two others suffered light injuries the police said all the injured were members of the security services
