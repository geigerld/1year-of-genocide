both Israelis and Palestinians are marking six months of War on Sunday our chief International correspondent Le duet is monitoring events for us she reports now from Southern Israel today a memorial service is being held here there's been a press conference where members loved ones of those who lost their lives here are expressing not just pain but anger asking why the Israeli Security Forces weren't here on this day to protect them saying that they still feel abandoned one of the people who did survive to tell the story was a photographer shy kind Klein whitesman binstein who has now returned to the United States but as the Rockets started being fired by Hamas he took at his camera and started filming this is some of what he and Chine veinstein joined us earlier from the US city of Denver I was at my first music festival I wasn't expecting it to end with us driving by gunmen and over corpses when what was the moment when you realized it was no longer a music festival after the Rockets began at 6:30 and they didn't stop I started to get worried that it wasn't just rockets and they went on for a while you know the Rockets began at 6:30 and we actually physically got to our car at about 7:51 in the morning so it's over an hour later and the rockets hadn't stopped and at that point I was growing increasingly more anxious and concerned about the situation um behind me as I'm speaking to you I'm at the site of the festival there's now a sea of Israeli flags of photographs um those who who died here on that day they may include some of your friends would you like to tell us about the people who were with you on that day who didn't Escape so I was with a group of eight of us total myself my cousin morai is now fiance Tamara and several mutual friends of ours Yael Ellie Barack Doras and almog and I'm very grateful to say that they all escaped but some of the people I made friends with at the festival including dor autan who was my age at the time 26 and Ron schaer were murdered and you returned to the United States and I understand that since then you have been trying to keep the memory of what happened on that day alive yes correct um Israel is still my permanent residence although now I've been away from the country the exact the same amount of time as I've lived there I moved there last April I've only been there till October I've now been away since then um and I've been going to University campuses across the country I've been to 157 different cities since November Canada the US East Coast West Coast all of the above uh sharing my photos my videos my story and just letting people know what happened to us and letting people know that even though this horrible tragic thing that occurred to cause us Terror isn't going to keep us down and how do people react to you in the stories you tell I've had a mostly positive response I've had a few instances where I've had protesters but most of the time uh very warm reception audiences from 5 to 500 people I've even had people who are prop Palestinian comes to me speak I've had Palestinian students come see me speak I've had black Israelites come see me speak people who don't know anything about what's going on who just want to hear more and many people are sympathetic and interested in in hearing what I have to say and having a very reasonable discussion and that was shy kle Feinstein who was here during those horrific events of October the 7th that day shook Israel to the core and shocked many around the world Israel's staunchest allies including the United States and Britain immediately rushed in to show very public and Powerful backing to Israel as it launched retaliatory strikes intended said the Israeli Army to destroy Hamas but 6 months on as the death toll in Gaza continues to climb and the UN says the territory is on the brink of famine there are loud calls including from Israel's staunchest friends for an immediate ceasefire for much more to be done to get desperately needed Aid into Gaza in the past few days for the first time Israel has opened the AZ Crossing in Northern Israel into Gaza it has opened the ashad port and it also says it will accelerate the capacity through Jordan will that be enough we're joined by Cindy McCain who is the executive director of the world food program welcome to BBC news thank you thank you could you please first describe to us how bad is the situation in Gaza when it comes to hunger as the UN said and as what I have said also famine is eminent in the north and and this is something that if we wait much longer we're going to go over the edge and not be able to recover from it uh that's why it is so important that we be able to get food at scale in we at WP are uh grateful that there's consideration to open the areas eras uh border point and ashdod Port we're hoping to see that happen very soon uh all of those things and more can along with the air drops along with everything else that's going on will help us get food in at scale but it can't stop uh it can no longer be a dribble of seven or eight trucks a day or seven or eight trucks a week it has to be multitudes of trucks and quickly there have been calls right up to the top of the United Nations so that while welcoming these new moves saying that all of the crossings should be open and if not that it will still be difficult to get the amounts of Aid in that are needed is that also your view that is absolutely our view uh we would like every gate open we need to get food in and get it in at scale as I we can no longer uh wait to be considered or wait to see if our drivers are cleared or wait to see if they're you know if if there's if the port if the checkpoints actually going to be open we need to get in now children are dying as we speak they are dying of hunger that's why it is so important that we do what we do best and that is take large amounts of food in and feed those who are desperately hungry as you know those who are delivering the aid also feel at risk in the wake of the killing of seven Aid workers with World Central Kitchen some agents genes suspended their operations is it do you feel it is still safe for your uh wfp staff to operate and are they still doing so well this is dangerous work no no matter how you look at it but we at WP are not going to to Halt or suspend any of our operations we continue to do the best we can to get Aid in uh again the these new openings and these new uh ports Etc we do get them to scale and get them get them operational will be of great help but we should have done it a while ago uh this is something that that uh that has has allowed uh the northern part of Gaza to Simply die and so for those of us at the UN that that work with work on humanitarian principles and and believe in delivering food and Aid uh in a principled fashion uh we feel very strongly about how how how much needs go in and why we should be in there and once again Aid workers should be safe it was unconscionable that that wck was hit it's it's a terrible situation and but but let me say there's been more Aid workers than just those that have been killed and we're sorry for all of them but we have to keep going we have to you remember that in the early months of this war you criticize what you described as the insane bureaucracy the the number of security controls that Israel has imposed that effect hold up the delivery of Aid has that improved has the process become smoother the process has become smoother yes it's still not 100% but let me say it is much better than what it was a lot of the confusion because we only had one opening at that time and it was Rafa so it wasn't just wfp trying to get in it was hundreds of other agencies trying to get Aid in and there was no real controls on it now I can say that with regards to un Aid agencies we go through Kum Shalom we try to make it up the fence road again that's why we need other openings further north so we can get our trucks in up through there and get directly to to Northern Gaza CD McCain one of the world's biggest uh Aid agencies struggling to deliver Aid to people who desperately need it in Gaza welcoming those new steps by Israel but like so many saying much more needs to be done well that's how it looks now on this day which marks the six month Mark at the Israel Gaza War we'll continue our special coverage here in across the region but now I'll hand you back to London that was LE just said well our International editor Jeremy Bowen has also been covering the war since the very start and has returned to one of the kutes in Israel that was hardest hit by the Hamas six months after the attacks it's a bit like going back into a time machine because all the damage is still here and the reason for that is that in this kibutz near Oz one in four of the population of more than 400 people was either killed or taken into Gaza which is a about a mile away the Border as hostages looking round at the damage here and hearing the stories too of what happened Hamas came in about 6:30 in the morning and they were here till early afternoon undisturbed going from house to house until the Army arrived the war's still going on that's outgoing fire from an Israeli B near here into Gaza this is now one of the the typical houses in this kibutz abandoned burnt out 6 months on it still smells of burning on the sofa over there there's some neatly folded laundry perhaps done the evening before October the 7th going around this place you can understand why Israelis believe very strongly that they're fighting a just war in Gaza of course their allies feel the same their quarrel is with the methods that Israel has been using that have cost so many innocent Palestinian lives and as for the family who lived here in this house they're dead there's also a long read by our International editor Jeremy boen on the BBC News website and app so we do encourage you to read that as well
