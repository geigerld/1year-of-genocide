people are living in the ruins in Gaza the Israelis insist that they hit Hamas targets who use civilians as human Shields America said it had sent Israel another reminder that Hamas are legitimate military targets and civilians are not in Gaza the UN fears civil order is breaking down its food warehouses in the South were looted the desperation comes from Israel's Siege which the UN says violates the laws of war because it's a collective punishment of civilians thousands of people ransack the warehouses Israel says there's no food shortage in Gaza he's saying we have no flour no water not even toilets our houses were destroyed no one cares about us we appeal to the people of the world the big powers are against us we need Aid we wouldn't have done this if we weren't in need we need fresh water we need food we are starving this is totally unfair our children can't sleep further north in Gaza City after patients and staff refused Israel's order to evacuate Al's Hospital the wards filled with smoke as building nearby were hit only a few miles away in stot the closest Israeli town to Gaza a sense of grim determination has replaced the Panic of the first few days after the Hamas attacks a Al Haj strat's head of security said his nephew and some of his team were killed by Hamas a visiting General nimod alone was greeted like a man back from the dead on the 7th of October Hamas made the false claim that they captured alone and taken him into Gaza ASP said they were all still trying to process the horror of what happened the security Chief took me on a tour of sto's defenses Hamas he said had hit them hard the equation had to change and if Palestinian civilians suffered it was not Israel's fault we allowed them to come work in Israel and we thought this would help the Ordinary People of Gaza we thought a good economy would bring some peace but now we know that only security brings peace but after 20 rounds of war with Kamas and Islamic Jihad this needs to be a story that ends here our eyes were closed he said and we lost everything Israel's dead are still being identified hash says he can't face any more funerals night and day Israel's groundw to destroy herass gather Pace it is reverberating around the region the risks of a wider Middle East War remain Jeremy boen BBC News in southern Israel we're live now to speak to tamaso DEA longa from the Red Cross joining us from Geneva thank you and welcome to the program um first off I wonder if you could just confirm whether you've been able to we have had that Communications uh blackout for a time over the weekend have you reestablished Communications with your team on the ground yeah good morning thanks for having me today yes we established communication uh yesterday early in the morning around 4:00 a.m. hour time uh but still is not a stable communication and is still a challenge to talk with teams uh uh in in the Gaza STP the most worrying part of the communication blackout was that people were not able to reach the Emergency Medical Service to call the ambulance so what we heard from pales colleagues is that they mainly they were mainly foll the noise of bombardment to arrive in the area and and try to find injured people which of course is pretty risky and once they had located those injured who needed your help um what resources do you have to hand they adequate not at all I mean the resources are absolutely limited and running out I would say minute after minute I mean we saw it in our Hospital the alud hospital in Gaza City but also in the other health facilities the the stories are um telling us that shelves are empty medical equipments are not anymore there and then we don't have to forget the stress on the medical personnel they are working 24/7 in the the last more than two weeks uh without any shift and also being affected themselves what can you tell us about aluts hospital aluts hospital is uh fully crowded of patients injured and more than 10,000 people who sought a refuge in the hospital because they thought that was the safest place where to stay in Gaza City the situation of course is out of control in the sense that it's a it's a heal structure where people are living in the corridors in the stairs outside and inside plus 500 patients that are receiving a life saving care talking about intensive care units babies in incubators people who need oxygen and now the the the the issue are mainly two one is the evacuation order that arrived yesterday which we are deeply concerned about because with this situation there is no possibility to evacuate patient and then second lack of medical equipment but also lack of fuel electricity will run out soon and in palest and colleagues already cut air conditioning the lift and other part of the of the of the building doesn't get any more electricity to save a fuel but of course this is a situation that sooner or later will arrive at the end and of course this is so what does the Red Cross make of um Israel um saying that there will need to be an evacuation of Al cuds what's your position the organization's position on that warning well I mean we were clear yesterday this is not possible this is not possible hospitals must be protected in any condition and no nurse no doctor no patient should risk to die in a in a bed of a hospital and then also this is The Impossible dilemma that no doctor or nurses should face leave the hospital to seek safety but leaving their patients behind or stay in the hospital are risking their lives palesa and teams said it clearly they will stay with their patients uh tomasa obviously you're in Geneva but I'm assuming you speak to your volunteers and your staff have they ever reported any intimidation from um members of Hamas in organizations or in buildings such as hospitals have they encountered that to my knowledge I never heard about these stories so what is going to be your position next in terms of um those bombardments have come closer and closer to um your hospital well aloud's hospital and asifa Hospital what's going to happen next what have you got in place well I mean what we are doing of course is calling on all the parties and having a bilateral conversation with different stakeholders to avoid that hospitals will become a Target so to protect as much as possible the hospital and we are strengthening all our efforts to get humanitarian Aid in from the southern border then of course we do hope that these two I mean the combination between the two so let's say diplomacy in closed door condition and bringing humanitarian inside the Gaza STP will help our colleagues in the hospital and around the Gaza strep now we understand that there were some 33 36 possibly trucks that were allowed into uh the Gaza Strip there is the hope that there will be more coming in 12 trucks I understand were carrying medical supplies medican on Frontier has said that they've sent 26 tons of medical supplies to Egypt hoping to get those into Gaza how closely do you coordinate with uh those trucks coming in well I mean the coordination is made logistically Wise by the Egyptian reccent on the Egyptian side and Palestine reccent together with the UN on the Palestine side the problem here is that these tracks and this humanitarian needs to enter 24/7 in the Rafa border through the ra a border we need to have a continuous flow of humanitarian Aid 10 trucks a day 30 trucks another day are just drops in the ocean and this is why we are really calling on all the parties to make this sustainable in the mid and long term but also to create a safe humanitarian space inside the Gaza Strip to do our work we need safety and civilians need safety to get the humanitarian Aid that they much needed okay toas Del Longo of the Red Cross speaking to us today from Geneva thank you very much indeed thank you
