and let's return now to the Middle East where concerns are growing about an allout war after 12 children and teenagers were killed at the weekend when a rocket fell on a football field in the Israeli occupied goolan Heights the attack LED Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to return early from the United States to meet his cabinet which has authorized him and his defense minister to decide when and how to retaliate and we're just seeing that Benjamin Netanyahu has visited the site of that rocket attack in the goolan Heights we're just uh hearing that well let's talk now about this situation with ha helier he's non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace thank you very much for joining us and just give us a sense in your view uh as to how quickly this situation could escalate and of course that is a big fear that this could escalate into an allout regional conflict so thank you for having me on your program uh I think the reality is is that for the past 10 months there's been the concern that the law of unintended consequences could lead the region into a fullscale regional war and uh for at many points over the past 10 months I think you've seen different actors be very Reckless um in retaliating against one another but also underestimating how possible it is to actually do quote unquote calculated escalations um the Israelis have made it very clear they are going to strike Lebanon um it will be soon um I wouldn't be surprised if it was in the coming few hours but it will be soon and at the same time they do not want a regional War because it's one that they're not prepared for so they will retaliate um or they will claim that this is retaliation because we still don't know exactly what happened um in the goolan Heights um but we do know that Israel will respond and the question will be can they respond in a way that isn't going to Tumble out of control in terms of consequences and reprisals from hisb um and I don't think we can be sure of that I don't know what they have in mind or what's planned um but I do think it's an incredibly risky step that they are planning to undertake as I said very shortly you were saying it is very difficult to have a calculated escalation because of that law of un unintended consequences you can never be entirely sure what one action may lead to um for for our viewers if you would just tell us a little bit more about the background to the goolan heights its strategic significance and and the reason for the the whole contentiousness around this this part of the the region so the Golan Heights is occupied Syrian territory um Israel invaded it in 1967 and has occupied it ever since and uh declared it annexed some years later um I will say that more or less the entirety of the International Community recognizes it as occupied territory um and I'm glad that the BBC continues to refer to it as the occupied Goan Heights because indeed it is as occupied territory as Gaza as the West Bank as East Jerusalem and the Sinai Peninsula until the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel um all of these were territories that were taken in 1967 um it frankly doesn't serve at the moment a quote unquote Strategic Benefit I mean we've moved beyond that due to the advances in technology and so on um there are um quite long-standing concerns around water and you know connection to Water Supplies but you know this is all an inheritance from the 1967 war you still have of course a large Drew mainly Drew population in the Golan Heights and they maintain quite strong connections to their Syrian identity um and it's also very peculiar to see how uh how his baah would have targeted them um there is an Israeli military installation in the Golan Heights so it may they aimed at that sorry to uh bring you to uh the end of your your thought there but we are out of time HJ helier from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace thank you very much
