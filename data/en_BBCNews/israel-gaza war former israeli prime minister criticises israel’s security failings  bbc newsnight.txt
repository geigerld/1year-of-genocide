first of all the prime minister of course there was a military failure and mil and intelligence failure of the military intelligence the Secret Service intelligence but the strategy was netan and netan alone based on on my personal experience but also on what netan said for years there is one person who is in charge of everything at the end of the day he decides in order to protect his status personally and to defend himself against the legal process which is was taking place already he needed to change the judicial system and that's what he was trying to do of course the government was shaking and the only basis of support for him stable were the Messianic groups so there was this Alliance that was based on corruption and on the abuse of the powers of the state and the resources of the state to protect the personal status of the Prime Minister and it also led to a huge number of forces being withdrawn from Gaza and taken to the West Bank part of it was part of the part of of the process part of the process was to to to respond to their demands at the expense of others and this was just one aspect of it not the only one billions and billions and billions of uh of uh shekels uh were spent in order to buy their support coming now to the future of the West Bank and the future of Gaza we saw prime minister Netanyahu a couple of days ago say that he thinks there's got to be an ongoing security involvement B can speak as much as he wants about taking control of all of this this is nonsense he had a security responsibility for Gaza until the 7th of October what did he do with it he completely failed I mean this is not new we always had security IR responsibility of course we do we need to be inside Gaza in the shift hospital or in kanun in order to take control of security no we just had to protect the Border in a more effective manner which we didn't and so after destroying Hamas we can return immediately back into the international border which is recognized by the International Community which is not even claimed by the Palestinians to be theirs and then we also have to offer a political Horizon and the only political Horizon is a two State solution so had I been the prime minister of Israel now that what I would have done I would have come to the Americans and Europeans and say hey guys you send your intervention Force into Gaza for a short period of time they will allow eventually the Palestinian Authority to take over not from the Israeli bayet but from the noninvolved Western power that will try and help rehabilitate start rehabilitate Gaza this is the end game now of course you would ask me will BB this government make a statement that they are prepared for a two-state solution no way they're not going to do it that's another reason why they have to be kicked out today would that solution for in the West Bank would that involve the removal of many of the new SS that have been built yes how would that be achieved will be imposed by strong government and I think that it can be done my proposal which by the way lies on the table of Abu masin as of two months ago the plan that I have that I have submitted to him that is broadly speaking I think is acceptable to them which they should have accepted 15 years ago but they didn't have the vision and the courage but anyway would you not face an extremely dangerous backlash to this violent backlash we will we will we have to save the state of Israel would it not risk destroying the state of Israel maybe but I trust that the overwhelming majority of people in this country all of the groups that make up the power the strengths the sophistication the progress the culture the achievements of this country will be on this side it will be a decisive process for what Israel is all about but anything else will be much worse because if we will not pull out from the territories if we will not separate from the Palestinians we will not help them create their own State independent state if they will not be allowed to exercise their fundamental right for self-determination then Israel will become a bational state that will forever live with internal conflicts and frictions and Terror and hatred and whatnot and SE segregation and and second class segregation second class citizens which is what bang and smri and the supporters want but we will not allow it because we have a different self image of who we are as human beings and we'll never allow it
