now to the Middle East and Palestinians have begun marking rabadan the Islamic month of fasting while Fierce battles continue between Israeli forces at Hamas fighters in Gaza Let's cross live to Jerusalem and join my colleague Anna Foster Anna Samantha thank you good morning welcome to uh Damascus gate in the city walls here in East Jerusalem where people uh have begun marking the first day of Ramadan you can see people moving around this is one of the places that in East Jerusalem that Palestinians often come at this time of year but of course many because humanitarian ceasefire could be reached by the beginning of Ramadan but that hasn't happened even though channels of communication still remain open and this is of course the holiest month in the Islamic calendar it's where Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset normally of course breaking that fast with an ifar meal at the end of the day but in Gaza it's going to be a very different Ramadan this time round the United Nations have warned of potential Mass starvation there they say that 25% of the population are at risk of mass starvation at the moment and they say the Hamas ran Health Ministry in Gaza says that 23 people have died so far of malnutrition and they say that the majority of those are children now I just want to show you these pictures from Al Moi in eastern Gaza and this was people last night marking uh trying to Mark at least as best they could the beginning of uh Ramadan you can see the little traditional lanterns there singing their songs and really doing what they could to mark this holy time during a time of War we forc every Ramadan and we put up decorations five or six days before it starts we used to be able to get cheese and dairy and filled our fridges with food for the sunset ifar and the sunrise ofo meals with meat but now we can't even break our fast with a can of peas or beans since we can't find any in the first place with thanks to God even with our empty bellies we will Fast to satisfy our Lord we talked about the fighting still continuing and the fact that that humanitarian ceasefire has not been achieved by now and in fact even just in the last day or two we've seen the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responding to comments found invasion of Rafa right at the southern end of the strip where more than a million Palestinians are now Sheltering and Mr Netanyahu said that that that Invasion would still happen uh he didn't give a Time achieve Israel's stated aim his stated aim of trying to remove Hamas fully from Gaza there's also an aid ship that's uh on the way now again we've talked in the last few days about attempts to try and get Aid into Gaza by sea there's a ship in Cyprus which is due to inaugurate this new Maritime Aid Corridor between Cyprus and Gaza which has been established by by the EU the UK us and others that ship still in ports in lanica in Cypress at the moment it's been loaded over the last few days we were told it was due to set off over the weekend but seems to have uh met delays and is still in Port at the moment but let's talk a little more about those attempts to get that badly needed Aid to civilians in Gaza who need it I'm joined by Dr Sarah you for joining us here on BBC News what's your assessment of the way that is getting into Gaza at the moment clearly not enough how could and should it be more efficient absolutely we are far from enough eight so eight agencies estimate that we would need about 600 trucks a day to cross into Gaza for sufficient supplies in February it was about 100 trucks a day so very very far from what is needed for food medical items but also shelter items tents tarps and so on so there is very very high need and we've seen different attempts now to meet this need we've seen some air drops first from the Jordanian Air Force but now also the American Air Force those look good yes absolutely and they are obviously helping but they are very very small volume if you're comparing it to what is actually needed so bringing in 8 by C sounds great because that vessel that's currently in Cyprus is carrying about 200 tons of materials so that would be very much needed but it is also then plagued with the same issues of onward transport a okay you're docking that ship somewhere but how is the aid actually going to reach people and that is a much larger issue it's interesting what you were saying there just little things I noticed you're saying about things that look good or sound great but don't necessarily provide the volume of Aid needed seemingly the best way to do that is to go back to the way that things were before the war and to allow Aid in by road but just remind us why that isn't happening definitely bringing in by road is the most efficient way of doing this but at the moment we only have two border crossings that are open both in the south of Gaza and they are quite Limited in what is being let through you need to have permission to bring Goods across and for some Goods that permission is being with help from with the uh by the Israeli authorities and of course it's then also a question of getting it across there's lots of checks on the goods and then also the distribution within Gaza has been very difficult because of course the infrastructure has been being destroyed the people are not there Communications are very very difficult internet availability in Gaza is quite touch and go it's not there very often and it is very very dangerous situation as well we saw that a little while ago with people being shot who were receiving aid it is an extremely difficult environment to try and distribute Aid in Road would be best and Road will be the onward transportation for no matter how we get eight into Gaza but it is extremely challenging at the moment [Music] we've heard uh world leaders pushing repeatedly for what they call a humanitarian ceasefire how would that change the picture on the ground in terms of actually getting that Aid in the ability to travel more freely within Gaza and to be able to access areas and not be shot at that will of course be a huge difference and it also makes difference to people receiving the aid if they are able to go towards where convoys are going without fear of being at the receiving end of air strikes of bullets so it would make a huge difference here to have the ceasefire also to just be able to access different areas of Gaza it's been very very difficult to get anything into the north of Gaza so that's been a real big worry for eight agencies the south of Gaza is also very difficult because so many people are compacted into a very very small area so it's quite difficult to reach them and to make sure that it's not just a strongest people who are getting aid but everybody who needs it can receive it so a ceasefire would help immens ly to get Aid to people who so desperately need it Dr Sarah shling thank you for joining is appreciate your time here on BBC News it is a a beautiful morning here in East Jerusalem very peaceful at the moment different scenes to some of the videos we uh started to see circulating on social media last night inside the old city there and the uh the the channels that lead towards the alaxa mosque compound we saw some scuffles between security forces and and younger Palestinians who were trying to get in there to to pray uh much more to come from here in East Jerusalem uh throughout the day here on BBC News but for now it's back to samanther in London Anna thank you
