well qatar's prime minister has spoken to reporters in Doha about the prospect of a deal to release some hostages it's not really about you know a specific thing that you know I can comment yes or no about it but it's uh the challenges that remains in in the negotiations are very minor compared to the bigger CH challenges they are more logistical they are more practical and I believe that uh with the willingness of both parties to engage and to have this deal uh moving we can we can reach there we are uh we've been focused in the past four five weeks now in in in these negotiations we've been we tried every way all possible ways in order to ensure uh uh that civilians uh are released and we treat all human beings are the same civilians are civilians whether they are from the Israeli side or the Palestinian side as as we mentioned in in in several occasions uh our focus is to make sure that there relas is happening safely and there are also the humanitarian issues of the Gaza STP to be addressed in in that that was qatar's prime minister there well I'm joined now in the studio by our Middle East Sebastian user Sebastian tell us more about what's been said about a potential hostage deal what we were hearing there from a prime minister who also serves as their foreign minister is more upbeat than we've heard for several days in public at least about what's going on and he's saying that the challenges that remain about trying to get this deal done and this is only a partial deal remember this is not a deal obviously for the full number of hostages to be released but that they are now they're logistical they're practical details they're very minor I mean in such a sensitive deal as this even logistical and practical details I would suggest could still be a major BL block what he's saying I think also the timing of it is interesting we had a Washington Post article uh just uh in the past 24 hours suggesting that a deal is almost done uh that essentially the um the way that it will be managed would be 50 hostages for his women and children would be released and in return Israel would uh provide a 5day ceasefire now in previous um leaks that we've had about what a deal might be with the Qatari Med iation this is Hamas Israel and the us all very much involved in this had been I think for a lesser amount of time for the ceasefire 3 days I think was a previous and also Hamas had been demanding that there would be an exchange of prisoners that Israel had as well Palestinian women and Palestinian children that doesn't seem to be the case at the moment so I mean he didn't say that it's imminent he didn't say you know expect news of this in the next day or two but I think you know this all looks for choreography looks even after white house uh denial essentially saying that there's no deal that's actually been done yet but they're working towards it and the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu also in a sense talking it down I think we are inevitably moving towards this I think everything kind of is merging to make this seem the likeliest option within the next days next weeks okay Sebastian thank you very much
