and welcome to today's verified live we start in Washington where Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is preparing to address the joint houses of Congress in a few hours time amid protests over his handling of the war in Gaza on his first trip since the devastating attack by Hamas on October the 7th Mr Netanyahu has said that he'll be seeking to consolidate bipartisan support for Israel but several us lawmakers have said they won't attend in a statement the number two ranking Democrat in the Senate Durban said I will stand by Israel but I will not stand and cheer its current prime minister we protest against Mr netanyahu's visit started last night hundreds of Jewish demonstrators saging a sit in at the capital to protest against the war in Gaza those people were later removed by police so let's go back live to Capitol Hill live to Katrina Perry who is there for us and uh we've seen more and more protesters Gathering quite close to where you are I know you're going to talk to Tom bitman our correspondent who's among them in a moment or two so aside from all of that tell me a little more about the raw politics of what we're going to get a little later in Congress well this is a very divisive issue here in the US obviously President Biden standing so strongly and so squarely beside prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu over these past months since those October 7th attacks but his support is not universally welcomed not even within his own party where there isn't Unity somewhere between 30 and 50 Democratic lawmakers will boycott this speech today you mentioned dick Durban well the only Democrat that's senior to him is Chuck Schumer he has said he will be there but very many of his colleagues won't many of them holding counter events rallies and joining the protests themselves um opposed to how prime minister nanah who is handling this and there are those who are protesting because they want a stronger position in terms of getting the hostages home and those who are protesting because they are want more done for the Palestinian people in Gaza making the point to President Biden that he will he should tell prime minister netan Yahoo that the war is against Hamas and not the Palestinian people a twin question here because after the events of Sunday is there likely to be much greater behind the scenes pressure to get Benjamin Netanyahu to sign up to that ceasefire deal and a broader thought too because right at the start October the 7th America absolutely in lock step with Israel there's been a subtle shift the longer this war has gone on the way that Israel has executed the war with increasing concern just tell me about both those elements indeed well firstly President Biden obviously not seeking reelection that changes the calculation for him personally and how he will now approach his relationship with prime minister Netanyahu who he will meet at the White House tomorrow it now becomes even more personal than it ever was for Joe Biden he has a legacy that he needs to protect now he has only a couple of months left as president he doesn't want to be seen as a lame duck president and this is absolutely one of the goals that he would like to deliver upon before he leaves office in January a proud Zionist he's spent so much of his career standing close to Israel and particular with prime minister Netanyahu but we have seen that relationship change and shift in recent months here in the aftermath of October 7th President Biden obviously traveling to Israel that Embrace with Netanyahu there and I can tell you here in the US there was almost zero coverage of what was actually happening in Gaza the ground swell of support was very much towards Israel that has shifted over the past months and now there is a a growing and significant public anger in this country of what is happening in Gaza and the death toll and the continuing horrific humanitarian crisis so we're seeing protesters here today who are coming for a whole variety of reasons and we can cross over now to my colleague correspondent Tom baitman who is down behind me somewhere here in the middle of the protest Tom can you describe the scene for us where you are blood is on yeah I mean we got here about half an hour ago and in that time many many more protesters have arrived speeches from the stage just getting underway in the last 10 minutes one speaker talking about tens of thousands of people killed he said by Benjamin Netanyahu what the protesters say they want to do here is carry out they say a citizens arrest against Benjamin Netanyahu now clearly uh they're not going to be able to get anywhere near him if you look this way you can see uh the Dome of the capital building in the distance here I just took a walk up the path here there are at this point you know huge barricades dozens of police they've tried to put effectively a ring of Steel around the capital building uh there was a van pulling up uh just as I walked up there and boxes of cuffs those plastic cuffs to Cuff people being pulled out so already I think they're anticipating the possibility or the potential um for trouble here later but at the moment as you can see things are extremely calm and people peacefully protesting um the organizers talked about wanting to get tens of thousands of people to come to Washington today certainly buses were being laid on uh from cities all over the East Coast so the potential for a very very large turnout as people try to make their voices heard but crucially you know as they get to the heart of American democracy here their path is going to be blocked as we get into the hours towards Mr netanyahu's speech and Tom talk to us a little bit about the people who are already there what are they saying to you about the reason for coming here today to protest while the prime minister is speaking well overwhelmingly at this protest and others you know they've had recently that we've covered um people talk about wanting to protest against Israel's military offensive in Goda and the scale of uh the uh numbers of civilians killed by the Israeli offensive uh fundamentally one of the first reasons that's often quoted many of the banners here are also about US military aid for Israel that's an absolutely fundamental issue not just in the protest outside but of course Katrina as you were mentioning the many Democrats it seems that will boyot the speech by Benjamin Netanyahu um the Israel receiv received $3.8 billion worth of US military assistance per year historically cumulatively recipient of American military aid historically and that has been one of the fundamental grievances particularly among Democrats that they have tried to push Joe Biden to change stack on to change c um and there's only been that one moment where a consignment of 2,000 bombs were held back um by the Americans to the Israelis the administration said at that point that that was over the fact that they had such a huge imp in densely built areas in Gaza now some of that Consignment the 500b bombs were since allowed to flow again but that key point that relationship of military assistance has not budged under Joe Biden although he himself has talked about indiscriminate bombing by the Israelis in Gaza but he has very much been frustrated ex exasperated by his inability to cajo Benjamin Netanyahu to switch course fundamentally over humanarian crisis inaz Li okay Tom thanks for that it is obviously very loud where you are so thanks for for bringing us that we will speak to you a little later on prime minister netanyahu's speech will take place here behind me at the capital just a couple of hours from now and he is expected to use that speech to speak to a number of audiences obviously the domestic audience here in the US and the lawmakers who ultimately have control over various funding votes of support Military Support to Israel but he's also going to be addressing the domestic audience back in Israel before he boarded the plane to fly here earlier in the week he himself was subject to many protests in Israel it's the first time he's left the country since those October 7th attacks and there is a ground swell of public feeling there um against the what the prime minister is doing to get those hostages back to Israel who continue to be held by Hamas in Gaza
