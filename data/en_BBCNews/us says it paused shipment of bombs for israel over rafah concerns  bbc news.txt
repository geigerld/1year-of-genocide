hello I'm Lewis for Jones welcome to the program Washington says it paused a shipment of bombs to Israel last week over fears they might be used in an assault on Rafa more than a million Palestinian refugees are Sheltering in the city in the south of Gaza Israel says it will deepen its attacks on Rafa until Hamas is eliminated or the first of the remaining hostages are released the defense minister said Israel was ready to make compromises to secure their return but insisted that Hamas only responded to force Israel has sent a delegation to Cairo to resume negotiations and Hamas says the talks will be the last chance for hostage release Israeli forces went into raffer on Monday night in defiance of international pressure seizing the border crossing with Egypt the UN Secretary General Antonio GES has warned that a full-scale assault on Rafa would cause a humanitarian nightmare qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called for international intervention to prevent the city from being invaded live now to Jerusalem and our correspondent yolan Nell is there hi yolan just bring us up to date with the latest well when it comes to this uh us shipment that's been paed that's really getting a lot of attention in the Israeli media this morning uh this is a senior us Administration official who's been speaking to journalists on condition of anonymity really because this is such a sensitive subject and it's understood that this shipment that was stop last week included uh some of the 2,000 bombs really big bombs uh the US has been sending over to Israel it's the first time that we've heard that a shipment has been stopped like this certainly uh since the start of the War uh 7 months ago the US has publicly been restating its Ironclad support of Israel but we know there have been these uh constant worries from the Biden Administration that Israel could go for a fullscale assault of Rafa against its um advice um because the US has really been pushing for much more sort of limited options to go after Hamas in gaza's Southernmost city and the concern would have been really that the the size of some of these bombs could have had a devastating effect in a place that is just so crowded with displaced people issue of Aid what is the latest with Crossings and getting in so we've had uh in the past day or so humanitarian agencies the UN coming out uh really expressing concerns about what could happen as a result of Israel's uh military offensive in Rafa which it says is limited but it has resulted in the Rafa Crossing uh between Gaza and Egypt uh being completely closed for supplies coming in there and this after the Kem Shalom Crossing was closed on Sunday because of what Israel said was Hamas rocket Fire coming from Rafa which killed at least for Israeli soldiers and wounded others who were close to that Crossing and now the White House had said that President Biden had specifically asked for that Crossing uh to be reopened it's a main artery for Aid that goes into Gaza still and we're hearing that that is now a reopening for the security checks that Israel demands are carried out um before the the lorries uh could pass into Gaza uh carrying their desperately needed Aid and your land just last where are we on the ceasefire talks we've not had any update on the ceasefire talks but we know that in Cairo you now have alongside the Egyptian and Kat mediators and the US team that's there as well Hamas and Israel um with their delegations for these indirect talks now Israel has really sent a lower level uh negotiating team with quite a limited mandate basically it says to see if uh it can get anything out of these talks we were told that there were some specific areas of difference um after Hamas came out saying it accepted this uh three-stage plan for ceasefire and hostage release I mean some of the differences seem quite easy to overcome uh there things like um specifying that um the first group of Israeli hostages some 33 of them that are released should all be those who are still alive we know that there are also some dead bodies more than 30 um that are held in Gaza um on top of that things like wanting um Israeli women soldiers to be returned home more quickly than this plan laid out but the really fundamental difference remains there about you know the plan for an end to the war because ultimately in the document that has been seen uh by journalists that's been leaked out to the media it talks about um a return to sustainable calm a permanent um halt cessation of military and hostile acts and that is really problematic for Israel it went into this war saying that it wanted to dismantle Hamas in Gaza that it wanted to stop it having any military capabilities and stop it coming back to Power and in the background here you have this problem that there has been no real post-war vision for Gaza um that has been agreed uh for something that is viable as an alternative to Hamas being inow there um you know other Palestinian bodies coming in and at the moment that really looks like the very very difficult part um of the ceasefire negotiations for the mediators to try to overcome yolan thank you for that
