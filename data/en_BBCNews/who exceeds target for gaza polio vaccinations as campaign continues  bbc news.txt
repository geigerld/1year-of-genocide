in more positive news from Gaza the World Health Organization says it is ahead of its targets for polio vaccinations day three of a mass campaign and so far has inoculated about a quarter of the children under the age of 10 the program began over the weekend it will take place in three locations Gaza City Rafa and then in the north of the strip with localized ceasefires being arranged Dr harinda Silva is a doctor working for UK Med it's a one of the UK's medical NOS he's in Gaza and he's been deeply involved with the polio vac program thank you very much for coming on I mean we've been talking about the challenge of reaching traumatized children getting them to come forward with their families are you encouraged actually by the progress you've made in in recent days I I am very encouraged actually and it's very surprising with how the health system is set up here in terms of the destruction of Water Sanitation hygiene Etc and the ability to move freely over the past three days we've vaccinated 1600 children and it's going fantastically well I'm hoping tomorrow is our last day here at our type one clinic and we'll have more children vaccinated by the end of that day I'm looking at these pictures of the children coming forward when you see them face to face how do they appear to you how do they present so it's a range of things um unfortunately most of the children here are malnourished um very thin some are stunted depending on the age they are and again it's just the look of destitution as well which is quite shocking and tragic when you see it when you see children up close and and most of the children that we see have skin conditions uh unfortunately because of the destruction of Water Sanitation hygiene so we're looking at cases of Scabies very bad impo and fungal infections as well the work you're doing obviously relies on this8 hour pause in the fighting uh in the specific areas where you're working has it been strictly observed so what we've seen at the two um field hospitals that UK Med runs our operations have been working as normal and uh for us so we're very grateful that we're able to get the football in being able to send our community engagement team out to bring children and uh speak to the families and get them to bring their children to the vaccination Center that we're running at the moment 2.8 million people in Gaza um anyone of any age unvaccinated can contract the disease are you satisfied that the wider population is protected it's it's very difficult to see there was always before um this conflict started it was vaccination acceptance so um there was 99% and the uh population has dropped down to 89% and obviously with the unvaccinated population who have been born throughout this conflict that's and the younger children I'm hoping that the 95% vaccine coverage that's needed to prevent spread of the polio virus will be met Dr harena Silva it's great work that you're doing thank you for coming on and do stay safe thank you bye
