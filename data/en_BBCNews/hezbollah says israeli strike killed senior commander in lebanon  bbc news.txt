now let's turn to the Middle East where Hamas says it sent new ideas to qari and Egyptian mediators aimed at ending nearly nine months of war in Gaza with Israel Israel confirmed its evaluating what it described as Hamas comments on a ceasefire and hostage deal meanwhile the Israeli military says it's killed a commander of Hezbollah in Lebanon in an air strike these images were sent to us by the news agency AFP which says that they were posted online at that they show the after Marth of the strike Muhammad niman NASA is one of the most senior Hezbollah figures to have been killed in nearly 9 months of crossborder clashes meanwhile Israel has also approved plans for what is being described as the biggest potential expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank in more than three decades Israeli officials have not publicly commented on the latest seizure of 12.7 square kmers of land which comes amid heightened tensions with Palestinians because of the Gaza War well earlier our Middle East correspondent yoland Nell told us what more more about the deal well this has come after weeks of very little public diplomacy um Hamas saying that it gave its response to Kat and Egyptian mediators it's saying there's um the Turkish uh involvement now in this as well um and it says it's responded in a positive spirit to the deal that's on the table that's basically the three-phase plan that was outlined by President Biden back on the 31st of May that the US has been uh pushing for very quickly we had a a response from the Israeli Prime Minister's office acknowledging that it had got those Hamas comments um and along with the mosad intelligence service which is really leading the negotiations um those were being looked at they were being evaluated and in the Israeli media this morning um there are some guardedly optimistic comments with um well-informed sources being quoted as saying that there is something here to work with so potentially some movement but surely this this concept of expanding the settlements in the West Bank that'll take it a step back won't it I mean certainly that will be seen as being a provocative uh move by Hamas um but when you look at what's been happening um on the ground in Gaza I mean really the key demands of Hamas the main sticking points that we've seen when it comes to trying to get a new ceasefire deal that will also see the release of the remaining 120 hostages uh believed to be held in Gaza some of those uh now said to be dead um what's really the main sticking point Hamas is demanding that it wants a full end to the war as part of any deal it wants a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip um and then Israel has been saying that as much as it's ready to come up with a truce to release its hostages it wants to be able to continue uh fighting on in Gaza to continue the war until it has destroyed hamas's governing capabilities and its military capabilities there so that the ceasefire and hostage release deal um really is very much about what's happening in the Gaza Strip but what's happening in the West Bank there have been these repeated warnings that that could open up a new uh front uh in the war if the situation uh in the West Bank deteriorates further and also of course as you were referencing before um this real concern Le internationally now that there could be a much more uh dangerous war that develops between Israel and the powerful Lebanese armed group Hezbollah in Lebanon yes and just on that just tell us more about what we know about the the death of this leader Muhammad niman NASA your land well he's the latest um quite senior figure to be killed um and it has been over the last few weeks that we have seen a real intensification in the barrages of rocket the numbers of attack drones are being sent across the border uh by Hezbollah and Israel responding with retaliatory strikes including going after um some you know Hezbollah Fighters but also some more senior figures within the group there have been these attempts we've heard about the the US um Envoy who's come to the region trying to add diplomatic efforts in the past weeks talking now to the French also about trying to calm things down diplomatically what Israel is really demanding is that Hezbollah should be pushed back uh from uh the Border uh its border with Lebanon that there should ultimately be some kind of deal to decide uh on the actual final border between the two countries as well and what Israel Le wants is for tens of thousands of its citizens to be allowed to go back to their homes they've really been uh displaced by this fighting that started on the 7th of October um as the war in Gaza began with Hezbollah saying specifically that it was trying to draw away uh is isi military resources uh from the war in Gaza that that was its way of supporting its Ally there Hamas you land n there live talking to me from Jerusalem around the world and
