take you back to Gaza now there's been Fierce fighting around hanun the IDF saying they have encircled the city in the south of Gaza but also we understand there is fighting around some of the hospitals there that are there so let's take you to Gaza we can speak to Leo caner as the head of mission for Palestine with the msf also known as Doctors Without Borders uh it's very good to see you Leo thank you for joining us can you tell us where you are firstly I just arrived in car yesterday and I was in for the last two weeks were you in hanun yes we were in the west we are living in the west side of hunis and I went to visit the nas hospital and the European hospital as well what was the situation in those hospitals and Leo what was happening around them was there fighting around the hospitals it's catastrophic you know I just went there just a week ago and it was already fighting quite close to the hospital when I was there there was a bomb who fell down just 150 M away from the hospital it killed two boys four years old and 5 years old plus six six more people uh and 80 wed so already when I was there a week ago the fighting was quite close since a few days it's becoming increasingly uh uh uh close in the immediate vicinity I just talk with my team this morning they are very scared about what is going on they don't know where the troops are they hear a lot of shooting and bombing uh they are so scared to get out of the hospitals because they are scared of being shot at like it happened in shifa hospital in in the North like in Indonesian Hospital in the north as well uh they're really terrorized by what's happening and we can see that currently the Israeli military ring is on purpose terrorizing the healthcare worker it is not acceptable they had to bury bodies inside the hospital because they were too scared to go to the cemetery that is just 100 meters away from the hospital and what is happening in terms of treating people inside the hospital what is needed there how overcrowded is it what do you have in terms of equipment do you know it was already overcrowded when I when I get there um uh people everywhere idps everywhere uh uh way too many patients for the number of healthcare worker so many patient were just laying on their beds for for for days for weeks without the proper without the proper medical care because there are not enough staff currently uh More than 70% of the staff has left ner because they're scared for their life and this is not acceptable what is going on we we are forced to abandon patients to to let patient dies die on their bed uh because because healthare worker cannot stay in the hospital it's it's it's happened in the North it happens again in the South Naser hospital and European Hospital are the last two hospital that were functioning in in in the South now Naser is barely functioning anymore because there are no more staff and no more staff to take care of the patient patient are in critical condition they need a lot of care and we cannot give to them in going on is any medical Aid getting across the border to the NASA Hospital you know we managed to get some Medical Aid across the border but it's very difficult to bring it to the hospital when I was there a week ago we brought full full care of medical supply so they they have some medical supply to carry on even if it's not enough especially in term of pain killer uh but when you talk about the north of Gaza which we tend to forget a bit like like shifa Hospital like Indonesian Hospital there is no Supply at all almost that can reach this area when I was there I tried four times to go in North Gaza four times we were denied by the Israeli Army to to reach this area this is uh completely forbidden under international law to forbid humanitarian people to bring essential Goods like medicines uh uh to the population uh what is going on in Gaza now it's too much uh uh it's a I I hope we're not getting used to it it's a it's it's a massacre that is going on every day uh I can remind you that since the beginning of the war it's 25,000 people who got killed uh if we just count the women and children it's 15,000 women and children who got killed in the beginning of the war it's 150 children and women being killed every single day since the beginning of the war it is not a normal War it is a war that is targeting civilians when I was visiting Nas hospital and European hospital I was shocked but truly shocked by the number of children and women inside those hospital it was mainly women and children I have never seen this in any other world and I've been in in in working in other Wars as msf we've been working in other Wars mostly you see combatants and you see some civilian people but here it's the opposite you see mostly civilian people getting treated for for for for for very difficult wounds the M are crushed a lot of burns on the face on on on the on the arms legs on the body it's it's it's extremely difficult ones to take care of and it's a it's a it's shocking and outraging that so many civilians are being uh wounded and killed Leo K thank you very much for joining us head of mission for Palestine with the msf thank you thank you
