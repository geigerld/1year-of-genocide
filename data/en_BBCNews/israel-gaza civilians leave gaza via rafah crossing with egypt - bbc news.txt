for the first time since the war between Israel and Hamas began people have been allowed to leave the besieged territory of Gaza they included dozens of injured Palestinians and hundreds of foreign Nationals they've left by the Rafa Crossing on the border with Egypt and the injured were treated at field hospitals there the foreign office says the first British Nationals have crossed and that more will be taken out in stages over the coming days people who've been trapped in Gaza for weeks began crossing the border from late morning after the territory was closed off by Israel when Hamas attacked it over 3 weeks ago Hamas is classed as a terrorist organization by the UK government and in Northern Gaza there's been another air strike on jabalia a day after an Israeli attack caused heavy casualties at the refugee camp there our International editor Jeremy boen has asked first report which contains material that you may find upsetting at last the gates of the Rafa Crossing were opened some foreign citizens were allowed to leave Gaza for Egypt for the first time since Israel imposed its Siege convoys of Aid trucks are moving into Gaza though not nearly as many as the UN and Aid agency say unnecessary ambulances went in for the seriously wounded in jabalia at the opposite end of the Gaza Strip more Israeli raids this time they said the target was a command center the UN said gaza's civilians were being starved traumatized and bombed to death on the other side of the Border wire Israelis are still in shock over the 7th of October attacks this is kibutz narim directly facing Gaza for the first first time Adele Rema was back to look and to grab a few things her old hopes of peace with her neighbors in Gaza Gone Forever stopping anything like this happening again is powering Israel's determination to see this fight through to the end Adele showed me the place where her son-in-law saved her three granddaughters all under the age of 10 so tell me what happened here that that is their safe room and that is where he shot the terrorists as kibutz narim was under attack Hamas radio messages were intercepted and the Israeli Army gave us this [Music] excert [Applause] the fence has been fixed Israel's security has not so there's no doubt there was a lot of complacency about the risks that Hamas posed to Israel and after the war there's going to be an inquiry but even now the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under a lot of pressure about his responsibility for the security land es that led to Hamas breaching the Border I took my pistol that day Noam tibon a retired Israeli General drove down from Tel Aviv to rescue his son's family from Hamas as the Hamas gunman surged forward tibon's mission was successful he took a rifle from a dead Israeli soldier and with others fought his way in I I saw one terrorist I pointed on him I killed him I saw another one I think I wound him or killed him so who do you hold responsible for what happened this is the biggest failure in the history of the state of Israel it was a military failure it was an intelligence failure and it was the failure of the government but I think that the one that really in charge and all the blame is on him is prime minister Benjamin nanyu this was the funeral of 20-year-old Lavi lipic killed in comb in Gaza Israelis are behind their troops but increasingly they want to know how so much went wrong and the pressure on the prime minister is going to increase Jeremy Bo in BBC News in southern Israel
