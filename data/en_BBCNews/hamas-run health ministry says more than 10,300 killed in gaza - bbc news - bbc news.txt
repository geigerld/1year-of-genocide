the hamus Run Health Ministry in Gaza has reported more than 10,000 people killed in Israel's military response more than 4,200 of them children while Middle East correspondent yolan Nell has this update from Jerusalem and a warning there are some flashing images in this report emerging alive from the ruins of his home for one month Palestinians have been under Fire all of Gaza is a battlefield even here in Ken Yunis in the south after Israel told people to flee here this is The Bravery of the so-called Israel they show their might and power against civilians babies inside kids inside this little girl survived the nighttime attack others didn't a grim Milestones been passed with over 4,000 children among the more than 10,000 people who've been killed according to local Health officials in the north Israel forces are advancing they say in their mission to dismantle Hamas after it launched its deadly attacks on the 7th of October and now the Israeli Prime Minister is also giving his first clue as to what might happen here after the war I think Israel will for an indefinite period will have the overall uh security responsibility because we've seen what happens when we don't have it when we don't have that security responsibility what we have is the eruption of uh Hamas Terror on a scale that we couldn't imagine across Israel it's an unofficial day of mourning many joined a minute's silence then singing the National Anthem to remember the bloodiest day in their country's history when some 1,400 people were killed with 240 hostages still missing in Gaza a table was laid out their loved ones hoping these symbols would get attention we are so uh said and we can't ER feel another feelings we can't smile we can everything that uh we are so we lose our happiness because of this situation and uh that's why uh we came here even after Decades of conflict between Israel and the Palestinians the past month has seen unprecedented suffering and for now there's no end in sight yoland Nell BBC News Jerusalem well from Gaza our correspondent Rush Abu Al says that there were more deadly Israeli air strikes overnight was a three deadliest a strike inun more than 30 people were killed in all of these area is in the south it's the area that Israel asked people to flee here they said it's safe today we are having more people coming from Gaza City into the uh uh southern part in fact they were walking about 5 kilometers because the road leads to uh Gaza City was damaged it's called Salah road which Israel advising people to take to take into the South I have met some people who were like walking very long way to to make it because no access to the road one month on is still Hamas able to fire Rockets is still fighting going on in eight different fronts in Gaza especially in the Northwest and Southwest of Gaza where Israel ground operation is been expanding and the grip around Gaza City is been tightening and the humanitarian situation there is really at the catastrophic of of hunger I was talking to a father of nine people there you know communication is very hard but between time to time we catch some someone there he said I have no food I have no money and I have no water there is no clean water because all of the aid that coming from Egypt which is very little according to the UN not reaching those about half million people who live in Gaza City and the north here in the South situation isn't better it's quieter a little bit less air strikes but the struggle to find food and water and the struggle for the hospital to find medicine is also continued that's our correspondent richy alof in Gaza well I'm joined now by the former Israeli Prime Minister ahud Elma he led his country from 2006 to 2009 and thanks very much for coming on the program um can I first get your your view on what's going on in Gaza at the moment we've had this situation where Israel has been telling people to leave the north of the territory and they're heading south and then the bombs are dropping on the south as well not really I think that what we are trying to do really is precisely what you have described you want to move the people out of where the combat areas are the headquarters of the Hamas organization uh is in the center of town in the north part and uh we want to be able to reach out for the leaders of Hamas and to their headquarters to the bankers to the launching pads where they shoot the missiles uh to civilian centers in Israel and we want to minimize the collateral damage to the maximum possible we don't want we don't fight civilians we don't want to civilians we are not enemies of the civilians non involved in Gaza we are enemies of the Hamas and I subscribe entirely to the announcement of the British government and the American government that voted in the United Nations against the uh uh call for ceasefire because they said Israel has a right to reach out for Hamas and destroy the Hamas organization that's what we're trying to do you talk about the collateral damage the number coming out of Gaza is that 10,000 people have died there in the last 4 weeks I mean what should Israel be doing to make sure that it isn't hitting civilians cuz clearly that's not working well two things number one while I don't want to argue with the numbers I must say that these numbers are numbers that are blown out of any proportion by the Hamas they they haven't been counted they haven't been uh uh checked and I can tell you that you can't deny that civilians are dying in Gaza can you no no so let let me let me continue I don't deny and I say that we try to do every possible effort to uh minimize the cial damage to the maximum possible uh people that are staying in the center of Gaza people that are living in the headquarters of the Hamas and in the bankers where from they wag their Wars against Israeli civilians are likely to to be affected and we try to avoid it as much as possible but uh when all the uh Western countries including your prime minister uh um Rishi sunak admirably I have to say says that Israel has a right to respond where exactly are we going to respond if not in where the headquarters of the uh Kamas are where the bunkers are where the concentration of their missiles and their uh other uh attacking devices are that's where we have to act and we try to avoid as much as we can I know that unfortunately I can't deny no it will be stupid and irresponsible that there might be collateral uninvolved people killed as a result of the Israeli operation we try to minimize it because our Target are not isra civilians in Gaza unlike the Hamas which were aiming at Israeli civilians and they killed in their homes and they butchered them and they beheaded them and you know all all of these terrible sides that were exposed to the world uh by what they did I suppose you talk about the support of the International Community like from the UK I suppose the concern for Israel is that if the continued suffering cons in Gaza continues to fill our screens day in day out and as we hear the numbers growing uh every day that the the sympathy and the unequivocal support could wne couldn't it for Israel yeah yeah definitely I I'm fully aware of that and in fact what I want to share with you is my vision I know I don't represent the government I don't speak for the government I think you know very well that I'm not entirely the supporter of this Israeli government but I want to present my vision for the end game of this event we are fighting now in order to destroy Hamas I think it's essential that we'll make clear that we don't want to stay in Gaza and that we are going to pull out out from Gaza entirely when the Battle Is Over however that's kind of the opposite of what Mr Netanyahu has been saying isn't it you have heard what he said about being responsible for security after this n said that Israel is going to be responsible for security Israel was responsible with the security it's just that his government failed in providing security for the people of Israel but we we also found out that Hamas has increased its military power to the extent that it becomes a danger to the entire stability of the Middle East so we have to destroy Hamas and this is something which is widely supported and accepted by the British government by the American government by many other Europeans now what I want to say is this we have to pull out I don't care whether Natan agrees with me or not I don't agree with him we have to pull out from Gaza completely then what we have to ask the Western countries is you want us to pull out we want to pull out no Arab country and no Arab Soldier will come to Gaza on the bonetes of Israel so there must be an intering period where an international force will take over Gaza for a short period of time to start and rehabilitate Gaza and start and uh reestablish and restore a civil Administration in Gaza now I we did it in the south of Lebanon in 2006 and it worked to provide security and and stability in Lebanon for the last 17 years is that a would you want a NATO force then is that what you're saying in Gaza we want to have an international Force for a period of time that will then be replaced by the forces of the palestin authority now one thing more which I think needs to be done today by Israel today not tomorrow is that Israel should present this end game plan and add one essential think that Israel is prepared to start immediate negotiations with the Palestinian Authority at the end of the battle on the basis of a two-state solution yes because that's what they said the Palestinian Authority have said that they only want to go back into to Gaza if it is an independent Palestinian State that's why I say that number one there should be an international Force for an interim period number two Israel should announce today that we have a political Vision we have a political Horizon we are prepared to start negotiations with the Palestinian Authority to establish a Palestinian State on a two-state solution now if Israel will do it today and this is what I propose that we will do and I think it's essential that we will do then there is a likelihood that the International Community will be more patient with the time needed for Israel to first defeat Hamas complet and break down its military power if we will not provide a political Horizon then the patience of the International Community may disappear very close and we will fail to achieve the goal that we set out and that was supported by the International Community however if we will then move and say we are prepared first we will pull out from Gaza completely second we are prepared to start political negotiations with the Palestinian Authority on the basis of two State Solutions then there is a horizon that can be supported by the International Community and by the moderate Arab countries they may not necessarily spell it out explicitly because of the divisions and the sensitivities and of their populations but I know based on my experience and my acquaintance and my uh past uh uh dealings with the Palestinian with the Arab leaderships that deep down in their heart the jordanians the Egyptians the Emirates Bakin and of course the Palestinians themselves are anxious that Israel will achieve its goal and crash the Kash Kash is threat not only to Israel the question is I suppose what would be left of GA what will be left of Gaza afterwards though I mean we're already hearing reports that half of all homes have been destroyed in Gaza already look a war is not a game and unfortunately they started a war and they killed 1500 Israeli civilians in their homes and butchered them and beheaded them and raped them and killed babies of two years old and elderly people of 85 years old and sometimes in the course of these events there are collateral uh damages and we talked about it however Gaza is not going to disappear Gaza is going to stay there and the international effort which will be made with the participation of many countries at the presence of international intervention force in Gaza will be able to rebuild lots of uh what has been damaged and also a momentum for a political solution will be created with a commitment by the state of Israel which has to be made and here I made it clear I don't speak for the Israeli government because they don't don't agree with it now but I hope that this government will disappear soon and the new government will be replaced that will make a very explicit commitment that we are prepared to negotiate a two-state solution this is the only possible direction for something that offer a different future for all parties involved and that's what I personally support and I think that Lots uh of uh people in the International Community entirely agree with this approach okay well thank you very much for taking the time to talk to us appreciate it there
