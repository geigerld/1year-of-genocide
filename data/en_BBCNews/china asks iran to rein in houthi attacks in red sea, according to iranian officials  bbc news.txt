you're live with BBC News us Central Command confirmed today it had shot down another anti-ship ballistic missile that was flying towards the USS car from houthi controlled Yemen the ship was operating in the Gulf of Aiden a lot of the focus so far has been on the US UK response to these attacks but Reuters is reporting that China is now getting involved citing four Iranian sources the report says officials from Beijing have been asking Iranian counterparts to help re in the h is the discussions took place in recent meetings in Beijing and Tran the attacks have raised the cost of shipping and insurance for Western companies that much we know but this is also a route that is used widely by ships from China who are exporting to Europe and we all know what sort of pressure the Chinese economy is under right now Beijing does have some leverage too they take 90% of the Iranian crude that was exported last year let's bring in there Neil Thomas he's a fellow for Chinese politics at a Asia Society policy Institute Center for China analysis welcome to uh the program um it's really interesting this because we've been wholly focused on on the western companies but of course a large part of the Chinese economy is still dependent on exports and they come on this route that's true uh it's certainly something that concerns International Trade r large not just the Western countries there are some reports however that the houthi rebels in Yemen are allowing Chinese Flagg ships to sail through those contested areas and that the Chinese kind of commercial Navy isn't experiencing the same type of difficulties but still like creating that instability creating that R of something going wrong in a Chinese ship or Chinese trade routs uh coming under attack or you know seeing the danger plus you know therefore the insurance premiums rise more generally that's certainly uh threat to China's interests as well in the longer term yeah because I mean just just on that point quickly I mean presumably not all Chinese exports travel on Chinese flagships exactly so it's a problem that is maybe less direct and less present for Chinese importers and exporters and the Chinese economy r large so you haven't seen uh quite as strong or immediate a reaction from the Chinese government but uh perhaps it's an indication that that is beginning to change we've seen before in fact we saw it last year didn't we the sort of influence that China has over some of its allies um they broke broke it a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran for instance so so am I right that they they do have significant leverage over tan they do have some leverage over tan that at least is clear I mean China buys a huge majority of Iran's exported oil which is obviously a Lifeline for a regime that's under significant us and international sanctions uh and you know China is you know trying to increase its own presence and diplomatic uh power within the Middle East so China has some leverage and some uh intention and some interests there but at the same time Iran also has its own uh interest and its own kind of allies if you like various Rebel groups and other uh organizations in the region that it has to look out for so it's not necessarily a complete convergence of interests or a complete asymmetry of power where China can simply say something H to Iran and that would be enough to uh stop the houthis from threatening international shipping so it be really interesting to see just how much influence China has so this will be a big test of its uh leverage over Iran and whether this leads to any kind of calming of the situation if it does that's a big diplomatic victory for China and that'll be seen across the region and across the world if it doesn't make any difference well that's going to make China question potentially what it's getting out of its relationship with Iran and we could even see some type of uh economic pressure being put on tan by Beijing yeah now while we have we have you uh can we talk about another issue I mean we've been learning today that a British man who disappeared in China five years ago uh has been jailed on espion charges in fact he was he was jailed two years ago beijing's foreign Ministry confirmed that Ian Stones a businessman around 70 years old was jailed for 5 years by a Chinese Court in 2022 he was found guilty of being bribed into providing intelligence illegally said the Chinese by external forces the Chinese Court tried the case strictly in accordance with the law fully guaranteed the various legitimate rights of in stones and arranged for the UK side to visit and attend his trial China is a country governed by the rule of law so seran Duncan Smith former conservative leader said that he'd raised this issue with the British government uh over a number of years Neil um and nothing had come out of it until we got this news today and it just begs the question what the right strategy is because there are others being held in China the policy seems to be that they don't like the British government don't like publicity um while the negoti negotiations ongoing does this suggest that actually maybe publicity would be better it's hard to say definitively it all depends I think to some extent or depends to some extent on the nature of the charges the nature of different cases but it's certainly true that we've seen in the past that the level of publicity attached to some of these detentions of foreigners in China has arguably contributed to their eventual resolution not necessarily their quick resolution if we remember the case of the the two Michaels the two Canadians detained after uh Huawei executive mongan Joe was detained in Canada uh it took them 3 years to be released uh by Chinese authorities after M had been released uh by the Canadian authorities but there was a huge amount of attention on that case and now both the Michaels are back home in Canada so it did lead to a resolution uh and argue that publicity did contribute interesting Neil Thomas thank you very much for your thoughts this evening uh we will see uh what comes of that Chinese leverage over Iran but
