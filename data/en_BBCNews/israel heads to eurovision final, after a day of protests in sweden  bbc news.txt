while the war in Gaza is casting a shadow over the Eurovision song contest which is being held in Sweden this year Israel's reached the final with a song performed by Eden Golan she received claps cheers and some booze when she took to the stage in Malmo early a thousands of people protested in the city against Israel's involvement the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wished her success saying that she'd already succeeded against what he described as an ugly wave of anti-semitism well I've been speaking to our correspondent Sarah reinford about the security in Malmo there are a lot of police here and and certainly we've seen Mounted Police we've seen drones in the Sky last night there's the occasional helicopter over overhead as well and a lot of police on the ground but speaking to uh police officers here the mood is pretty relaxed in actual fact you know there are a lot of them they're definitely being vigilant uh we know that the terror threat in Sweden as a whole is pretty high at the moment but in terms of policing the protest the authorities are trying uh to keep this as calm and as peaceful as possible uh they have Community uh police officer they call them the dialogue police here they are right along the route of any of the protests and the mood has been peaceful although the mood of the protesters themselves is passionate too they are angry that Israel has been allowed to take part in EUR Vision this year at a time when the Israeli military uh is bombing Gaza at a time of humanitarian crisis and the slogans and the Chance are pretty furi curious so the mood is strong uh the crowds are growing there were probably uh 10,000 or so protesters there according to police yesterday although some quotes and estimates are a bit higher than that uh but as I say it has been peaceful it has been contained all of this is organized and planned in advance with the authorities we haven't seen any spontaneous uh protests of any uh particular size so I wouldn't say it was tense here but I would say that there are plenty of people who want to make their views heard uh and that view that uh Eden Golan is Israel should not be at Eurovision particularly talking about what they call hypocrisy because of course Russia has been banned from Eurovision uh because of the fullscale invasion of Ukraine and lots of people at the protest will mention that uh when they tell you why they've come out to protest I should just mention as well uh perhaps Sweden's most famous political activist was also in the crowd of protesters yesterday I had a quick chat to her Greta tumberg uh she told me it was her moral obligation to speak out uh she was joining the protest she said uh because she considers it considered it inexcusable for Israel to be taking part in your vision uh whilst the bombing of Gaza continues and away from of course the uh headlines around the war just tell us what we can expect when it comes to the contest in other areas well an actual fact the Israeli performer Eden Golan has been uh becoming far more popular with the the audiences uh she's uh climbed up the the list of favorites uh so so she's pretty high up now there's also an actor from Croatia by a band called Baby lasagna uh who talk something about cows and something about cats it's pretty mystifying act uh there is the usual kind of dizzying array of crazy costumes Crazy lyrics it is your vision as usual at the party venue itself at the arena but as I say here in town it's all about the protest there are more protests planned of course now that Israel has made it to the big Final on Saturday night and of course we'll have full coverage from Malmo throughout the day my colleague Marian maseri will be live there later
