let's return to our main story because the world food program has paused life-saving food deliveries to Northern Gaza saying Aid convoys have endured complete chaos and violence due to the collapse in civil order the Israeli military ordered 1.1 million Palestinian civilians to evacuate Northern Gaza and seek shelter in the south at the start of its ground offensive in October last month the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees underw said at least 300,000 people who' remained in the area depended on its assistance for their survival a deliveries to the north since the ground offensive have been scarce and dependent on security clearances from the Israeli military well let's speak now to Matthew hollingworth who's representative for the world food program live in Jerusalem Matthew thank you so much for being here on the program so just explain for us uh in a little more detail why you've taken that decision to pause food deliveries to the north so um thank you Matthew and I mean first of all it is a pause it's not a permanent suspension this is temporary in nature um we need to fix a couple of problems that we were facing and have faced this week u in the two convoys we did get to Gaza City um the two convoys came up uh with two big big concerns first of all and most importantly when we did get into Gaza City um unfortunately um people came under Fire as they were receiving assistance um you don't really uh ever imagine that people could be so desperate so hungry um and so you know fearful of their own family's health that they're willing to run into machine gun fire to receive food assistance but that's what we experienced when we got into Gaza City on Sunday and Monday of this week um second of all as you rightly said we also came up against some very serious insecurity issues just getting into Gaza City because of the breakdown of Law and Order which is down to desperation it's down to to you know hopelessness need uh needs you know not being met outside of the of Gaza City as well so those two concerned married together um worrying about the people we're there to serve making sure that we're doing no harm by providing them assistance and trying to get that that safety assurance that when people are going to be supported they're not going to come under Fire that's our primary concern and second of all making sure that our gar and truck drivers our gar and staff our International staff who are going in are also not coming under Fire um when they're providing life-saving Aid two things in this question tell me more about the need in terms of what you've witnessed in the north and how distressing is it as a humanitarian to have to pause humanitarian efforts I mean the needs in Gaza City are phenomenal um I spent four or five hours traveled all around the city met with lots of people um they are desperate um people were able to live off some stocks that were that that that were still uh in the basements of buildings in the basement of shops um but unfortunately that is no longer possible um people were able in the past to get hold of essentially chaff um it was animal feed and they were using that animal animal feed to make very basic flour to make bread that ran out a week ago so people are absolutely desperate for assistance for food assistance uh what we've been able to bring in so far is a drop in the ocean what we need to be doing is sending in 30 trucks every single day consistently regularly without pause people need confidence and trust that humanitarian assistance will re will get to them and they also need to know that when it does they're not going to come under Fire they're going to be protected they're going to be safe none of that exists yet that's what we're negotiating to resolve once that's done the pause will end and we will be back trying to pump as much food flood food into a place where famine is knocking at people's doors a final quick question you end by saying famine is knocking at people's doors particularly in children because more stats on that released by your organization in the last 24 hours and you must also be watching what is happening around rafo with increasing alarm look um it's we're talking about a very small area um 140 square miles there is no safe area across the entirety of the Gara strip people are in desperate need throughout the whole of the strip um but when you look at the the the level of deprivation in Gaza City it is phenomenal as you rightly said we came out with a joint Report with the World Health Organization and UNICEF earlier this week that showed that in a very short period of time um children are facing emergency levels of malnutrition and that should worry us all when you add to that the Fear Factor on what will happen next in Rafa potentially a million more people displaced yet again people who've already been displaced already lost their homes and and been pushed around parts of the strip seeking shelter and safety and may have to do it again it's a extremely worrying period um Rafer as well as our our main entry point into the strip it's the the artery for all Aid that's going in which has already been hampered in the last week because of protests and violence on the corridor where where we bring trucks into the Gaza Strip things need to change we need more entry points into the Gaza Strip we need guarantees of safety that when we can go when we can get Aid in can travel around uh safely and we desperately need to ensure that when we're serving people those people don't actually face more harm uh and more violence through the provision of Aid they need safe Aid Drop Zones where when we provide the aid they can receive it and take it home to their families Matthew hollingworth we have to leave it there but thanks for talking to us here on verified live we're grateful for your time
