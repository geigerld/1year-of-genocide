we begin with the latest in the conflict in Gaza where it's been reported that the US has carried out its first airdrop of aid for the territory thousands of meals have been parachuted in by three military planes that follows a pledge on Friday by President Biden meanwhile Egyptian sources say talks on trying to secure a ceasefire in Gaza are due to resume in Cairo on Sunday it's understood there has been some progress but the violence has been continuing at least 13 Palestinians including a medic are reported to have been killed by an Israeli air strike near a hospital and a United Nations team visiting gaza's biggest hospital has found that many Palestinians who were injured as lorries were delivering Aid on Thursday were wounded by gunshots American officials have confirmed that the US military has carried out its first airdrop of humanitarian Aid into Gaza let's take a look at these pictures here you can see US military planes flying over Dar Al Bala in the the central Gaza Strip American officials say over 35,000 amals were dropped by Parachute it comes after a promise by President Biden on Friday following the deaths of 112 Palestinians during a rush on an aid Convoy on Thursday let's get more on this now from our Washington correspondent will Vernon will good to see you good morning to you there in DC tell us more about what US officials have been saying that's right we received the statement um from the US military saying that this first aird drop has been carried out that was done uh in coordination together uh with the Jordanian Air Force uh some C130 aircraft uh dropping over 38,000 meals along the coastline of Gaza uh say the US military now this will not be the first this will be part of an ongoing Mission there's expected uh to be many of these us officials say Israel is supportive of the mission and it's being carefully planned uh to ensure that there aren't any civilian casualties on the ground because this is a a very complex this is in fact an actually actually a very inefficient uh way of delivering Aid getting Aid in by trucks via land routes is actually um much more much simpler and much more efficient uh so I think the fact that the US has opted for this method not only uh shows how serious the humanitarian crisis is in Gaza uh but it also uh I think shows that uh the US wants to send a message that more aid needs to get in by land and indeed in that statement from the US military today it says these air drops are part of a sustained effort to get more Aid into Gaza including by expanding the flow of Aid through land corridors and routs will I want to pick up on what you mentioned there this this slight nuanced shift in the US position because America has been supportive generally speaking of Israeli activity but this is a change in tone and this promised by President Biden on Friday was a shift in that us position what's the trajectory of this do you think that's right I mean we've we've been hearing a kind of increasing tone of exasperation I think from President Biden from other uh White House officials in recent weeks um recently President Biden said he thought uh Israel's military operation in Gaza was over the top uh recently he said that uh the the rougher uh Israel's plans to launch an offense into the gazen city of Rafa uh shouldn't go ahead unless careful planning uh took place to ensure that no civilian casualties uh that there were no civilian casualties and also yesterday during President Biden's meeting with the Italian Prime Minister we saw him say that only a handful of Aid trucks were getting in uh whereas it should be you know many more than much more than that uh so I think you know there has been uh there has been some frustration uh but also remember it is an election year here a particularly closely thought uh fought uh election campaign particularly polarizing at least it's shaping up to be that way and Israel Gaza is becoming an election issue here and President Biden has to walk a very tricky tight rope on the one hand he has to ensure that the US is is supporting a key Ally Israel on the other hand he has to uh make sure he's not alienating progressives in his own party uh also putting off traditional voters and we saw that a few days ago uh in the state of Michigan when a Democrat primary election was held there over 100,000 people in Michigan actually voted uncommitted so most of those were a protest vote against President Biden for uh his support of Israel of course the US uh hasn't uh called for an immediate ceasefire like many people uh many of those voters in Michigan for example uh would like President Biden to so that I think was um a stark warning and a concern I think sign uh for the White House for the Biden campaign that come November uh this could become a problem among key voters in those crucial swing states such as Michigan okay will very good to get that take from you will ver Washington thank you
