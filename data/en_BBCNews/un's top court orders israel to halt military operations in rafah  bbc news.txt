hello I'm G guruthi we begin in the hag where judges at the international court of justice that's the United Nations Top Court have just ruled that Israel must immediately halt its military offensive and other actions in Rafa citing the immediate risk to the Palestinian people it also ruled that Hamas must immediately and unconditionally release its hostages let's listen to what the judge who was speaking in the past half an hour had to say the court recalls that in ordance with article 75 paragraph 2 of its rules when a request for the indication of provisional measures has been made it has the power under its statute to indicate measures that are not in whole or in part other than those requested in the present case having considered the terms of the provisional measures requested by South Africa and the circumstances of the case the court found that the measures to be indicated need not be identical to those requested the court considered that in Conformity with obligations under the genocide convention Israel must immediately hold its military offensive and any other action in the Rafa Governor which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part the court records that it that in its order of January 26 2024 it ordered Israel inter area to I quote take effective measures to prevent the destruction and ensure the preservation of evidence related to allegations of Acts within the scope of Article 2 and article 3 of the genocide convention end of quote in the present circumstances the court is also of The View that in order to preserve evidence related to allegations of Acts falling within the scope of Article 2 and article 3 of the genocide convention Israel must take effective measures to ensure the unimpeded access to the Gaza Strip of any Commission of inquiry fact finding Mission or ever investigative body mandated by competent organs of the United ations to investigate allegations of genocide the judge there the icj just to give you some initial responses uh David Mera spokesperson for the Israeli government has said there is no power in the world that will push us to commit a public suicide because that's what this is to stop our war against Hamas that's repeating a line that of course a consistent line that we've heard from the Israeli government who I think are meeting now there was a call for Mr Netanyahu to meet um his top ministers and Hamas um as reported by the Reuters news agency has said that they welcome the icj plan to send the investigation committee into Gaza they say they would promise any cooperation that they can give um and they have said that they welcome the decision on Rafa saying it doesn't go far enough it's urging an end for Israel's offensive on all of Gaza and looking at uh whether the security Council will now look to try and implement this ruling well let's get more now our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams is in Jerusalem and he told us more about the immediate reaction there in Israel if this was the The Measure that was anticipated uh uh with some debate as to whether or not the court would finally uh take that additional step uh no uh reaction official reaction from the government so far it's due to discuss this ruling uh later today uh there is a reaction from the Hardline Finance Minister uh itar benav who has called it irrelevant and ant and he's dismissed the court as anti-semitic these are the sorts of remarks you would expect to hear from some of Mr netanyahu's more Hardline colleagues uh but when it comes to uh the order to uh to Halt the rough or offensive I think we can expect uh a big fat no from the government here uh and I think they will probably complain that the court uh in coming to its conclusions only cited what the the UN had told them about the situation uh in southern Gaza the Israelis have been arguing for some time that they are taking steps not withstanding their military operation in Gaza that they are taking steps to improve the provision of food and goods into the Gaza Strip it's very noticeable for example that for the three weeks or so after uh after May the 7th when the order to uh to launch the offensive in began only about 140 trucks of un Aid entered through the Karen Shalom crossing the most important crossing point from Israel but and this was something the court did not refer to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of trucks of commercial uh food stuffs have gone in through that very same route allowed in by Israel escorted by uh armed guards inside the Gaza Strip and taken into the the marketplace in Gaza there is food to be had in places a lot of gazans can't afford it but that was an element of Israel's response to uh the situation uh in Gaza that the court uh simply didn't allude to they also obviously did not allude to Israel's military rationale for attacking Gaza the complete dismantling of the last uh remaining battalions of Hamas and the importance Israel would say of securing the the border between Gaza and Egypt to prevent the smuggling of weapons uh which could lead to a future conflict now all of this was was was was not referred to by the court the court obviously feels that of in excess of 800,000 people we think it's probably closer to a million by now uh is evidence of the increased risk uh to life and and well-being of a huge portion of the Palestinian population of the Gaza Strip and that was enough to persuade those judges who had not been persuaded so far to say enough is enough this operation has to stop Paul Adams there speaking to us a bit earlier uh from Jerusalem and just to let you know that since we SP Paul um David mener who's a spokesperson for the Israeli government um did give some reaction to the news uh to the BBC and he said there is no power in the world that will push us to commit a public suicide because that's what this is to stop our war against Hamas uh we understand the Israeli government are meeting or going to be meeting soon to discuss this ruling uh We've also had reports on Reuters of Hamas reaction Hamas apparently calling on the UN Security Council to implement the icj court of justice decision welcoming the ruling and uh welcoming the call for an investigation an inquiry saying that they would cooperate with that also we've had a response from the Palestinian authorities saying they welcome the decision as again reported by Reuters um news agency saying that it represents an international consensus to end the war on the Gaza Strip um according to a Palestinian presidential spokesperson we will keep you across all the reaction of course we're going to be looking to the US to see uh what the White House say whether this has any impact on Biden's current position of ongoing support for Israel though of course he has warned repeatedly uh the Israeli leadership not to go into uh Hamas uh territory uh in Rafa uh because of the risk to civilian life we will keep you across those events
