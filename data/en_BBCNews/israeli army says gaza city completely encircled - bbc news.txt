hello and welcome to World News America I'm Katrina Perry the Israeli military says its forces have encircled Gaza City after encountering Fierce resistance from Hamas Fighters a joint operation from ground sea and air forces saw Israeli troops break through the Hamas front lines in the north of Gaza earlier today and advanc rapidly South the fighting comes as gaza's health Ministry says more than 9,000 people have now been killed in Israeli strikes since the deadly Hamas attacks on the 7th of October Israel's intense bombardment of Gaza continued on Thursday with a third deadly air strike in his many days on the densely populated jabalia refugee camp the Hamas run Health Ministry said at least 27 people were killed in the strike which it claimed was near a un School our International editor Jeremy bone has the latest more evidence that nowhere in Gaza is safe Israel hit bur refugee camp for days Israel has been ordering civilians in Gaza to move South for their own safety bur is inside the area where they were told to go and thousands of displaced people were Sheltering there the UN Human Rights office has said that so many civilians have been killed and wounded in Israeli air strikes that it has serious concerns that these are disproportionate attacks that could be war crimes a girl was pulled out alive she asks the stretcher bearers are you taking me to my grave the men try to reassure her that she's not dead across Gaza unknown numbers of dead are buried under the r in Bur Camp he's asked who he's looking for my four children my for children he says oh God why did you leave me and die Israel says it wants to destroy Hamas civilians it says are killed because Hamas uses them as human Shields Israel has released pictures of some of its latest attacks based on reports from inside Gaza and Israeli military statements it seems clear that they are pushing forward into Gaza City the pictures released by the Army are pre-edited they don't want to give away locations Hamas as far as we can tell is using hit-and run tactics against what is a much more powerful Army to support the ground war in Gaza the Israeli military says it's only using half its air power the troops have been visited by Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu I call on the uninvolved get out get out move South because we will not quit our effort to eliminate the Hamas terrorists we will advance we will advance and win this is jabalia in Northern Gaza hit 3 Days running Israel defends its targeting vigorously but it also knows that pictures like this every day make it harder for its allies to push back demands for a ceasefire the boys say we didn't do anything wrong we didn't do anything wrong the UN says 22 people Sheltering in four of its schools were killed today it isn't clear what hit this one in jabalia what is clear from the evidence and un statements is that nowhere is safe in Gaza Jeremy bone BBC News Southern Israel well let's speak now to our correspondent John donison who is in Jerusalem John another update from the IDF today they say they have Gaza City encircled what's the latest on the military campaign well their ground operation is clearly advancing they say yesterday they said they were at the gates of Gaza City today Benjamin Netanyahu said they had passed into the outskirts of Gaza City uh and today an Israeli military spokesperson said they had Gaza completely encircled um so the ground operation is advancing they are facing resistance uh we've seen 19 Israeli soldiers uh now killed uh and it has to be said that the area on the approach to Gaza City is relatively open you know there are small towns and Villages which are maybe easier to move through once you get to the densely builtup urban area of Gaza City itself it's going to be increasingly difficult and complex of course and of course one of uh Israel's objectives is to remove hamas's military capabilities and their ability to govern the other is of course to free those hostages and carrying out that ground offensive while trying to get those hostages out alive um is not going to be easy now we saw more people again mostly foreign Nationals leaving Gaza through the Rafa Crossing today is there a sense that number is set to increase well look the Egyptian authorities had been saying that they were going to try and get through about 500 people uh a day uh foreign uh passport holders and a small number of critically injured uh people I don't think they've reached that number today I think more than a hundred people have managed to get out uh we know some Americans uh passport holders were able to leave a few at British passport holders but there are more than 7,000 foreign Nationals in Gaza so it is going to take a considerable amount of time uh to get them all out and of course the key thing is that is just a tiny fraction of the what is it 2.2 million or so people who live in Gaza the vast majority of whom have no chance of getting out and the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is on his way there he says us diplomacy can make a difference how is his visit is it likely to be received well I think there will be some us diplomacy in putting pressure on to try and get uh the American citizens out I think when he was here a few weeks ago Mr blinken you know he really offered uh Israel unconditional support they have been urging Israel to try and limit the number of Civilian casualties is and America believes that Israel is trying to do that but by the time Mr blinken leaves this visit you know we're going to be on the way to 10,000 people killed in Gaza according to Palestinian Health officials in Gaza and the UN also publishes those figures so you know not all of those are militants a lot of civilians are getting caught up and you know I was speaking to a British government Minister yesterday and I said look when does Israel's response to hamas's attack on October the 7th become disproportionate you know is it at 10,000 deaths in Gaza 20,000 100,000 he didn't want to give an answer but I do think as the number of people being killed continues to rise uh the you know uh countries like America uh European countries are going to be under increasing pressure I think to try and um put pressure on Israel to uh limit the number of people being killed okay John donison in Jerusalem thank you for that
