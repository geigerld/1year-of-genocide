the Israeli military says Hamas has now lost control of the north of Northern Gaza after intense fighting 50,000 Palestinians fled Gaza City yesterday through evacuation routes after Israel opened a safe passage on the road to the South for a few hours meanwhile a senior un official has accused both sides of committing war crimes he's our Middle East correspondent y your land nail with the latest Israel's vast military might on display once again it says Hamas has lost control in Northern Gaza and its troops are battling inside Gaza City this is a critical point in the war and for the first time the BBC was given access behind Israeli lines in Gaza escorted by soldiers while the BBC had editorial control of the report these pictures were cleared for use by the Israeli military amid the huge destruction officers showed what they said was a Hamas weapons factory set up they said below a family apartment a child's bedroom they insisted that Hamas not Israel was responsible for civilian loss of life we know intelligence we know what we hit we know the targets they're approved by the by our Command it's not that I wake up and my my objective is to to ruin the the city I aim for enemy an enemy only Israel says its actions in Gaza where it's trying to eradicate Hamas are a military necessity that this war is about self-defense but Air's view is different she says that because of Israel's bombardment nowhere is safe there's no food or drinking water for the children and that Israel has bombed the bakeries Israel says that 50,000 Palestinians moved South in Gaza yesterday when it promised safe passage but during the day deadly Israeli air strikes were reported across the length of the strip the Hamas run authorities now say that more than 10 and a half thousand people have been killed the UN Secretary General says the civilian death toll in Gaza shows something is clearly wrong with Israeli military operations but also Al that Hamas is using people as human Shields meanwhile the un's human rights commissioner visiting the region is accusing both Israel and Hamas of war crimes after G7 top diplomats voiced their concerns at a meeting in Japan attention is also beginning to turn to the post-war future the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin said there should be a United Palestinian L government for Gaza and the West Bank as a step towards Palestinian statehood uh it's also clear that Israel cannot occupy Gaza um now the reality is that there may be uh a need for some transition period uh at the end of the conflict but it is imperative that um the Palestinian people uh be Central to uh to governance uh in uh in Gaza and in the West Bank as well but for now this conflict rages on Hamas be hugely outgunned but its Guerilla tactics on the streets of Gaza could keep the war with Israel going for months to come yoland Nell BBC News Jerusalem well more on this the French government is hosting a conference in Paris to discuss ways of getting humanitarian Aid to people in Gaza delegations from several Arab nations are attending but Israel will not be represented and its main backer the United States is only sending a lowlevel team well let's go live now to Paris and our correspondent Hugh scoffield Hugh let's just start with the conference itself what is France hoping to achieve well it's hoping that this will lead to some kind of breakthrough in getting Aid into Gaza um they're assembling some very iminent people you know the head of unra the relief agency is going to be talking um um the head of the International Red Cross will be here briefing delegates on the situation um and the hope is that they with the delegations will come up with creative ideas about getting Aid in about establishing establishing field hospitals uh getting fuel down into the Gaza Strip and so on I have to say there's a huge degree of skepticism though about about this uh conference which was hastily organized um in the last few days and and it's really just a kind of adjunct to an existing peace Forum which president macron um had been planning which will discuss a lot of other issues such as global warming and uh uh um Ai and so on and this was sort of tacked on to the beginning because of the pressing problem of Gaza but I don't think there's a huge expectation that it's going to lead to anything par particularly significant but it does send perhaps a message to Israel and Israel isn't sending a delegation to the conference and the French government has talked about not wanting to offend the Israeli government yeah we need to be quite clear that the Israelis are not sending dation but primarily because they weren't invited and that's not intended to snub the Israelis the the idea was that this would be a a conference of countries that are interested in getting Aid into to uh Gaza donor countries and Israel obviously does not count among them so um there's no intention of snubs in either direction um but what is the case I think is that this does have a PO itical Dimension um the French government President Ma in particular has been accused by some here in France many here in France of adopting a kind of Nee pro-israeli um reaction and of uh in the initial aftermath of the October the 7th attacks you know coming down very very very too firmly on behalf on the side of of Israel and all of this and there is pressure certainly from the foreign ministry here to redress the balance some somewhat and show that you know France also shares the concerns of the Arab world of the South um more largely um and their concerns about humanitarian difficulties in Gaza so that does address that and does send out a message and does send out a message about how the world increasingly is hoping for some kind of humanitarian pause in the fighting yes thank you very much that's our correspondent in Paris Hugh scoffield well as Hugh mentioned there there has been some skepticism about the conference including from Aid organizations and human rights groups and we can now talk to Sasha deshmuk who's the chief executive of Amnesty International UK here in London Sasha thank you very much for joining us so Amnesty International has issued a statement ahead of this conference saying the focus should be on calling for a ceasefire yes we've welcomed the International Community focusing on the humanitarian situation in Gaza at this conference we have said that a ceasefire we believe is an important step that can mean that there can be a chance for the delivery of sustained and effective Aid in Gaza there can be a chance for the burying of the Dead there can be a chance for the treatment of the many many people wounded and also critically during a ceasefire there can be an intensification of negotiations trying to ensure the return of hostages which of course must also be a critical Focus but do you understand Israel's position because you've been calling for a ceasefire but the Israeli government says any pause in fighting would benefit Hamas and it has a responsibility to protect its citizens well all states have a responsibility to self-defense um of their citizens they actually have that as a duty but that Duty can never be undertaken by committing War crime and as you've reported um many experts including the United Nations commissioner have spoken now about war crimes that have been conducted both by Hamas but also by the Israeli authorities I believe that a ceasefire is critical in this situation um I believe that it does provide would provide an opportunity not only for the delivery of critical humanitarian Aid in a sustained way but also provide a critical opportunity for a focus on the hostages as well of course that hostage taking is a terrible crime as well many people watching might be wondering what happens next because the United States most countries are either calling for a ceasefire or a pause in fighting what can what more can be done well I think within a ceasefire as well as the delivery of humanitarian Aid as well as a focus on the return of the hostages critically also there needs to be a focus on human rights and the journey to a longer term solution which I believe needs to be based on human rights within a ceasefire we also need to see um investigators from the United Nations uh commission for human rights from organizations such as Amnesty International as well as the international criminal court be allowed access be allowed to actually give the world truth about what has been happening the crimes committed by both sides but critically also what does it then mean for there to be a human rights solution a human rights based Journey out of this conflict I believe it's only with a focus on human rights that we're going to see the end of what has been a decades long crisis and also focusing particularly on Gaza we need to remember that the current situation which within which we're calling for a ceasefire is also been an intensification of a 16-year long blockade of Gaza that action in and of itself is been an illegal action thank you very much that's Sasha deshmuk chief executive of Amnesty International UK thanks for joining us well for the latest on the conflict let's go live now to our correspondent Mark Len who's in southern Israel and Mark as we've been reporting there were about 50,000 people who left Northern Gaza yesterday and the Israeli military saying it's going to open a key highway for people to leave once again today what do we know about the movement of people and how they're managing to get out of Northern Gaza well there is this Main Highway as you say Katherine the salalen road which which goes from the northern tip of Gaza down uh down to the South and that is the road that the Israelis are trying to encourage civilians to take in order to flee the most intense uh military uh air strikes in the north of Gaza and the Israeli Defense Forces say that 50,000 took that road yesterday that is considered higher numbers than have taken it if if confirmed uh the the previous days um and the Israeli Defense Force say that they it could indeed be reopened again today there's been no official confirmation but the likelihood is that it would be reopened as the Israelis try to get the civilians to flee South but remember there are still tens of thousands maybe even hundreds of thousands who are still in the north uh as the Israeli Defense Forces push further into Gaza City now um the Israelis say that Hamas has lost control of Northern Gaza uh there was they say an intense 10-hour battle yesterday to take control of a Hamas stronghold um and the offensive in into Gaza City pushes deeper meanwhile there is some um possible good news on on on the on the hostages uh with the um with reports that the Qatari government is mediating for the release potentially of 12 hostages including some Americans uh the Americans believe that 10 US Nationals are still being held under Hamas captivity uh and we understand that those talks are ongoing and Mark we've been talking so far in the program about a possible ceasefire or pause in the fighting the United States other allies other isra other other allies of Israel are calling for the same are we seeing any sign of that from the government there well certainly not a ceasefire that the the Benjamin Netanyahu is ruled out if unless there is a full release of the hostages and that's very un likely to happen what we're talking about really is humanitarian pauses and pauses in the fighting and yesterday the Israeli military announced for the first time that there would be a 4-Hour pause in three large neighborhoods of Gaza City uh in order for food and water to be um to be reached by the civilians uh but residents there saying that there is such a shortage of food and water that they were unable to get very much during those those pauses but that was the first time that there had been apparently an official announcement from inside Gaza City um meanwhile uh the you what what what appears to be happening are kind of more localized stoppages uh in in in some isolated places on the ground I don't think we're necessarily going to get an official announcement from the Israeli government about a humanitarian pause I think it's going to be more localized stoppages for people to be able to access Aid uh so far um uh yesterday we are told that 86 trucks uh crossed from Rafa in Egypt into Gaza carrying aid but that is still just a drop in the ocean in terms of the needs on the ground thank you very much that's our correspondent there in southern Israel Mark Lauren
