we start with a developing story this hour that Hamas says its Deputy political leader Salah alarri has been killed in a blast in Beirut the capital of Lebanon local media have described the explosion as an Israeli drone attack on the Hamas office in the south of the city Reports say five other people were killed in the blast video footage shows a car in flames and damaged to buildings in a busy residential area which is known as a Hezbollah stronghold well within the last hour and advisor to the Israeli Prime Minister has said that Israel has not taken responsibility for that attack but they say it was not an attack on the Lebanese State saying whoever did this did a surgical strike against the Hamas leadership well Hamas has blamed Israel for the strike earlier I spoke to our correspondent in Jerusalem about the reaction from Israeli authorities and we did reach out to them after local media as you've mentioned Ben um attributed this blast to an Israeli drone attack we reached out to the IDF who came back to the BBC and said they would not comment um on reports from foreign media um we did get confirmation that it's that Salah aluri the uh Deputy head or the deputy chairman of hamas's Po Bureau um has been killed in this blast and we have had uh we've had reaction from lebanon's caretaker prime minister naib mikati he described the blast um as a as a new Israeli War crime that aims to drag Lebanon uh into a new phase of the conflict according to what he said we also um got this line just now from Mark RV an adviser to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he was speaking to the American Network MSNBC and said that Israel did not take responsibility for the attack but quote whoever did it it must be clear that this was not an attack on the Lebanese State whoever did this it was a surgical strike against the Hamas leadership confirming there that a senior Hamas official has been killed um in this blast I think it's very significant and it's worth pointing out who was skilled but also where he was killed you refer to it um Salah Lori was killed in the dah the southern district which is seen as a hisbah stronghold Hamas and hisbah have very close a very close um relationship salahi himself um is very involved in hamas's military structure he was one of the people that formed the um aadin Kasam brigades the military wing of Hamas so this is a very Hamas senior official right up in the pit Bureau of the group killed in Hezbollah stronghold yes and Sean you mentioned this as well there will be a lot of nervousness right now and we've talked about this before about the potential for this Israel Gaza crisis to escalate beyond the borders of Gaza and Israel and this could be a sense that that is happening um what do we know and and you touched on the response we've had both from the IDF but the authorities there about it being a targeted strike but it will make a lot of people very nervous that this crisis is spreading it will make a lot of people very nervous especially of course um in Lebanon but look if if if what you can read in nij MTI the the Lebanese prime minister he is accusing Israel of dragging Lebanon into this conflict and also remember as we as you say Israel has not taken responsibility for this attack but the timing of it this comes as the northern border between Israel and Lebanon has been heating up quite a bit with a continued exchange of fire with very very strong rhetoric from the Israeli um leadership whether it's Benjamin Netanyahu or uh or the you know a war cabinet minister or the defense minister they've all Ratched up the rhetoric that if hasbalah is not going to be limited um and pulled back from the border that Israel was going to do it we cannot draw a direct line between what's happening in on the border and this but the timing of it makes this extremely volatile right now in the region that's shalil there with the very latest on what we know so far
