well the government is writing to universities in England for the second time in the last few weeks warning them that not enough is being done to stop the rise of anti-Semitic incidents on campuses some Pro Palestinian students say they've also been let down by the way universities have responded to the conflict in the Middle East our education correspondent Elaine Dunley has been talking to students to hear their experiences we are seeing so much intimidation so much hatred so much abuse which Jewish students are get the union of Jewish students they've been inundated with incidents of anti-Semitism there's been a significant increase in Jewish students saying they no longer feel safe at University there are Jewish students reporting threats of physical assault there are Jewish students who are questioning whether they should be outwardly displaying their Jewish identity there are Jewish they should even be attending their lectures on the phone there are images and messages Jewish students have received most are too graphic to show it's calling for violence it saying where should be violence towards Israelis towards Jewish people and again I can imagine these poor students who are seeing these things these postgraduate students are members of a Palestinian Society in Oxford activism has replaced academic life fre free palese they feel let down by the university and say whilst they have been offered mental health support the conflict in Gaza has not had the same response as other Wars uh when Russia invaded Ukraine the University made a clear and strong uh statement condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine rightfully so it makes us wonder when and why the university decides to act in some cases of humanitarian crisis and not in others in a statement the University of Oxford says it's been clear in calling for a peaceful solution for the peoples of Israel and Palestine universities play a critical role in encouraging debate and freedom of speech but with a conflict where words have failed to describe the grimness or find a solution managing discussions and demos on campuses are difficult we want to recognize and ensure that the right for All Views is is maintained and we create a circumstance for those to be articulated provided it's not violating the law it's not inciting hatred when people put our safe space at risk we will act and I will do so not only to protect Jewish students but I'll do so to protect Palestinian students cease fire now cease fire now for some students the war and a humanitarian crisis thousands of miles away has brought fear and anger to university life here in the UK Ela Dunley BBC News
