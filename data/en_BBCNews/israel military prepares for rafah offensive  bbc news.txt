Israel's war cabinet is meeting to discuss a possible major military operation in Rafa in southern Gaza despite growing calls against it Israel says it hopes to launch an assault on remaining Hamas battalions in Rafa Aid groups and Western allies have warned Israel not to carry out a fullscale attack more than a million displaced people are taking shelter in Rafa as part of its Invasion Israel is planning to evacuate civilians out of the city well satellite images shown show two new tent encampments in southern Gaza one at a site to the west of carun and another site near Rafa by comparing this satellite image from the 7th of April with this image from the 23rd of April we can see the tents were put up this month meanwhile Hamas have released a video appearing to show an Israeli American hostage HH Goldberg Poland in captivity the short undated video showing the man in his early 20s missing his lower arm he was shown saying he had sustained serious inj injuries during the October the 7th attack there's been anger in Jerusalem with some Gathering near prime minister netanyahu's official residents demonstrators have been calling on the Israeli government to do more to secure an agreement to release the hostages there were also clashes between police and protesters and the police also had to escort farri Israeli National Security minister itamar benav to his car through the crowd of chanting protesters while H Goldberg Poland's parents have responded to the video of their son leading for negotiating parties to reach a deal my name is Rachel and this is John and we are the parents of hirs Goldberg Poland an American Israeli civilian who was kidnapped into Gaza 2011 days ago seeing a video of HS today is overwhelming we're relieved to see him alive but we are also concerned about his health and wellbeing as well as that of all of the other hostages and all of those suffering in this region and we're here today with a plea to all of the leaders of the parties who have been negotiating to date that includes Qatar Egypt the United States Hamas and Israel be brave lean in seize this moment and get a deal done to reunite all of us with our loved ones and to end the suffering in this region and H if you can hear this we heard your voice today for the first time in 201 days and if you can hear us I am telling you we are telling you we love you stay strong survive our diplomatic correspondent James landelle spoke to me earlier he explained more about those plans for a military assault on Rafa T cities are being built uh to try and have a place where civilians can go during this military operation where there are reports of senior Israeli officials meeting with their their uh Egyptian counterparts uh in Cairo because clearly there is a huge risk for uh Egypt that this conflict this operation spills over uh into Egypt we know that a couple of uh battalions of Israeli Army reservice have been mobilized but that said uh the Israeli government has still yet to decide how and when it's going to carry out this operation that's one thing they're discussing today we also know that um Israel's allies have not yet given any support for this uh particularly the United States Jake Sullivan the US National Security advisor said last night that look the US and Israel are still talking about this and they he said there are different ways of dealing with the threat of Hamas in southern uh Gaza so the Americans have yet to give any kind of green light and I think the key thing to understand is that this is going to be a process uh it's going to take some time to move hundreds of thousands of people out of Rafa into to some you know tent sort of you know humanitarian Islands to use the Israeli language you know that's not going to happen quickly uh and any military operation that's not going to happen quickly so I think what we're expecting is some more of a process rather than a one-off event yeah and James what reaction has there been to the release of the video of the hostage HS Goldberg pollen well as you said um almost instant uh demonstrations here in Jerusalem once again people taking to the streets to say look this is just a reminder to the uh Israeli government that they need to focus more in their view on the hostage situation and not just on the the the taking the fight to Hamas now that many people here are interpreting was precisely why this hostage video was released was once again for Hamas to try and put some pressure back on the Israeli government not just because that's what they want to do but also maybe to say to the Israelis look these these hostages are still alive if you want to do a deal let's talk let's see if we can get something agreed thus far it's proved impossible but the aim is to put pressure back on also a hint that maybe Kata was saying to Hamas look you need to to show another Proof of Life video just to get the ball rolling again well talking of the ball rolling again what is happening are there any sense of any talks resuming when it comes to a ceasefire hostage deal no not at the moment uh it just seems that both sides are too far apart on all the substantive issues how long should there be a secession a pause in the fighting who amongst the is Palestinian prisoners should be released and when which hostages should be released and when and which or and in what order all of those issues they've yet to reach any kind of agreement on uh and at the moment with the focus in recent days having been on the clash between Iran and Israel and now the focus returning to Rafa the expectation is that those talks on any kind of ceasefire or a hostage release are going to be put on hold unless something can change
