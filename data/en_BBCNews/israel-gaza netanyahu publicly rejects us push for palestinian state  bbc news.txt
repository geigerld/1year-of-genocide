the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has told the United States He opposes the establishment of a Palestinian State once the conflict in Gaza comes to an end in a news conference Mr Netanyahu said Israel must have security control of all territory west of the River Jordan which would include the territory of any future Palestinian State there's been a critical response from Washington US state department spokesman said there was no way to ensure Israel's long-term sec security without a two-state solution many nations including the US have long called for a two-state solution in which a future Palestinian state would sit side by side with an Israeli one Mr Netanyahu however has spent much of his political career opposing Palestinian statehood let's have a listen to what he told Thursday's news conference in any arrangement in the foreseeable future with a settlement or without a settlement Israel needs security control over all territory west of the Jordan River this is a necessary condition and it clashes with the idea of Palestinian sovereignty what can you do I tell this truth to our American friends and I also stopped the attempt to impose a reality on us that would harm Israel's security the Prime Minister needs to be capable of saying no to our friends saying no when necessary and saying yes when possible benan yah who there Ben Menan rad is a senior fellow at the University of California burkel Center for international relations and a lecturer in Middle East studies he says he's not surprised by Mr netanyahu's comments it doesn't facilitate the pathway towards a solution that I think will bring a diplomatic end to the crisis but given netanyahu's stance historically as your U reporter indicated it's it's consistent with his position for a long while but it's it's not going to move move things forward is it is he is he being realistic oh no he's not being realistic I if the solution the goal is to get the hostages released and to create a secure and stable environment to prevent incidents like October 7th from happening it's by all accounts it's difficult to do without creating a viable pathway towards a Palestinian State we're seeing divisions in netanyahu's own cabinet over that very same issue and I think very much he and his uh right-wing members of his Coalition stand alone on this um and what do you make of him publicly uh coming out to rebuke the United States on this well this is very much for internal domestic consumption again he has extremist members of his cabinet and he's holding on to a very thin Coalition in his ruling government so if he doesn't come out and Proclaim and stake these positions that he needs to maintain he risks losing the support of those members of parliament who are in effect keeping him in power my colleague the leaza Burak speaking to Benjamin rad
