you're watching the context it's time for our weekly segment AI [Music] decoded welcome to Aid decoded that time of the week when we look in depth at some of the more eye-catching stories in the world of artificial intelligence so we're going to start with futurism which reports that uh the humans behind the accounts of virtual influences or AI generated characters that masquerade is the real thing on social media media are now pasting fake faces onto the bodies of Real Models meanwhile Business Insider asks whether AI will put an end to gen Z's obsession with becoming an influencer after Major Brands begin to show interest in using AI models instead of humans Mashable says a misc captioned video falsely claiming to be an Iranian missile strike on Tel Aviv was promoted as legitimate by social media platform X fake headline quote Iran strikes Tel Aviv with heavy missiles was apparently generated by X's own official AI chatbot The Verge looks at Ai and copyright in the US a new bill could force uh tech companies to disclose any copyrighted materials they use to train their AI models the bill from representative uh Adam shift would require anyone making a training data set for AI to to submit reports on its contents to the copyrights register there's been a pet hate of teachers everywhere but not in Texas where they plan to replace thousands of human exam markers with artificial intelligence it's believed the AI graded tests could save $20 million a year that's from Tech spot and finally popular science uh future AI developer Google deepmind who are now able to train tiny off-the-shelf robots to play soccer uh we'll show you a bit of that later with me is priia Lani who's CEO of century Tech and artificial intelligence education technology company that develops AI powered learning tools thanks very much for coming on the program good to see you great to see you okay we're going to start now with this AI influences so artificial influence we we can take a look at um a little bit of what we are talking about so those AI influen are deep faking fake faces onto real women's bodies without permission and the the subheading there is it's a real problem is that is that how you see it yeah absolutely so the first story is about these people that are taking the real bodies of women mostly and then they're putting on a deep fake face right and then they're posting that and earning money actually from it most of the time on competitive of only fans which is a platform where essentially creators can put on their own content now in the context of only fans um more creators on only fans are women rather than men um 85% of the top 10% of earners are women and an average Creator Le just to give you a bit of context right earns about $180 a month so this is a business for some of these creators where they're you know using their own images their own bodies and creating that content and so essentially their content and their videos are being ripped off right because then you superimpose an AI face and post it elsewhere and you make money off that content so firstly you're violating personal rights yes but the second thing you're doing is obviously infringing on the the woman the creators intellectual property um and 300 people I think 300 odd odd creators have surpassed a million dollars annually earning money from from doing this so they have a very good right to be very very upset about this so it is a real problem and just just so you you get it personally this took me six 60 seconds to do actually if we can put it up on on the screen so I created one of you but actually so because there are so many tools that allow us to do this so This literally took me less than a minute actually I've done the reverse here I've got your face but I've actually changed your body yeah right you look great casual Lewis but but and so that's a bit of fern but can we have a look at it in this context so I just created this before I got here so I didn't have time to send it to the producers but if you look at my iPad leis so I took a video of you okay on BC just lift Okay so we've got you on the BBC presenting okay um a story about Tik Tok so hopefully the viewers can see that I apologize this is really last minute yeah and then uh through magic hour AI I've mashed your face with Christians Christian phrases oh my that is a terrifying thought in every way right but you see how this is you in your day job right so I've got your body I've got your I've got the BBC thankfully it stopped it stopped right so you and Christian together that's what you guys would look like um but what's interesting about that I think your your floor manager is laughing no one can hear that right now um the reason that's really important to show is that that is you in your day job and so creators are obviously creating this content you know which we we've shown um viewers and they're earning money from it so not only is it a personal affront but it's also a professional affront well and how do you you just knock knocked that up pretty quickly and pretty disturbing that's in the cab on the way here and and so how do you how do you begin to try and stop that how if it's so easy how do you how can you try and stop well and I think some of the some of the stories that we're going to come on to will help with this but obviously the input here is a an infringement right it's an infringement of Ip rights so there are laws um to protect uh copyright and we're going to talk about that in a minute in a future story but what's really important is when we're talking about this sort of generative AI okay separate it into two areas separate it into the input this is really important for the rest of how regulation and law develops in this area separate AI into the training data what was the input what data was used to train the artificial intelligence models yes and then the output what came out of the other side right now actually in the cases in the story The reason why it's just so blatant is because the output is also substantially similar right to the input okay so how do you do that well there are laws to protect in these areas is but what I find and find really really difficult is the fact that law is sometimes so expensive and difficult to access for some people so it's not actually as as Fair as saying well you know you've got recourse okay let's look at this is very very linked as you were talking Business Insider Jen's fading dream human influences are being replaced by artificial intelligence and maybe that's a good thing yeah well so so apparently a lot of gen Zed and I got anywhere from half of genz to a quarter of gened that's a lot of gen Zed want to be influencers that's the future career aspiration of of of these young people about 25% of marketers work with influencers and and again it's a job for them right so when it comes to influencers they earn a lot of money um they they create content they partner with brands for example and Brands find this really great because the return on investment from an influencer promoting your content is higher on average than if you just advertise your content so a brand would earn an average of about just over $5 in Media value for every $1 spent on an influencer so it's a huge Market but the reason why this article is basically saying your hopes and dreams no longer going to be alive right genz said is because people are using AI influencers these are completely fictitious which is what we're seeing right now so this woman here is not a real woman that's AI on top no that's AI absolutely that's yeah exactly so they're using AI to actually you know and and why right because it's cheaper right so if I can do that in a few minutes right if you're doing it where you're not substantially copying this is a different story right this is not about copying on on real pp's bodies but if you can create truly original con original output content I should say otherwise every Tech is going to have a goat me saying hang on what was the input okay but you can do that cheaper Brands can do that cheaper you don't have to pay people money you could run many characters on platforms yourself you don't have to deal with any egos that would be pretty cool right the video to me the presenter ego absolutely talking and and and so therefore this is a potential solution to that issue but I tell you what could happen right which is really interesting if you end up with AIS right out there influencing and partnering with Brands right the the most the area that most uses influences is lifestyle and second is beauty right the point is is that you trust influencers that's why they work are you going to trust an AI putting cream on their face saying my visible in my 40s lines have disappeared so actually that authenticity of the human I think will become even more valuable in the future so therefore therefore still Del a potential career path right we're going to move on to Mashable we're going to whip through a couple of these stories now Elon musk's X pushed a fake headline about Iran attacking Israel uh talk us through this because this is potential real world warning signal yeah and this is what actually people have been talking about for so long so the fact that we're just seeing it play out is actually really really sad um for for the people that have been in this space for years talking about this so essentially all that happened was that um there was content onx right that was fake news right the fact that it stated that Iran was responsible for these strikes actually that's the footage was from Ukraine I think uh launching strikes against Russians in Crimea um but anyway it was it was fake news and then grock which is uh Elon musk's big investment in generative AI um that operates on the X platform took essentially this content saw it as a trending topic made up this is an AI right made up its own headline made up its own contextualized story all fake news and then actually posted that to X users and and the problem with this obviously is it's dangerous and it reminds you of that 1938 a and Wells story where War of the Worlds right where he was on the radio and he was actually talking about martians and Aliens descending on Earth people tuned in a bit late and there was mass hysteria apparently people left their homes so how you can have an influence by posting fake news is real this is really dangerous and disinformation in fake news has to be tackled and we need to hurry up right in terms of Regulation and I mean you know ex ex is already in trouble with the EU at the moment and I think it's only a matter of time really you know for for other states to take action as well okay we're going to have a look at legislation attempts anyway The Verge a new Bill wants to reveal what's really inside AI training data so what's the attempt here yeah okay so this is very much linked to all of this right so the input data so what's happened here is Adam Schiff who is um I believe a you're going to correct me a Democrat sen Senator have I got that right but he's proposed a bill to the House of Representatives where essentially any generative AI platforms would have to list if the bill was passed so post Bill not not the current platforms with their current training data just to be clear um any copyright sources copyrighted sources that they've used to train their data models which actually gives you that transparency of what's been used right the EU already have this um in their in their drafts uh for the EU um AI act so so essentially it would it would it would put you on this Level Playing Field with the EU and the UK is saying that people in the UK saying we should hurry up as well and so it gives you that transparency of what has been the input content so when there are cases there are plenty of lawsuits at the moment for example John Grisham and a bunch of authors the New York Times has taken open AI to court it would give content creators and copyright holders the ability to to essentially check if their content has been used and if copyright has been infringed I see but it's not law yet so we keep an eye on it see how it see how it develops it's moving quickly okay uh we're going to stay in the US Texas is replacing thousands of human exam scorers with AI this is from Tech spot uh how is this going to work this is really interesting right so it does cost millions and millions of pounds in the UK dollars in the US all over the world to Mark exam scripts so they've changed the exam in Texas so that it has more long form answers so less multiple choice exact short answer and they're going to be using trained AI models to Mark students answers now before you look really skeptical okay what I would say is if you look at gcses in the UK in England for example if you look at the GCSE papers and long form answers for example in a history essay right actually it's pretty proven that marking can be a bit skew whiffing cases because you have the human marking and it can be sometimes quite subjective even if you have a rubric and a mark scheme and we've actually developed this sort of Technology at Cent as well when it comes to literacy what you do is you train your own proprietary models you don't just plug it into a GPT why because when a third party upgrades its own models actually you don't know what changes have been made and then you can see a prompt that you enter today could actually give you a completely different answer next time and then you use the exam scripts you look at the you essentially constantly have this human evaluation which is what Texas will do they've trained it on 3,000 transcripts they'll mark Mark and save lots of money and apparently need to use 2,000 people rather than 6,000 people this year but it actually is an ongoing investment because every time an exam takes place you take lots of scripts you look at the scripts where there was a low probability of those scripts being marked properly you retrain your models and it's an ongoing process very quickly that seems to make sense and I can't imagine marking script after script if you're a human teacher or exam is the most fun so that's po I bet some of them find it really fun actually I'm Jud it's an we have 30 seconds left do you want to watch some cute little robots playing football of course you do let's take a look at that right just in 20 seconds priia what's going on so essentially Deep Mind have built these mini robots playing football they use what's called Deep reinforcements learning it's a really really powerful technique in artificial intelligence where you look at all the permutations of how a football uh play might take place you reward the system or you punish it if it doesn't for example score a goal and then they're basically through Brute Force training it with tons and tons of data using deep learning as well so the technique is super interesting and here you go will will one of those be lifesized and play for Man United and help my team I don't know hopefully oh he's falling over again it is adorable when they fall over right priia amazing thank you so much we're are out of time thank you thanks Lou
