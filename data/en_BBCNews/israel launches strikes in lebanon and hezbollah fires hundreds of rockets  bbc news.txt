we begin in the Middle East where Israel's prime minister has promised he will do everything to restore security at its northern border with Lebanon that's after the Israeli Defense Forces launched air strikes against Hezbollah Israel says it identified preparations for a large scale attack now these pictures just released by the IDF show them attacking a number of Hezbollah targets Israel's defense minister has issued a 48-hour state of emergency in the country now meanwhile Hezbollah that it launched more than 300 rockets and drones at Israel and targeted 11 military sites in response to the killing of its top commander in Beirut last month the group has said this was an initial response and that it has completed phase one of an attack on Israel these are live pictures from the Israel Lebanon border which has had a number of missile strikes in the last couple of hours and this was the idf's announcement earlier from IDF spokesperson rear Admiral Daniel Hagi from right next to the homes of Lebanese civilians in the south of Lebanon we can see that kisala is preparing to launch an extensive attack on Israel while endangering the lebanes civilians we warn the civilians located in the areas where kisala is operating to move out of Harm's Way immediately for their own safety hisis bala's ongoing aggression risks dragging the people of Lebanon the people of Israel and the whole region into a wider escalation Israel will not tolerate bala's attacks on our civilians we are operating in self-defense from kisala and any other enemy that joins in their attacks against us and we are ready to do everything everything we need to defend the people of Israel there's the IDF specs person Daniel hagari well meanwhile the Pentagon has said in its words the US is postured to support Israel and the President Joe Biden has instructed officials to maintain close communication on developments well Laura blumenfield is a Middle East analyst and former senior policy adviser on the state Department's Israeli Palestinian negotiating team she told us more about the strikes and reactions from both parties the Israelis have called for a 48-hour period of emergency their Secretary of Defense their defense minister Galant um you know is is calling on the population so it's not just one night you know one and done on the other hand so much about these exchanges of since October 7th has been not so much about being strong but being smart and so it's kind of our intelligence versus your intelligence kind of battle here the Israelis were clearly caught by surprise on October 7th the shooker assassination was an intelligence coup for Israel as was the hania assassination um into heran so I think his Bala is is feeling like they need to show that they can in some way penetrate um and kind of shift that kind of dignity back into balance it's possible that you know they they already have it's horrible to say but wounded one person in AKO which is quite deep into Israeli territory that that might satisfy the need uh you know for publicly Saving Face now also just one update for you the Lebanese Ministry according to uh news agencies as well as local reports uh is saying that one died in the Israeli uh strike in uh the south of Lebanon our News correspondent John donison is in Jerusalem and he told us about the fears of escalations in the region this is clearly a significant and ongoing escalation we're not at the point of fulls scale War yet but that is clearly uh the fear not just here in Israel but in Lebanon and The Wider region Israel saying around a 100 fighter jets uh were used in this operation last night hitting around 200 Targets in Lebanon now if that's the case then that is the most serious attack on Hezbollah since the full scale war between Israel and Lebanon uh back in 2006 now you know in the last few weeks we've seen intense diplomatic efforts to try and stop the crisis in Gaza escalating into a wider regional conflict uh but the United States has warned that the failure to get a ceas fire and hostage release deal in Gaza uh could see uh this escalate into wider regional conflict at the at the moment judging on what's happened to this morning you'd have to say that those diplomatic efforts have not worked and John hisbah has said that this was in response to the killing of its top Commander fad shuk on the 30th of July of course there's also the fact that isil hania was assassinated in Iran uh and that Iran which backs hisbah also vowed a strong response I wonder whether putting all of this into context can we see this as Tit for Tat or is that the real risk that this could uh meet further responses from Hezbollah as well as Iran well I think TI fat kind of downplays the significance of this you know when Israel assass uh is believed to have assassinated the leader of Hamas is melhan in Teran uh the day before they had assassinated uh as you say a very senior Hezbollah commander in Le on F shoker and we have been waiting for some sort of response from Iran and from Hezbollah now in the past few weeks that response has not really come there has been some crossborder activity between Hezbollah and Israel in the north but not really significant until this morning and we've not had any kind of response uh from Iran to uh the targeting of Ismael hania inside the Iranian Capital so the fears have been for the last few weeks that that response was coming uh and certainly from the north from Hezbollah we've got something this morning and John uh you're in Jerusalem we've been hearing these reports of sirens that have been uh blaring in in Israel as well in certain cities um I wonder what your assessment is of the security situation in Israel especially given that the New York Times is reporting that uh this attack by Hezbollah was also aiming Tel Aviv yeah and of course Tel Aviv is deep into Israel it's in central Israel really so uh that would be hugely significant if they manag to penetrate uh Israel's uh missile defense system uh here in Jerusalem this morning I have to say it feels relatively normal I'm sure lots of people will be waking up and reading the news and have uh concerns we did see some military helicopters flying uh across the sky earli this morning some heading north uh but certainly in Jerusalem it feels uh relatively normal at the moment well a reminder you'll see a QR code on your screen that will take you to our BBC News live page on our website and app where our correspondents are providing updates and Analysis our BBC News Room is also bringing in any reaction and information as it comes in the meantime here on the news channel let's speak to our senior International correspondent who's in southern Lebanon that's Alla Garen Alla uh good to have you now given all your experience and your time there could you put this into perspective for us because the New York Times is reporting that Tel Aviv was a Target we know that benguan is now open the international airport is open but when you look back at this war how significant an escalation is this well we know that the Israelis are saying Tel Aviv would have been targeted but that didn't actually happen because of their preemptive strike we're certainly in a new stage as a day we had been expecting this retaliation for some time now it was at the end of last month that an Israeli strike killed a senior a top Hezbollah commander fuad shuker in the heart of hezbollah's stronghold in southern Beirut a place called dahia and Hezbollah had vowed it would respond now similarly the Iranians had vowed they would respond for the assassination of the Hamas leader ISM hania in tran both had held off and the feeling had been that they were waiting to see how the ceasefire attempts being uh led by the Americans and the Egyptians and the cateres would play out well certainly Hezbollah is waiting no more they said in a statement this morning that this was the first phase of a large scale operation and that its full response would take some time and that the punishment will be harsh and severe now I think we need to look carefully at the targets that were hit by hbet today so far uh they were 11 military targets inside Israel so not critical infrastructure not civilian areas but military Targets this is according to Hezbollah we have had no reports from Israel yet of any casualties and certainly no reports of Civilian casualties similarly on this side in Lebanon the Israelis have hit U more than 200 t targets they say but we have not received any reports of Civilian casualties I should tell you as day that about 30 or 40 minutes ago in the Hills behind us we saw two very large plumes of smoke um from two two detonations two explosions Israel had obviously struck close to the Border area which is in that direction but I think the key to this is that so far we are not being told that any civilians have been injured or killed because that again uh could be the the trigger for another escalation it's by no means clear when Hezbollah plans to carry out its next phase it says it will happen uh but it certainly may not happen today so I think for now uh Israel has got its preemptive strike in Hezbollah has managed to fire by its own account 320 Rockets into Israel and sending some drones so for the moment Hezbollah has made its Point H now we have to see if Israel is going to take further action all right Ola Garen there thank you for all that insight and again Alla there has raised that there are still a lot of questions that haven't been answered uh including uh verifying the nature of those military targets uh as well as how things could develop of course
