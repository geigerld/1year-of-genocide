let's turn to the Middle East where Hamas has issued a statement stressing what it called its positivity in negotiations on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza Hamas also rejected a claim by the US Secretary of State that they presented unworkable changes to the deal Anon blinkin said that American and other mediators will work over the coming days to see if they can reach an agreement for a ceasefire in Gaza well we are Middle East correspondent yoland n is in Jerusalem and joins us now on the line and um yoland why do you think Hamas is issuing this statement when the US Secretary of State has already criticized their response to the ceasefire deal I mean really Hamas is coming out here uh defending its own position we heard um from the US top Diplomat Anthony blinkin when he was in Doha yesterday having um looked through this Hass reply to the latest three-phase plan that was outlined by President Biden back on the 31st of May that Hamas was uh demanding changes some of which were seen as being relatively minor um a later um a White House official said they were not on anticipated those changes but there were also changes there which Mr blinkin described as being unworkable and going Beyond uh previous positions laid out by Hamas so in this short statement Hamas says that it had uh signed up to a deal back on the the 6th of May but then afterwards pointed out that Israel began uh in Earnest its military offensive in Rafa this ground and Air Assault um and then it said also uh that um while Mr blinken was speaking about Israeli approval of the latest plan it wasn't hearing that same approval coming uh from Israeli officials so it's asking the US to put more pressure on Israel uh to agree to this new ceasefire plan and nevertheless uh yoland at the end of his visit uh blinkin saying he was optimistic that a ceasefire deal could be reached how is his latest tour of the region being viewed there I mean certainly this was a a Fast Trip Around the region by Mr blink and a very timely one uh given that the Hamas response came through at this point it was just after um there was a shift in his Politics as well after the Centrist Minister Benny Gan seen as someone the Americans could talk to uh left the emergency wartime government of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu making him more reliant on hardliners so Mr blinken knew that he had his work cut out for him as he went around the region trying uh to push um Hamas in particular but also for Israel to kind of sign up uh to this deal we got the message from mediators that they were going to continue their negotiations to try to bridge the gap uh between the two sides and some reports um uh certainly in the Israeli media today about what some of the changes are um that Hamas um is demanding which give us an idea of what negotiations May Center on uh they're saying that Hamas is wanting a complete say on uh exactly which Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli jails in exchange for those Israeli hostages being released uh by Hamas from Gaza um that Israel should withdraw according to Hamas uh in the first uh few days um of the uh of the plan um they should withdraw from the main road which is currently dividing um the North and the South of Gaza that would presumably allow uh displace people from the South to go back to their homes uh in the north um other specifications around that as well and they're also asking Hamas apparently for uh International guarantees that there would be a move from the the first phase um of this three-phase plan which is supposed to be for a temporary truce with hostages being released to the second phase which is supposed to work towards a permanent uh end to fighting and and see the remaining hostages uh coming back and we know from you know comments by different Hamas officials they've had a lot of concerns around that uh meanwhile we've had Israeli officials in recent days who have come out insisting that Israel uh remains determined to meet its War objective of defeating Hamas in Gaza your land thank you that's the BBC's your land now in Jerusalem there
