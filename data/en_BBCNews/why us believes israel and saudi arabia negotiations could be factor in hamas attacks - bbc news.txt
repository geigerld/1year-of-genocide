there's a lot of attention on why Hamas carried out the attack on Israel now and there's one factor America has highlighted here's one thing that's uh that's clear uh we've been actively working on trying to help Israel and Saudi Arabia normalize their relations normalize here means to establish formal ties such as setting up embassies and creating other diplomatic and economic links and America believes the Hamas attack May connect to this push for normalization now who's opposed to that Hamas Hezbollah Iran uh so I think that speaks volumes Hamas is an islamist militant group based in Gaza Hezbollah is an islamist militant group based in Lebanon both groups are armed and funded by Iran all three consider themselves part of a resistance to Israel and on the Hamas attack the UN is unequivocal its Secretary General says nothing can justify these acts of Terror but Hamas has tried to justify the attack it cites what it calls Israel's crimes against the Palestinians and its repeated storming of alaka mosque that's a reference to the actions of Israeli police at Jerusalem's most important holy site for Muslims and for Jews and this year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians in the Israeli occupied West Bank though Israel has defended its actions throughout Hamas will also have known its attack was almost 50 years to the day since a surprise attack by Egypt and Syria on the Jewish holy day of yum kapor there was something else in hamas's list of grievances normalization that same factor that America pointed to so let's look at this because what's being called normalization is in fact far from normal in the region because for decades most Arab states didn't recognize the state of Israel in 2020 that started to change the US broker deals with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in which they normalized relations with Israel but Palestinians weren't involved neither the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank led by makad Abbas nor Hamas which controls Gaza and they both denounced the normalization deals at the time BBC's Jeremy Bowen explained that the new agreement breaks a long-standing Arab consensus that the price of normal relations with Israel was Independence for the Palestinians in other words in the eyes of its critics normalization weakens the Palestinian cause and now the US is brokering new normalization talks that are even more significant this time with Saudi Arabia one of the Region's most powerful countries and in September Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Washington and he expressed hope that what he called a historic peace with the Saudis was possible I think such a peace would go a long way first to advance the end of the Arab Israeli conflict uh achieve reconciliation between the Islamic world and the Jewish State and Advance a genuine peace between us well on the Palestinians and unlike previous normalization talks this time Palestinians have been involved but not all Palestinians in September a high level Saudi delegation visited the occupied West Bank for the first time in decades it met Mahmud Abbas leader of the Palestinian Authority now to be clear there's no deal yet the US has said the talks are incredibly difficult but to supporters of normalization the prize here is huge in the words of one Israeli newspaper Saudi Israel normalization would transform the Middle East but this push for better Saudi Israel relations has left Hamas wanting to derail the process Hamas officials have mentioned that they want to send a message to um their to Arab leaders that they can't be ignored that Arabs can't just make deals with Israel and expect to get peace Iran had a message too this is its supreme leader in early October before the Hamas attack countries that use the gamble of normalization with the Zionist regime as a method for themselves will lose and a loss awaits them they are making a mistake Zionist regime is a reference to Israel Iran refuses to use Israel's name it also denies being behind the Hamas attack and americ says it's not seen evidence that it was and if Iran and Hamas have points to make on normalization so does Israel since the attack its US ambassador has urged everyone who has a stake in peace and normalization in the Middle East should support an outcome that would deal a blow to Iran and its proxies to Israel to the UN the US the UK the EU and many others no reason can justify this mass murder of civilians this war crime but in quite different ways Hamas and America both say normalization was a factor in why this attack happened now America and Israel's desire for normalization is matched by hamas's desire to stop it for now though Israel is in shock in mourning and at War normalization will have to wait
