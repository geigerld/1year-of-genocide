there are encouraging and strong signals tonight that the temperary ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas due to end at midnight tomorrow could be extended now the deal so far has led to hostages being freed that were seized by Hamas which is designated as a terrorist organization by the UK government in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails and crucially an influx of much needed Aid into Gaza well so far over three nights 40 Israeli hostages have returned home with these 14 released this evening and another group expected to be freed sometime tomorrow a number of other hostages from Thailand Russia and the Philippines have also been released as part of separate negotiations in return 117 Palestinian prisoners have been freed to 39 today well all has the very latest rejoicing in Israel after the darkness of recent weeks the latest group of hostages freed from Gaza waved to supporters as they are welcomed home both Israel and Hamas are signaling their deal could be extended to free more of those being held for reun like this after 50 days apart young hostages finally home Emily hand embraced by her father Thomas who at one stage believed her dead now she is free and he says doing well yeah yesterday we finally got Emily back from the hands of the G and terrorists uh she lost a lot of weight um from her face and body uh but generally doing better than we expected Emily's Family say they will throw her the biggest birthday party ever she turned nine in captivity abigil Idan has also been freed Joe Biden had been pushing for her release the four-year-old is American Israeli last killed both of her parents also back in Israel yafa Adar since coming home she has learned her grandson is a captive this was the 85-year-old being driven Away by Hamas a survivor of the Holocaust taken hostage her granddaughter says she is back from Hell strong as ever her spirit is still there and she's still looking all of us in the eyes and she's still showing us that uh she wouldn't let them break her and uh and she's telling us how she thought about us and about the great grandkids at night when it became tough and she she's saying uh she could hear their voices calling her and that it she said okay I have to I have to push through I have to do whatever it takes to to be back also so coming home Palestinians in their teens freed from Israeli jails many children are detained by Israel the occupying power on charges of throwing stones in the West Bank they got a hero's welcome the green flag of Hamas now Flying high in Gaza the truce is holding among Ong the ruins more than 14,000 Palestinians have been killed according to the Hamas Ron Health Ministry many in the International Community fear what's to come if Israel's bombardment resumes orar and BBC News Tel Aviv Let's cross to Lucy Williamson who is in East Jerusalem for us tonight Lucy um there's the possibility that more Palestinians could be released beyond the end of the current deal if there is an extension yes and I think that will come as welcome news to many people in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem not just because it means more Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails but also because of the sense of kinship that many people feel with people in Gaza and concern for the situation there Israel has put restrictions on many of the families who are receiving people back from jail saying they shouldn't hold celebrations they shouldn't talk to the media but there's very little mood for big celebrations as it is because people have told us they do feel anger and sadness at the situation in Gaza we spoke to one mother in the West Bank this week who was waiting for her son to come off one of these uh coaches from from the Israeli jail and she said she felt conflicted about what Hamas had done on the one hand she said it brought her son back to her on the other hand it caused the devastation in Gaza indeed okay Lucy thank you Lucy Williamson there uh in East Jerusalem let's get a final word from all who's here we heard Lucy there say of course Palestinians on the West Bank uh and in Gaza they're going to want an extension and President Biden has made it clear this evening that he would like to see more hostages released and an extension of the ceasefire what do you believe the next few days could hold in relation to all of this I think for the moment live it suits everyone to extend there's nothing firm there's nothing official but we've had a series of statements today that are all indicating the same thing first of all Hamas said it would like to extend the ceasefire and there was a suggestion from a Palestinian official who spoke to the BBC that this could be an extension of 2 to 4 days allowing for the release of another 20 to 40 Israeli hostages then we had President Biden saying we would like to see the deal extended this evening we had the Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu referring to the fact that the deal allows for an extension and using a phrase which translated means that would be a blessed thing so the signals are that this is something that all the sides want we have to get through tomorrow first and the release of the final batch under the existing deal so we're expecting another 13 or 14 tomorrow important to say c that Netanyahu has also said after any deal we will go back to war with full force he's under pressure from the military here not to let this pause drag on too long they want to get back to the battlefield the families of the hostages want peace as long as possible indeed
