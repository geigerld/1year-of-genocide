so what do we know about the extent of the damage in Gaza well Merlin Thomas from our BBC verifi team has been piecing together just what we know we've seen Israeli air Stripes continue on Gaza with Force now this is one of those locations a shat refugee camp and this is the aftermath residents sifting through the rubble with their bare hands searching for survivors and bodies now ashat is just on the coast here on the Gaza Strip it's the third largest refugee camp in the Palestinian territories according to the UN and remember Gaza is one of the most densely populated areas on Earth with over 2.3 million people in just 41 km long square piece of land and right now it's got closed borders and within that there are at least eight refugee camps now we've been trying to verify the extent of the damage at sh refugee camp and trying to find the same before and after images but pinpointing and matching up exact streets is almost impossible because the destruction is so bad now this is an satellite image of the site just a few days before the attack and this is Dr own footage from reuter's news agency now we don't know precisely how many were killed but the Palestinian Ministry of Health said that there was a large number and for those who were injured Gaza hospitals aren't necessarily the safest place either now gaza's Ministry says that seven hospitals were hit by is air strikes we've been unable to verify that ourselves but we have been able to verify the damage on just one of those buildings that's this one here the International Eye Hospital this is before the attack and this is what it looks like after this is posted on X formerly Twitter by a charity worker now we haven't been able to find a statement from the Israel Defense Forces on this particular hospital but recently they said that they have intelligence that shows that Hamas hides inside hospitals we haven't been able to independently verify that now Israel Defense Forces say they notify garans when an air strike is imminent now we can't verify whether that's happening right across the territory but this this is one of the ways they do that so sometimes they drop letters so these little white specks that you can see here that's them dropping letters so that people know when the strike is imminent this is sent to us by rushi Abu ALU who's our correspondent in Gaza and he sent us this video from this area of B Leia and this is what this letter says this says in Arabic so it says you know there's an attack coming imminently make sure you evacuate quickly and go to a shelter Israel has consistently said that their bombs Target military locations but as pictures continue to emerge from Gaza of entire neighborhoods reduced to Rubble it's clear that it's causing wide spread damage and that was Merlin Thomas from our BBC verified team
