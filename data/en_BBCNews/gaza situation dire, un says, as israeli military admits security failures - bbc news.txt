with me to discuss is Professor Lena ctib she is the director of the soas Middle East Institute um I hadn't seen Jery's report we watched it together I'm struck by how many of the victims in these reports are pacifists who've worked with Palestinians have picked Palestinians up from the areas Crossing they are the people in the South most at risk from graza but in a way they are in the same way closer to the Palestinians would I be right well we have to remember that in this conflict not everyone is an extremist not everyone believes in violence and there are pacifists on both sides when you're talking about pacifists who are Israeli who live near Gaza these are the people who are also observing the suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza and this perhaps makes them more likely to want to help because of you know observing the suffering of fellow human beings rather than those who are in T Aviv or West Bank who sorry or in Jerusalem who are more detached from it yeah I mean this is of course a generalization however in general communities that are isolated from others uh don't really uh know what it's like to be on the other side and so when you have communities that are completely detached from what life is like for these Palestinians then perhaps they don't even imagine the scale of the suffering it's it's I I I don't know how the parents deal with what they're hearing and and and what they're seeing um why do you think it must have been a deliberate strategy if Hamas had come in and shot the men and shot the soldiers that would be one thing but shooting children burning children slitting the throats of children that that is a deliberate strategy why why have they gone that far I mean the attack by Hamas is is unprecedented in terms of scope in terms of scale in terms of ambition Hamas wants this to be a message to Israel that this is an existential battle now and for that reason they are attacking everybody they regard everybody as a legitimate Target to instill fear in the Israeli population because they know that the Israeli State exists to protect the Jewish people and the Israeli citizens and so in attacking the civilians Hamas is basically trying to say this idea of the Israeli state is not viable so they are sending a uh psychological message to the rest of the uh Israeli population which is uh you know another tool of warfare this is psychological warfare as well as a military attack causing actual physical casualties what about the message to their own people in Gaza that too I mean Hamas wants to be seen as heroic and it's no accident that the there are lots of Palestinians who won't see this as heroic no of course not but I mean we've seen in the um reports uh people being very desperate I mean we have to look at the circumstances of people in Gaza they are so desperate that for a lot of them they feel they have no other alternative and they think either way we're dead and so we might as well get behind this kind of lost battle because what have we got to lose um it's really unfortunate I mean not everyone necessarily believes in hamas's methods or Hamas is a political entity or a military entity but for a lot of people they are so desperate that they're just getting behind Hamas for lack of other options just on the wider region because we're going to talk about that a lot this evening um this is putting enormous pressure it and it certainly will when the pictures come out of Gaza in the in the weeks ahead it's putting enormous pressure on Arab governments and the Egyptian government absolutely I mean for Saudi Arabia that had just until Saturday thought that its plan to go ahead with a deal with Israel the United States uh was kind of you know making progress of course it was talking to the Palestinian Authority about this deal to try to find some sort of solution to this conflict now that is stalled and same for Egypt president CCE of Egypt is facing an election soon and now he has a very complicated uh problem on his hands Professor KB good to see you thank you for coming in this evening um lots to discuss and we'll get into some more of that uh through the course of the program around the world and across the UK you're watching BBC News let's take a quick look at some of the other stories making news today the waiting list for Planned NHS England treatment has risen again to a new record high more than 7.7 million people were waiting to start routine treatment at the end of August it's highest number since records began routine treatment ranges from hip replacements to surgery to remove cancerous tumors the former Formula 1 boss Bernie Eon has been given a suspended prison sentence for fraud the 92-year-old billionaire pleaded guilty at Souther crime Court he admitted failing to declare more than 400 million held in a trust in Singapore to the UK government in July 2015 he received a sentence of 17 months suspended for 2 years the UK economy grew by. 2% in August according to the latest figures the office for National statistics says there was strong growth in Services which was partially offset by Falls in manufacturing and Construction in contrast some sectors fared poorly such as Arts entertainment and Recreation you're live with BBC News now there are around 150 people thought to have been taken hostage by Hamas last night we received a bit more information from the Israeli Defense Force on where they're being held they believe they've been dispersed among tunnels under Gaza in locations that were not known to be used by Hamas prior to this conflict but remember this is not just an Israeli hostage crisis there were 23 nationalities among those killed on Saturday the US said tonight that 27 Americans were killed 14 are still unaccounted for it's belied some of them will be among the hostages there's 18 French citizens that are missing including several children the French prime minister Elizabeth Bourne said they are sure that some of those were abducted by Hamas 17 British Nationals killed or abducted we don't have a breakdown yet on the numbers that have been taken so how do you get them out alive that is the task of the negotiating teams with me uh a man who is an expert Scott Walker he's a former hostage negotiator having resolved more than 300 cases in his career thank you for coming in it's good to see you um what's the Arc of a hostage crisis like this well as you can imagine in the early hours and days there's lots of High emotion uncertainty and confusion so one of the early stages is to try and build an information intelligence picture try and find out what is going on who actually has the hostages and try and engage in some kind of dialogue with them it's different though when you're dealing with an organization rather than a state or a government and the demands of Hamas are so much different to what other groups would be looking for correct well this is the challenge in this particular case because the negotiations when they take place are actually occurring in a war zone there's an extra Dimension to it as well and there are so many of them spread out across G as well as you mentioned earlier in tunnels and and and basement and what have you it seems to me that the strategy has to be keeping in the mind of the hostage takers the value of the people they're holding how do you do that absolutely it's about humanizing them and it's just to kind of reiterate right at the beginning when we talk about negotiation we're not talking about agreeing or condoning or acquiescing to the hostage takers it's actually just opening up some kind of dialogue to enable the safe And Timely release so in the case of Hamas that would be we could talk about prisoners but what you have to give us some proof of life you have to give us some proof that they're being well cared for absolutely proof of life is one of the fundamental aspects of all hostage negotiation uh and it's normally in the very early stages what about the complexity of this because as I've just described I mean I I don't know how many hostages are in there of different nationalities but we've pulled out four the French the Brits the Americans of course the Israelis who takes the lead because what you don't want to do is over complicate a situation like this well my understanding is there is a coordination cell and Situation Room set up and that will bring together the Americans through the FBI and the Brits and other National alties who have hostages taken out there as well to kind of coordinate the response to try to identify and locate where the hostages are being held and actually what are the options are including there will be options for hostage rescue perhaps as part of the the incursion that is inevitable but that obviously only increases the risk to the hostages we're going to have to brace ourselves for the inevitable film that will come out we hope against hope that it's it's not somebody paraded who is already dead but but does that as as a negotiator does that affect the give and take that tends to develop in a situation like this well it's important to remain optimistic in these and actually as I mentioned just now it is about trying to humanize the lives and the people the hostages that they've got to actually minimize the chances as much as possible of them coming to harm and actually if they want some kind of prisoner exchange they need to take care it's their responsibility for the welfare of the hostages whilst in their captivity are you hopeful yeah absolutely I think normally there's a high chance of success in hos negotiations generally and I think if this is handled well I'm hopeful for for Lam to come back Scott it's good to see you thank you for coming in
