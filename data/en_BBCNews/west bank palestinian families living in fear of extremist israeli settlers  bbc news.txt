sanctions for months bbci has been investigating settlers waging a campaign of intimidation I'm not touching don't touch and harassment against Palestinians we reveal how an organization with ties to the Israeli government has supported radical settlers and their growing presence in the West Bank a family is being forced out of their home in the Hamra area of the occupied West Bank they say they are being threatened by a Jewish settler AA and are now staying at their son Muhammad's house 10 kilometers away the person Thea family accused of leading the violence against them is this settler MOSI sharit he's become known in the area for his aggressive actions against Palestinians frequently captured in mobile phone footage filmed by peace activists since the war in razza began locals say Moshe is responsible for forcing families including theas to leave the Hamra area but Moshe paints a different picture of his presence here he is part of a movement to expand Israeli territory that began decades ago in 1967 following a war with its Arab neighbors Israel occupied the West Bank and Raza not long after Israelis began establishing settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories claiming a historical and religious connection to the Land There are now more more than 140 Urban settlements across the West Bank where more than half a million Jewish settlers live amongst three million Palestinians but Moses shavit's Farm is different it's what's known as a hering Outpost it gives settlers access to vast areas of land which has led to Violent confrontations with Palestinian communities most of the settlers in the West Bank are Israeli citizens which pay taxes do their uh military service and are low Keepers citizens okay they don't break the low AI Mizrahi is a former head of the Israeli Army in the West Bank whenever you put outposts illegally in the area it brings stands with the Palestinians that are living in the same area most Urban settlements have been approved by Israel's government and are legal under Israeli law but outposts like Moshe shavitz don't have government approval and are therefore illegal under Israeli law many are subject to demolition orders but these are rarely carried out the UN says both settlements and outposts are illegal under international law Israel disputes [Applause] this while Ultra nationalist settlers were once at the fringes of Israeli politics today they hold key positions in prime minister netanyahu's coalition government their political rise has been a boost to extremist settlers living in outposts these politicians aim to establish new outposts all over the west bank and to expand existing ones like The Outpost hav we heard about an event organized by local settlers they described it as a hike but they had a clear message to the Palestinians living in the town [Music] go began as a small Outpost with just a few families today there are around 100 Israeli families living there the hope for its residents is that eventually the Israeli government grants hav legal status making it an official settlement for the first time since they were forced to leave their home Aisha and her husband are trying to return they are joined by Israeli Peace activists that's the Ser that resides here in this Outpost he's trying to confiscate all this land this is land Palestinian Farmers say they own and have been cultivating for fore it's not long before the the Israeli Army and police arrive at the scene they tell the Palestinians and Israeli Peace activists to leave the area yesterday we for the first time announced um some sanctions against um violent settlement who were carrying out criminal acts in the West Bank Moshe shavit was one of the settlers sanctioned by the UK and later the US and the EU for violence and harassment against Palestinians just weeks after the measures were announced a local camera crew filmed an open day at his farm speaking candidly Moshe lays out the strategy behind his Outpost a key body supporting settlers is the world Zionist organization or wzo it's been around for more than a century and was instrumental in the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 one of its ski departments is the settlement division which describes itself as an arm of the Israeli State it's a body which runs very very very big part of a land which had been expropriated by the Israeli authorities in the West Bank to different Israeli settleman or settlers the settlement division doesn't publish details about its individual dealings with settlers but contracts obtained by the settlement Watchdog pieace now help us understand more they show how the settlement division allocates large areas of land for grazing and farming throughout the Bank but the contracts forbid the building of any structures one of them is for an area we know well Hamra what you see here you can see this is the contract between the W Zoo yeah and a settler which we hide his name and you can see this is the area which was allocated to him the red stains on the map yeah this is here this is where we are right now there's only one settler here in the area where the her this is M the name in the document is redacted we cannot be sure if it's mus shit's contract but the date matches when he arrived in the area but we have also found evidence of the wzo allocating land to two other settlers that have set up illegal outposts and who've later been sanctioned internationally Israel doesn't publish official figures for the number of illegal outposts but the BBC has analyzed data on outposts from settler Watchdogs organizations and the Palestinian Authority verifying each location using satellite imagery social media posts and Israeli government Publications we have independently verified that almost 200 illegal outposts have been established in the last 30 years almost half of them since 2019 the un's top court has said all settlements in the West Bank are illegal under international law Israel rejects this after repeated attempts to speak with Moses AIT we decided to visit his Outpost to question him directly I think there is a gate there's a gate as far as we're going to get we want to speak with you about the sanctions we've spoken to a lot of the Palestinian families here who say that you've used violence on them forced them out of their homes what do you have to say it was definitely you we filmed you we've spoken to a Palestinian woman who says you put a gun to her head so will you let the Palestinian families return to this area more than 5 months after being forced to leave their home Aisha and Nabil triy to return once more today moshes harat's Brother David arrives to meet them foree spee foree
