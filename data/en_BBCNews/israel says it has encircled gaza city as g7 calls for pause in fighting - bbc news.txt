intensifying there has been a very intense night again of uh Israeli shelling and Israeli air strikes in Gaza and focusing on Gaza City where Israel's defense minister now says that the Israeli troops are operating in the heart of Gaza City which the minister claims is the heart of terrorism the area is one of the most densely populated parts of the territory and has frequently been hit by the Israeli military in the last month it says it is targeting Hamas which Israel along with many other countries considers to be a terrorist organization in this bulletin we will bring you the developments from right across this region from here in Israel from inside Gaza and from Lebanon as well but we'll start this hour with the latest developments from Middle East correspondent your land now flares hanging in gaza's night sky are ominous warnings of incoming Israeli fire but increasingly the Israeli Prime Ministers being pressed for a pause in fighting I did ask you for p yest waiting this is a key moment Israeli troops are now said to be in the heart of Gaza City closing in on this stronghold of Hamas ministers say the destruction in Gaza is already immense with entire neighborhoods flattened and the civilian death toll is rapidly mounting the World Health Organization says an average of 160 children are killed here every day nothing justifies the horror being endured by the civilians in Gaza people in Gaza are dying in their thousands and those alive are suffering from trauma disease lack of food and water the level of death and suffering is hard to Fathom dozens were reportedly killed by Israeli air strikes yesterday in the southern gazen towns of hunis RAF andal in hunis Dr aad Shakura at Nasa hospital was on duty in the emergency room when he was told that his two children aged five and seven his mother his brothers their wives and their children were killed in a strike what did these children do wrong what crime did they commit to deserve tons of bombs on their heads tons of explosives on their heads Israel says that it does what it can to avoid civilian deaths in Gaza and that it's acting to eliminate Hamas it says it's destroying dozens of tunnel shafts used by its Fighters the Israeli Prime Minister continues to reject international calls for a ceasefire but now says he'll consider tactical little pauses in hostilities he added that Israel would have overall security responsibility indefinitely after the war's over yesterday marked exactly one month since the deadliest day in Israel's history vigils took place for those killed in Hames surprise crossborder attacks and some 240 women men and children still being held hostage I'm waiting and demanding they do whatever it takes to bring everyone home safely this is the time to do things that have not been done before to ensure their safe return there's huge pain and anguish on both sides in this war and there are many more difficult days ahead yoland Nell BBC News Jerusalem well it's been a very busy morning of course uh on in this military offensive that is now more than one month old let's take a look at some of the uh most recent developments President Biden said he had asked the Israeli Prime Minister uh to Benjamin Netanyahu for a pause in the fighting potentially for three days in order for progress on the hostages Mr Netanyahu has said there will be no ceasefire but he did raise the possibility of what he called tactical little pauses in hostilities Israel's Minister for strategic Affairs has said his country has no plans to govern Gaza but will ensure it remains demilitarized after the conflict the number of deaths in Gaza since the outbreak of hostilities has risen to over 10,000 according to the health Ministry there that is controlled by Hamas with more than 2,700 missing and the World Health Organization says that among the casualties 160 children on average are being killed each day in the war in Gaza well while the military offensive grinds on and the humanitarian suffering of course intensifies foreign ministers from the G7 the uh group of most industrialized nations in the world have been meeting in Japan they have just issued a joint communic and the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has also been speaking in the last few minutes let's listen to what he's had to say our first Focus here in Tokyo was the crisis in the MD East uh yesterday evening I had an opportunity to brief my colleagues on my travel through the region as well as extensive engagements by President Biden and our entire National Security team uh the G7 ministers reaffirmed our staunch support for Israel's right and obligation to defend itself and seek to ensure the attacks of October 7th can never happen again in accordance with International humanitarian law we had in-depth discussions about the steps that we are taking to address urgent needs on the ground we all agreed that humanitarian pauses would Advance key objectives to protect Palestinian civilians to increase the sustained flow of humanitarian assistance to allow our citizens and foreign Nationals to exit and to facilitate the release of hostages I brief my colleagues about my conversations with Israeli leaders on pauses and on concrete steps to minimize harm to Palestinian civilians in Gaza and to stop extremist violence in the West Bank the US Secretary of State speaking there while Britain's foreign secretary James cleverly is also at that meeting in Tokyo he was asked about his reaction to the current death toll in Gaza and whether he believed that Israel's military response was proportionate well Israel was uh on the receiving end of a brutal terrorist attack and they have every right indeed a responsibility to the people of Israel to ensure that they are able to uh protect themselves and uh we speak about this military operation uh we get clear assurances from Israel that they are acting in accordance with humanitarian law in order to protect themselves from Attack what we of course want to see is ultimately a peaceful two-state uh solution and we of course always make clear that any actions that Israel take should be in pursuit of that ultimate aim and they should avoid doing anything which undermines that that will remain the UK government's position James cleverly there referring to the two State solution that many will believe is even more distant and perhaps even Dead uh after this military offensive it's long been uh seen to be an unachievable goal Let's uh see whether this current conflict reinvigorates the idea of a long-term political settlement of a two-state solution uh Israel and a Palestinian State well as well as the G7 ministers who are there in Tokyo our own sha Khal our BBC correspondent in Tokyo is there and she's covering the G7 foreign ministers meeting and she can join us live now from Tokyo Shima uh just tell us about the joint communic that's been issued and what has come out in the last few minutes from the G7 foreign Minister's meeting well I think the G7 foreign ministers wanted to present a united front not only on the Middle East conflict which overshadowed events which was at the heart and the center of the discussions today but also on the ongoing war in Ukraine and the security concerns in the Indo Pacific specifically China economic coion um the tension between China and Taiwan and of course um Russia's uh relationship with pongyang and pyongyang's nuclear Arsenal Ambitions remember this is a very different landscape that the foreign ministers are dealing with than the G7 leaders were dealing with when they met in Hiroshima in May right now their ultimate message is yes the conflict in the Middle East is overshadowing events but we continue um a message for Russia really that they say they continue um to be committed to sanctions on Russia and for Ukraine's right to defend itself on the Middle East again I think because there were background differences in the ceasefire um or proposals for a ceasefire by some G7 countries Anthony blinkin was quite clear that they are now United um on a no Seas far essentially um still supporting Israel for no Seas far but calling for humanitarian poses I was actually speaking to um the British foreign secretary um James cleverly um earlier and he said that essentially they're pushing for um these humanitarian pauses to to ensure the safety of hostages to ensure the safety um of multinationals um in Gaza and to get Aid uh to those who needed the most what we don't have uh mark from the g74 ministers communicate is detail where're it's really lacking on detail on how these pauses are going to be um are going to be conducted when they're going to be conducted especially as you reported not very far from where you are the bombardment continues and the Israeli strikes continue uh on Gaza I put it to um James cleverly as well uh Benjamin netanyahu's remarks about Israel continuing um or taking security responsibility in Gaza and how that could be reinterpreted as um reoccupying Gaza and he said this again he agreed with um Anthony blinkin there saying this is a transition period it is inevitable that the forces on the ground will take charge of of security in Gaza but ultimately what they're calling for um is Palestinian leadership Palestinian governance and as Anthony blinkin put it a few minutes ago a joint Palestinian governance in Gaza and ultimately in the Bank okay sh in Tokyo thank you very much indeed watching that G7 meeting in Tokyo that may also be talking about what comes next in the future of Gaza once if and when Hamas is eliminated as Israel aims now the other part of this region where there is increasing concern is Northern Israel and and Lebanon the Border there between the two countries where there has been increased uh crossborder fire in recent days 16 uh Lebanese uh Rockets were said to have been fired against Israel in the last couple of days and Israel responded militarily with very heavy strikes and Israel's prime minister has said that Hezbollah is starting to take part in this war but they would be making the mistake of a lifetime if they did so well uh hezbollah's Deputy leader uh the deputy secretary of state as he's called of of of Hezbollah shik Naim km has been giving a very rare interview to the BBC's Chief International correspondent Ola Garin in which he has warned of the real risk of a wider war in this region in his words saying that uh the region cannot bear much more of this Israeli uh military offensive and AA spoke to him in Lebanon and she began by asking him about the likelihood of a wider regional conflict if the aggression increases and continues at this space very dangerous and very serious developments could occur in the region no one would be able to stop the repercussions for sure there is a danger of a wider Regional War breaking out how realistic do you think is that danger now how close is that danger the danger is real because Israel is increasing its aggression against civilians and killing more women and children is it possible for this to continue and increase without bringing real danger to the region we know that Hezbollah has weapons that can reach deep inside Israel but if you were to use them Israel can respond with air power and it has promised a response of unimaginable magnitude and many Lebanese could die are are you willing to risk that it's normal and natural and we are ready to pay the price but the question is can Israel pay the price this is a question for Israel with the crossborder attacks that you have been carrying out over the past month isn't there a risk of dragging Lebanon into war even unintentionally a war that Lebanon can't afford and for which there appears to be absolutely no support here it's the right of any lianes to be afraid of a war this is normal nobody likes War but who is responsible for this war did we start it or did Israel what's most important is that the Israelis were the one who started this aggression against Gaza in this hideous way with respect Hamas started by attacking Israel on the 7th of October and killing more than 1,400 Israelis most of whom were civilians women and children so this round of warfare began with Hamas not with Israel what should the Palestinians do to regain their freedom and their land this operation was inevitable and it was an act of resistance and of Defense some would say that the attacks on October 7th have been a disaster for the Palestinian cause because the result has been massive destruction in Gaza the killing of thousands of civilians including more than 4,000 children haven't the attacks actually backfired I think what happened was a great achievement for the Palestinian resistance now the massacres committed by Israel are mobilizing the Palestinians more and more to cling to their land and they know there is no solution accept continued resistance but you say you consider the attack a great success but 10,000 Palestinians have been killed since this attack and who knows how many more will die who killed the Palestinians it was the crazy Israelis would you intervene more militarily would there be a stronger military reaction from Hezbollah if Hamas is in danger of being beaten in Gaza this is a matter for the future and what happens in the battle it's something we do not talk about in the media but we have our plans for more confrontation and resistance depending on what the circumstances require or agaran speaking to the deputy leader of Hezbollah there about the real risk of a wider Regional War
