we were not conducting any offensive operations whatsoever against Kamas Targets in Gaza and there was this unprovoked attack on our soldiers a deadly attack two of our soldiers were killed others apparently injured and I'm afraid one seems to have been kidnapped and Hamas by breaking the ceasefire not only killed Israelis and not only slammed the door shut on diplomatic Solutions but Hamas has unfortunately destroyed the chance of the people of Gaza receiving humanitarian help that they so badly need they were supposed to be a 72-hour period a 3-day period of ceasefire to allow the people of Gaz to get that human humanitarian support that they so badly need and I think this shows what Hamas really thinks about the people of Gaza what their agenda truly is
