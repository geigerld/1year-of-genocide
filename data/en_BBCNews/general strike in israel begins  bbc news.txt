trade unions and groups representing the families of Israeli hostages are holding a general strike to press the government to reach a deal to free those still held by Hamas it's already been inflicting some flights on benorian airports in Tel Aviv and businesses schools and other forms of Transport have also been hit well the stoppage is a day after the Israeli Army said it had recovered the bodies of six hostages who were taken during the attacks of the 7th of October that led to mass demonstrations in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv on Sunday with the organizers calling on the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to negotiate a deal with Hamas to bring home the estimated 100 remaining hostages Sunday's protests were largely peaceful but some crowds broke through police lines blocking a major highway in Tel Aviv while our correspondent John nson is following the story after the biggest protests in Israel since the start of the war in Gaza with hundreds of thousands of people demonstrating across the country today A general strike so thousands of businesses are going to be closed some schools universities government Ministries Banks uh some bus uh networks uh so we're expecting a major hit on the economy here today in Israel and the outrage against Hamas is a given but these protests are not about that these protests are against the government of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who is accused of pursuing his own personal political Ambitions and his survival uh in in sacrifice of a hostage release and ceasefire deal in Gaza Mr Netanyahu insists that the best way to get the remaining hostages out of Gaza is to keep applying military pressure on Hamas however many many many people in Israel don't feel that way including some of the hostage families they have accused Mr Netanyahu of having the blood of their loved ones on his hands there were chance of murderer at last night's uh protest and it's not just the public it is also within his own government so we've had reports in the last week of a shouting match between the Prime Minister and his defense minister yev Galant uh who says that in effect Mr Netanyahu is blocking this deal with Hamas that the world's diplomats have been pursuing now for weeks and months as I say Mr Netanyahu up to now has re has rejected that pressure and he says that it is Hamas who are the murderers and that they will be pursued and punished John donison there our correspondent let's speak to the former conservative MP aliser Bert also served as minister of State for the Middle East thank you very much for being with us um when we look at events in Israel with these protests today um what political effect do you think that might have the scale of the protest is certainly unprecedented there's been thousands of people demonstrating regularly against prime minister Netanyahu firstly for uh internal political reasons and then sort of post October the 7th lately in terms of his handling of the of the crisis but the scale of the protest the vment of it and the sense that the prime minister's strategy after October the 7th of seeking total victory of the elimination of Hamas and the recovery of the hostages has proved to be a failure because it was impossible he was advised that you couldn't do both uh and that advice has been borne out by experience and the circumstances of the murders of the six hostages that have been reported have just increased the the the anguish of uh many of the population of Israel that's what we've seen whether it will change breson netanyahu's policy is difficult to estimate because he is trapped by some in his cabinet who do not want him to make a deal with Hamas those the extreme rightwing ministers and he himself has set set on a course where he can only succeed by delivering what he has already promised even if it's impossible so it's very hard to say what the immediate impact on the politics will be and you know even if he was to be swayed by what these protests when activists say that they want a Hamas hostage deal have they spot out exactly what they're prepared to concede for that hostage families and friends in Israel that I've spoken to and many people have said they just want the hostage back the terms of the deal are of less consequence at present than physically returning those hostages that are still alive and sadly the remains of those who are not and the desperation was evident in the faces uh and the comments of the families over the weekend the assumption is it will be a deal for the return of Palestinian prisoners being held by uh by Israelis both on the West Bank and elsewhere um but the actual terms of the deal seem to matter less to people protesting than just the desperation to get the hostages back and they feel strongly that the priority that should be allocated to getting the hostages back has not been the priority of prime minister Netanyahu and the government hence the vence of the demonstrations and the anger of Defense Minister y Gallant of the way in which the Coalition is handling the crisis at present and O it's obvious as to why s family and friends of the hostages will absolutely prioritize that but the government also has to to balance the future security of Israel as it sees it that is right but everything since October the 6 has changed it would appear that the security of the state of Israel which prime minister Netanyahu and his supporters had predicated on dividing the Palestinian leadership Community supporting habas covertly in Gaza preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state has fallen apart uh and the anger in Israel is directed at the failure of that overall political security policy as well as the atrocity that took place on October the 7th for which Hamas Bears complete responsibility so the wider security of Israel is indeed uh in in question now and that calls for a different political solution which will require Israel to think of U an overall settlement which will involve the West Bank East Jerusalem as well as Gaza and it will require the abandonment of those who believe that the extinction the state of Israel is still possible so a lot of political changes necessary in order to secure the peace and security of Israel to which it is entitled as well as the self-determination of the Palestinian people and justice for them it is not impossible and negotiations have always faltered when they've got very difficult but if there was ever a time to press the case it's now aliser Bert thank you very much indeed for being with us
