the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza says at least 70 people have been killed by Israeli shelling and air strikes in eastern areas of Han Yunis Medics say more than 200 people have been injured in the Israeli strikes and that hospitals in the area are overwhelmed by casualties meanwhile the World Health Organization says the number of people needing to be evacuated from Gaza for medical care has risen to around 14,000 and that it is extremely worried about the possibility of a polio break thousands of Palestinians have fled harun including many who were in an area previously designated as a humanitarian Zone the Israeli Army says the evacuation order is in response to Rocket fire separately a meeting between Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden which was due to take place in Washington later today has been delayed until Thursday I spoke to our correspondent in Jerusalem Barbara PL user who told me more about the situation in hunis that military operation is continuing the Israelis say they have conducted more air strikes and they've also destroyed uh weapons weapon stores as well as tunnels they're going after Hamas militants they say in the Eastern districts of kanun now they thought they had cleared this area earlier in the year there was a sweeping operation in the city of kanun and then they pulled out in April but then they they said that there had been increased rocket fire from this particular area that Hamas was regroup grouping so they' moved in again but those evacuation orders were then given to the people living there so around 400,000 people were living in this area many of them having been displaced uh previously and as you mentioned this was a part of this area was had been designated uh a humanitarian zone so yesterday we had people fleeing with very little notice uh just picking up what they could carry and some of them running out uh but not fast enough because uh you you were saying that the casualty figures there many were killed and in injured and now looking for another place to stay um they can go to the other designated humanitarian Zone but that is quite crowded with other people there aren't that many services uh and as a un official said uh the the the front line keeps suffocating them it keeps moving and people are constantly asking where can we go now where can we go now um there's no place safe so the this has been again another Mass displacement in Gaza and Barbara let's talk about benj in netanyahu's trip to Washington as he was leaving Israel there were protests weren't there people saying he should be staying and and working on a deal to free Israeli hostages but he is in Washington uh what are people saying there about their expectations for this meeting with President Biden and of course he's going to be meeting kamla Harris as well well he's going he's gone to Washington at a time of great political turbulence hasn't he because uh Mr Biden has said he will drop out of the presidential race so Kamala Harris is possibly probably going to replace him as a candidate so Mr Netanyahu is meeting with Mr Biden as well as Kamala Harrison he's also apparently asked for a meeting with the former president Trump so trying to figure out what the political landscape in Washington is like but he is under great pressure to agree to a ceasefire deal in order to um bring a pause in the fighting and also to release Israeli hostages that pressure comes from the Biden Administration for sure uh from the Democrat from elements in the Democrat party as well and from the families of the hostages he met them in Washington but before he left they were protesting regularly telling him you've got to sign this deal uh don't go to Washington before you do so that that pressure has accompanied him to Washington but it started here in Israel Barbara PL user well as you've been hearing the World Health Organization is warning that it is extremely worried about a possible polio outbreak in Gaza its Regional head says many people are living in shelters with just one toilet for 600 people and little access to Safe Drinking Water let's speak now to Samir sah who is director of programs at Medical Aid for Palestinians Samir thank you very much for joining us on BBC News you obviously must share those concerns expressed by the World Health Organization traces of polio have been found in the sewers in Gaza um but the last case was in 1984 I believe How likely is it that you were going to see an outbreak do you think thank you for inviting me as you rightly stated last case was 1984 and uh it was 23rd of June they took seven samples from a sewage site in Gaza and they found that six of them were actually positive for what you call vaccine derived polio virus now this vaccine derived polio virus comes from a strain which is from the weakend live virus which is given an oral polio crops it is of massive concern because uh this is a population that is under continuous bombardment have been displaced multiple times and there are children who haven't been vaccinated for polio so if this strain gets into children who haven't been vaccinated or who have a weakened immune system they will get polio which leads to paralysis of the lyms how contagious is polio it's very contagious it it's basically a feal oral transmission Route so which means that it's from the waste in the sewage and in the uh gutters outside and at the moment because there's no waste disposal happening it's very likely that it's going to spread given that medical facilities in Gaza are overwhelmed as as we've heard uh what approach are you going to try to to be working on to to deal with the situation if people have not had young children especially haven't had vaccin inations or have only perhaps gotten partway through the course of vaccinations I mean the only thing that we can do at the moment is make sure that children receive vaccination but actually the solution is not just vaccination the solution is that there should be a ceasefire now the solution is that there should be an increase in the aid going into Gaza especially access to clean drinking water and access to medical supplies and Medical Teams going in to give you an idea there were 11,000 trucks going in every month uh before the crisis started for the month of June compared to 11,000 only 581 trucks went into Gaza so actually not much Aid is going and then ceasefire is also important because the repair of the sewage system the repair of the water supply system is important you have to clean up tons of waste that is on the streets of Gaza and you have to rebuild roads you have to provide the transport system so people can get into medical facilities in fact the bombings have to stop so that people can access medical care and just finally briefly Samir without a ceasefire currently obviously to what extent can your teams um mitigate the outbreak of of a disease like this it's extremely difficult it's extremely difficult because uh if you know there's zero electricity in Gaza at the moment vaccines need a cold chain which means they need to be kept refrigerated so even if you deliver a lot of vaccines then there's a big challenge of keeping them refrigerated uh in fact even fuel is in short supply inside Gaza and so yeah our our response uh is quite challenging it's very difficult to provide the vaccines uh even with the teams and even if you are providing the vaccines you are not taking care of the live virus that is in the seage system already so you have to tackle that as well Samir sa thank you very much pales Ians and let's return now to the political situation in the Middle East and uh China says 14 Palestinian factions have agreed to set up an interim National reconciliation government to govern Gaza after the war ends it follows talks in Beijing between representatives from each group including Hamas and fata which is in charge of the occupied West Bank the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi who attended the discussions hailed what he called The Beijing declaration Let's uh talk about this some more now with the founder of China dialogue trust Isabelle Hilton Isabelle thank you very much uh for joining us many previous efforts to uh to try to deal with antagonism between Hamas and fata and various other groups have have failed um how much weight do you put behind this effort and this declaration well it it's quite a big declaration uh it's significant in that China doesn't usually you know take risks like this um so China does have quite a lot of heft um as you say a lot of previous attempts have failed including attempts broken by Egypt and many other intermediaries and we have nearly 20 years of hostility now between these two factions but we are in an extreme situation we've got the continuing War and the devastation of Gaza conflict on the West Bank and the United States which is m in its own electoral politics and therefore can be you know has limited has limited effect and and the frustration that President Biden has been unable apparently to restrain Benjamin Netanyahu which is you know causing waves in the region so for China this is a big opportunity and and it's one that they have steadily been uh taking advantage of the talks began very early in the year in Moscow and then moved to Beijing in April in May China hosted big uh Arab conference as part of its uh now continuing diplomacy with the Arab world in which China posited the need for an International Peace conference and now this so there's been a lot of setting up of context here so why I is China uh positioning itself like this trying to broker some kind of deal and and to what extent do you think those involved in the talks in Washington Joe Biden CA Harris Benjamin Netanyahu to extent do you think they will be paying attention to what's been happening in Beijing well I think they will be paying attention there is a fundamental uh difference in approach in that the United States insists that Hamas must recognize the right of Israel to exist and there has been nothing in any Chinese statement to that effect so we have you know essentially a very different approach but the fact that China's weight in the region has been growing so much it has good relations with Iran it has good relations with Saudi Arabia it's one of the biggest customers for Middle East energy it's a supplier of renewable energy so altogether China's uh position in the gulf and and in what it caus West Asia is actually getting very strong and the United States is beginning to look as though it can't quite you know manipulate things as it as it used to it can't quite bring a result as it used to so for China this is a big win in terms of its Global image just very briefly Isabelle because we're almost out of time interesting also that Ukraine's foreign minister dimitro kba uh is in China at the invite the behest of the the Chinese they sent the invitation um what might be happening there well I you there has been it's interesting because there's been very little contact between China and Ukraine and I think China is trying to trying to correct the global impression of facilitating and supporting Russia in its aggressive war against Ukraine I think that is doing diplomatic damage China again is trying to present itself as a peacemaker It produced a 12-point plan last year with no diplomatic underpinning but it continues to maintain a a posture if you like of wanting peace okay Isabelle Hilton founder of China dialogue trust thank you very much thank you
