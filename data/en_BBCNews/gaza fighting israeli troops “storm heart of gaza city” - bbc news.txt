we are live in southern Israel with news tonight from the defense minister that his troops have now battled their way into Gaza City thought to be the stronghold of Hamas the fighting which is Street to street is taking place just a few kilometers off in the darkness behind me across the border it's exactly a month since Hamas killed 1,400 people in coordinated attacks on Southern Israel planned in Gaza and today Israelis attended vigils lit candles and held them minut silence in remembrance of those who died well Israel's bombing raids have intensified in recent days in the city of Khan Unis in southern Gaza dozens of Palestinians are reported to have been killed and now the fighting is said to be in the heart of Gaza City our first report tonight is from Jeremy boen Hass released video of their men fighting in the streets of Gaza they know they can't win a pitched battle so they're using hit run tactics that will intensify as Israel's tanks and troops move deeper into Gaza City after an Israeli striking hanun Southern Gaza they were digging for survivors the town is in the area Israel has told Palestinians to go to stay safe but nowhere safe Israel says this is self-defense Palestinians call it genocide Ahmed ayash had 27 members of his family inside the house when it was hit this is The Bravery of the So-Cal Israel they show their might and power against civilians babies inside kids inside and elderly it is the mighty Vengeance promised by Israel's prime minister when Hass attacked a month ago in Tel Aviv at the empty table set for the hostages in Gaza friends and families am mounting a 24-hour vigil the national trauma Israel suffered a month ago is not lessening in fact they're reassessing everything not just relations with the Palestinians but also with Arab countries they thought they were getting closer to and who are now condemning everything they're doing in Gaza and there's the issue of the safety of Jews in places around the world where the Palestinians get a lot of support so even though Israel is more secure than a month ago many more people are out and about a real sense of threat not just from Gaza remains Israel insists that force not negotiations will bring the hostages back Shanny Luke's family hoped she was a hostage until she was confirmed dead a week ago friends filled her family home with her portraits she was at the music festival that was attacked we got this horrible video that was shown all over a friend of us sent it to us and he said I I recognize Shani this is on on on the truck on the pickup truck this is where she was faed down yeah she was in a weird position looks unconscious Blood on the head and people were the pickup was driving in inside the Gaza Strip and people were shouting and celebrating and spitting on her and it was it was terrible and and we were just in shock do you think Israel's doing the right thing now I don't know what the end will be because there are really many civilians in innocent civilians also there in in AA and they they shouldn't suffer but U but there needs to be something radical with the terrorism be done because if not we will be back in this in the next few years they will get the weapons again and they will train again Israel's pounding of Gaza has not stopped neither has its rage diminished Jeremy bow BBC News in southern Israel well as we've been hearing Israel is claiming to have reached the heart of Gaza City tonight let's talk to Paul Adams who's live in Jerusalem Paul this potentially then is a significant moment in this conflict Clive I think we can say that the battle for Gaza City has definitely begun we have seen images in the last day or two that show that the Israeli military is all around the city they all the way down the coast they've cut it off from uh the Southern Gaza Strip so their attention now is focusing ever more closely on that very very built up area of Gaza City and its nearby refugee camps I think what they're going to do is Mount operations from their positions on the edge into Gaza City to tackle what they regard as one of hamas's major strongholds the problem for them is that in many of the targets they have in mind many many thousands of Palestinian civilians are still clustered and the Israelis argue that Hamas is using some of those civilians as human Shields we saw some people on the move today thousands perhaps making their way South along the road uh towards relative safety but many many remain and that is going to be a problem and then the question is when the battle for Gaza City is done where do the Israelis go then indeed okay Paul thank you Paul Adams their live in Jerusalem
