the Israeli military says it's rescued two of the hostages abducted by Hamas during a raid in the Gaza Strip their release from an apartment in Rafa was announced shortly after Israel carried out an intense aerial bombardment of the city the two men Fernando Maron and LS ha aged 60 and 70 respectfully are said to be in a good condition they've been taken to a hospital in central Israel it's the thought to be only the second time that Israel has carried out a successful military operation to rescue hostages dozens of Palestinians were reported to have been killed during the Israeli air strikes in Rafa overnight residents told the BBC that there've been around 50 air strikes in the early hours of Monday um as well as that helicopters and boats took part in the attack well earlier Benjamin rad from the UCL Center for Middle East development told told us more about the critical situation in southern Gaza Rafa appears to be the very last refuge for uh Hamas leadership and the remnants or what's left of hamas's Fighters and also where the government believes that the a good portion of the hostages may be kept as we've seen from the two that were rescued it also limits really where they can go at this point now as they get hemmed further and further to the south of the country now they're pushed against the border the idea is to provide little opportunity for homas leadership including yoir and others to find Escape Routes out of the out of the area Benjamin Netanyahu must be coming under considerable uh pressure uh certainly the US indicating that it's the welfare of those within the strip that they are concerned about um and yet he remains defiant yes and let's not um pretend that it's a coincidence that this operation was scheduled at the time as the United States those of us here were watching the Super Bowl so it was really meant to be I believe uh timed in an opportune way to minimize detention and scrutiny and also netanyahu's position is that any attempt to seize operations or not pursue it to its utmost end which he believes includes going into Rafa would essentially hand Hamas an opportunity to regain control or to reconstitute itself and also lastly is the pressure to put on Hamas as part of the ongoing hostage negotiations because we've seen Netanyahu already rejected the counter proposal that Hamas offered last week Benjamin do you do you think in a in a conflict such as this that the solution is going to be a military one or not well it depends on if the if the main objective is to free the hostages then no a full military solution will very unlikely to lead to the safe um uh to the rescue of the remaining hostages it's very difficult to see how that can be the case and if it's going to be an enduring solution not just a temporary one it's going to have to involve more diplomacy and less military action and ultimately it has to involve something that creates a semblance of a Palestinian state or um autonomous governing entity as it stands we're not hearing any of that from the Netanyahu side and that's what poses a problem however as you mentioned he faces tremendous domestic opposition as well specifically from right-wing members of his cabinet who are insisting that he not yield at all in these operations as far as the Middle East goes I mean relations here are really being uh threatened particularly moving forward I'm looking at Future cooperation within the region not just for Israel but for the likes of the United States as well well a lot of this will hinge on how quickly Israel can get in and get out of Rafa and continue the operations it is carrying out now and secondly we have the parallel track of negotiations taking place and all indications from the state department are that they are progressing and moving forward they're speaking with very confident language that some agreement will be reached and then we also know that the Saudis are very eager to see this all come to an end so they can resume talks towards normalizing relations with Israel we know that this is something that's been sitting on the back burner but that both countries have an interest in pushing forward so the momentum is there barring any um catastrophic or horrific um action by the Israelis that results in a large number of Civilian deaths as part of this Rafa operation that remains to be seen that was Benjamin rad there we're going to cross live now to Jerusalem and speak to our correspondent there Barbara PL user hello there to you Barbara um what more do we know about the hostages that were rescued first off well they were rescued in quite a dramatic operation overnight in Rafa two older men their names are Fernando Simon marman aged 60 and Louie har aged 70 so they've been in captivity for 128 days uh but the Army is saying they're in good medical conditions so that would be a relief for their families and the military's been saying a little bit more about what went into it they said they two men were found in a residential building in Rafa on the second floor that they had been monitoring that area for quite a long time and then they spent sent in a special uh Joint Forces operation which involved the Army uh this the internal security service as well as the special police forces they breached the building with an explosive they said uh there was a lot of heavy gunfire during the rescue operation and then there were the air strikes as the the team and the two hostages were extricated uh from the area and uh the military spokesman said also that the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as top military officials were monitoring it as it went ahead yeah Daniel hagari was speaking just a short time ago did he make any reference to criticism of the their offensive in Raa well it's interesting because during this heavy bombardment overnight the Palestinian residents of Rafa panicked because they thought this was going to be that ground offensive that Mr Netanyahu has been talking about but it wasn't that is still being planned the military has been tasked with a plan to come up for that as well as a plan to evacuate the civilians and you know there are more than a million displaced Palestinians who are Sheltering in Rafa as a sort of last place where they could go as the Israeli Army moved through the Gaza Strip um having people evacuate to the South so so Mr Netanyahu has uh been coming out and saying we will have a plan to evacuate them we're working out the details he hasn't given those details he had a chat with that about with about that with the uh American president yesterday who's very concerned about the possibility of heavy casualties but also the humanitarian situation there which is already very Grim becoming much much worse and Mr Biden told Mr Netanyahu uh that plan to evacuate it has to be credible and it has to be executable it has to be possible in order to protect this the the civilians but that is not something that seems to be imminent because a plan like that um will take some time Barbara just how strained are not only diplomatic relations in the region but also amongst the Allies um that Israel counts upon for example the United States I think things are quite strained uh with the United States uh because the Americans have been pressing the Netanyahu government um very consistently and in person and on the telephone to tone down and Tamp down on the military operation to do much more to let in humanitarian Aid and to take measures to protect civilians now they have had some success but it's been quite modest uh and that is I think frustrating the administration considerably you have heard uh rhetoric from the secretary of state that has been getting tougher but also now from the president over the last few days in which he actually called the military oper operation over the top in Gaza something that many critics have been saying for a long time including constituencies that are important to Mr Biden politically uh but others as well um in terms of the region the that is very tense at the moment and I'll just focus on Egypt which of course has a peace treaty with Israel and that is a has been an anchor a Cornerstone of regional St stability for decades Egypt according to reports is saying that it would it would tear up that treaty or pull out of that treaty if Israel carried out a ground invasion of Rafa now they haven't been saying that publicly publicly they have been warning of dire consequences but just those reports give you some idea of how concerned the Arabs and especially Egypt which is on the border with Israel and the border with Gaza uh and Rafa see any possible U major military operation in Gaza in Rafa sorry okay Barbara plasa something to watch keenly there thank you very much indeed thank you
