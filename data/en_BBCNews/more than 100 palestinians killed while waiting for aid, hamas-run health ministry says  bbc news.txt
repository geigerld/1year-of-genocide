more than a 100 Palestinians have been killed while waiting for food Aid in Gaza City these images are from that attack in the southwest of the city a journalist told the BBC that Israeli tanks opened fire on a crowd who'd come to collect supplies a large number of people had been gathered waiting for food when the incident happened the Israeli military issued these aerial pictures of the incident it says dozens of garans were crushed and trampled as they surrounded the aid trucks separately an Israeli Source confirmed its troops had fired after feeling threatened by the crowds near the aid Point let's have a listen to that statement from the Israeli Prime Minister's office the trucks were overwhelmed and the people driving the trucks which were Garen uh Garen civilian drivers uh plowed into um the crowds of people uh ultimately killing my understanding is tens of people now let's have a listen to an account from a Palestinian who was there after they stopped shooting we went back to get our Aid by the time I got flour and some canned goods and took it down from the truck they shot at us they shot me and the truck driver left and ran over my leg I lost my nerves if you want to get us Aid this way then you might as well not bring anything what has already happened to us is more than enough we went to get flour for children we have been eating animal feed for 2 months and even that ran out what are we supposed to do where are we supposed to go now this all comes as we've received the latest figures on the numbers of Palestinians killed in Gaza since October now more than 30,000 people have been killed in the territory according to figures from the Hamas run Health Ministry there now this graph from the BBC verify team charts the rising number of people killed in Gaza from Israeli strikes which were sparked by the Hamas attacks on Southern Israel on the 7th of October now it shows the majority of those killed in Gaza are women and children and the number of children killed so far stands at 21,000 well for more on all of the day's developments we can go straight to Jerusalem and join our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams who is there for us Paul tell us more first of all about what we know happened when those Palestinians were gathering to receive Food Aid well one thing I can tell you Virginia is that that account that you heard that brief account from an Israeli spokesman doesn't really begin to describe what actually happened nor by the way were these people waiting for food Aid this was a convoy driving into the into Gaza City at 4:00 a.m. in the dark it had just passed an Israeli checkpoint when uh crowds began to descend on the trucks in scenes that we have seen already many times before remember that the situation in the northern part of the Gaza Strip is by far the worst people are utterly desperate any trucks that that arrive there with Aid and very very few do immediately get mobbed now this was a convoy of anywhere between 18 and 30 trucks it had passed through the checkpoint the Israeli checkpoint and at some point while the crowds were swarming onto the truck TR s some of those people approached to within around 70 M of the Israeli checkpoint the soldiers there felt they that they were in some danger they fired shots in the air according to the IDF and then at the crowd in what an Israeli military spokesman described as a limited response the impression we get having listened to what the IDF says and heard from an an eyewitness a Palestinian eyewitness who was there was that utter Panic ensued and the pictures that have been released by the IDF this morning shot uh from the air at night show the trucks attempting to move forward while absolutely covered in people trying to uh to retrieve Aid with thousands of people surrounding them and in that Mayhem it seems a significant number of people were run over our Palestinian Source tells us that most of the people who died we think around 104 were killed because they were run over by the trucks not because of the Israeli shooting but the shooting does seem to have contributed to the absolute panic I mean yeah that sounds the circumstances sound really tragic uh whatever uh we know so far on what happened Paul and I'm just reading um on Reuters that a un Aid Chief has said that they are reped at the reported killings and injuries during the transfer of aid supplies in Gaza City is there any more reaction that we've had no I think everyone is still looking at it trying to figure out exactly what happened the Israelis you know they're they're saying you look you need to look hard at this uh listen to what we're saying we don't want to have a repeat of some of the mistakes that they say the media have made in certain key episodes in the past all I would say is that anyone who has access to Twitter can go uh or X should I say can go on the idf's uh feed and look at that footage shot in the dark the early this morning it is utterly utterly gobsmacking the sheer size of the crowd the fact that the trucks are all completely covered with people trying to retrieve Aid and that they are moving forward it gives you it gives me one of the most dramatically Vivid accounts of the desperation of the northern Gaza Strip that I have seen so far and you don't even see anyone's faces okay Paul Adam thank you so much for bringing us more details on that developing story on the ground thank you very much
