the US vice president and Democratic presidential candidate kamla Harris has added her voice to International condemnation of the loss of civilian life in Saturday's deadly Israeli air strike on a School Compound in Gaza around a thousand displaced Palestinians had been Sheltering in the building at the time of the Dawn strike the Israeli military insists that it used Precision missiles to Target what it claims was a Hamas Command Center in the compound the director of a local hospital said that the facility had received 70 bodies and the remains of at least 10 more people Israel disputes those figures well this is what Miss Harris said on the campaign Trail take a listen you know yet again there far too many civilians who've been killed I mean Israel has a right to go after the terrorists that are Hamas but as I have said many many times they also have um I believe an important responsibility to avoid civilian casualties well the Biden Administration has has also responded to news of the attack a White House National Security Council spokesperson says quote we are deeply concerned about reports of Civilian casualties we're in touch with our Israeli counterparts and we are asking for further details we know Hamas has been using schools as locations to gather and operate out of but we have also said repeatedly and consistently that Israel must take measures to minimize civilian harm just hours before the bombing the US state department announced that it's releasing $3.5 billion do worth of weapons for Israel part of a larger Aid package approved earlier this year by Congress now this report from Jenny Hill contains images that you may find distressing anguish bewilderment Israel struck Before Dawn shattering the sanctity of morning prayer thousands of displaced civilians were Sheltering here a place of Refuge suddenly a scene of Carnage there isn't any safe place this woman cries no place is safe where is the world he asks why does it stay silent in the face of these crimes how many times have gaza's ravaged walls echoed to the sound of a mother's grief um says three of her sons were killed I'm 80 she sobs I've never seen anything like this before the way they're bombing us is Like An Earthquake but Israel claims this was a legitimate Target that the school housed a Hamas Command Center in a statement on social media an Israeli Defense Force spokesman said around 20 Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants were operating out of the compound Israel's repeatedly struck school buildings in recent weeks each time they insist they conceal Hamas bases and each each time they insist they strive to minimize civilian casualties the strike comes at a time of heightened tension in the Middle East International governments are urging Hamas and Israel to agree a ceasefire and hostage return deal as soon as possible and extensive diplomacy is ongoing to try to stop the conflict in Gaza from spiraling into an allout Regional war and as Palestinians mourn dead and take shelter for another fearful night it's hard to see hope in the ruins of Gaza Jenny Hill BBC News Tel Aviv well I've been speaking to Muhammad Taha from BBC Arabic who explained the amount of pressure Israel was coming under lots of condemnation International condemnation to the amount of Civilian death in this strike Algeria the Arab country is re Westing a an urgent meeting for the UN Council to discuss the matter and lots of calls to Israel to uh constrain H Israel however continued Shilling some parts of Rafa khun and asked uh lots of parts in in eastern kanun to evacuate we expecting more strike in the coming hours this is what's happening normally when they ask people to evacuate Hamas denied uh completely uh that there were Fighters uh of them in in the compound or in the prayer area Israel issued a statement H named uh 20 people or so who are Israel saying they are belong to Hamas and they were in the compound isra Hamas said these Fighters were killed previously in in in in previous occasion and there are clear instructions for their Fighters not to mix with the civilians and even if there were fighters in the in this area they wouldn't be praying with the people in the school you mentioned that International condemnation from the likes of Algeria also the White House and uh vice president Kam Harris saying too many civilians are being killed in this conflict the possibility of a un security council meeting is that likely to exert any pressure of course uh because now there is a mounting pressure on Israel to return back to the negotiating table uh on Thursday as suggested by the United States if the United if the UN Council would come and and have a a statement that's calling both parties to return back to the negotiating table that would be uh a positive uh and it it could also uh it could also um uh Place pressure on Israel to avoid such uh such U targeting to uh shelter places because it it became a systematic uh practice from the Israeli Army that they would Target schools hospitals and places that they are taking uh shelter and even though places that the Israel army would suggest that they are safe places but they return back and strike these places and also reports today amid concerns of a broad Regional War an exchange of fire between Hezbollah and Israel what more can you tell us yeah this is uh this is an uh another front that is open now in in this war we saw that hisbah struck new places uh mahat alone and safad in Northern Israel and uh wide areas in Al Jal in Northern Israel also Israel rep by by by by by shelling some parts in southern Lebanon like Al and Ma Sal there are fears as always that hasah would would retaliate for the killing of fad shuk their leader and also the expected reply from Iran for the killing of isma H well let's go straight to our correspondent Jenny Hill who is in Tel Aviv good to see you there Jenny um just bring us up to date with the latest well um the US arguably Israel's greatest Ally and of course a major supplier of weapons uh has expressed its dismay at the strike as that International condemnation mounts we heard from vice president carela Harris who said that yet again too many civilians uh have been killed she added that Israel has the right to go after Hamas but it also Bears a special responsib ability to avoid civilian casualties the Israeli military continues to insist that it used Precision missiles to Target what it claims was a Hamas Command Center within the school compound um it's published a list of the names of 19 people killed in the strike which it says were either Hamas or Islamic Jihad operatives um the big question of course as you've been asking all morning I imagine is where does this leave any hope of a fire and hostage return deal because of course the strike came at a time of very with International the International Community urging both Hamas and Israel to get to the negotiating table um and agree upon a ceasefire and hostage return deal Cara Harris herself reiterated those demands um but listen to what Hamas had to say in reaction to the strike they described it as a horrific crime and said that Israel in effect had escalated the um conflict so this morning in Gaza as people continue to mourn their dead absorb the shock and of course pray for those injured the prospect of Peace seems very remote indeed and Jenny how are those comments from the likes of Harris the White House we know that Algeria for example also calling for a un security council meeting how are they being received there in Israel I imagine it depends on who you speak to well of course um I mean Israel says it's going after Hamas um as a matter of of self-defense um the Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu has said you know his aim is to completely dismantle the organization um a lot of the Israeli press um are publishing what the Israeli military are saying that this was um in effect a legitimate Target um we've seen a string of similar attacks on schools in Gaza by the Israeli military in recent weeks and each time we see a very familiar um pattern the Israeli military will say well um there was a Hamas Command Center or base within that school schools of course are no longer being used as Schools they're largely being used um as shelters by the many many displaced people of Gaza um but the Israeli military say each time they go out of their way to avoid civilian casualties with for example the use of precision missiles and the use of intelligence that they've gathered um so we are once again in a familiar routine I think what perhaps makes this particular strike Stand Out is the number of dead of course that is why we are seeing such International outrage and and calls for an urgent return to the negotiating table our correspondent Jenny Hill in Tel Aviv Jenny thank you very much
