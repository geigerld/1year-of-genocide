good evening tonight Israel's ambassador to the UN gillad San has called for the resignation of the UN Secretary General Antonio gutterz following his speech at the meeting of the UN Security Council in New York guz whose call for humanitarian ceasefire said that the October 7th attack by Hamas on Israel did not happen in a vacuum but that the Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation he also said that the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas and those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people the Palestinians are divided by Israeli land walls and fences 3 million Palestinians who live in the occupied West Bank live with something that looks more like a functional government it has Ministries ambassadors posted throughout the world and secular politics but the Palestinian Authority hasn't held election for more than 15 years and the PA also seems unable to stop the increasing encroachment of Israeli settlements into Palestinian land in the West Bank regarded as illegal in international law though disputed by Israel and so there's a collapse of faith in the nearest thing the Palestinians have to a legitimate State and with it a collapse of faith in a diplomatic solution to the conflict with Israel so what next for the PA enter prime minister Muhammad chatai likely to succeed president abas an economist and moderate he's a strong supporter of the two State solution but now since the Israel Gaza war broke out and there have been deaths in the West Bank as well as Gaza he is also in the midst of the crisis Amir sat down with the Prime Minister earlier today in rala I call for immediate ceas fire and uh I call for immediate session of all what is happening in Gaza and an immediate opening of a safe passages for uh International Aid to get in and so that we will be also able to treat the injured there are more than 15,000 Palestinians injured who are waiting uh for treatment no food supplies no electricity supplies no water supplies so the situation is extremely catastrophic and that continuation of this israelian bombardment will obviously cause more lives to be lost clearly for a ceasefire to happen Israel needs some kind of victory such as the release of all hostages do you call for the release of all hostages look the issue is not about Victory Israel is now in the mood of Revenge so if Israel is in the mood of achieving Victory it's not going to get any Victory killing innocent people does not really lead to a victory Israel if Israel needs to be victorious they have to sit down with with the Palestinians and put together a political track so this does not repeat itself by all means I would like to see hostages going home every hostage every prisoner and that this only can come through a peaceful negotiation a peaceful measure a peaceful solution that will put an end to all these sufferings presumably in the same breath as you would say indiscriminate violence the killing of civilians is wrong you would also say the same about the October the 7th attack in the south of is by Hamas I told you we should not really look at October 7th only there what about the West Bank 92 Palestinian lives have been lost and 92 Palestinians have been killed by settlers by the Army and Palestinians here in the West Bank they didn't initiate anything all Palestinians are under attack if we look at October 7th as a starting point then we miss seeing the picture then we miss seeing the macro picture we we lose the context yes but the incidents on their own are also important and just as we you know the world condemns the killing of civilians in the Gaza Strip doesn't the world also condemn don't you also condemn The Killing killings of Israeli civilians I have seen of course International leaders queuing to support Israel I I I saw very few of them condemning the killing of innocent people in Gaza so therefore look my dear friend by all means who wants to see in people killed I'm sure nobody does so therefore in the same way that we want to save the lives of our kids our children our women our our ELD we want to save the lives of everybody so I don't see the event as an isolated event I see things in totality the issue is Palestinian people the issue is Palestinian cause the issue is the sufferings of the Palestinian people and I just do wonder if you recognize that what happened to Hamas attack is not only a tragedy for Israelis but it's a tragedy for the Palestinian cause as well because it's in the outside world it's shifted how people regard the Palestinian cause it's not uh I mean I have seen demonstrations in the Streets of London in the streets of Berlin in the streets of Paris in Washington Chicago everywhere people are fed up with this situation people they want an end to this miserable situation I know of course two wrongs don't make a virtue but the situation is what is the virtue The Virtue is actually that we reach a solution that is the most important thing I'd like to just go back to last week and the terrible explosion Blast at the alahi hospital in Gaza the US Israel some media organizations have said they believe that or you know they have proof that it was um a misfired Palestinian rocket others feel differently I wonder do you feel like you have a duty to say to your people let's wait to understand the facts and you know let's let's listen to what the truth might be about that particular blast we know what the truth is Islamic Jihad does not have the technical capacity in one single missile to kill 500 people that is not the case only Israel that has the military capabilities to do that and if you want to buy the story of the other side of the Israelis look Israel has been spreading so many lies I am not defending any situation I am saying that we have to get facts right I am saying that we have to avoid fake news there's different opinions and that suggests that you know as a Palestinian Authority as a as a leadership you have to say we don't know we you know that rage we must listen you to tell me what to say you want to you are suggesting to me and answer I'm not going to answer the way you want my dear friend I am not we have to get facts right is not this sort of creating you uncertainty about who did it is just simply not to allow people to reach the truth the truth is that Israel did it is it revealing a crisis in the political leadership here because it is encouraging people towards more violence you can't completely protect the the safety of your Civ Millions you know we haven't had elections in the West Bank in 16 years this is a crisis the question is how do you get out of the crisis there is an opportunity today that while Israel is also in a crisis and that we are in difficult times that there is a need to sit down and in the conflict so out of this crisis one has to make an opportunity and I think there is an opportunity the problem is that there is no leadership on the side of the Israelis who are ready to sit down with us and settle the account and settle the problem and end of occupation and give the Palestinians their rights my dear friend the Palestinians have been in struggle the Palestinians have been fighting in every means and ways for the last 100 years it is time for these people to enjoy their right it is time for these people to live with dignity it is time for these people to live in a sever and viable contiguous state of Palestine on the borders of 6 67 with Jerusalem as its capital and the right of refugees to go back to their homes otherwise the conflict will continue the Palestinians are not going to surrender if Hamas was brought down in Gaza would the Palestinian Authority accept the invitation to try and form some form of government there we're not waiting for an invitation by anybody the Palestinian Authority palesa leadership will not go to Gaza on an Israeli military tank to your audience the Palestinians live under military occupation that should end and therefore any solution any thinking of the day after does not solve the Gaza problem alone does not solve the West Bank problem alone it has to solve the Palestinian problem the Palestinian prime minister we joining me now from Tel Aviv is Alan leevy the spokes person for the Israeli government thank you very much for joining us if I can just uh find out from you what is the position tonight about the ground offensive are we close to it are we not close to it what's happening uh thank you for having me on the show Kirsty first before I answer that I would like to respond and say I was truly appalled to listen to that interview with the Palestinian prime minister now he was questioned three times pressed no fewer than three times by your reporter whether he would condemn the October 7th Massacre the worst terror attack in world history since 9911 brutally murdered 1,400 people and three times he refused to condemn that attack in fact he said that the Palestinian struggle against Israel has been going on for a hundred years 25 years before the state of Israel was even established and long before the 67 56 I think 56 years was the what was the number of years said 100 he said 100 years he said 100 years but but I'm going to go on and ask you a little bit later uh about whether or not there's going to be a position where anyone will sit down with each other future but I just want to get up to speed on what is happening now why is there a hold up in the ground Invasion Israel is United now around a single goal and that goal is total Victory against Hamas in response to the October 7th Massacre now when the next stage of the Israeli operation is going to continue I'm not going to speculate on the movement of the troops that's going to happen in accordance with our operational needs but the response to the October 7th Massacre that brutal murder of 1,400 people whole families burned in their homes children who are cuffed families that were shot dead tortured mutilated the response is going to be the the total defeat of the terror organization that conducted that but I wonder if I wonder if the hostages I wonder if the hostages are a factor or not because when we have done interviews it seems that that when the ground Invasion starts if the hostages are there so be it they may lose their lives is that true Israeli Society at the moment is sick with worry about the fate of the hostages over 220 innocent men women children who are being held hostage by Hamas one of them is Ohad this is Ohad he's 9 years old yesterday was his ninth birthday he's the hostage of Hamas two weeks ago he was visiting his grandparents on the kibuts of NE o when Hamas death squads invaded in the morning they brutally murdered his uncle and they took him together with his grandparents Abraham and ruy both aged 78 and with his mother Karen into captivity as hostages into the Gaza Strip here he is with his parents his father AI is sick with worry he doesn't know whether Hamas stole his son's glasses whether he saw dead bodies he says he's taking sleeping pills every night to try to sleep and he wakes up in the morning and he feels guilty that he wasn't thinking about them this is this this is it is the most terrible conflict and you you highlighted the plight of that little boy but the truth and there is no excuse but the truth is but the truth is that no matter what children everywhere are suffering children are suffering in Gaza as well this is this is this is a terrible situation where and you would you would accept can I just can I just ask you this that you would accept that the children in Gaza who have died and have been wounded by the Israelis air strikes did not deserve to die you accept that the humanitarian suffering that we're seeing in response to hamas's decision to declare war against Israel on October 7th is truly heartbreaking and I wish we weren't in this situation and no one were getting hurt this isn't a war that Israel started it's not a war that Israel wanted it's not a war that Israel even expected off but what happens but what happens is there was no Aid in today now that affects children as well you need to put fuel in so that the aquafers can provide fresh water water is a human right so how so therefore how does it how does it help pure cause to make sure that children don't get the medicine never mind adults but ordinary Palestinian is that children don't get the medicine they need that children don't get food that children don't get water is that any way in a sense to conduct this conflict so let's set the record straight first of all Aid is entering the Gaza through the border with Egypt not there was a consignment of trucks and we're hopeful that will continue but since you mentioned fuel it's important to know that Hamas holds 500,000 lers of fuel in the Gaza Strip right now I don't know whether that includes the 24,000 lers of fuel that it stole from onra from the the United Nations just a few days ago but there is plenty of fuel in the Gaza Strip the problem of course is that the terror regime that controls the Gaza Strip that conducted the October 7th Massacre is choosing to hog that fuel in order to conduct order to continue its war against Israel the fuel is there fuel there plenty of it we're very short time I want to ask you one very uh short actually final question what the Palestinian prime minister said was that there's no leadership in Israel ready to sit down is there a chance of peace and peace talks between the Palestinians and the Israelis pery I very much hope that one day we will be able to have peace in this land but for now we have to destroy Hamas we have to defeat the terror organization that perpetrated the October 7th Massacre because Israel cannot go back to the conditions on the sixth of October on the 7th of October that cannot happen that would leave Hamas free to Butcher and behead and burn again thank you no way Israel can afford that thank you much
