now we've been reporting in the last half hour those new lines coming out from the White House Israel agreeing to 4H hour military pauses in Northern Gaza also information about two humanitarian corridors to allow people to flee the hostilities so let's head to Washington let's talk to our state department correspondent Barbara PL Usher and Barbara tell us more then in terms of what the Americans have been saying in the last little while what they have said is that they've reached agreement with the Israelis to have a 4-Hour pause every day um in order to allow Palestinians in Northern Gaza which is where the main military operation is to flee safely to the South and they Israel we have been told would give a three-hour notice every day when that pause would be uh and the Palestinians if they wanted to leave would be taking uh safe passage corridors which reportedly have actually been um operating for several days now but now they would have um a cessation of military operations um for them to take those corridors safely to the South so that's the that's the announcement um they uh the White House is hoping to be able to use such pauses to get more Aid into Gaza um they're hoping to get up to 150 trucks daily of Aid that hasn't happened yet and also ultimately um perhaps to use pauses to um facilitate the release of hostages now it was reported uh previously that President Biden had asked the Israeli Prime Minister for a three-day pause uh in order to facilitate hostage release but also to get you know significant amounts of Aid in um so he's just been asked if that was indeed the case and he has said yes in fact he asked Mr Netanyahu for longer than a three-day pause and when he was asked whether he was frustrated with the Israeli Prime Minister he said this has taken longer than I expected it to um so you know read into that what you like but this is definitely something that the Americans have been pushing uh relentlessly through the president through their special Envoy on the ground through the Secretary of State to try to get uh not a ceasefire uh but breaks in the fighting in order to get Aid in and to help Palestinian civilians get to Safe areas Barbara as you were talking I know in the last few minutes Joe Biden has talked to reporters there at the White House before heading off to the helicopter and exactly as you were reporting there was asked about that three-day pause for Gaza and a pause much longer to try to get hostages out so we will actually play for viewers that clip here in just a moment or two but quite clearly in terms of the pressure from Washington on Israel's prime minister it is upping yeah I mean you have seen the evolution of the the the rhetoric and the pressure from uh from Washington over the past month as the situation has changed as the uh military operation has led to the kill in of thousands of Palestinians as the humanitarian crisis has grown completely dire as the uh un humanitarian officials said last week uh there is no more life sustaining functions in Gaza and so uh the Americans while they support the Israeli stance that there cannot be a ceasefire at this point because they say that would benefit Hamas allow it to regroup they have really been pressing for a break in the fighting in order to address this dire situation to get a significant amount of Aid in but also again to try to get the hostages released and there's been reports floating around uh lately about perhaps a deal in the making we can't confirm that but those those talks are very active so most definitely the pressure for some kind of break in the fighting longer than an hour or two which is what Mr Netanyahu referred to in an interview earlier this week long enough to actually get something done uh has been coming from the White House and from the state department Barbara pleas user there in Washington thanks very much for that
