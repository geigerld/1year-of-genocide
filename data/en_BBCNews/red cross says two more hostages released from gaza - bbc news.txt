right you are live with BBC News as we've been uh reporting two further hostages have reportedly been released this evening that's according to Hamas uh those individuals uh we have not uh at the moment received any uh independent verification on that but those details have been coming through in the last hour 90 minutes or so I'm we're going to talk now with someone who has extensive experience in trying to negotiate for the release of hostages from Gaza Albert Matan he is a co-founder of the conflict mediation group forward thinking thank you very much for coming on the program thank you for the invitation so since we uh we invited you this developing news in the last 90 minutes as I mention two more hostages released according to Hamas we await uh independent verification of that whilst we do what's your reaction to it well I think it's a good sign and it's exactly a week go today I was in DOA and I conveyed through channels the desire to release all of the civilan hostages and without any preconditions so I hopeful hopefully this could be the beginning but it takes two two Tango as to say if I can put it that way um you know that without the willingness on both sides to secure the safe Passage of all the civilian hostages I think people will be in danger okay can you take us as it were into the room where it's happening behind the curtain what what we received in in in from the social media account uh the Hamas statement they talked about Qatar Egypt mediation what what does that mean what's going on well it it means messages are passed um there's never direct engagement between um Israeli officials and Hamas officials they don't meet together they have always used intermediaries to pass messages and it's a longterm usually long term because usually there uh quid proquo you know what do we get for this who do we get and so forth in this particular case I understand I think it was the the operatives who went into Israel committed the atrocities and I think it's inexcusable The Taking indiscriminately of civilians um that they they made a mistake and the way I would see it is that Hamas are Keen to hand back all the civilian hostages now I stress civilian as opposed to the military okay that's that's an important distinction you mentioned quid proquo would it be your understanding that the uh four people released if if we do get confirmation of the latest two that there will be something in place then and and what what could that be well leis from the conversations I had in DOA I I think the the fact they civilians there were to be no conditions they were going to be handed back as soon as conditions um allowed for the safety because you wouldn't keep 200 or it won't be 200 it'll be I don't know how many civilians but you would not keep them all in the same place so it's a question of how do you move such numbers around Gaza do you release them 2 by two or whatever I would hope not I would hope that we could have a ceasefire that we could create conditions in which a process of exchange could take place and I say that should take place in these circumstances without any conditions interesting you've made the distinction civilian and not what therefore is the process and protocol around non civilian hostages well the practice of taking soldiers and I'm explaining it not endorsing it not justifying it but the practice of capturing Israeli soldiers was simply to use those young people as leverage to release Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails currently before this um outbreak um of cycle of violence you might say renewal of that cycle um there were about 4,000 um is Palestinian um prisoners in Israeli jails now some of those were convicted some were on the the detention without trial and the capture of a soldier was a precious commodity if I can put it that way a bargaining chip in which you would get these cases reviewed I think the answer to it for me would have been for Israel to after the Shalit deal to have introduced a review system of all cases and have had an independent review of all the convicted Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jail so that there could be some hope of people being released at present there's no hope for many of them murnan absolutely fascinating to get your behind the scenes expertise thank you very much for coming on the program thank you leas and let's hope the news tonight is the beginning of something that will be ongoing and all of those hostages will be returned to their families Oliver mcturner thank you I just want to bring you an update to this uh in the last few minutes CBS News which is the BBC's media partner in uh the US then are reporting uh the two hostages are being released by Hamas an Israeli government official has confirmed to CBS News uh the names of the two as well so uh just to outline exactly how the process of verification and Confirmation in these kind of situations works we had initially the statement on social media by Hamas through Hamas uh media channels uh which we then take and clearly investigate we don't take that on its own uh the way that media organizations work around the world and BBC included is you have Partnerships with different with other uh media organizations ours in the US is CBS news they have spoken to an Israel government official uh confirming to CBS News uh the names of the hostages and in terms of how this plays out last week when we had the first two uh um hostages being released released uh after the CBS News confirmation BBC did independently uh confirm a pretty short time after that too uh right let's take a look at another post that's just come up on uh social media you can see from the icrc let's see what they saying about it we facilitated the release of two more hostages transporting them out of Gaza this evening our role as a neutral intermediary makes this work possible and we are ready to facilitate any further release we hope that they will soon be back with their loved ones and to re reiterate what happened the last time last week with two hostages was a similar uh process and it wasn't until uh that they were confirmed safe on Israeli territory that we then heard from uh officials and authorities in Israel confirming things like uh name and status of the two hostages so we will wait and see if and when uh that happens but clearly more confirmation coming through that two two Israeli hostages uh have been released by Hamas we're going to keep across all those details for you and when of course the BBC established our own independent verification we'll bring that to you as well
