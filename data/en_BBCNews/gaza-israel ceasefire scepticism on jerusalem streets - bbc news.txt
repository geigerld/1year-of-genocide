if the ceasefire works so that really there is quiet and Hamas is not able to rearm themselves and something is put in place so that they are demilitarized then I think it's a good thing I think everybody is tired and needs a rest and needs to get back to a normal life I'm a little bit skeptical as to whether it's really going to hold and whether Hamas will follow through this time as we know they've broken their ceasefire time and time again I think we've seen it before um I don't think really solves anything the whole Mi didn't solve anything we're back where exactly where we were before uh it's my opinion as long as they don't want peace we're not going to have peace uh they have great opportunities to have economic growth and have peace and grow they just don't want to do it so as long as they don't want to do it we're not going to have peace I'm not really sure it will be I think we'd have to go in and physically remove the Rockets the missiles and the launching infrastructure it's the only way I could see it being quiet anytime soon
