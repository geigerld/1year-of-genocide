let's start in Gaza where the Israeli military has confirmed that six bodies found in a tunnel in the city of Rafa were those of hostages held by Hamas after the October the 7th attack it's named them as Israelis Alexander lobanov almog cusi Eden yerushalmi Ori denino carel Gat and HS Goldberg poin who was an American citizen he had appeared in a Hamas video with an amputated arm a few months ago in statement President Biden called his death tragic and reprehensible saying Hamas leaders will pay for their crimes the missing families Forum has again urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire for the release of the remaining hostages elsewhere three Israelis have died after their vehicle was fired on near the city of Hebron in the occupied West Bank well with me now is Muhammad Taha from BBC Arabic uh Muhammad let's start first of all with the news of the bodies of six hostages that have been found what more do we know about the operation in order to be able to find them and recover those bodies so the operation was to secure just a tunnel where the Israeli forces found an alive hostage last week aladi a bedwin hostage so the Israeli forces was just trying to clear the tunnel and they found the bodies there so they didn't go there upon uh and intelligence information or something they just found them while they are searching the tunnel so the circumstances around the killing so uh the Israeli there is exchange of of accusations the Israeli Army saying that Hamas kill killed them intentionally and the Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu just issued a a statement a few minutes ago saying that we will continue to free all hostages and Israel will not rest until we reach the killers means you know he's int inciting that the military operation in Gaza would continue but Hamas issued also a statement and they said uh that they were killed in an Israeli shelling and they said that what they described as as practicing genocide in Gaza and the support of President Biden to Israel as they said is the cause of the death of these hostages so there is this exchange of accusation between two parties and how much does this add pressure on to the Prime Minister we heard there uh the comment from the hostages families Forum they've also said that uh prime minister Benjamin netan should take responsibility for abandoning the hostages indeed today is a big day for Israel in Israel as the is Sunday as everybody came from the Sabbath we saw in the evening last evening a big demonstration asking the uh prime minister Netanyahu to strike a deal there is a call by the families of the hostages to for a general strike in in in Israel there is already strike in the secondary school there supposed to start today and it did not uh start and they are calling the uh the Labor uh um syndicates or unions to call for a a wide strike to try and make this moment where they found the bodies of this hostage a turning point to try to convince the Israeli government to do some action the Israeli Prime Minister canceled the annual the sorry the weekly meeting of the Israeli government that's happening every Sunday morning he canceled this meeting and there will be a meeting on 400 p.m. local time uh to uh to address the issue this meeting was called by the defense minister yuav Gallant who is already was vocal about his disagreement with the Prime Minister Israeli Prime Minister bamin netan in his approach of insisting of having uh permanent presence permanent military presence of the Israeli forces uh in Gaza so the situation now in in in the Israeli territories is really in high tension and as you mentioned there is also attention in the Western Bank and in Gaza well Muhammad stay with us we'll come back to you in a moment but let's now go live to Jerusalem and to our Middle East correspondent John donison John we were talking there about the divisions in Benjamin netanyahu's cabinet how much does this latest development add to that well I think Muhammad's right it reflects the divisions within the government but also the divisions within Israeli uh Society but Benjamin Netanyahu in his short statement this morning said uh Those Who Kill hostages do not want a deal referring to the allegation from the Israeli military that these hostages were brutally murdered in their words by Hamas shortly before the bodies were found you have to remember though that back in November last year we had a ceasefire temporary ceasefire where hostages were being exchanged for Palestinian prisoners every day that went on for about a week with roughly 10 hostages a day coming out and a lot of questions being asked about why didn't Israel continue with that process for a longer period and then some of those who we now know have died uh might have been freed the certainly the hostage uh families Forum saying today that the people whose bodies have been found today would have been alive today if a hostage deal could have been done and we have heard reports haven't we of uh Mr netanyahu's defense minister uh disagreeing with him as well and and accusing him of putting his emphasis on uh deploying IDF in the Philadelphia Corridor over the hostages what more can you tell us about that yeah well the last time the security cabinet met earlier this week uh there are reports of a shouting match between yab Galant and prime minister Netanyahu yab Galant saying that this insistence on in leaving Israeli forces in the Philadelphia Corridor that's the Border area between Gaza and Egypt was blocking a deal that is something that Mr Netanyahu has insisted uh he is going to pursue and and continue with you have to remember that within his government government there are also more Hardline elements who want Israel to be doing more milit territory and have said they will resign from the government bringing the government down if a ceasefire deal is done and I'm talking about uh itar benav the uh Hardline national security minister and all also the Finance Minister Mr smrd who have said they will pull out of the government so he is torn Mr nety as he has been now for months of trying to keep his government together but also the pressure building for a ceasefire deer not just from diplomats but also from Israeli citizens and in particular those hostage families and John we have also been hearing about three Israelis who've been killed after their vehicle was fired on uh near the city of heon what's the latest on that yes well you'll be aware looks me that for the past four or five days there have been intensified Israeli military operations in the north of the West Bank targeting uh Palestinian militants at least 20 people people have been killed in those raids and Strikes on Palestinian cities and Israel says it's trying to protect its citizens from attacks well in the south of the West Bank bank near Hebron which is the biggest Palestinian City in the occupied West Bank three Israeli police officers were killed in a shooting attack overnight on their car uh and uh we not got the details of their names yet but certainly that is a another dangerous development in the West Bank which the warning is that there could be a war in the West Bank similar to what's we've happened has been happening in Gaza for the past 10 or 11 months John thank you that's our Middle East correspondent John donison live in Jerusalem for us
