large numbers of Palestinians have continued to flee from Han Yunis the second biggest city after an Israeli evacuation order the UN says that a quarter of a million people have been warned to move from the east of the city they've been told to seek refuge in a coastal area where there are few basic Services Reports say that an Israeli air strike killed 12 Palestinians who just arrived there despite it being designated as a safe Zone by Israel well earlier I spoke to our Middle East Corr respondent yolan Nell who gave us this update so this is the latest evacuation order from the Israeli military it was issued on Monday evening and very quickly we saw thousands of people uh fleeing uh towards this Coastal area um over in in the west of the Gaza Strip um those scenes have been continuing panicky chaotic people who've been displaced already multiple times and the reason just so many people are affected in this part of Kanan yunes is because the city although it had been largely destroyed by an Israeli military offensive that ended uh back in April you'll remember that it was seen as being a stronghold of Hamas well people had begun to return to their homes there even if they were camping out in the rubble and then when Israel began its ground assault in Rafa uh the Southernmost city of Gaza back in may we saw the UN said about a million people fleeing from there and many of them ended up uh in KH yunes uh now they're on the move move again people saying it's just really not clear where they should go to uh for safety because as you were saying um as much as there has been some bombardment uh in the east of of KH unun with the Israeli military saying that one of the sites it hit was a rocket launch site where Islamic jihadist said to have launched Rockets from uh on Monday uh but even in this area that's been designated as a humanitarian Zone we're getting a report of an Israeli air strike that took place yesterday um killing according to to the reports we've seen from medic and local people um a family who' just gone there from unun have asked the Israeli military for comments on that strike on a building um where the family was staying with other relatives of theirs and they haven't yet been able to get back to me with a comment so difficulties when it comes to whether this is a a a genuinely designated safe Zone also the conditions on the ground are we getting Aid through is the situation improving somewhat at all when it comes to getting aid distributors to people or is it still a really difficult situation there I mean of course what's happening now with this latest Mass displacement of people is just going to complicate things further but what we've seen according to humanitarian agencies is that the situation in the South and in the center of the Gaza Strip has just become um much much more difficult since Israel launched its operation in Rafa because uh that closed the the Rafa Crossing with Egypt that was a main crossing point for Aid coming to this the most crowded part um of the Gaza Strip you have most of the population uh displaced and crammed down into this uh half of the territory you land now there in Jerusalem
