I mean, look at the big dilemma. You also want to maintain the policy or the editorial line of the channel. I am now in a cemetery in the Tal al-Sultan area. It is being lifted. I mean, I am the first.  Once in my life I see this scene. Now a large mass grave is being dug. Then we received news that the army wants to hand over a number of these remains. At that time, there were between 80 and 100 bodies. They were handed over. They were in a large box in a truck. The smell was difficult. We could not open the box. These bodies had been handed over.  By the Israeli army to the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing. Now the local authorities are burying. I apologize. There is a smell. There is a very difficult and unpleasant smell.

The situation has made us leave what it left behind, and it is a shame for us to part with Gaza. [Music] Of course, I am the first and last choice for Gaza, and I must return to it, so when it will end, no one knows
