start with that breaking news from the Middle East because hundreds of Hezbollah Fighters have been injured by their communication devices exploding across Lebanon what's been described as an unprecedented hostile act Iran's ambassador to Lebanon is reported to have been among those affected well let me just show you the moment that one pager exploded in a supermarket in bayout there you see people rushing away the explosion in the foreground apparently it was in a bag been carried by a man and that just one of the locations and similar things have been reported in so many different parts of Lebanon in Beirut in southern Lebanon other videos posted online show people with injuries some of them really severe ambulances have been seen rushing through the southern suburbs of Beirut to Hezbollah stronghold lebanon's Health Ministry has called on staff to report to hospitals and for people to donate blood it said anyone with a pager should immediately discarded unnamed security officials say the pages were hacked by Israel which hasn't commented Hezbollah official called it the biggest security breach suffered by the group well with me in the studio is our security correspondent Frank Gardner and Frank these still the the early details of this it was first being reported uh less than two hours ago take me through first of all what we know sure I mean it's extraordinary this um almost unprecedented I can't think of any case where you've got a simultaneous almost simultaneous explosion of so many personal devices now these were not mobile phones they were Pages which sounds very 20th century but the reason for that is that when the Gaza War uh or conflict began after October 7th massacre in southern Israel um an order went out by hasbalah to its people not to use mobile phones in case they were sabotaged and the reason for that is there's a bit of History here is that back in January 1996 somebody called Yahya aesh who was known as El mandis the the engineer he was the chief bomb maker for Hamas and he was assassinated by shinb Israeli intelligence with an exploding mobile phone so people have always been a bit wary of those and what H yet what happened this afternoon was the almost simultaneous detonation of these devices these pages that had been used by hundreds of Hezbollah not just Fighters but Medics officials and others they appear to have been tampered with at some stage they've been ordered relatively recently in some cases only received with the last few days Israel is not commenting on who might have been behind it Frank before I ask you the next question I want to put on the screen again just that video of one of the explosions because you were just describing how there are so many blasts and there you see it in the in the foreground uh an explosion in a bag you mentioned that it wasn't a mobile phone it was Pages I'm reading here and it's been quoted three security sources talking to Reuters saying that the pages uh that were detonated were the latest model brought in by Hezbollah in recent months so exactly as you're saying these are all things that they had purchased in the last few weeks yeah and that they thought that they were doing the safest option um interestingly these devices are don't appear to be designed to be lethal so they've they've um inflicted some very n wounds some injuries on people many of whom are in civilian dress now they may or may not work for Hezbollah they may be bystanders but you know there's there are hundreds of wounded have' been brought to hospitals across Lebanon mainly in the southern suburbs of dya in beut um but they are for the most part low charge so you know not packing enough to actually kill somebody in the vast majority of cases but to send a very strong message and let's not forget that this comes on the same day that Israel has extended its War aims to include expelling Hezbollah basically from the border so the low grade ongoing conflict that Israel has with Lebanon on the sou on that border the joint border they've got has driven roughly 60,000 Israelis away from their homes and businesses on the Israeli side of the Border a bigger number than that on the Lebanese side hundreds of casualties in total on both sides and there's a lot of political pressure on Israel's cabinet to deal with this once and for all to deal with the problem of Hezbollah firing rockets and drones and missiles across that border they want to push Hezbollah north of What's called the Lani river which is technically at the end of the 2006 War that's where it was supposed to have stayed but they've crept South and that's why there is this ongoing exchange of fire Frank before I ask you the next question let me just show you the live pictures from one of those medical centers that we have pictures coming into us from bayroot because large amounts of people around one of those Hospital centers there you can see just scores of people waiting I suppose for updates and some of the injured being taken to Medical establishments like that now it is being reported by reuter that Iran's ambassador to Lebanon is one of those injured you were making the point in terms of the whole backdrop to this but the fear has always been about a wider war between Hezbollah and Israel alongside that war that's already going on with Hamas in Gaza this adds to all of those fears doesn't it it does and remember that uh it wasn't that long ago on I think it was July the 30th that Israel admitted assassinating somebody called f shukar in the southern suburbs very close to where most of this is concentrated Southern subur was a beut and he was a senior commander in Hezbollah he was assassinated with a Precision drone strike that hit him in a building Israel um openly admitted it that was followed of course a day later by the assassination of Ismael hania in Teran which Israel has not uh owned up to but everybody assumes it was them he was the political leader of Hamas so after that hasbalah vowed Revenge um the have there was a sort of flurry of rockets from Hezbollah and Hezbollah after that said right score settled for now um this I think regardless of the fact that Israel hasn't commented on it is going to be laid at the door of shinb or mosad Israel's intelligence agencies Hezbollah will expect to demand some kind of retaliation some sort of Revenge um and Iran of course will probably support them at least verbally and diplomatically uh and possibly even with Supply further weapons because Hezbollah are the most powerful non-state military force in the Middle East they are a force to be reckoned with they've got a massive arsenal of rockets which is sort of poised should they choose to launch them at Israel now the retaliation would decimate Lebanon the Lebanese are saying please don't our economy is on Dar State we're on our knees please don't up the war with Israel anymore than it is already but that's why it's a very febrile tense atmosphere and you're right something like this could tip it over the edge Frank Gardner thanks very much for that analysis
