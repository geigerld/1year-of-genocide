we're on a hill on the edges of Israel and this group of young men is looking towards the horizon and if you have a look there you might be able to see some smoke stacks those are in Israel but if you keep looking left and keep going you'll start to see a builtup area full of crowded buildings that is Gaza right on the Mediterranean coast and that is where the Israeli Army has been carrying out its air strikes in recent days Palestinian militant groups have fired more than 100 Rockets from Gaza towards Israel some have been fired towards ashalon but other Rockets have been fired in this direction towards the town of stot and many people at the moment are deciding to stay off the streets they've got bomb shelters they've got protected areas and people we've spoken to in the town say that they want the Israeli Army to act hard against Hamas
