let's turn our attention to the Middle East now during a phone call with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu President Biden stressed the urgent need to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza the White House said they also discussed us efforts to support Israel's defense against what it called all threats from Iran and proxy terrorist groups including Hamas let's speak to uh my colleague uh s shahata from BBC Arabic who's in Cairo side we were led to believe last week after the talks Drew to a close in K that they were due to start in Cairo where you are what's happened uh no news about any uh resumption of the talks uh because uh some of the Hamas members of the political Bureau of Hamas uh said that they are not willing for any new negotiations because they send the reply to the proposal announced by uh Mr Biden the American president on 2nd of July so they don't accept any conditions more uh demands from the Israeli Prime Minister Mr Benjamin Netanyahu uh so there is uh from Hamas sides are not willing to any new negotiation in new conditions in addition to that within the Israeli negotiation team there is reports about disagreement between Mr n from one side and some members of the negotiation team regarding the some of this members want the deal to be done as the American wants but Mr Netanyahu seems uh to put more conditions which are not accepted even by Egypt or Hamas so now it's like a deadlock and no one knows uh will uh the negotiation will be restarted again in in Egypt or not how is this affecting the apparent optimism that some were expressing last week yeah that optimism came from the American but like uh from Hamas side and Israeli side is no optimism because Hamas like uh members of the political Bureau uh several of them said like the Mr n put more obstacles the hostage family put pressure on Mr Netanyahu to reach a deal but there is some staking points between the two sides especially after What's called the bridging proposal by the United States announced by uh Mr blinkin the American foreign minister which was not revealed publicly but there is some dis agreement especially the uh talks about the presence of Israeli forces along the Philadelphia Corridor or Salah Corridor uh and the Nim Crossing which separate between the North and Central and South of Gaza so and within the plan of uh which accepted by Hamas and announced by Mr Mr Biden there is three stages of this plan and there is disagreement about the names of the uh prisoner released and the numbers and and the withdrawal of the Israeli forces because the Mr Netanyahu repeatedly said there is a red line about fighting Hamas until he demolish Hamas and there is no signs he demolished Hamas yet after almost 11 months of the war since uh 7th of October so there is some staking points especially the presence of Israeli on the Philadelphia Corridor which is not accepted by Egypt or Hamas n because Hamas said they need the people evacuated or forced to leave their house in the north to go back but the Israeli put conditions that should be monitored because you don't want to allow any uh militant uh according to the Israeli and Mr Nan to go to the north without like being monitored and screened so there is many sticking point disagreement so the optimism came from the American side but from the concerned side the Israeli and the Palestinian there is no optimism s for the moment thank you very much s shahata from BBC Arabic speaking to us from Cairo in Israel a funeral ceremony is being held for one of the hostages whose bodies were recovered from Gaza earlier this week 8-year-old yor Meto was kidnapped from his home in kibutz near oolong with his wife tamama who was released from Hamas captivity after 53 days the Israeli mil military received retrieved the bodies of six hostages from the Gaza Strip on Tuesday as negotiations continue to bring back more than a 100 people still being held captive in Gaza
