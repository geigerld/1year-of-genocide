we start with the latest from the Israel Gaza conflict and it's been one of the heaviest nights of bombardment in Gaza since the start of the war with Israeli air strikes hitting the north of the territory and reports of huge explosions Israel says it's now effectively divided Gaza into two parts North and South further south the Royal Jordanian Air Force cargo plane has dropped several containers of humanitarian relief supplies over the Gaza Strip Jordan's State News Agency said the consignment was urgent medical aid for the Jordanian field Hospital in Gaza Israeli media Reports say the airdrop was carried out in coordination with the IDF meanwhile the US has stepped up diplomatic efforts in the region the Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is now in Turkey for meetings with the country's foreign minister also the country's CIA director William Burns is now in Israel urging greater effort to avoid civilian casualties and in the last few hours the White House has said that vice president Kamala Harris will discuss the conflict in a phone call with unnamed foreign leaders later today well let's just show you that scene live across the Gaza Strip where it's currently just after 900 a.m. and we'll be bringing you more on all of those latest developments in the next half hour but first we're going to begin our cover with this report from our Middle East correspondent Yan n the Relentless bombardment continues the latest Israeli strikes in Northern Gaza among the most intense so far and once again phone and internet lines were cut this was yesterday's aftermath locals say dozens were killed sayed's wife and daughters were wounded he searches on for his neighbors can anyone hear me in he shouts there are people this is part of Gaza where civilians had been told to flee to Israel's military says it's looking into whether it was operating in the area at the time Israel's ground invasion is advancing its military says it's now divided the territory into two and that it's doing what it can to avoid civilian casualties for several hours Israeli forces say they opened a route for gazans to head south the relatively few made the journey on his latest stop in Turkey the US Secretary of State is hearing calls for an immediate ceasefire from around the region Washington backs short pauses in fighting everyone would welcome the mara because again it could Advance things that we're all trying to accomplish including getting uh hostages back including getting a lot more assistance into Gaza including getting people out of Gaza one of the more than 240 hostages being being held in Gaza is 84-year-old Elma Abraham her family found this photo online where she's seen being taken by her Mass her son worries how she's coping without her medication right now we are 4 weeks after that four weeks and one day and they still not here and they should be here yesterday not today yesterday I'm like in a in some horror movie mov that I'm stuck but yeah I still have hope Israel says that without progress on releasing the hostages it won't agree to any pause in hostilities for now for so many each day brings only more suffering yoland Nell BBC News Jerusalem so that's the latest from Gaza itself we're also following developments overnight further north on Israel's border with Lebanon Lebanese State media have reported that three children and their grandmother were killed by an Israeli military strike on a car near the border itself the Israeli military said it had targeted a vehicle identified as suspected transport for terrorists and was checking reports that civilians had been inside Hezbollah said it had fired multiple rockets at Northern Israel in retaliation we're live now to Lebanon and our News correspondent Yugo Bacha so what's the latest on those strikes Ugo yeah Lua so I think this shows how tense the situation HS here along the Lebanon Israel border so this attack happened last night again the Lebanese authorities are saying that four civilians were killed uh and they say that this was uh after an Israeli strike that targeted this car not really far here from our positioning teer in southern Lebanon and last night it has po politician said that the group would retaliate and I think the fear here is that this could lead to an escalation of these hostilities here between Hezbollah uh the powerful Lebanese group and the Israeli Army I think last week we had uh the first speech by the leader of Hezbollah Hassan nzala he did not announce an escalation of of of those attacks that have been carried out by the group but he did leave the door open for more attacks if uh depending on the situation on the the ground and he did say that Hezbollah could return to its uh rule of Civilian for civilian in other words if Lebanese civilians were killed Israeli civilians would be targeted so last night hasah said he had retaliated he had launched uh a barrage of missiles targeting uh positions in Northern Israel and I think there is the concern here that this latest attack that resulted in these four civilians being killed could lead to an escalation of the violence here here and uh last night the Lebanese caretaker prime minister uh described this attack as a crime and uh pictures of this car this you know car that was destroyed after this U attack uh were widely shared here on social media on Lebanese television so again tensions remain really high along the Lebanon Israel border obviously the US Secretary of State who um secretary blinkin is on a tour at the moment really trying to calm things down how significant would it be if Hezbollah were to enter into this conflict yeah so after that speech by Hassan nazala I think there was some optimism from American officials saying that they believe that the conflict had been uh contained uh in Gaza that there was no sign that the situation here could escalate and this could become another front in the conflict but the reality is that these attacks continue they have been frequent they have been happening uh in several locations along the border so there's always the risk of miscalculation there's always the risk that uh a single incident could uh spark a much more violent confrontation here so I think that's the fear here hollah has indicated that these attacks are going to continue the Israeli authorities say that they're going to respond to every single attack coming from groups uh operating here in southern Lebanon and obviously I think some still fear that this violence could escalate and Lebanon could be dragged into another conflict and uh if you're aware of this but I I'll just bring this to you and our viewers so via the Reuters news agency we're hearing that Britain's foreign officers said that it's temporarily withdrawing some Embassy staff from Lebanon um have there been other moves by other governments yeah we H had in the last few weeks a number of countries announcing that they would uh remove some of their personnel they would uh also uh they would telling their citizens to leave the country uh as soon as they can while commercial flights were available uh some countries have also told their citizens to not travel to Lebanon so I think this is a reflection of the situation here how volatile the situation is along the Lebanon Israel border as this conflict between Israel and Hamas continues as ever thank you very much indeed thank you well we're going to cross live now to uh Geneva and speak to tamasa DEA longa who is the spokesperson for the International Federation of the Red Cross and red crescent societies hello there and thank you for joining us here on BBC News obviously this has or rather on Sunday night we saw the third comm's blackout by Israel on Gaza how has that affected your agency thanks a lot for me today and thanks for the question uh yeah it affected badly because we had for the first time as you said Total Blackout of communication with our teams in Gaza and we're deeply worried about that and even the other thing that is really concerning is that the gazin the people in the Gaza Street will not be able to contact the Emergency Medical Services so the ambulance service and this we already saw in the other two times that affected our operation and also the ability of uh ambulances and healthare workers to reach the people injured or who need the medical assistance obviously the Jordanian King has announced that Medical Aid was dropped into parts of Gaza I believe the northern area of Gaza which has been hard as hit by uh Israel's bombardments um is there the likelihood that more of that will take place well I mean I I I have to say that um any humanitarian Aid entity in Gaza it's a positive it's a positive news but the reality here is that there is not there is not a continuous flow of humanit enter in the Gaza Street first is still a drop in the ocean very important but still a drop in the ocean and secondly that we we know at least from our Hospital of alud in Gaza City of the pales Cent is that mainly no humanitarian Aid is entering in the north and is a great concern all the civilians in Gaza and all the Care Facility in Gaza must receive much dity humanitarian Aid such as medicine and medical equipments for hospital but also put the water for civilians we understand there there have been two reports of strikes uh on or near some refugee camps within Gaza the alour refugee camp and also magazi refugee camp many of the injured were then sent to the alifa hospital what can you tell us about how these hospitals are coping well I can tell you that the health system in Gaza in general is really on the brink of collapse or almost collapsed some Care Facility already closed for lack of fuel or lack of medicine and then the pressure on the hospital the still are open is immense I can tell you that our colleagues in Gaza City in the auts hospital are telling us a scene where there are patients literally everywhere in corridors in the Halles everywhere and Medicine are really running out and um fuel is running out so electricity and then there is this confusion where people know exactly what will happen next uh we had in the last 48 hours different shelling literally in front of our hospital that created damages inside the hospital like Windows broken but also damages to Intensive Care Unit we can call them collateral damages but for the people who are in panic and for the people who are uh in that hospital it means really an horrible daily life and this must St obviously Israel have announced that they've effectively split Gaza in two now North and and South how is that impacting on your operations and what is your plan moving forward you're in the main aloud's hospital is that correct yes exactly and and then also pal is running out ambulance service I I have to say that it's a bit difficult to to make an assessment at the moment because the situation is volatile and it's changing pretty fast what I can say is that humanitarian teams ambulances heare workers should have access and should have a safe and an interet access in every situation so I I do hope and I do call on all the parties to make this happen and to make sure that people who need health support will get it no matter if Gaza Strip is divided in two or three or whatever is the next step okay Tomaso Del longa thank you for joining us here on BBC news thank you thank you
