some breaking news uh to bring you now we have just had this statement from the IDF uh about the investigation into the killing of seven Aid workers uh in Gaza in an Israeli air strike um the the uh uh statement says that the investigation's findings indicate that the incident should not have occurred those who approved the strike uh this statement says were convinced that they were targeting armed Hamas operatives and not the employees of wck which is uh World Central Kitchen the aid agency they go on to say that the strike on the aid Vehicles is a grave mistake stemming from a serious failure due to a mistaken identification errors in decision making and an attack contrary to the standard operating procedures they go on to say that uh after being presented with and considering the investigation's findings the uh IDF chief of general staff decided that the following command measures will be taken um the Brigade fire support Commander an officer with the rank of major will be dismissed from his position the Brigade Chief of Staff an officer with the rank of Colonel in reserve will be dismissed from his position Additionally the Brigade commander and the 162nd Division Commander will be formally reprimanded the IDF Chief of Staff decided to formally reprimand the commander of the Southern Comm command for his overall responsibility uh for the incident uh they go on to say that the IDF uh emphasizes its commitment to fighting against Hamas terrorist organization while upholding the values of the IDF the laws of war and avoiding harming civilians uh the final sentence says the IDF will learn the lessons of the incident and will incorporate them into the idf's ongoing operations um let's go to our Middle East bureau chief Joe floto Joe uh we have just had this statement in as I was saying but um from first reading this is extremely significant particularly the um the the Lessons Learned uh that line really stands out to me the IDF will learn the lessons of this incident what do you make of it well look the the IDF took a group of journalists last night uh very late last night to the ministry of Defense to give them uh a briefing uh which was embargo which was we weren't allowed to publish until uh now uh to explain the context in which this happened and and it's fair to say that that uh that the soldiers at that briefing were mortified uh they uh recruited a a retired Major General to have a look at the facts uh and what comes across is uh as you've pointed out already a series of catastrophic errors I think one of the biggest ones was that they failed to to disseminate properly throughout the area of operation that there was an aid Convoy process happening that evening there already been one Convoy that had run earlier in the evening and uh they had failed to notify everyone uh who was F fighting in that area that this was continuing so in that context they say their soldiers were on the lookout for Hamas gunman and had seen some of them uh approach the aid Convoy earlier in the uh in in the evening uh they showed us some video of a gunman climbing on one of the aid trucks a big lorry uh and shooting in the air not clear what they were shooting at whether it was a warning shot they then described how after depositing that truck full of Aid that had been delivered to the coast uh a number of vehicles separated in different directions one vehicle headed north uh and that was positively identified and they showed us video of gunman exiting that vehicle in the meantime three vehicles belonging to World Central Kitchen uh were driving back down to the southern end of the strip and at that point we're told that their drone team identified a person entering one of those Vehicles carrying a gun turns out that was a mistake turned out it was a bag and the rdf pointed out that one of the catastrophic mistakes was for that team to seek authorization to Fire based on what turned out to be very flimsy evidence they weren't sure and they shouldn't have asked for authorization to fire the other shocking thing I think was the detail last night of how the individuals inside those Vehicles survived the initial strike so uh in the space of 6 minutes the Israeli military uh fired three missiles at each car but they're in sequence so they hit one car where they suspected there was a garment it wasn't they'd made a catastrophic mistake two people are seen leaving that vehicle apparently we haven't been shown that footage entering a second vehicle that was part of the Convoy 2 minutes later that vehicle is Struck from the air and there are survivors from that second air strike who enter the Third vehicle in that Convoy and try to make their their way away from the scene two minutes later they are struck again by a missile and at that point well we know the result seven people ended up losing their lives and we've heard from the families of those victims we heard from them the the the family of uh Jacob Flickinger earlier they there there has been speculation that they were targeted directly but that in this statement they are absolutely conflicting that and they was they are saying that this this is this is a mistake so one one of the things that is clear from from the brief amount of video that that we were shown last night is that at night with the cameras that they have on their drones uh the large Colorful World Central Kitchen stickers are not visible at least on the video that we were shown uh and the Israeli military wanted to stress that at no point did their soldiers believe that this was an aid Convoy they thought that they were gunmen however there are very simple remedies uh to uh to be able to identify vehicles uh at night from drones uh all military vehicles have got special reflective tape that could have been used but most importantly there was no way to contact the team on the ground so the Israeli military said that once they spotted a gunman earlier in the evening they made an attempt to contact World Central Kitchen contacted their coordination Center which I understand is in Washington uh they were unable to reach their people on the ground now we're told by a agencies that this is frequent event the phone system is obviously uh deeply deeply dysfunctional uh satellite phones don't work very well uh and we are told by the aid agencies that the IDF themselves prohibit the use of radios so it was impossible to contact them but the bigger context is that this was an aid operation that was effectively sponsored by the IDF these shipments from Cyprus directly to Northern Gaza had been something carried out under the aaces of the IDF they were providing security that evening and not to have told everyone involved uh in operations in that evening that there were civilians in the area uh appears to be one of the most serious failings uh in this whole Affair which is why the the the the commander of Southern command so that's one of the most senior jobs uh in the IDF has been formally repr reprimanded by the chief of staff in the statement they also say we express our deep sorry for the loss and send our condolences to the families and the wck organization they say we consider the vital humanitarian activity of international Aid organizations to be of utmost importance will continue to work to coordinate and assist their activities while ensuring their safety and safeguarding their lives I mean we know that those um that it looks like those Crossings will will at some point uh be opened but do you think this this could could therefore have an impact on those Aid organizations because you know if they if they know that this could happen that this is a mistake will they put their staff at potential risk so let the M Ministry of Defense here say they're already taking steps to improve the coordination uh of uh Aid and to make it safer you've just pointed out that there as a result of this incident and uh what we understand was was quite a difficult conversation with the American president the Israeli Prime Minister has announced the opening of further Aid Crossings and and critically the use of ashod Port which is just 45 minute driveway from northern Gaza to deliver Aid uh into uh the war zone now there are going to be questions about Safety and Security I think there are also questions about the level of evidence the threshold above which the IDF considers it appropriate to use lethal Force when they only suspect that someone might be a gunman so plenty of people will look at this incident and conclude that this scrutiny has happened only because six international passport holders were ultimately killed but lots of people will W will wonder whether that laxity uh that speed uh possibly you would justify as recklessness uh in applying lethal Force when it's not clear that a gunman was uh in the vehicle uh has something that's been applied in the last 6 months countless times possibly there is a great deal of suspicion that the use of force is applied recklessly and this will do nothing to assuage people's suspicion of that we also have a map um Joe I should point out that the the map you're about to see has been given us by uh the IDF um and that Joe kind of takes us through what happen can you just reiterate what they are saying happened in this situation yeah so let's it's it's a complex story but let's go through it uh so in the top right of that picture you'll see the the improvised Jetty that has been built over the last few weeks to take uh Aid to Northern Gaza and it it is uh there that a a ship with about 300 tons worth of food Aid has come from Cypress and docked in Northern Gaza rdf were providing security for that that area and they were unloading that ship that evening so a previous Convoy had already departed earlier in the evening without any event at all uh at about 10:00 that night they offload a further 100 tons onto a truck onto a big lorry uh and that heads down the coast to a point on that map I don't know if it's still up called The wck Welcome Center that's where they're met by the escort of these Aid workers who consquently lose their lives and that's where the IDF say that a gunman boards the aid Lorry and fires shots in the air we don't know if that was locally agreed security or whether it was a genuine attempt by Hamas to hijack an aid Convoy we don't know at this stage the people who do are now dead but that truck with its escort goes down the coast then turns left Inland to a warehouse and is deposited in that warehouse and at at that point the Convoy splits one car goes north which the IDF say and they've shown us video contain four gunmen and then three cars which we now know contain seven members of the world Central Kitchen staff uh heads back to the coastal road which is the road that takes them away from where the fighting is uh in central Gaza and they're heading home and it's at that point when they leave that warehouse that we're told that the Drone crew uh appears to see a gunman enter one of those vehicles with no evidence of that and that we weren't shown any video of that point in the decision making but it's clear that they mistook a bag for a gun and on the basis of mistaking a bag for a gun they sought authorization for a missile to be struck at that first vehicle
