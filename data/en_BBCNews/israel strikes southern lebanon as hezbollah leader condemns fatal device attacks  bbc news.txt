hello and welcome to today's verified live the Hezbollah leader Hassan nasala has given his first public response to two days of attacks in Lebanon using sabotage communication devices he described the attacks as an unprecedented blow to the Iran backed militant group but vowed to continue to fight Israel the number of people killed by exploding pages and walkie-talkies has risen to 37 with over 3,000 people wounded the Hezbollah leader said the operation CR C all red lines thousands of pages were targeted by the Israeli enemy and detonated at the same time with this operation the enemy crossed all rules laws and red lines he didn't care about anything at all not morally not humanely not legally let's go live to Beirut live to our correspondent Hugo Bea Hugo you listen to the entirety of that give me your analysis yeah I think it was very interesting that he acknowledged that this was a massive security blow unprecedented uh in the history of uh Hezbollah uh and uh as expected uh he promised a harsh punishment uh but he didn't give any indication of how this response is going to be but I think it was also interesting that uh there was no change uh in hezbollah's position again the indication is that Hezbollah is not interested in an escalation in this conflict with Israel we've seen that uh for almost a year Hezbollah has been attacking uh positions in Northern Israel saying that this is in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza Hassan azraa again said that this campaign these attacks are going to continue unless there is a ceasefire uh in Gaza so this has been the main hope here to deescalate the distinctions between Israel and Hezbollah and those negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza have been unable to reach a deal uh Hassan nazala also reflected on uh those decisions that have been taken by the Israeli authorities to add the return of those residents who've been displaced from communities in Northern Israel uh as one of the war goals he said that uh these um attempts by Israel will not succeed and again that these attacks by Hezbollah are going to to continue so no clear indication of what Hezbollah is going to do again has expected some harsh words against Israel saying that these attacks that happened here uh in Lebanon amounted to a declaration of war he said it was a massacre uh and again uh reflecting on the suffering of the population here over the last two days Hugo as you were talking there we were showing pictures of those Israeli jets that screamed really low over Beirut earlier at the start part of that speech you've been there in the city over the last couple of days I was talking to someone from Beirut only in the last hour who was saying how different the last 48 hours have felt there what has it been like exactly and it has been different because we've seen that this conflict has been by and large contained to areas along the border between Lebanon and and Israel and now what's happened in the last two days is that this conflict has been felt by the population here of Beirut and other parts of Lebanon and obviously people here are scared they're very angry as well uh because of the extent of these attacks these are explosions that happened as people were shopping were uh with their families at home children are among the dead um uh but again uh these are explosions that happened uh across the country and including in several parts here of Beirut creating Panic uh in the population one of our producers received a message from a friend saying that she was uh replacing her Lebanese seam card with an international one because he was concerned that her phone could explode so I think this gives you a sense of the feeling here of how scared uh the population is after those uh two days of attacks you go live for us there in Beirut thanks very much let's continue with this with our chief International correspondent Lee duet who's here with me leas it was fascinating listening to the different stages of nasan HZ talking there how weakened is Hezbollah do you think well of course he put on a very brave face today saying that their Communications Network had not been shattered but from everything that we have seen and just the numbers alone uh right across the country also in pagers and walkie-talkies are exploding in also in Syria and and in Iran it is clear that their Communications nwor has been crippled their confidence has been struck um and also it you heard from Hassan n that this was the most devastating most humiliating blow unprecedented uh for them so yes they are in many many ways they are weakened by it and the question will be they're now the they will now feel HonorBound and this is what we're hearing from Hassan nasah he talked about a reckoning they have to show that they are able and willing uh to strike back and some of our colleagues who follow his statements really really closely are saying that what's different in this speech this time we've had many defiant speeches from Hassan Nilla since the events of October the 7th and throughout this Rising tension along that Lebanese Israeli border that he always says when they're struck in the in the in the aftermath we reserve the right to respond at an appropriate time and place this time he warned Israelis you will not just hear the response you will see it this time well that's interesting and interesting that you pick out those words what do you make of Israel's strategy the sorts of decisions that have been made over the last three days adding a new war aim we saw that Sunday night then talking about a new phase of the war then moving troops to the North of Israel yes there's been a steady drum beat isn't there the eve of this uh what has to be called a mass casualty attack even though Israel says it has pinpointed as you've been reporting we've been reporting ever since they happened they it was very discriminate they went off in markets and Father's hands when their children were close by well just before that prime minister Netanyahu in the security cabinet added to their War aims the return of 60,000 Israelis from the communities along the Lebanon border returning to them to their homes they have been living as displaced people ever since these tensions started rising in October then we had the pager account whether that was coincidence or not there's a growing view Matthew and I'm sure you've reflected it on the program that it was a kind of a use it or lose it moment as is that some hisbah operatives understood that something was wrong with the system Israel had to use this weapon um in other words or else they would not would they would lose this kind of tool and yet again today even with the buzzing of the aircraft lower than ever before there's this constant message from Israel we know where you are and we can get you even in your hands and only in the last 10 15 minutes we've seen Anthony Lincoln this time is in Paris he's been shuffling around both the region and other Western capitals again asking pleading for deescalation but every step is the the opposite of that where is diplomacy do you think within all of what we're seeing well Amos Hawkin who is the envoy uh for President Biden to work on the Lebanon front what has been called since the beginning the second front he was in Tel Aviv when these tensions were ratcheted up when they added this New Lebanon War aim uh to to their their their list already the the Gaza list including of course bringing the hostages home Hassan n today made it clear that the Border would not be safe and calm that the residents would not return home in the North of Israel until there was a ceasefire in Gaza that is the view of Hezbollah that's the view of Iran the only way to end this violence is to end the Gaza War and yes Anthony blinkin is continuing to shuttle going from he went to Cairo to talk to the Egyptians who played a leading role and there's a new proposal on the table it doesn't seem as though it's one that can be acceptable to uh yes um to sinir from everything we know about this most uh militant the most uh even Hamas people describe as the most violent in a violent organization that he would not want to leave the Gaza Strip but that offering is now being put on the table it seems from the reports that we've seen that in exchange for releasing all of the hostages that there would be so-called safe passage for senoir and other Hamas leaders to leave Gaza but there are many who are saying that's just not the ilk of Sino they're not going to leave I was talking about Anthony lincol and the message around Lebanon and deescalation it's worth just playing that clip in the next few seconds France and the United States are united uh in calling for restraint and urging DS alation uh when it comes to the Middle East in general uh and when it comes to Lebanon in particular we continue to work to get a ceasefire for Gaza over the finish line and as we discussed uh with some of you just a day ago uh in Egypt uh we believe that remains uh both possible uh and necessary but meanwhile uh we don't want to see any escalatory actions by any party that make that even more difficult well it is an extremely difficult situ ation at the moment for diplomacy a final word leas because you have the Iranians also watching they claim retaliation yes they have unfinished business according to them how dangerous then is this moment that we've arrived at this is the most dangerous moment we've seen for decades in the Middle East and a region that is all too often plunged into this kind of a violence there has never there have been many sadly for people of the region many many wars but there has never been this kind of a war which draw draws in so many players at the same time and so many players willing to use whatever it takes to get what they want to take Mr say
