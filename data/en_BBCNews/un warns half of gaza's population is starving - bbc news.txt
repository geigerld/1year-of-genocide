Israeli military for a response new aerial shots show Palestine Square previously a bustling spot of Gaza City now under control of Israeli forces marking the Jewish Hanukkah holiday after two months of the most intense ever war between Israel and the Palestinians the scale of the suffering and Devastation here is unprecedented yolan Nell BBC News Jerusalem we can just show you some live shots now of Gaza itself this is the view from Israel looking into Gaza and you can see huge plumes of smoke there on the skyline going up into the sky um we've been watching these pictures for a couple of hours now and there's been constant uh plumes of smoke rising up over Gaza today that's the live pictures from a camera in Israel pointing towards the Gaza Street our correspondent our Gaza correspondent Rush Abu alif gave me the latest on the situation inside Gaza last night there was a very heavy fighting inun not from the direction that the Israelis have been trying to uh you know move into the city center of kanun but from another Direction in the east of kanun they came from Bena Village and they cut through Salah Road and now they are advancing from another Direction into kanun people were talking about very heavy fighting overnight and and this morning with also Israeli artillery fire was Heavy in that area the since the collapse of the humanitarian Seas fire the Israeli Army was pushing hard towards the city of kanun kanun is the second biggest city in the entire of Gaza Strip and it's the place where about a million people came this place from the north and they were taking canun as as a shelter now they have to to move farther west to the area called Al maasi it's a very small area not not designed to receive this number of people there's no building or infrastructure in it and also other people were left to RAF RAF is a very small town near the border with with Egypt and people are now hundreds of thousands of people are taking this very tiny piece of land as a as a shelter and the humanitarian situation is really severe in the area with very little Aid coming other two key places where the Israeli Army is pushing hard is the east of Gaza City neighborhood another stronghold for Hamas and in the north jab but last night the focus of the operation and the fighting the heavy fighting was down we've been hearing from the UN officials saying that Aid is really only reaching a very small area of the territory I mean what is in terms of the movement of people how much are people heeding those warnings and moving around or some people just finding that they're having to stay put despite the fighting around them yes I mean like in jabalia in the north there was warning from October the 13th about over like a month ago for the people to leave but because the the the south is very crowded and people don't know where to go and since the Israelis are controlling the Main Street Sal Ro and there is a checkpoint and fighting according to Hamas local author in the north there still about 100,000 people in jabal refugee camp itself and that's almost like 30% of the total number of population who lives normally in javal Camp is the biggest Camp about 250,000 people and according to like local Authority and the UN about half million people are still in Gaza City and the North and since the this map of that this divided Gaza into too many looks were published by the Israeli Army following the ceasefire about 80% of the population don't have internet to activate this QR code and know where to go and how to go the the Israeli Army is droing leaflets in the area but sometimes they ask the people to go from this corner to that corner and they don't know they that they should stay in the other corner where to go because next day they might receive another warning to leave this corner so very complicated humanitarian situation in guys Abu Al there now let's go live to Jerusalem we can speak to our correspondent yolan Nell and we've been hearing these dire warnings haven't we Yan from the aid agencies talking about how people are starving and Aid really isn't getting through to the people who need it and then we've also as the counter to that we're hearing from the head of the Israeli Army talking about how they need to step up their campaign in Gaza indeed and actually if you look at what's been happening overnight it does seem that there is an intensification of fighting uh there's been smoke rising up from the Horizon over the north of Gaza and we've heard of Heavy bombardment Across The Strip overnight then uh down in Ken Unice the Israeli Army has given more evacuation orders for places in the center of that City seen as a stronghold of Hamas telling them to flee um but we're hearing that the fighting actually now is is along the main road between yunas and Rafa so already with hundreds of thousands of people crammed down close to the Egyptian border it's not really possible for people to pass more along that route and it's going to complicate this Aid effort even more um with with you know Aid agencies increasingly complaining not just that enough Aid is there's not enough Aid getting into the Gaza Strip but also that it's impossible really to effectively distribute it inside Gaza we've also had the US approving the emergency sale of arms to Israel will that make a significant impact I mean certainly this is just being seen as as more evidence of uh the strong us support for Israel at this stage in the operation it's been so important with um calls mounting internationally for a humanitarian ceasefire uh the US had to use its veto power to prevent a resolution being passed at the UN Security Council on Friday night um so we see Israel at this stage really pushing forwards with its operation I think it really want in kenun to try to find the Hamas leaders it believes are hiding there um it's the head of Hamas in Gaza yaka sinir is is from that City he's not been found in the very extensive operations that there have been um in in Gaza City uh further north and now that the pressure is on the Israelis really to try to find those Hamas leaders they believe may be hold up now in the South and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu coming out overnight saying defiantly Israel will continue in our just War to eliminate Hamas what happened with the negotiations in terms of trying to reinstate the truth because we know that the the Israelis withdrew their people didn't they but are people still carrying on those negotiations the qataris like what what is happening on that front to try and and reintroduce uh the truth because you know so many people in Israel will be wanting to know about what the you know the issue with the hostages weren't they of course and yes the cateres the Egyptians uh with us involvement as well are still working behind the scenes we understand uh trying to get another deal that could potentially bring hostages out but at the moment uh all the language from Israel it's very sort of strong rhetoric about how uh they are pushing forward with this stage of their offensive last night in Tel Aviv we did see large crowds Gathering once again um it's making it sort of more solemn for Israelis the fact that this is is the the Jewish Hanukah holiday uh there are many families who have hostages still being held inside the Gaza Strip uh for whom you know this is this is a really difficult time um and 137 people still believe to be held there and there are calls from some section of Israeli Society for the Israeli government to do much more to bring those people home thanks very much your land now for us there in Jerusalem
