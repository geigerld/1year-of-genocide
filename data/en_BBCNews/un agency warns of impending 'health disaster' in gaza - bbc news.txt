now let's return to what we've heard in the last couple of hours because President Biden talking to reporters before he left Israel but after his talks with Mr Biden Benjamin netanyahu's office said Israel will not allow any Aid into Gaza from its territory until the hostages are returned but it will not block Aid going in from Egypt well the UN agency Ana is on the ground in the Gaza Strip his director of communications Juliet tumor talked to me earlier about Aid that is desperately needed but also her reaction to the events at that Gaza Hospital in the last 24 hours attack on the hospital was horrendous our un Secretary General um condemn it last night right after it it happened uh civilians should be protected civilians are not safe anywhere in Gaza no place is safe in Gaza few hours before that um one of our schools an Andra School in fact that is a Sheltering displaced family was also hit during during Israeli air strikes and um and bombardment um the loss of life continues the loss of Civilian lives lives continue and that has got to stop this is why it's absolutely critical that there is a ceasefire right away so that civilians are protected so that we don't continue to lose civilians totally unnecessarily like we have been for the past 11 days we were just listening to the US president he said he had tough questions and conversations with the Israelis in those meetings when you heard him say that the people of Gaza need food water power and they're asking for humanitarian assistance to be allowed in you must be heartened by that are you hearing anything on the ground about practically how and when that might happen not just yet not just yet The Siege on the Gaza Strip continues for the 11th day and The Siege on the Gaza Strip must be lifted so that Andra is able to bring in much needed humanitarian supplies not just Andra all other humanitarian agencies who work in Gaza we would like to ask for The Siege to be lifted we're urging we're urging for The Siege to be lifted so that we can bring in much needed supplies including fuel so that water runs back into Gaza two million people two million people do not have water in Gaza and they're resorting to unsafe drinking water we're going to have a health disaster soon in Gaza if we do not have our humanitarian supplies go into Gaza for people who need need it most the president was making the point that perhaps inspections would have to be done there On the Border in terms of stuff crossing the borders he said none of it must go to Hamas in your view and in your experience are those things that can be sorted out relatively quickly or are those things that take quite a lot of time well when it comes to anra we will bring in the supplies ourselves our own un unra teams on the ground will distribute it to those in need we have been doing this for many many years these are un staff they are accountable to serve the communities in need and they will ensure that that assistance will get to people who need it most to civilians who need it most well that was latest from The Honorable spokesman as uh President Biden has said that Israel has agreed to humanitarian assistance beginning to move in from Egypt into Gaza so that is a significant glimpse of progress
