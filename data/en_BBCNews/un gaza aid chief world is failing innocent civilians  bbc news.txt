the un's most senior official overseeing Aid and reconstruction in Gaza has said the world is failing innocent civilians there after nearly a year of War ZD KARK has been addressing the UN Security Council and she described her assessment of the ongr situation in Gaza as somber and dark I can tell you every day that passes life in Gaza is unlivable the risks are high disease is uh continuously at risk of outbreak children are not in school people are living in tents this is not the Gaza of before the 7th of October it is Hell on Earth so every day that passes impacts people's lives well let's speak to George morera D Silva the executive director of un Ops that's the UN Agency for projects and services he's also the under Secretary of the under Secretary General of the United Nations and was at that session that we played a bit of just now at the United Nations today thanks very much for joining us here on BBC News a really Stark assessment there from your colleague sigd describing Gaza as hell on Earth uh we've been covering the situation on uh BBC for close to a year we speak to Aid agencies we speak to people on the ground um what do you think needs to change Beyond of course calls from many organizations for a ceasefire thank you for um inviting me I I went with Sig we both went to the security Council today and de brief the the the Council on the situation in in Gaza and we were very clear about what is really needed we need a ceasefire we need humanitarian law to be fully respected we need unimpeded access to Aid to those most in it um but now we we're also able to to show that what we have been asked to do we delivered as you may recall uh some months ago the security Council decided to call for the creation of a mechanism to facilitate the operationalization of Aid into Gaza to overcome the bottlenecks the delays the redundancies the multiple inspections and unops uh uh with the with the senior coordinator for uh humanitarian Aid and reconstruction in Gaza we work together finding a solution that deliver results today at the secret Council i' I've I've been able to to brief members on the fact that through this mechanism with One Stop Shop uh database to approve all Aid and also with the monitors on the ground to speed up delivery we were able to have all the The Crossings and all the corridors to togethera being uh uh operating in a smoother and swiftly uh manner but at the same time it's very clear that this is not about logistics we may fix everything outside Gaza to have uh less transloading less inspections uh smoother operations um better coordination more producti ability at the end of the day if things inside Gaza doesn't improve there is no possibility to reach those most in need um some people watching this might say well that's all very well intended the goal to try and have mechanism to try and get more help and Aid into Gaza but the very fact of the matter is that that's not happening and it's politics only really that can change that yes it's political will it's precisely the topic do you really believe that you and sigd can change the mood at the UN when it hasn't changed for months on end at least we removed other excuses or pretexts because Logistics uh were uh presented very often as an issue now there is no no excuse um the the mechanism is functioning uh in a well manner so now it's very clear that the problem is inside Gaza and it's not just about DEC conflicting it's also about these incidents that are not accidents are incidents with un uh uh convoys being targeted uh with a with a no capacity to operate in in safe conditions with humanitarians that have lost their lives including a colleague of mine from my agency yobs so this is the moment where the political will needs to Prevail it's the moment where uh um it's it's fundamental to to ensure that uh we put in place our best political and diplomatic capacities to overcome this situation and George I wanted to ask you about this because Sigrid um actually on her visit to Israel did meet senior Israeli officials including the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu what did she say about that conversation um and does she believe that anything may have changed as a consequence of that chat Sig has has managed to engage at the political level with all parties in the in the region and this has been an important element to ensure uh that we would have um always the chance to engage and to better understand uh the each other's position now we have more data to reveal that issues need to be fixed again through political will you remember uh I came to to to to BBC and other occasions that we were not knowing exactly uh the rational for rejection of materials for dual use now you go to our database and you know exactly uh how much Consignments have been approved how many have been requested how many have been rejected and why for instance from the rejected Consignments out of the 37 Consignments that have been rejected 31 was just for the fact that it was through unra so the fact that unra is a consigner or a cons is a reason to stop this so now everyone is more accountable so you can ask the questions with the data and with the facts okay thank you very much for explaining some of the work that you're doing um that's George morera D Silva the executive director of un Ops the UN Agency for projects and services speaking to me from the United Nations in New York
