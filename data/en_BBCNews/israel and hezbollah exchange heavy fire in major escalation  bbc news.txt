we begin in the Middle East the United States says it's working to prevent the conflict between Israel and the Lebanese group Hezbollah from escalating into a regional war after Sunday's heavy bombardments the UN Secretary General Antonio grz has called for an immediate end to hostilities on both sides in a televised address hezbollah's Secretary General Hassan nazala said that the delay in the retaliation attack for the assassination of its military commander last month was to keep Israel on edge he also said they still have to assess the impact of its barrage and did not roll out another strike from Tel Aviv Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel's air strikes were not the end of the story and added they had destroyed thousands of hezbollah's short range rockets and no progress on the Gaza ceasefire talks in Cairo either Hamas which has now left the Egyptian Capital said it rejected new Israeli conditions and accused them of backtracking in on promises Israel denies changing its demands since a last round of talks in early July all for more on this we can speak to our Middle East correspondent in Beirut Hugo Bea so Hugo we heard that Hezbollah isn't rolling out further attacks Benjamin Netanyahu is saying it's not the end of the story where are we yeah I think it was very interesting that last night the powerful leader of Hezbollah Hassan azrah gave that speech essentially he said that the attack was over the retaliation for the killing of fad Shuka the senior Hezbollah Commander was assassinated by Israel here in Beirut a month ago and Hassan nzala also said that gave indications that uh no major operations against Israel were being planned so I think he was trying to deescalate tensions with Israel uh yesterday there were concerns that those attacks could uh lead to a major conflict between Hezbollah and Israel we've seen that so far this violence has been relatively contained to areas along the Lebanon Israel border uh nzala did say that uh the group could attack Israel uh again but given everything else in the speech I think this seemed to be something that had to be said rather than uh a threat against Israel uh and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also y today said that uh what happened was not the end of the story and again I don't think it's surprising that he's saying it uh he needs to keep all his options on the table he's under a lot of pressure to act against Hezbollah to allow the return of tens of thousands of uh residents who have been displaced from uh communities uh in Northern Israel but uh behind the scenes there have been indications that both sides have said they're not interested in further escalation obviously this doesn't mean that the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel is over but again we see indications that uh they're not interested in a major conflict that could have catastrophic consequences not only for Lebanon but also for uh Israel and uh the main hope uh of of a deescalation here is a ceasefire deal in Gaza and we've seen that the latest round of talks for a deal uh in Cairo ended yesterday without a major breakthrough so what's the the state of alert there then Hugo in in in light of the recent events yeah so for weeks uh we've been waiting for this uh response by uh Hezbollah and uh the work concerns that this could lead to a major escalation and there have been fears here in Lebanon that Hezbollah could be dragging this country into another confrontation with Israel uh many people here still remember what happened in 2006 uh the war between Hezbollah and Israel the devastation caused by the conflict not only to areas of Southern Lebanon but also to parts of Southern Beirut and many people you know fear that history might be repeating itself it seems now that uh you know worst case scenario has been averted at least for now there have been these indications from Hassan nazala that the group is not interested in uh in an escalation of these hostilities with with Israel and even uh in Israel we're seeing that there have been some signs that uh you know the Israeli government is also trying to prevent a major escalation with Hezbollah but again uh there has been a lot of anger uh from residents in the north of the country they say that they have been under attack uh almost every day with rockets being fired from Hezbollah and they've been urging the Israeli authorities to do something to uh push Hezbollah away from the border and to allow the return of tens of thousands of people who have had to flee their homes in Northern Israel because of this violence happening along the border okay Hugo Bea in beir thank you very much well for more let's speak to Yosi bin former Justice minister of Israel and one of the initiators of uh Israel Palestine Oslo Peace Accords thanks very much for your time here on BBC News let's pick up with those peace talks then in light of what's happened is is there any chance of those uh talks having a positive outcome yes I believe that uh Israel doesn't want to continue this war it is really long overdue and I hope that this is also the situation on the Hamas Side ER the point is that it is not peace talks of course it is it is talks about a ceasefire hopefully a long ceas fire and uh the other side is not recognizing Israel and Israel is not recognizing Hamas of course and to get to the decision makers on the other side is very difficult so what you hear is is rumors from time to time or a declaration of one of the Hamas people but the groups are there I mean the the the teams uh are there negotiating still and I hope that it will end by an agreement this agreement is not going to be an historic one but it will put an end at least to the current situation whereby people innocent people are killed and and you don't see any Horizon the US is saying it's it's working to prevent the uh any conflict escalating what what can they do to move on these peace talks well they are doing a lot they are actually the main player not the only one because you have Qatar and you have Egypt but it is a very important player and I think that they can put push the the parties directly indirectly they have their own ways and and I hope that eventually reason will prevail and it would be possible to put an end to it I mean we are there in in a kind of an ongoing war from September October the massacre of Hamas in the southern of side of the part of Israel and nobody is is gaining anything from this war just losing we know obviously the elections uh in the United States are coming up presumably Netanyahu will be watching those closely and I I was just saying that with the uh elections in the US uh coming up Netanyahu were presumably watching those very closely to see what happens yeah but I I don't think that this is going to have any direct impact first of all the the elections are very close but uh the the 20 of January is further and we have to put an end to this situation much before I think that waiting for the 20th of January and hopefully netanyahu's candidate will not win but even if he wins I think that waiting for him is a is a kind of betting because you never know with this person ER I mean Trump of course what is he going to do what is he going to say he may surprise the world this way or another if God forbid is elected and it was and if it is as I hope Kamala Harris it it will be the same kind of a policy like the the current policy of President Biden okay we have to leave it there Yosi bin thank you very much for your time here on BBC News
