we start this hour in the Middle East Israel says it has struck a series of Hezbollah targets deep inside Lebanon according to the Army terrorist infrastructure was hit including stockpiles of weapons it follows a deadly rocket attack on the Israeli occupied goolan Heights on Saturday in which at least 12 people were killed most of the casualties were teenagers who were playing football in the town of majal Shams Israel has blamed lebanon's Hezbollah movement it has denied responsibility Let's cross live now to Jerusalem and speak to our correspondent Barbara plat user welcome to you Barbara tell us what's the latest on the Israeli strikes the Israelis uh carried out these strikes overnight in Lebanon in the southern part of the country um where those crossb conflicts has been happening um over the past months with Hezbollah but also further north in the Baka uh according to the the Air Force and that is uh less common for the Israelis to strike there so I think that was probably a message that they are preparing for um uh for for a larger operation and certainly that is what uh the Israeli officials are saying the language that they're using is very tough the defense minister uh has said we'll ensure that Hezbollah pays a heavy price for this loss the Finance Minister uh is is calling for the the the grp the leader of Hezbollah to pay with his head the for the foreign minister is saying an allout war is approaching so the rhetoric is pretty steep uh there's going to be a security cabinet meeting later today when the Prime Minister returns from the United States to talk about what the next step will be but I think everyone is expecting uh that the strikes that we saw overnight could be just the beginning uh of how the Israelis will respond and what more details do we have about the rocket attack on the goolan Heights in which at least 12 people died well that rocket struck a football pitch where where uh children and teenagers were playing football it it frankly it could hardly have been worse the all of the casualties are are young people uh many of the names have been released as well as the ages the youngest was 10 the oldest was 16 uh and there was one family that lost four children so it's a real tragedy the funerals are have started last night and they will continue uh later today uh an eyewitness said that the sirens did go off when the rocket uh was in the was in the air but there wasn't enough time to get to the shelter the children were running towards the shelter uh but the the Goan Heights is very close to Lebanon and so the time before the warning came and the time that the rocket struck wasn't enough and it struck between the children and the and the shelter so uh it was it was a very very uh tragic and and uh strike and the leadership of the community has responded with great anger and great anguish uh against those who Hezbollah or they didn't name Hezbollah but they said against the terrorists who launched the strike but also against the Israeli authorities saying that we really don't have enough protection here uh because we're right next to the border with Lebanon we need to have more uh protection we've had strikes before this is just the deadliest one yeah Hezbollah denying it was them but Israel the IDF giving details about the rocket uh and the bomb and saying it could only have been them that's right Hezbollah had been carrying out some strikes earlier in the afternoon on Saturday day for which it claimed responsibility but uh it very strongly denied that it had hit the town of maal shamp so when the extent of the damage became known uh based on what it had said earlier it was targeting an Israeli military base in the area so it's possible that one of the rockets misfired in fact that seems probable it's interesting to see the reaction in Lebanon because this conflict has been taking place between Hezbollah and the Israelis uh but other uh constituencies in Lebanon have responded clearly because they're very alarmed that this is going to lead to a a bigger conflict if not an allout War the head of the Drew community in Lebanon and I should say that the community that was hit in Israel in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights uh which is where M Mel Shams is located uh was a community of uh Arab Drews there are many Drews also in Lebanon and the leader of that group um did come out and condemn the killing of civilians but he also said look Hezbollah statement said they weren't responsible we have to remember that the Israelis um try to divide uh and sight Discord and fragment the region with their efforts and so he was putting the emphasis on Israel rather than on Hezbollah uh and calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a ceasefire the Lebanese government also has made various statements it usually stays out of of this ongoing conflict but it again condemned the killing of civilians but said uh that there must be a sensation of hostilities the foreign minister has spoken recently and he said look I don't think hbal would have targeted this community it's a community of Arab Drews as I mentioned and uh and we have a large uh number of them in the country perhaps it was a mistake either by Hezbollah or by Israel um but he clearly was worried that this would lead to a bigger conflict and he said we are talking with Hezbollah uh and and asking them not to retaliate at this present time so I think uh the expectation is of a strong Israeli strike and clearly the Lebanese authorities are trying to convince Hezbollah not to respond to that okay Barbara thank you well we will be live in Beirut in just a few moments time first though let's remind ourselves of how events unfolded on Saturday Mark loen has been monitoring developments and sent us this [Music] report early evening in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights and the warning of an incoming threat about to become deadly and dangerous a rocket struck a football field where children and teenagers were playing several were killed in the deadliest strike since the crossborder fire between Lebanon and Israel began last October the anguish of loved ones at young lives cut short in a conflict that could be about to escalate sharply a rocket barrage which lit up the sky was claimed by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah but it denies firing the deadly strike onto the football field that the Israeli Army spokesman says is a lie this attack shows the true face of kisala a terrorist organization that targets and murders children playing socer on a Saturday evening we will act to restore full Security on our northern border for all the citizens of the state of Israel and the question is how Israel's government will react Benjamin Netanyahu is returning early from the US to chair his security cabinet where he'll face calls to hit back hard as the young injured were rushed to hospital fear is growing that allout war with Hezbollah a proxy of Iran could now be drawing closer South in Gaza the other front of this war Palestinians too were scrambling to save lives this time after Israeli strikes killed dozens here too its children paying the price in a nightmare with no end the missiles tore into a school housing displaced Garin Israel says it targeted a Hamas command and control center inside but from the rubble came those simply seeking shelter Mustafa says the blast threw him into the air and he fell to the ground I didn't know where to run for fear he says so I fled inside the school thinking it was safe but then I saw heads hands hands and feet the spark from the 7th of October ignited Gaza and now Golan the question here is will it start an inferno Mark loen BBC News Jerusalem
