in the last few hours the Israeli military has announced what it's calling a daily tactical pause in part of Southern Gaza but not the city of Rafa it says the halting operations will be during daylight hours to facilitate the delivery of aid aid organizations have repeatedly warned of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza Israel meanwhile has released the names of the eight soldiers killed by an amass rocket in Rafa on Saturday the deadliest incident for its troops in months Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the nation on Saturday following the deaths of the soldiers here's what he said with deep sorrow in heavy mourning I bow my head together with all the citizens of Israel and mourn the fall of our heroic Warriors Deputy Company commander in the Engineering Battalion captain wasm mmud and other heroic soldiers whose names have not yet been released don't let anyone distract you from the simple and clear fact despite the heavy and staggering cost we must stick to the goals of the wall destroying the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas returning all our hostages making sure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel and returning our residents safely to their homes both in the north and in the South Benjamin naha let's go live to Jerusalem and our News correspondent John donison John I wondered if we could start with what we know about this tactical pause that the Israeli military's announced in the last few hours well to be honest it's not really clear because initially we had a statement from one branch of the IDF saying that indeed there was going to be a tactical military pause each day lasting from 8:00 in the morning till 7:00 at night around the km Shalom Crossing from Israel into Gaza and then stretching over to the main Coast Road which runs north to south in Gaza we've since then though had another statement from the IDF saying that it wanted to bring Clarity that there is no cessation in hostilities in Rafa or in southern Gaza and that the operation to get Aid into Gaza is continuing as normal that followed a statement from Israel's Hardline national security minister itman benav who said that whoever made the decision to introduce a tactical pause was both evil and a fool how much Aid is getting into Gaza at the moment well according to Aid agencies and the United Nations not enough there is no Aid Crossing in from uh Rafa uh from the Egyptian side of the Border we've got thousands of trucks backed up there waiting to bring Aid in some is passing in uh every day through Kum Shalom but as I say not enough according to Aid agencies the uh us built Pier off the coast of Gaza has been dismantled this week because of uh rough Seas uh so there just isn't enough Aid getting in the UN is saying that more than a million people in Gaza are facing starvation within a matter of weeks Israel disputes that they say there is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza meanwhile the fighting continues and we have the deaths of those eight Israeli soldiers on Saturday yep eight Israeli soldiers who've now been named they were aged between 19 and 23 so uh pretty young this was the heaviest loss of life for the Israelis since Jan January uh what apparently happened is they had been carrying out an operation against Palestinian militants in the early hours of Saturday morning as they were retreating from Rafa one of their armored vehicles was hit with some sort of missile there was a large large explosion and all died uh immediately uh Hamas is saying it targeted that ve vehicle with some sort of anti-tank missile a week ago or so we were talking about the possibility of a ceasefire and we've had uh more comments from uh the Hamas leader based in Qatar today yes this is coming from Ishmael hania the leader of hamas's political Wing who's in uh Doha and he has said that the the counter proposals I guess that Hamas put forward to that American Plan uh American Israeli plan were consistent what with what the United States has been demanding that is is contradicted by really what the state department is saying they say were some of the Amendments that hassad proposes were reasonable others were just not consistent with the deal and I don't think those talks are really going anywhere at the moment Anthony blinkin the US Secretary of State is now uh left the region his eighth visit to the region and there is a feeling I think on the ground that neither Hamas particularly their leaders in Gaza or the Israeli government led by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu I don't really think either of them are pushing for a deal at the moment yeah interestingly the Pentagon saying that the Israeli defense minister will soon visit Washington for talks with his us counterpart because uh Washington still would like a ceasefire if they could get one wouldn't they they do want one I mean frankly the whole world wants one the United Nations has pushed for it with that security resolution backing a ceasefire plan uh last week there's no doubt that the Egyptians and the qataris who are mediating uh want it but it all counts for nothing really if the two main figures who are calling the shots and that is yayya sinoa the Hamas leader in Gaza and prime minister bet Benjamin Netanyahu uh don't want one now here in isra Israel there are elements of his government on the far right who have said they will quit the government forcing fresh elections and bringing prime minister netanyahu's government down if he does a deal so it's hard to see that happening the Americans insist that this is an Israeli plan that they have signed up to it but Benjamin Netanyahu has certainly not said that publicly John Donan live in Jerusalem thank you
