the Israeli military is continuing its offensive in southern Gaza despite calls for the operation to be halted to prevent the loss of more civilian lives well Algeria has said that it would draft a UN resolution calling for an end to the killing the US has vetoed previous resolutions and says it still considers the Israeli campaign in Rafa to fall short of what it deems a major ground operation but it said that the deaths on Tuesday of 21 more people in a dis bled persons Camp were heartbreaking Israel has denied firing on the area well let's cross over live two Jerusalem our correspondent there yoland Nell joins us so yoland the White House saying the US continues not to believe that Israel has launched this what a a fullscale invasion of Rafa in southern Gaza despite that what does this mean for the people already displaced there where did they go well that remains big question we've continued to see people flee in the past day of course heading north um along the coastline um also to to Khan yunas um a city that was previously um really devastated uh by uh a fullscale uh Israeli ground offensive there that was seen as being a Hamas stronghold now what we're hearing this morning is there have been further Israeli air strikes in Rafa um we've been hearing as well in in the past day or so that um these have been in the west of the city that's an area where Palestinians had not been told to evacuate from uh previously now um we've also had Israeli Ground Forces advancing into the center of Rafa and along the Gaza Egypt border as well that was important that assessment that came from Washington last night really saying that it still sees this as being a limited operation not Crossing what it has defined as its red lines um to which would lead to uh US military aid vital Aid uh to Israel uh being stopped um they're saying that really they've not seen at this stage um that Israel has smashed into Rafa there's been hitting multiple points um with lots of troops on the ground but the US has said is closely monitoring Sunday's deadly strike um on that tent camp in the west at tesan in which at least 45 uh Palestinians were killed uh the Israeli military had said that it used precise bombs to go after two Hamas commanders um in that area um the US saying that those results the fire that broke out and that was something that was tragic we've been hearing from the Israeli military that this initial assessment is that there were um secondary explosions at the size of the Munitions it used it says could not have been responsible suggesting that perhaps uh weapons held by Palestinian armed groups in that area um could have been to blame there is this proposed un security Council resolution that is now circulating uh we're told put forward by Algeria following the closed doors emergency session uh that took place yesterday they have said they would like to see um an end to the killing in Rafa they putting forward a proposal on that um but of course we have had at the US vetoing multiple uh resolutions at the UN Security Council calling for ceasefires in Gaza okay well yand as always thank you very much for just bringing us up to date of the situation on the ground there Yan now live from Jerusalem well as Yan was saying that the Israeli military is continuing that offensive in southern Gaza as my colleague Lucy Williamson now reports Rafa was once gaza's Refuge the safest place in a dangerous War today the city's West and Center was emptying those still Sheltering here fleeing again amid air strikes and artillery fire taking whatever they need to survive whatever they can't leave behind there's been no evacuation order from Israel's Army and for many no sense of where to go I'm just walking in the street I don't know where to go there's nowhere safe where should we go this is not alive this is not aive they were packing up two in the displacement camp at Tas suan to the west of the city still scarred by fires triggered in an Israeli air strike on Sunday dozens dead survivors spent there's more than one way to lose a life Israel says its operation in Rafa is key to defeating Hamas and that Sunday's strike on Hamas commanders in the camp was carried out with precise Munitions that would not by themselves have caused so many deaths we're talking about munition with 17 kilos of explosive material this is the smallest munition that our Jets can use following this strike a large fire ignited for reasons that are still being investigated our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size while people fled today gaza's Health Ministry said more than 20 were killed in fresh air strikes to the West over half of them women as far beyond these borders three European nations officially recognize a Palestinian State and gaza's last urban center begins to fall under Israeli control Lucy Williamson BBC News Jerusalem and we we have a special section on our website dedicated to the Israel Gaza War for more detail and Analysis and background as well
