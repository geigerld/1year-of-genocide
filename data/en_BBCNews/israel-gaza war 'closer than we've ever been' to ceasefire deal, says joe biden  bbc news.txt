we begin with the latest developments in the Middle East and President Biden has said the prospect of a ceasefire deal is in Gaza is getting closer but is not there yet it comes after the US Qatar and Egypt put forward a new proposal for a ceasefire and the release of the remaining Israeli hostages Hamas reportedly have rejected the new conditions proposed at the talks in Doha the three mediators issued a statement on the second day of talks that suggested that the new proposal closes the remaining gaps The Talk have paused but will resume next week earlier the UK's foreign secretary David Lamy said that he was told by Israeli ministers that they hope they're on the cusp of a deal over the war in Gaza he was visiting Jerusalem with the French foreign minister Stefan sour and Israel announced that the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are expected to meet in person on Monday meanwhile the UN has described a deadly attack by Israeli settlers on a village in the occupied West Bank as horrific the settlers set cars and houses a blaze as they descended on the village of jit armed with batons rocks and Molotov cocktails at least one Palestinian was killed and others seriously injured thousands gathered in jit for the funeral of the man killed in the settler attack David Lamy condemned the violence as abhorent the scenes overnight of the burning and the torching of buildings of the the molotov cocktails thrown at cars of the widespread Rampage and chasing of people from their homes is a Bor and I condemn it in the strongest of terms the UN has recorded hundreds of settler attacks since the Hamas assault on Israel last October BBC verifies Merlin Thomas has been looking at video posted on social media of this latest latest incident this was a scene in the village of zet in the occupied West Bank after a group of Israeli settlers reportedly attacked various properties and vehicles the Palestinian Health Ministry has said that at least one person has been killed we've been investigating online footage of the attack and its aftermath to try to piece together what happened the village is located here just west of Nablus in the West Bank and CCTV has emerged online showing a group of individuals setting a car on fire outside a house and the Tim stamp on this footage shows 1949 which appears to be consistent with what eyewitnesses told the BBC of the attack taking place just after Sunset which is around 1920 note also these distinctive arches here which we use to verify other footage like this clip here we see those same arches and the arrangement of the nearby buildings and roads confirm the location of this house to be on the southern edge of the village now on this CCTV footage take note of the pillar here and the empty baby walker cuz this V video shows two men setting fire to another building in the village we've confirmed this by matching those details that I just pointed out to you with verified image of the aftermath note again the baby walker here and the pillar there prime minister netanyahu's office has condemned the attack and said that those responsible for any criminal act will be caught and prosecuted let's speak now to our correspondent Jenny Hill who's in Tel Aviv and Jenny there have been quite a few developments in the last few hours if you could talk us through them uh most of all in the last few minutes we've just had a a statement from President Biden saying that the Gaza Tru deel is closer than we have ever been but it's not there yet yeah I think there are two key takeaways here first of all reaching that deal is going to take more time you know these negotiations were dubbed the last ditch Summit now mediators are saying they're going to have to get their technical teams to keep working before officials resume their talks in Cairo by the end of next week secondly the US and the other mediators Qatar and Egypt are determined to get this deal past the post and that I think is why we're seeing the US Secretary of State blink due to visit the region in the coming days due to hold talks with Benjamin nanyu the Israeli Prime Minister uh on Monday we've heard from Hamas too um first of all the statement that was released by negotiators today said that a proposal had been put forward which um built on recent points of agreement and bridged remaining gaps well Hamas a senior Hamas leader has told the BBC that this does not include a commitment to Implement what was agreed upon early in July now Hamas had not participated in this round of talks because they protested um against what they said was Israel's imposition of new conditions on existing proposals they said they were not prepared to enter new negotiations so everything hangs essentially in the air right now but the negotiators who met in Doha know that time is not on their side first of all there's the human cost of this war just yesterday the Hamas ran Health Ministry in Gaza said that the number of dead was now past 40,000 since the war broke out in October and those negotiators know that achieving a ceasefire and hostage return deal is crucial if they're to stop the conflict in Gaza from spilling over into a wider allout Regional War they're also painfully conscious that Iran and its proxies including Hezbollah have threatened to attack Israel is in retaliation for the recent assassination of hamas's political leader in tan um Ismael hania it's hoped that while a ceasefire and hostage deal remains a prospect that attack could be mitigated limited Iran might be persuaded not to carry it out at all okay thanks very much for now that's Jenny Hill for us there in Tel Aviv let's speak now to Laura Blumenfeld a Middle East analyst and former senior policy adviser on the state Department's Israel Palestinian negotiating team thanks very much to you uh for joining us and just seeing some of the the quotes that are coming through just in the last few minutes just shows how complicated this is we've got President Biden saying we're not there yet but we are closer than we ever been and I've Just Seen A uh Reuters report saying quoting a Hamas official a senior Hamas official speaking to Reuters saying quoter saying the US Administration is trying to create a false atmosphere what is your an analysis of of where these talks are at at the moment uh well if you're asking me for a headline I would say the question is is the US Qatari Egyptian bridging proposal a bridge too far and you're right to be concerned because as I learned working at the state department under President Obama on the Israeli Palestinian negotiating team um the devil is in the details um so we can that we can breathe easy over the weekend I you know I hope fingers crossed that there'll be no retaliatory strike but we are going to be on edge at least until next week when those those lower level teams are hammering out the details um the principal negotiators are going to reconvene next week and that's when we'll really have an answer and do you have an understanding of what those gaps were that they they say this new statement closes those remaining gaps do you know what they were well look there's a lot of secrecy surrounding it um some of them are are kind of obvious which is whether Hamas can rearm um the Israelis are saying they need to control the Philadelphia quar which is the southern border of Gaza along the lines with Egypt so that they don't have to fight this fight again in a year in three years in four years they want it to be kind of one and done um you know Hamas is asking for a permanent ceasefire Israel is interested more in a pause I say it's all language because you know they're at permanent War these two parties and so a real ceasefire is not even realistic a permanent peace well and there's a conflict at the top of the Israeli government isn't there in in terms of you have these disagreements within the team at the top we've got we've had yav Galant the defense minister saying certain things about criticizing this this aim of total Victory as being nonsense and then Benjamin Netanyahu saying that that is what he's after you know total Victory um it's so complicated isn't in terms of of of that side of things the political situation at the top in Israel well nothing quite focuses the mind like a gun at your your head and a gun is at netanyahu's head right now the only way that Iran and Hezbollah can save face right the Western Nations have said to them Stand Down in terms of retaliation for those twin assassinations the only way though that they can save face is is if they can say they forced netanyahu's hand and there's now a ceasefire I have confidence I guess what gives me hope is actually the people of the region Israel as you all know is a rockus democracy it's you know from the right to the left they don't hold out their opinions they were standing there with megaphones as the party uh negotiating team departed for Doha saying don't come home unless you bring the hostages the same can be said of the Lebanese people they can still taste the dust from the rubble of 2006 when Israel went to war with Hezbollah they don't want to see their economy and their infrastructure decimated and in Iran they just elected what they considered to be a moderate president who was interested in in improving relations with the West so they're listening to their people across the region we'll get that ceasefire what do you think though that Benjamin Netanyahu is going to accept uh this this deal I mean do you think that that that influence will work well watch the meeting on Monday with secretary blinkin um you know our defense secretary uh Austin has been in close contact with Galant we know that that's a very smooth working relationship it's been harder for secretary blinkin he's got to navigate the internal politics let's see the looks on their faces when they come out of the meeting on Monday and don't forget that the Democrat National Convention is also starting on Monday there's a lot of pressure on this Administration and to bring it to a peaceful conclusion part of it is you know electoral politics it's an ugly kind of optics for there to be people demonstrating outside of their own convention from their own actual supporters yeah okay thank you so much for talking to us I really appreciate your time that's Laura blo and felt them and least analy thank you
