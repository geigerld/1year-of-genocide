the World Health Organization says Gaza is in an imminent Public Health catastrophe well let's get more now on the situation on the ground in Gaza we've been speaking to our correspondent rushi Abu Alou last night there was like a little Bose of air strikes here in kenun but this morning about four air strikes in different area resumed and we have to remember that this area is considered safe area but Israel keep targeting places here in the South where about 2third of the population now moved from the north into the into the South but the main focus of the Israeli operation is in Gaza City and last night it was intensified in the northwest of Gaza Strip it's a place called Bia it's near the coastal and near the Israeli Border in the north there was very heavy fighting in the area very few people who are still having are able to communicate we're talking to local radios we managed to talk to someone in jabalia Camp close to the to the area and he he was talking about how serious the air strikes there and how massive the explosions in the area they said the dust and the smoke were making a real issue for the civilians who are still living in the area we are talking about 700,000 people are still in the operation area in the place where Israel has been bombing day and night in in in that also in Gaza City and there was also another a couple of strikes around the alotz hospital it's the hospital that Israel keep insisting and calling the director to leave he said it's impossible because about 14,000 people are taking the hospital as shelter and about 100 patient are being treated eight eight or 10 of them were connected to the life saving machines we are getting report today about another 30 trucks are heading back to H Gaza from the Egyptian side they said the process is very slow the UN the largest U Aid agency is also struggling to find trucks and fuel to move the ER food and medicine that Egypt has been sending into Gaza a large amount of Aid are on the ground between the two Crossings and the they they said the the the the operation is very slow and it needs to be more sufficient to allow more more uh trucks into Gaza what we have so far is 150 trucks in the last 10 days and what we need according to the UN is 100 truck a minimum of 100 truck every day uh that is rushi AB ALU our correspondent who uh is as always reporting for us from inside Gaza one of the few correspondents in international media who is able to report from inside Gaza well the US says it's optimistic the number of a trucks entering Gaza will soon increase to around 100 a day they're likely to come through the Rafa border crossing with Egypt uh you can see it there at the bottom of that map well Rafa is uh as as I said a second ago on the far left of this map of Gaza uh well let's cross live now to Cairo in Egypt where AID organizations are poised to help uh there we can talk uh to one of them Global empowerment Mission who've been delivering Aid uh to the area Michael Capone the founder joins me now Michael it's good to talk to you thanks for joining us here on the BBC just tell me exactly uh what is there and what part it has to play in the a to Gaza yeah so we've been responding to both sides of this absolute catastrophy and uh right now what we're doing is setting up long-term infrastructure uh on the road from Cairo to El Rafa and we set up uh warehouses and we are amassing food from all our partners and supplies medical supplies all throughout the world and then what's going to happen is as you said earlier it looks like there'll be a much uh better Flow by next week it's absolutely needed that there's minimum 100 trucks that could go in you know per day with the situation so what we're doing here is just amassing everything preparing everything sorting packing and then our Logistics team along with you know the help of all the different clusters that we're involved with with the UN is involved all the different agencies um we have Partners on the ground inside uh Gaza that have been working there for over a decade they're incredible aner and the mechanism is to get it directly into their hands without it you know having any issues right so show me show me a little bit of what's behind you show me a little bit of what's in that warehouse Michael yeah so right now there's just uh you can see there's just four trucks that have arrived so far this is you know this is all brand new operation uh by next week there'll be racks up here this Warehouse will be filled and uh you know we we respond in Ukraine we send about 300 full-size semi trucks to the front lines of Ukraine every single month with Howard G Buffett so you know we're very experienced in this and in Frontline work and you just have to build up the systems to be able to do this this is a really long-term thing this is even if the war was completely over tomorrow the collateral damage that's done right now is going to be years and years of recovery Michael tell me a little bit about how you make sure that the that I see there gets into uh the people's hands the people who need it the most yeah so you know right now there's been a lot of great forward Communications between all three governments and I think there's going to be a a much more secure green Corridor by next week that's going to be able to protect the aid um so far our partners have been Distributing small amounts of Aid uh that they've been purchasing with funds from gem local loc Al believe it or not there's still Farms that are producing food out there and that's what's been happening and they haven't had any issues so far but you know this is every single International Aid organization that we are in Communications with has never seen something like this I mean that you have agencies that have lost 80 employees already in just two weeks Michael it's so good to talk to you thank you very much indeed uh for not only the work you do but also taking the time out of what I know is a busy schedule to speak to us today on the BBC thanks again well of course uh that is not the only Aid agency working uh towards helping Palestinians in Gaza Let's cross live now and speak to Julie Megan country manager at Christian Aid Julie good to talk to you thanks for joining us and what is Christine a doing uh right now uh to help with what's happening well the very first thing that we're calling for is an immediate and permanent ceasefire not a pause but a permanent ceasefire because that is the only way to ensure safe and effective humanitarian delivery across the Gaza Strip we work through local partner organizations so we're not waiting for trucks to get in we've been able to send um grants to Partners to be able to respond where they are and those responses are working communities are themselves able to support themselves where possible now that obviously relies on local markets functioning and unfortunately we are hearing more and more that supplies are dwindling so even if we can transfer grants people cannot um get the supplies that they need some of the things that we've been doing are supporting medical relief Outreach so um one of our organization one of our partner organizations has been going to some of the most affected areas um oftentimes without fuel for their vehicles they will use uh bicycles to get there and provide first aid and and dressings um for the injured um we're also working with with um on shelter and providing sa well spaces for people to come together um in the South but of course um you know without a full and permanent ceasefire there will be no proper humanitarian response there and it is important as well to say at this point that the population of Gaza are overwhelmingly civilian they're being punished for war crimes of their defacto Authority who they voted in in 2006 and who have they have not been allowed to have another election since so the humanitarian need is absolutely colossal and we are doing everything we can to work with local Partners on the ground but the reality is that people are hungry they are thirsty they are afraid that they may starve they do not have fuel and they do not have medical relief we've heard harrowing reports of people being treated children and adults being treated without anesthetic people in hospitals not able to clean bloody sheets five children to a bed you know this we cannot overstate the humanitarian catastrophe that we're seeing here and so there has to be an immediate ceasefire for humanitarian access to flow Julie let me ask you a little bit about fuel because we know it's difficult to get fuel into Gaza we know that fuel is key not only for driving people around but you know much more importantly for things like Hospital uh you know equipment generators and a vital equipment to desalinate uh seawater uh what part have Christine a played in this or what more can you tell us via your local Consultants about Fuel and how it's going to get into the into Gaza and how important it is not one drop of fuel has entered Gaza since the start of this and as you say you cannot separate fuel from food from water and from medical relief so we uh you know partners are running out of fuel we've had some amazing stories of real Ingenuity and this is where our community-based model really works because communities themselves have been able to somehow manage to get generators to work using gas canisters for example but of course these do not last but really communities are finding whatever they possibly can to try and get um the power that they need some you know of the centers that we've been funding have solar panels and so they've been able to circumvent the fuel prices that way okay but also but they don't have electricity um and they don't have power I'm so sorry Julie we have run out of time but it's been really important to get Christie a onto the show I appreciate your time thank you once again thank you
