to the Middle East now and let's go to Gaza where four schools have been hit by Israeli air strikes over the past four days killing scores of Palestinians many children the latest happened in southern Gaza where doctors at the al- nassa hospital in hunis say at least 29 people were killed and dozens more were wounded in an Israeli air strike on a camp for displaced people which hit tents outside a school the Medics said many of the Wounded were in a critical condition videos online show more than a dozen dead and seriously injured people including children on the floor of a hospital Israel says it's looking into the reports the strike on hunis in the South comes as the Israelis have launched intensive attacks in Gaza City in central Gaza on the ground and from the air many Palestinians have been killed in separate strikes on two un run schools and one Church run School in the nerat refugee camp meanwhile talks on the Gaza conflict are due to resume in Kata Washington says there's hope for a deal on a truce and hostage release well let's go live to Nick beak who's our correspondent in Jerusalem Nick I wondered if we could start with the latest on what you're hearing about that incident in hard Unis yeah well eyewitnesses have been talking to the BBC Nikki and they've been describing this horrific scene yesterday this was a site in the south of the Gaza Strip near near the the city of hanun and it was somewhere where a lot of displaced Palestinian families had been seeking shelter and safety there was apparently food and water there some of the children were able to have lessons but this missile struck yesterday uh without any warning and eyewitnesses have described a graphic horrific aftermath including women and children having been killed some medical officials are saying that at least 29 people were killed as for the Israeli response to this they say they're looking into claims that Ians were killed the Israelis are saying though that they yes they carried out this attack but they were targeting an individual who they said was a Hamas operative who they say was involved in the October the 7th attacks and that was the justification for striking there as you were saying this is the fourth attack on a school that was being used to shelter people in the past four days and in the first three cases the Israeli authorities said that they were targeting Hamas politicians or Hamas police officers or Hamas fighters in these locations so that's why they were they were aiming for them the Israeli attacks also happening around Gaza City yeah that's right and we've seen quite an an increase in activity around that place of course thousands of people Palestinians having to move because of the fighting ranging raging there Hamas said that they've been engaging with Israeli Fighters uh Israeli troops claiming to have killed some of them at the same time the Hamas leadership is saying that the ongoing Israeli operations are putting in danger and threatening the peace talks that you mentioned that are once again taking place in Qatar today and there is some optimism that sort of built up over the past 10 days or so that the two sides may be reaching an agreement but obviously what happened yesterday doesn't help at all and you've got the Prime Minister here Benjamin Netanyahu found to keep up the fighting to destroy Hamas even though opposition figures and also we're seeing some senior members of the military here apparently believing that the idea of completely destroying Hamas just isn't possible to do and Nick on these um ceasefire talks you talk about optimism some of this seems to be around that demand that uh Reports say Hamas have dropped about uh there being the permanent ceasefire yeah this is absolutely the Crux of it so what they're looking at at the moment what they're discussing is a proposal that was put forward by President Biden back in May and it would involve initially a six- week truce a pausing the fighting during which time more hostages taken by Hamas on October the 7th could be released and returned to their families it seems in the past week that Hamas has dropped this key demand and they were saying that if there is going to be this process right at the the start the Israelis have to say this will be an absolute complete ceasefire and that the troops will go the tanks will go and there won't be a resumption of Israeli operations now if that is the case if Hamas has uh said that's something they'll accept then potentially that does mean that they are moving in the same direction but as we've been hearing publicly the proclamations from both sides suggest there is Big tensions I think interesting to listen to the White House they've been saying that despite all that's being banded about behind closed doors and remember this is a a private negotiation the two sides are moving closer together they're not hugely optimistic though the White House they're not talking about any sort of imminent breakthrough and if there is to be one there certainly aren't any signs of that coming at the moment Nikki Nick big thank you very much latest there from Jerusalem
