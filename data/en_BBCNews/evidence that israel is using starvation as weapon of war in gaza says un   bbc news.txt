there is a plausible case that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of War that's according to the United Nations most senior human rights official fulka Turk he says if proven that would amount to a war crime humanitarian agencies are calling for an immediate ceasefire and large deliveries of Aid in Gaza where a famine is looming Israel insists it's letting in all the humanitarian Aid that is needed from Jerusalem here our International editor Jeremy bone and his report contains upsetting images Gaza is no place to be ill nura Muhammad had lung and liver problems before the war now after months of starvation and without the Right medical care she is deteriorating fast and I'm my daughter can't move says her mother she's anemic always sleeping and there's nothing nutritious to eat there is plenty to eat only a few miles away in the lorries that are backed up on the egyp eyptian side of the border and much more that could come from Israel if the Israelis let it into Gaza from Geneva vulat Turk the un's most senior human rights official told me there is plausible evidence that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war look when it comes to humanitarian assistance let's be clear Israel is an occupying power and has an obligation to provide humanitarian assistance and if that humanitarian assistance does not come in in the scale speed and predictability that is required yes very serious questions are raised so let's get it very clear Israel is to blame Israel is to blame in significant in a significant way yes you're aware of course that Israel says they're not to blame at all that they give as much Aid as is possible that if anyone's to blame it's the UN and it's particular L Hamas it is absolutely clear what happened on the 7th and the 8th of October by Hamas and some of the other armed groups is unconscionable these are flagrant violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights at the same time the brutality of the attack by Israel and the method of warfare it begs the question of the proportionality of the response you you're saying questions you say there's no doubt about Hamas are there any doubts about Israel you always have to prove the intent but as I said Collective punishment the collective punishment that was declared with the siege is indeed amounts to a war crime and it needs to be dealt as such on social media false claims circulate that famine in Gaza is a Lie the Hebrew caption says there's more shawarma in Gaza than in Israeli Hyer and Israel's government dismisses the un's accusations total nonsense total irresp responsible uh thing to say Israel is accepting all the aid that the US and the world is giving to gazan innocent people which a lot of it goes to extend the war how many innocent people are in Gaza in your opinion that's not I'm not going to quote any number I I'm basically saying that over 70% of gazans support October 7 Massacre so they're not innocent people that are supporting uh Hamas uh they have a different thought they're an enemy I thank our friends around the world for supporting our strategic goal and I'm I'm I'm telling you but they don't like the way you're doing it do they that's tough we're going to finish the war we'll do everything we can to kill the Kamas terrorists and to minimize collateral damage as much as we can the evidence of gaza's humanitarian catastrophe is overwhelming and it is deepening International pressure on Israel swollen joints wasted Limbs and dermatitis are classic symptoms of acute malnutrition these children reached Hospital most of just over 1 million gazans considered to be in acute need will not have that option Jeremy bow BBC News Jerusalem
