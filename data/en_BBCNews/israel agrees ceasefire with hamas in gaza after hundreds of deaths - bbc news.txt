israel and the palestinian militant group hamas have agreed to a truce it's due to come into effect in less than two hours time bringing an end to 11 days of intense bombardment our middle east editor jeremy bowen is in jerusalem and what chance does it have of holding jeremy i think when it comes in i think a reasonable chance for at least a while there are just under two hours to go the horrible tradition in these things is that sometimes both sides like to show they can fire the last shot and then there is an intense period the last hour or so i hope that doesn't happen it might both sides have also been crafting what's referred to here sometimes as victory narratives uh hamas have said that they have forced israel to take its hand as they put it off the al-aqsa mosque here in jerusalem and also the the district of shaitura which became a big flash point in the run-up to all of this the israelis say that they have scored some unprecedented military victories now this is the fourth big war between israel and hamas since the first one back in the end of 2008 and after each of those encounters and all the smaller ones in between similar things have been said by both sides in claiming victory and then essentially the seeds of the next conflict are sown and i can tell you one thing for certain that if the status quo does not change favorably there will be another round of this our middle east editor jeremy bowen in jerusalem thank you
