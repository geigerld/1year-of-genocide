welcome back to BBC News well in the last few minutes the un's top Court the international court of justice has delivered an advisory opinion outlining that Israel's settlement of Palestinian territories are in breach of international law now it had been examining the issue since the beginning of last year uh I think we can take a quick listen now to that opinion being given live the court considers it important to stress as it did in its wall advisor opinion I quote the Urgent necessity for the United Nations as a whole to redouble its efforts to bring the Israeli Palestinian conflict which continues court giving its opinion live there in the heg I want to leave that momentarily and just bring in our security correspondent Frank Gardner uh into this and Frank just explain to viewers at home what exactly the court has been looking into CU important to underline that this has been going on since before the October 7th uh attacks by ham and the start of the Gaza War that's right so this this this is the international court of justice not the international criminal court it's issuing a um an advisory it's not legally binding but it will be seen as a basis for international law and it's looking at it's examining the legality of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territor since 1967 particularly focusing on the West Bank and East Jerusalem and settlements therein and it's a pretty damning verdict on Israel's actions and policies there I'm just going to because this is incredibly legales and as you can imagine there was a big Preamble as to what the framework of their observ their work has been this is delivered by the spokesperson for 15 judges they've been examining this since 2022 they took evidence throughout February from around 50 countries and their conclusions in brief are that Israel's policies and practices are in breach of international law the continued presence of Israel in the occupied territories is illegal and they call on Israel to cease all new settlement activity it particularly focuses on the settlements and the treatment of Palestinians in those territories now Israel I think will um they're unlikely to accept this in the past that they have not accepted the legality of uh rulings when it comes to their occupation and Palestinian territories but I think it's it's a pretty hostile verdict for Israel this okay Frank well we have to leave it there I'm afraid but Frank Gardner thanks for that uh giving that context on that icj ruling thank you now a Russian court has
