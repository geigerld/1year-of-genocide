the United States has been avoiding using the word ceasefire during un votes on the war between Israel and Hamas but they're using tougher language now the US has proposed a draft resolution at the UN Security Council calling for a temporary ceasefire as soon as feasible now the United States resolution also opposes Israel's plans to attack the overcrowded city of Rafa it says the assault would harm civilians and push them into neighboring countries it's not clear when or or if the text will be put to a vote but either way it still intends to veto another measure calling for an immediate pause to the fighting well let's get more from our correspondent Jenny Hill who is in Jerusalem for us Jenny what more do we know about this us resolution well we know that it warns against as you say that planned ground offensive in the southern city of Rafa saying that such a move on the part of Israel could threaten the peace and security of the region um the US is Israel's closest Ally but we have seen in recent days and weeks a real shift in tone and language and it looks as though the Biden Administration is starting to run out of patience as Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli Prime Minister continues to defiantly um oppose ignore international calls for restraint in his military operation in Gaza launched of course in uh response to those October 7th attacks now look he's insisted that he has to go into Rafa where he says there are still battalions of Hamas Fighters just yesterday the Israeli government said that if Hamas doesn't return all Israeli hostages within the next 3 weeks it will go ahead with that offensive and that seems to have really prompted a bit of a flurry of international efforts to try to get Israel to rethink its strategy try to calm this situation down just yesterday um all but one of the eu's member states issued a formal statement um calling for an immediate humanitarian pors in fighting and we learned this morning that reportedly the US's Top Middle East advisor is due to travel to the region to hold talks in both Egypt and Israel in the meantime of course there are more than a million displaced Palestinian civilians in G in Rafa City living in tented accommodation in conditions which are described as really very unpleasant indeed and all they can do is watch and wait to see what kind of deal the International Community might be able to thres out with Israel and Jenny that's pressure from a staunch Ally Mr Nan who's also facing pressure at home isn't he when it comes to the economy and and calls for an early election yeah I mean Mr Netanyahu has got by if you like um for a very long time um on a reputation as the defender of Israel's security Mr security that reputation has crumbled um he is in a coalition government he's held up in effect by some Coalition Partners who are very Hardline very right-wing they don't want to see any kind of peace deal really in fact if anything they'd like to see all Palestinians moved out of of this country um so he himself is in a pretty precarious position politically and that is why I think it's one of the reasons certainly that we see him taking such a defiant stance you know just yesterday here in Jerusalem there were protests women protesting about the Israeli government's approach to trying to get its hostages home so yeah he he faces an uneasy situation here but it's the international pressure now which I think will claim his attention all right Jenny thank you so much for that well speaking of international pressure meanwhile at the international court of justice it's on its second day of public hearings to decide the legality of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories now South Africa and Saudi Arabia are among the countries to address it yesterday the un's top Court heard from the Palestinian delegation Israel has declined to take part so let's speak to our correspondent Anna hollan who is at the ha for us Anna thank you for your time what did we hear from the Palestinian foreign minister uh well there were some emotional testimonies yesterday we heard from uh the Palestinian authorities representative to the UN his voice was breaking as he asked the judges here what does international justice mean to the children of Gaza today it hasn't Protected Their Lives or limbs their hopes or homes we also heard from the uh International lawyer Philip Sans who said the Great Hall inside the peace Palace home to the international court of justice was not Starry Eyed about the potential for international Justice and yet he said this is all we have and he told me after the hearing that he believed Leeves an advisory opinion from this court the un's highest court could help to set the parameters for a negotiated settlement in the future and Anna given that Israel has rejected the Court's Jurisdiction on the matter what can the Palestinians truly hope for here you're absolutely right um Israel has rejected this Court's Jurisdiction over its occupation of the West Bank and yet it has submitted a five-page document in which it says it believes this case is harmful to efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution uh because the question posed by the UN gen general assembly is actually Prejudice however over the next 5 days six days in total a record 51 countries taking part we'll start to get some insight into how different countries positions may be shifting in line with or in response to what's happening in aaza in Rafa today and then it will probably take about 6 months for this court to issue its advisory opinion these advisory opinions are not legally binding but they do carry a huge amount of political weight so could indeed have some influence over the future trajectory of this conflict
