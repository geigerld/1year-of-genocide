now the US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has called for new elections in Israel saying the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a major obstacle to peace and risked making Israel a pariah Senator Schumer said it was a grave mistake for Israel to reject a two-state solution the fourth major obstacle to peace is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who has all too frequently bowed to the demands of extremists like minister smotri and Ben gavier and the settlers in the West Bank now this comes after the Israeli military said it plans to move nearly 1 and a half million displaced Palestinians in Rafa to what it described as humanitarian islands in the middle of the Gaza Strip Aid agencies have insisted that safely moving such a large number of people in a war zone would be almost impossible and an assault on Rafa could prove disastrous Merlin Tomas from verifi has been looking at where Israel might try to move the people from Rafa the Israeli Army has said it plans to move Palestinians out of the city of Rafa in southern Gaza to what it describes as humanitarian Islands it comes ahead of a planned military offensive in Rafa and Rafa is at the southern border with Egypt over a million displaced Palestinians are currently Sheltering there after being forced to leave their homes because of the Israeli offensive elsewhere and this is a image from before in December look at this road and this area and this is one from late February and you can see just how many people are there tents are everywhere even on roads so where will people go from Rafa we don't know the Israeli statement doesn't specify exactly where but there are already questions of where in the rest of Gaza has the infrastructure and buildings still intact to shelter people coming from Rafa take a look at this map this is the Gaza Strip and this is a map of all of the areas that have been damaged that's the red patches that you can see those are areas that have been damaged or destroyed since the beginning of the war after all the people who came to Rafa came because they were seeing much more intense bombing in the rest of Gaza uh one of the most heavily affected areas is carun it's a city in southern Gaza some 7 kmers North of Rafa this is a satellite image from December and this is from February and you can see how some of those neighborhoods have been completely flattened there and again is in central Gaza again this is from October and this is from March and you can see just how extensive that damage is and getting anywhere in Gaza is a huge challenge there's only one main road from the south to the north that's fully operational right now and that's being used to transport Aid it's the coastal Road here this orange one called alash road so in order to move over a million people out of Rafa safe routes will likely have to be created Israeli military spokesperson Daniel hagari has said this planned evacuation of Palestinians to so-called humanitarian Islands would be carried out in coordination with International actors but last night US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has said he's not seen any details of an evacuation plan and any evacuation of over a million people will take time but the plans for how exactly that will happen is unclear that was Merlin Thomas from uh BBC verify and just uh backing up what she's saying we just had a statement from the white house uh saying that they cannot confirm whether Israel has plans to relocate people out of Rafa uh let's speak to Al benari senior fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for strategy and security hello to you thank you for joining us here on BBC News um so plans although this has been announced this plan for humanitarian Islands moving what more than a million people potentially from uh from Rafa how logistically uh could that happen in effectively a war zone first of all good afternoon and good evening um I would say it's a huge logistical undertaking we are talking about at least two major areas one would be pushing the uh the civilians in the Raa area towards the uh the coast and up north a bit to the north towards the southern part of central Gaza which is still an open area that's one possibility for major effort the other is that we've been having consistent um I would say reporting about Egypt creating a humanitarian area just on the border of Rafa in the Egyptian area so this would be these would be two major areas now having said that one must realize that the very acts of establishing an infrastructure which includes tents uh sewage running water some kind of public facilities for healthare for government and so on is something that will take months to carry out well that's interest that's interesting that you bring up the the matter of timing because as you say with that amount of people and those amount of logistics that will take time that's right and and obviously certainly in the Gaza area the idea of the one to be there and control all the U establishment of the infrastructure now if I may another little comment this is as you said before there are no actual plans that have been uh published or disseminated to the general public but it does fit what have been we we in Israel have been told by the IDF that the whole campaign will take months to take to complete people are talking about 2025 perhaps 2026 so this effort it will take a long while but it does fit with the overall idea of the IDF campaign in G and what do you make to the statement by the White House that we just uh talked about there with the fact that they are saying they have no idea of the plans that they are not aware of these plans um it does rather seem that there has been in more pressure from uh the the White House Administration to try and find out what is going on what Israel's plans are but clearly um Israel not sharing them at at this uh stage I I agree completely with the idea that uh uh B Benjamin Netanyahu is completely beholden because of the structure of his coalition to the radicals smotri and uh Ben and and others and so on and and uh knowing BB at least according to his track record he's holding all the cards very close to his heart and in a sense based again on uh presidents uh he will perhaps wait for even greater American pressure being put on Israel and coming out with certain plans we've seen this time and again during this campaign where the US would say uh more human Arian Aid R netan prevaricates and finally if you like capitulates and so on the very fact uh one must understand that the Israel the idef is quite a porous institution in Israel and so we are getting various media reports about this possibility of these humanitarian Islands any concrete plans I don't have any idea myself um one of one of the objectives clearly of the IDF or the main objectives is to uh get rid of any Hamas operatives I just wonder when you potentially are moving more than a million people from one area to another how do you separate how do you identify those Hamas operatives um how would they go about doing that logistically this would be uh this was this this is one of the things that may take time so if the IDF creates various kinds of check points roadblocks and so on they will have to check each and every individual now the big there are two big worries from the point of view of the IDM with the Hamas operatives in indeed seeping into these humanitarian Islands that's one that is uh Hamas operatives on the other hand the IDF is very worried that the Hamas May potentially start to control these uh humanitarian Islands instead for example dominating or controlling uh all the access to uh to food medicine and so on just just as it is has done and is doing in Gaza one more point which may interest uh International audience is that we're hearing I would say the last month or so various suggestions about creating a governmental or a military government the same kind of government through which Israel uh occupied and controlled the West Bank and Gaza before the withdrawal 2005 and before the Oslo Accords that is in every one of these humanitarian islands and perhaps in other parts of Gaza you would have a military governor and an apparatus under him we'll have to leave it there it's really good to talk to you really appreciate your time thank you thank you very much
