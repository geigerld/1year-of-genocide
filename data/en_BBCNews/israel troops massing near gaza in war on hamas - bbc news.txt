well let's go straight now to the southern Israeli city of ashalon and our chief International correspondent leis duet um leas hello to you um can we first of all just focus on the Diplomatic efforts uh we awaiting a statement from Anthony blinkin the US Secretary of State he's visited what six Arab states over the last four days spoken to six different leaders how would you summarize the US approach to what's happening where you are Israel is I think it it's clear that Israel and the United States are almost in lock step now at least at this moment the United States is doing everything it can both to show Israel that it will stand by it stand by its right to defend itself but also to send a very clear me message as it staunches of allies that Israel also has to do everything it can to try to minimize civilian harm Anthony blinkin came to Israel some days ago he did his tour of the region speaking to every Arab leader who could have some sway over one side or the other one part or the other in this in this conflation he's come back to Israel and we've just heard that instead of going back to the United States tonight has planned he's going to go back to the Jordanian Capital Aman so whenever a top Diplomat like Anthony blinkin changes his travel schedule it is perhaps a sign that there is they're working on something and we know that they are focusing on two fronts one is that they want to get that rough acrossing the only way in and out of Gaza on on gaza's Southern border to get the foreign Nationals out about a thousand of them to get that desperately needed Aid food fuel medicine the lores are piling up at the Rafa Crossing in Egypt Sinai Peninsula secondly they want to do everything possible to ensure that this crisis does not spread as bad as it it is in Israel and Gaza if it spreads even further if it spills across the border then it is an even more dangerous territory tell us you're in uh ashalon the military buildup presumably there continues um to the the ground offensive have you got any sense of you know just tell us what you're seeing what you're hearing where you are well this is day 10 of of this war 10 days since the massacres committed by Hamas in southern in southern Israel we've seen with every day the Israeli forces uh racing down to the border the artillery the armor they're now in a Zone a closed military zone that were not allow to enter but throughout today we moved around southern Israel including to stat Which is less than a mile from the Gaza border there was the constant sound of our Israeli artillery firing into Gaza and at every place place that we went the Israeli military moved us away that it was too dangerous that we could be in the line of fire in the last position they said there could be an errant missile fired by the tanks which are firing into Gaza you get a sense that that that the military operations are gathering pace and of course the non-stop bombardment of Gaza it seems as though Israel wants to well there was hope there could be a ceasefire in southern Gaza that hasn't been reached but that is Focus now so that there can be more humanitarian and a rescue of some of the people um in Gaza I have to say it's been relatively quiet there was two days ago there were the air raid sirens went off almost every hour here in ashalon it's been relatively quiet today although there have been missiles fired in other parts of Southern Israel and in in Border towns like satat an official evacuation is taking place to move even more people to safety away from that border okay Le duet uh thank you that's leet our chief International correspondent there in the southern Israeli city of ashalon
