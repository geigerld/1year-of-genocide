speaking to many inhabitants of Gaza yesterday and today I have heard the same messages time and time again if we are not safe in an unra school we are not safe anywhere in Gaza they say and they add the world has failed us has failed to protect protection of civilians is an expression we do not want to hear anymore many commented I also call on all parties to respect the sanctity of un premises and to exercise the highest precaution in the conduct of military operations that affect civilians in this region that the attack on the shelter in jabalia came only six days after a strike on a designated unra emergency shelter in banun caused multiple injuries and fatalities to internally displaced people taking Refuge there and making the call all the more in Urgent there is another challenge in our operational field to which I want to draw attention on three occasions we have found in empty unra facilities Rockets belonging to Armed groups in Gaza we immediately alerted all relevant parties to their existence and we strongly condemned placement of weapons in our schools unra is now working with un Partners to improve procedures to address such violations in a manner that does not compromise the safety of Staff or civilians including unra beneficiaries it should also be said that these discoveries do not in any way justify attacks on unra facilities and in particular ones Sheltering idps unra takes robust measures to closely monitor all its facilities to which it has access in an effort to prevent misuse by combatant and other parties dear members of the council allow me to turn to the most difficult challenge facing unra in Gaza today we are currently hosting over 220,000 internally displaced people a number which has grown every day of the conflict and at an accelerated Pace in the last week this is four times higher than the peak number of displaced people during the conflict in 2008 and 2009 I am not here referring to the tens of thousands of displaced in Gaza that have found temporary shelter with most families only to those that are registered in unra schools we are doing everything possible to provide the displ with minimum needs food mattresses and blankets but we are now into the fourth week of mass displacement in facilities unequipped to shelter large numbers for such a duration conditions are increasingly dire in the shelters there is no water for Hygiene very few showers and latrines are totally inadequate disease outbreak is beginning with skin infections scabs and others there are thousands of pregnant women in our schools deliveries are precarious and we are shelting Sheltering newborn infants in these appalling conditions our ability to mitigate this situation is of course heavily restricted by ongoing hostilities we are gravely concerned about this situation equally we are gravely concerned about any possible additional displacement that will drive up the numbers in our shelters with as many as 2,500 displaced people residing in schools and an average of 80 people to a classroom we have exceeded the tolerable limits we can accommodate it is therefore with alarm that I have received accounts of new instructions from the Israeli military to Palestinians to evacuate the zun area of Gaza City and areas in the vicinity of Kan Yunis in view of these facts of the shelling affecting unra schools on six occasions I believe the population is facing a precipice and appeal to the International Community to take the steps necessary to address this extreme situation should further large-scale displacement indeed occur the occupying power according to International humanitarian law will have to assume direct responsibility to assist these people dear members of the council the new reality being created before our eyes in the occupied Palestinian territory in Israel is not sustainable under any circumstances the humanitarian and political costs grow by the day with each death and injury with the continuing destruction of infrastructure vital to the life of the Palestinian people in Gaza and with the continuing violations of international law as I have stated on previous visits to Gaza the rocket firing on Israeli cities and endangering Israeli civilians is unacceptable and must cease we all aspire to see a middle east in which its people share common interest a stake in each other's well-being and a commitment as the Secretary General recently said to peace Justice and security for all in the region this cannot happen under the conditions of military occupation and those caused by the pitiless conflict now unfolding it is past time for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire to be agreed by parties and called for by the council in its recent statement allow me also to add my voice to those calling for the redress of the underlying conditions that fuel this conflict and the violence that repeats itself in full view of the world in other words a ceasefire while immediately required to save lives is not enough it is not conceivable to Simply return to the situation existing before this conflict not withstanding Israel's legitimate security concerns the illegal blockade of Gaza must be lifted this small territory is home to 1.8 million people who face the prospect that it will become unlivable in a matter of only a few years unless urgent steps are taken by the International Community to enable the development of Gaza and in the ensuring security for all in the region unra truthful to its mandate will remain steadfast in its commitment and operations whether during the terrible emergency or in the recovery phase once the fighting has ceased but much more is required to ensure lasting peace and stability in the region
