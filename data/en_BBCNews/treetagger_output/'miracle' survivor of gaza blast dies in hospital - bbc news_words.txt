all
over
Gaza
evidence
of
another
round
of
heavy
[Laughter]
bombardment
two
missiles
struck
this
building
last
night
it's
not
clear
if
there
was
a
warning
11
people
were
killed
the
rescue
workers
have
been
up
there
since
early
this
morning
looking
for
bodies
and
we
can
see
one
right
next
to
them
there
a
foot
stuck
between
two
bits
of
masonry
they're
trying
to
get
the
body
up
but
as
you
can
see
it's
incredibly
precarious
Danger
work
it's
an
office
block
but
last
night
there
were
civilians
here
refugees
from
the
devastated
neighborhood
of
Shia
attacked
on
Sunday
after
more
than
two
weeks
it's
getting
harder
and
harder
to
hide
11
person
killed
without
any
just
they
they
come
here
to
be
sa
at
shifa
hospital
Hospital

her
life
among
thousands
who
failed

10
when
their
house
was
hit
on
Sunday
morning

the
only
Survivor
getting
Asma
out
of
the
wreckage
was
a
miracle
in
itself
we
were
with
the
rescue
team
on
Sunday
afternoon
when
they
spotted
a
body
buried
under
concrete

was
a
dangerous
rescue

responding
but
they
weren't
going
to
give
up

under
the
rubel

hours
12
hours
12
12
hours

survive

lucky
a
cousin

vigil
outside

one
day
to
tell
her
just
how
much
she's
lost

them
have
now
died

of
them
