let's start with the islamist militant group that carried out this attack who are Hamas well its name is an Arabic acronym for Islamic resistance movement it's sworn to Israel's destruction and its base is Gaza it's been in control there since 2007 though as it's not held an election since it's hard to gauge what support it has and this weekend President Biden called Hamas a terrorist organization in fact the EU the UK and the us all categorize it this way in the region Iran is hamas's primary backer indeed Hamas has told the BBC Iran gave direct backing for this weekend's attack Hamas also has close relations with the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon which shares a border with Israel and Israel knows all of this and more about Hamas which leads us to the next question why didn't Israeli intelligence know about the attack the analyst Colin Clark describes how Israel has worldclass Intelligence collection and Analysis capabilities that includes using informers in Gaza and surveillance drones above it in the words of one former US counterterrorism specialist it's almost inconceivable how they missed this but they did and working out why is now a matter of urgency our next question is whether this is different to previous escalations serious violent escalations between Israel and the Palestinians are not uncommon but the scale of this ham attack makes it different Israeli territory was infiltrated hundreds of Israelis have died as many as a hundred hostages were taken Saturday was one of the deadliest days in Israel's history the un's Middle East peace Envoy says this is a dangerous precipice and I appeal to all to pull back from the brink this is different and the scale of the attack leads us to how is Israel responding well already prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu talks of a long and difficult War there are Israeli air strikes in Gaza hundreds of Palestinians have died military vehicles are heading to the Gaza border and tens of thousands of Israeli reservists are being called up as well as that the US defense secretary Lloyd Austin has announced that additional equipment and resources including Munitions will be sent Israel's allies are offering solidarity and help and while right now the focus is on the immediate threat from Hamas Israel and its allies will also know that in the long term this attack will reshape how they seek to maintain Israel's security
