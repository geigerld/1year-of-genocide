now we're going to go back to the Middle East where two key right-wing members of Israel's coalition government has threatened to bring it down if the Prime Minister agrees to the latest peace deal offer the Finance Minister bzel smotri and the national security minister isir benav have said that they were opposed to striking any deal unless Hamas was wiped out and last night in Tel avive tens of thousands of people gathered to urge the prime minister to accept the ceasefire proposal which was unveiled by by the US President Joe Biden groups of protesters dispersed were dispersed by Mounted Police and by water cannon so let's discuss this proposed deal with mju zi who is joining us from Doha a professor of contemporary Middle East politics at Qatar University Professor zi what do you think hamas's leadership group in Doha in katar where you are are saying are they urging each other to accept Joe 's proposal as far as um they um announced last night they looking positively to the announcement made by President uh Biden and they are willing to uh uh talk about it and discuss it um further to see more clear plan uh and uh more details about the implementation um let me just uh uh remind the viewers that all of the proposed suggested in the last few months actually all of them sort of uh re restructure and re submit of what had happened in the Paris meeting a few months ago when the whole uh uh mediators uh basically discussing the whole crisis in Gaza so everything we see now is actually started in Paris in Paris discussion which is actually happened a few months ago so the new proposal is sort of amendment of that discussion so what what is your understanding then what what is specifically different then with this because arguably this proposal means that does Hamas in your understanding continue as is because ultimately Benjamin Netanyahu the right of his party will not accept that list um according to President Biden what he presented it was an Israeli proposal and that proposal did not mention three things one anything about the day after secondly anything about rebuilding Gaza thirdly um about uh the complete uh withdraw however if you look at the three steps announced by Biden actually there is a talk about stopping all uh um uh I would say military activities but they don't talk about complete saire so there is a there is a a playing of words can be seen all of the proposal they talk about three stages each stage 42 days and basically followed by complete ceasefire and within those there will be uh uh basically all of the uh captiv will be released there will be more Palestinian also released there will be uh uh there will be freedom to the gazan people from South to go to the north narim Israelis will withdraw from Whole Gaza um and then they talk about uh basically rebuilding in what Biden presented there is no talk about the day after and what that is what I think B now Netanyahu trying to capitalize on and trying to protect the proposal from uh uh his cabinet members okay Professor maub zier from the Kat University we're going to have to leave it there we're out of time but thank you for your analysis
