hello I'm Tanya Beckett President Biden has appealed for the more than 1 million Palestinians Sheltering in Rafa in the southern Gaza Strip to be protected once again urging Israel not to carry out a big assault without a credible plan for the safety of civilians he was speaking after meeting the Jordanian Monarch King Abdullah in Washington the King has repeatedly pushed for a full truce to end the conflict that started when Hamas attacked Israel on over October the 7th on Monday morning a series of Israeli air strikes there killed at least 70 people with Israel warning of an impending ground offensive more than half of gaza's population now live in Rafa the potential for a ground campaign has sparked alarm from Israel's allies including the United States as The King and I discussed today the United States is working on a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas which would bring a immediate and sustained period of common to Gaza for at least 6 weeks which we could then take the time to build something more enduring nearly 100,000 people have been killed injured or are missing the majority our women and children we cannot afford an Israeli attack on Rafa it is certain to produce another humanitarian catastrophe the situation is already unbearable for over a million people who have been pushed into RAF since the war started we cannot stand by and let this continue we need a lasting ceasefire now this war must end for more analysis on King abdullah's visit to Washington here's our North America correspondent namia ikbal this was a very significant meeting in that uh King Abdullah is the first Arab leader to meet President Biden since October the 7th and the King has been very open about what he thinks should be happening and he's laid those goals out to President Biden we heard it in his statement he wants an immediate long-lasting ceasefire he also wants humanitarian Aid to be sent into Gaza he's worried about the military operation in Rafa and he also wants a long-term solution a two-state solution these are all issues that President Biden has also raised um and King Abdullah is meeting President Biden where the tone has slightly changed in Washington uh last week President Biden issued a a rare rebuke of Israel in which he said the military operation Gaza had gone over the top critics have pointed out that there has been no practical change however in America's approach they they continue to give military aid to Israel uh but the king will be hoping to use his influence with America uh Jordan is incredibly important as a regional Ally to the Americans uh the king also enjoys a very close relationship with America he takes pride in his close relationship with President Biden all the presidents before him but it is a it is a very difficult tricky balancing act because in Jordan there has been much unrest amongst a lot of people uh there's been Street protests because of what's happening in Gaza many calling on uh the Jordanian uh leadership to abandon its peace treaty with Israel to abandon its defense agreements with America that's not likely to happen uh the King will want to use his influence so this meeting with President Biden has been a very important role of the dice in that sense in order to make his feelings heard to America we can now live cross live and speak to Dr Alam Salah who is senior electure in politics and international relations at Australian National University but is joining us today from leads in the north of England welcome to the program we've heard about the concerns from King Abdullah and also President Biden they are by no means alone what would be the Diplomatic consequences of an assault on Rafa well definitely would have many different consequences first of all diplomatically speaking uh it would internationalize and regionalize the conflict into uh Egypt involving Egypt that means uh learning from the past Egypt knows that uh uh hundred thousands of refugees U moving to to to to Egypt would have uh security consequences like what happened in the early 1970s when Palestinian uh refugees have caused and posed threat in for for Jordan internally that means of course many militants might move to Egypt uh with the refugees and this is something that Egypt cannot uh accept politically speaking uh it would uh stop any kind of chance for the ceasefire we know that the United States kares and and Egyptian officials are gathering today in in Cairo to to to discuss the six week ceasefire and this would be uh definitely compromise such uh attempt economically speaking uh uh this would have some economic B for for Cairo like what happened in 2011 onwards when 100 thousands of Syrian refugees moved to Lebanon and turkey uh this is also something that that Egypt is not ready to pay for um uh this is uh also U difficult for for Cairo to accept simply because they it is very it will be very uncertain whether these refugees uh will be allowed to return to to Gaza one day or if any when so this might be very prolonged uh process that might uh uh undermines uh security economy and political situation of uh um Egypt in such a war so this then puts added pressure on Egypt to add momentum to the peace process what realistically can it do what can it bring to the table well uh uh of course uh it's it's very complicated it's is a multier issue over 1.3 million Palestinians are gathering in in an area smaller than 64 kilometers Square uh uh and and this might end with a humanitarian catastrophe of course with a security catastrophe but for Tel Aviv of course uh they believe that they have started a war and if they stop it here it would be an unfinished game and therefore they cannot accept any kind of uh compromise with with this part of uh Gaza because they believe many militants Hamas militants are amongst these uh uh over 1 million people gathering in in in the southern part of Gaza Dr Alam Salah thank you very much indeed
