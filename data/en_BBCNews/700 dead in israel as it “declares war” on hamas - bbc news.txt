more than 700 Israelis are now feared dead after unprecedented attacks by Hamas militants it represents the biggest loss of life in a single day in Israeli history Hamas which is designated as a terrorist organization by many Western governments including the United Kingdom is still holding out in parts of Southern Israel where they're coming under attack by Israeli forces and Israeli war planes are now bombing the Gaza Strip where more than 400 Palestinians are said to have been killed and more than 2,000 injured and worry is also deepening over the shocking hostage taking of more than 100 Israelis who are now said to have been taken to Gaza our first report tonight is from our defense correspondent Jonathan Beal who brings us all the latest and I should warn you that in his report report there are images that you may find distressing Israeli troops are still hunting down armed Palestinians more than 30 hours after their biggest and bloodiest breakout from Gaza into Israel itself one of the world's most advanced militaries taken by surprise by Hamas a militant group kept behind barriers that were supposed to stop this happening their attack as brutal as it was Brazen hundreds killed for Israel that's included scores of unarmed civilians as well as soldiers already the largest loss of life in decades here the bodies of an Israeli family shot dead waiting to be identified and buried Hamas has taken dozens of host ages too like this 85-year-old grandmother yafa Adar whisked Away by militants in a golf card families too among them yon's wife and their five and 2-year-old daughters he's left anxiously waiting for news and pleading for their safe return I want to ask of Kamas don't hurt them don't hurt little children don't hurt women if you want me instead I'm willing to come Israel's prime minister meeting security Chiefs this morning has warned his nation of a long and difficult War ahead both sides have already suffered significant losses Hamas murdered hundreds of Israelis men women and children and took dozens host St into Gaza this horrific terror act Demands a forceful determined and sustained response Israel's response has been Swift and harsh despite the massive intelligence Failure Its missiles filmed by our BBC team in Gaza Jets have been hitting what they say a Hamas positions but many civilians have also been killed in this densely populated Palestinian enclave blockaded and nowhere else to flee tonight this is as close as we can get to Gaza itself about 5 kilm in that direction there is a lot of military activity Jets overhead Israel has told its citizens living nearby to leave it's not clear whether that could signal a land incursion by Israel into Gaza itself but inevitably this will end up being more bloody still there's also the risk of escalation Hezbollah has been firing Rockets into Israel from neighboring Lebanon they say a show of solidarity with Palestinians this region has long been a Tinder Box and once again the Flames are being fanned Jonathan Beal BBC News Southern Israel and tonight Israel search and rescue committee has confirmed that more than 250 bodies have been recovered from the
