the US Senate has approved a $95 billion Aid package for Ukraine Israel and Taiwan the overwhelming vote in favor marks the end of six months of Deadlock in Congress the measures approve around $61 billion in long- awaited aid for Ukraine alone it also designates more than 26 billion in aid for Israel and 8 billion for Taiwan and US indopacific allies on Saturday the House of Representatives ended months of stalemate to pass the aid package it's expected to be signed into law by President Biden shortly the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the United States had shown its allies that it would not turn its back on them a lot of people inside and outside the Congress wanted this package to fail but today those in Congress who stand on the side of democracy are winning the day to our friends in Ukraine to our allies in NATO to our allies in Israel and to civilians around the world in need of help help is on the way to our friends in Ukraine America will deliver more ammo and air defenses and basic supplies that you need to resist Putin on the battlefield our North America correspondent Peter Bose has more on what's been approved this was a long time incoming held up for months in large part by Republicans in the house some of whom would rather see more money spent here in the United States on immigration and on the issues affecting the southern border of the US with Mexico but there does seem to have been a change of heart amongst some Republicans notably the speaker of of the house which allowed it to pass through that stage that part of Congress at the weekend now rubber stamped you could say or at least passed in the Upper House the Senate as well just remains for it to be signed into law by President Biden we expect to see that happening in the next few hours and the president already issuing a statement indicating that that military aid that president zelinski in Ukraine has said that is so desperately needed that military aid will be on the way we're told by the end of this week air defense Weaponry in particular that is so desperately needed that's part of the $61 billion package for Ukraine then there's 26 billion for Israel also humanitarian aid for the people of G and about 8 billion for Taiwan to Stave off potential advances by China and some of the issues in the indopacific reason one of the measures in this bill perhaps most controversial for some Americans at least is the potential ban on Tik Tock and this is part of the security measure that is part of this very large bill with essentially an ultimatum to B Dan which is the company the Chinese company that that owns Tik Tok that they should divver divest and sell the platform to an American owner or face a ban in this country now nothing is really going to happen quickly it's quite likely that b dance will take this to the courts claim that this move is unconstitutional and uh also suggests that the concerns of Americans are misplaced or the concerns of Washington are misplaced and that is that the the Chinese government could invoke security measures to in some way get hold of the personal data of Americans that is part of that app B Dan likely to say that they've already taken measures to ensure that that doesn't happen Israel said the US Senate approval of $13 billion in military aid sent a strong message to its enemies well let's get to more on this with our Middle East correspondent Yan Nell so tell us more about the reaction that Israel has had to this usaid being passed well Israel's reaction is basically um of of great thanks to the US its closest Ally we've had that coming from uh the Israeli foreign minister this is a top story that this Aid package has been passed in uh most of the Israeli media this morning and if you break it down um you can see that uh really you have here5 billion dollar that goes for replenishing and expanding Israel's air defense systems that have been used so much recently uh including in uh shielding Israel from that attack um by Iran um 3 and A2 billion for purchasing Advanced Weapons Systems from the US a billion for enhancing weapons production and then on top of that 4 and a half billion almost in other supplies and services and then you have this other amount um some 9 billion which is going to humanitarian Aid in Conflict zones around the world and that does include money that will go uh for Gaza where we've had the US expressing concerns that it Still Remains close to famine particularly in the north and you land in the mean time we've also had reports of some of the heaviest shelling of Gaza in in whis that's correct and this is something that's reported up and down um the Gaza Strip um in the north also um some notable Israeli air strikes this after the Israeli military issued fresh evacuation orders to people living in parts of BET in the north now this is significant because this is an area that Israel had long ago said that it had cleared and it sort of adds to the sense uh that Hamas in particular is able to regroup is coming back and it gives us an idea of where things could go in terms of Israel's overall military um offensive in Gaza um that it will continue to have um you know Hamas coming back as a threat in areas where it it thinks um its troops have been able to withdraw we've had rocket fire Fire coming from the north of the Gaza Strip um in in a meaningful way really for the first time in many weeks in just the past few days and the Israeli military says it's hit rocket launch sites with air strikes we've seen hundreds of Palestinians already responding to recorded messages and text messages they've been sent telling them that this is now being declared a dangerous combat zone where they're living they've been heading down towards uh Gaza City uh in particular and I think this comes of course to 200 days into the war we had a message from a rare message from the head of the Hamas military Wing Abu abeda um talking about how the Israeli military he said was stuck in the Sands of Gaza um and at the same time a lot of frustration being expressed uh on that 200 day um marker by families of Israeli hostages um still being held in Gaza some of them joining a demonstration in Tel Aviv last night calling on the government desperately to do more to bring their loved ones home youan now thank you very much indeed
