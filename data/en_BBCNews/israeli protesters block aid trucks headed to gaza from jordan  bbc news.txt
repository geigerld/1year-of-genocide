to the m east now and the White House National Security adviser Jake Sullivan has said the US is still working with Israel to avoid a major military operation in Rafa we still believe it is would be a mistake to launch a major military operation Into the Heart of Rafa that would put huge numbers of civilians at risk without a clear strategic gain the president was clear that he would not supply certain offensive weapons for such an operation were it to occur it is not yet occurred and we are still working with Israel on a better way to ensure the defeat of Hamas everywhere in Gaza including in Rafa well let's go live to Jerusalem and our correspondent Dan Johnson Dan um we've had news that a un Aid worker has been killed what more do we know about that yes we know a un vehicle was hit yesterday uh containing at least two un Aid workers one of them killed one of them injured we don't know a huge amount about who they are or what the circumstances of this incident was whether that was an air strike or if that vehicle was engaged by Ground Forces there is video that shows a marked un vehicle that's had its Windows shot out now whether that's the the vehicle that we're talking about we're still waiting for confirmation the incident's been condemned by the uh Secretary General Antonio gutterz who sent his condolences to the families of those involved and highlighted the risks that un and other Aid work workers are facing in Gaza more than 190 un Aid workers have been killed now since uh October he's called for a full investigation and Israel Defense Forces are conducting that review of exactly what happened in this incident they say the early indications are that this vehicle was in an area of active combat and that its position its route hadn't been notified to the IDF so that is perhaps how this incident occurred but we'll have to wait for more information but one Aid worker killed another one injured yesterday there have been disruption to aid supplies coming into Gaza as well with some Israeli protesters yesterday blockading trucks that were heading from Jordan through the West Bank trying to take aid supplies into Gaza that's been an issue they want to highlight the ongoing plight of the hostages who are still being held by Hamas in Gaza and of course the fighting continues we know that there's been an operation around raford but also Israel targeting jamalia in the north what do we know about that operation yeah we've seen an intensification of the military buildup around Rafa over the last week in particular but then yesterday we saw tanks moving back into areas in Northern Gaza areas that had been declared cleared and free of Hamas terrorists just earlier uh this year so the fact that the Israel Defense Forces are going back in there raises a question about whether Hamas has been able to rebuild its strength repopulate battalions in that area and now how the IDF is is going to deal with that and what further destruction that will cause what further upheaval that will mean for Palestinians uh who've gone back into that area believing that it was safe believing that military operations had uh concluded there and this brings into question whether Israel's strategy to drive out Hamas is actually sustainable in the long run huge questions a huge risk to the civilian population of Gaza more than 20% of gaza's population is now estimated to have been uh uprooted and moved again just within the last week that is hundreds of thousands of people who were already without homes and are now without a safe place to shelter enormous issues uh to be considered on the day that Israel is marking 76 years of Independence 76 years since the creation of the modern Jewish State yes and on that I assume there have been subdued commemorations this year yes the Prime Minister said this was not a normal Independence Day because the country is engaged in Conflict there are still hostages being held by Hamas families calling for their safe return there are uh IDF soldiers who are still involved in combat even today so the normal events are not being marked in the same way there is a somber mood to this Independence Day and the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said to the people of this country yesterday that they war for independence they War for freedom is not over while this conflict is ongoing Dan Johnson with the latest live from Jerusalem thank you very much around the world and across the UK this is BBC News
