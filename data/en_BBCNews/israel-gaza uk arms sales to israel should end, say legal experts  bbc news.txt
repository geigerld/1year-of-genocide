here in the UK three former Supreme Court justices have joined more than 600 legal experts in calling for the government to end weapons sales to Israel one of those former justices is Lord suion talking to the BBC he explained why he decided to sign the letter I was sent a copy of it I thought that it was a persuasive and moderately expressed letter which makes some very important points that the UK government seems to be losing sight of the most important point is that article one of the genocide convention uh requires States um uh to uh do what they can to prevent genocide now it hasn't yet been determined whether what the Israelis are doing is genocide the icj international court of justice is considering that issue but they have already ruled that there is a plausible case that that is what is going on uh in Gaza and it seems to me that if you um have a duty as we do uh an international law to prevent genocide uh and there is a plausible case that that is what is happening you should do what you can uh to abstract it well let's speak to our political correspondent Hannah Miller who's at Westminster Hannah what has the response from the ukai Prime Minister and from the main opposition party leader been at the moment we've not had any direct response to that letter from 600 prominent lawyers and academics but there is clearly a kind of growing weight of voices behind this call for the UK to suspend um sales and there's a handful of conservative MPS now saying that the deaths of UK Aid workers must be a line in the sand that's a quote from Paul Bristo the peterb MP as I say one of just a handful but adding to that there's also the former foreign office Minister sir Alan Duncan who has said that it can no longer be justified that we send arms over to Israel and he previously had responsibility for looking at who gets export licenses and where arms can go I would say though that there are conservative MPS who believe that the UK must stand by Israel including the former Home Secretary sella braan who visited Israel this week and also Lord Frost the former brexit negotiator he said Israel must not just be allowed it must be enabled to win this war that's because it's in our national interest to do so he said so in that sense it's there's not a kind of United uniform view within the conservative party but there is added weight behind those calls for the UK to suspend armed sales Labour's position is to ask for the government to publish its legal advice on the issue they say that if if that legal advice shows that Israel hasn't been meeting its International obligations then armed sales should be suspended that is a more nuanced view than has been taken by the liberal Democrats and the SNP who have been calling for some time now for arm sales to be suspended Hannah thank you that's our political correspondent Hannah Miller at Westminster for us well let's speak now to John devil a former Brigadier with the British Army and former director of Defense diplomacy at the ministry of Defense thank you so much for for joining is now we heard there that the deaths of the UK Aid workers represented for some A Line in the Sand what was the specific turning point for you where you believed that it was no longer okay for the UK to supply weapons to Israel well Lu me thanks for having me on so going back in time I for the best part of two years was the senior British officer working in the Palestinian territories and from that perspective I got to know the Israeli Defense Forces very well I was around at the time of massive incursion by the IDF into Gaza operation castled so I've seen this closeup in the past and for me the Turning Point actually was a long time ago and the calls about which uh people have been hearing on your program for the last 5 10 minutes uh have come late in the day because it was completely clear to me looking at the scale of the casualties on the civilian side that from a military point of view as a former military operational planner and somebody who knows the IDF uh adequate care in my view was not being taken by the IDF as of a long time ago in this campaign in order to minimize civilian casualties John you were among signatories saying that the UK should stop sending arms to Israel uh before today and last week as well a cross-party group of MPS said the UK should stop sending arms to Israel and now we've heard hundreds of legal experts saying the same thing but which authority ultimately makes a judgment on this and can enforce it well the um of course there are a number of reasons which we've been hearing um in the last 10 minutes as to why we should be stopping arms uh exports at the end of the day it's the British government decision but it's it's obliged by our government is obliged both by our own laws and by International laws not to provide export licenses if there is a plausible risk that those weapons will be used in violation of of international humanitarian law otherwise known as law of arm conflict as far as I understand it Lord Cameron about a month ago now said that the lawyers in the foreign office were going to look at whether or not IHL was potentially being breached and we still have to uh learn about the results there was a leak uh not long ago suggesting that they had already apped that IHL was in danger of being breached and the point being therefore that uh that our government potentially is out of order legally we have form in this regard going back to I think 2017 the British government found itself in court and lost lost the case and was was ordered by the judge to cease weapons exports to Saudi Arabia because the Royal Saudi Air Force was using British Munitions and aircraft uh to bomb over Yemen without taking du consideration about civilian culties so we've been there before and I can I can foresee looks me that we'll be here again pretty soon if we don't stop exporting weapons and John just briefly finally what would the consequences be then for the UK if that were found to be the case well I would say a lot of embarrassment I would say that uh as I say that we will have to will be ordered by by a judge potentially to stop exporting if we don't preempt that by stopping doing that before then are soonest I think also what I would like to see from military point of view which we certainly would do ourselves not only the better coordination that your respondents have been talking about but also accountability so in our system we would uh expect the soldiers and their chain of command in terms of officers to be held to account and that's not only if uh not only for sins of commission I.E for instance the possibility that direct targeting took place uh on purpose in order to um hit the humanitarian Convoy yesterday but also sin of omission I lack of adequate care so I would like to see proper accountability as well and that's certainly what we would do I set out a model process on paper for our government which went to number 10 and also chief of Defense staff on our side after the uh the Saudi example I gave you earlier uh setting out exactly what we are El would do in the British military in order to uh ensure that we minimize civilian culties and those are the sorts of things that our own government should be ensuring that in this case the Israelis uh carry out and indeed any other country to whom we might export weapons in order to avoid being in beats of law Brigadier John devil thank you so much for your time
