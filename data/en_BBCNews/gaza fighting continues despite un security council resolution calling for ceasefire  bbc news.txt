intense fighting is continuing in Gaza just hours after the passing of the first un Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire Witnesses say Israeli war planes have again bombed the southern city of Rafa with gun battles raging in other areas this is the moment the vote was passed after previous attempts to call for a ceasefire failed the US is now calling for an immediate surge in desperate needed Aid these are the latest pictures in the past hour of air being a of Aid being air dropped into Gaza the UN world food program says famin could set in by May in two areas of Gaza unless the flow of Aid is increased Israel's prime minister has responded to the UN vote by cancelling some meetings between Israeli and American officials meanwhile Hamas appears to have rejected the latest trth proposal made via mediators in Qatar well let's go live to Jerusalem and our Middle East correspondent yoland n yoland what more do we know about the state of fighting in Gaza overnight just after this UN resolution was passed I mean it seems that the resolution passing has had very little impact on the ground what we've heard from Palestinian witnesses that even in Rafa on the Egypt border there have been Israeli air strikes in that area and that fighting remains intense um particularly around the two hospitals that we've been talking about for the past few days uh the shiffer hospital in Gaza City that's where Israeli forces launched a raid one week ago where they say they've rounded up 500 members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad um Palestinian residents nearby saying they've seen corpses on the street that there are still um Close Quarters battles going on there also in al-amal hospital around Al AML hospital um in the southern city of Khan Unice Israeli tanks are rolling back in there in the past couple of days and uh the Israeli military has said that Hamas is using civilian infrastructure in that area and Y land what's the feeling there in the region about what kind of a difference this resolution could bring to the fighting there in Gaza well of course while Israel reacted very angrily uh to this and it said that um this could be uh an encouragement for Hamas that it didn't have to give up the Israeli hostages that it's still holding um in exchange uh for a ceasefire and we had um strong rebukes from the Israeli Prime Minister when it comes uh to the American position the exstension when it came to voting on uh Security Council resolution 2728 um the the claim was made that really this um marked a Divergence from Washington's previous policy um the US has denied that but on the the Palestinian side uh this was welcomed including by Hamas but as we can see it's not um despite the fact un Security Council resolutions are seen as having the force of international law um we also had a White House official um when he was talking about the Israeli reaction saying that he didn't think um really that this would have an impact on Israel's ability to tackle Hamas and that it didn't change things when it comes to uh the US commitment to Israel particularly when it comes to matters like military assistance so seeing the strong support for this resol resolution at the UN Security Council how isolated is Israel on the global stage would you say now this is something that will concern Israel greatly it does feel very much like it's isolated but at the same time if you um look at surveys of the Israeli public opinion um there is still wide support for the war in Gaza um and for this idea of of dismantling Hamas there it's seen as being such an existential threat we've had reminders that Hamas can still pose a threat in the past day it's had we've had Rockets fired um to Ash D Israeli city uh in in the south of the country for the first time in weeks there were rocket warning sirens that continued to go off through last night um in Israeli communities close to the Gaza Strip um but yes on an international stage Israel will be worried about this and we've had Israeli officials coming out in the past day so particularly talking about how they are trying to get surge of Aid using that un language trying to flood uh Gaza with Aid we were told in a briefing yesterday um as that is part of this resolution too and of course part of the big International demand that they're so worried about the threat of starvation and famine in Gaza your land thank you very much that's the BBC's your land now there in Jerusalem now as well as calling for a ceasefire the UN is also warning that northern areas of Gaza could face famine within weeks Israel says it's opening new routes to let Aid through and the Israeli Army Chief in charge of Aid coordination says there's no shortage of food I should warn you that this report from our Middle East correspondent Lucy Williamson contains some distressing images from the very start gaza's border fence divides more than just land on one side Food Supplies on the other sick malnourished children agencies say Israel is blocking Aid Israel says the only hold up is the agency's ability to deliver it a ceasefire could help get Aid in but Israel has said it won't work with the un's main relief agency Ana accusing it of links to Hamas Ona's Chief said the ban was outrageous gate 96 a newly opened Crossing Point takes trucks straight to Gaza City where the UN says people are weeks away from famine on the night we were there the Army said 20 trucks were approved to cross but only seven showed up we took a lot of measures in order to enlarge the amount of humanitarian aid but the UN and other International Organization have some bottlenecks they have issues and challence regarding Logistics of amount of trucks amount of uh truck drivers Manpower uh working hours and Etc on board one of those trucks the local head of the world food program with a different explanation on this particular Convoy we were given a limit of 15 vetted drivers by the IDF that were cleared to use this route but only seven were available to us some had already gone up to Gaza City the day before and they simply hadn't been able to return yet we literally need 50 60 70 80 truck drivers cleared to use these routes every single day Israel is Keen to show the world it's allowing more Aid into Gaza but it says it's not responsible for the amount of Aid going in international law says different it says Israel has a duty not just to open the gates but to get food and medicine to the people under its control do you think children are starving in Gaza I know that they are not so when you see those pictures of children Starving in hospital what do you think I say it and I will say it again as much as I know there is no starvation in [Music] Gaza two things are crossing this border Aid and the army they bring food and War life and death Lucy Williamson BBC news on the Gaza border the UK's Royal air Force has air dropped more than 10 tons of food into Gaza for the first time including water rice and baby formula the a drop comes amid fears that 1.1 million gazers gazans face imminent famine in a catastrophic humanitarian crisis the defense secretary Grant shaps urged Israel to allow more Aid into the war torn territory
