now Hamas has announced that Yaya senoir Israel's Most Wanted man has been chosen as the new head of the group he succeeds is hania who was assassinated in the Iranian Capital Teran last week well let's take a look at Yaya sina's background he has most recently been serving as the leader of hamas's military Wing in Gaza Israel holds him along with others responsible for the October the 7th attack on Israel which killed around 1200 people and saw more than 200 kidnapped the 61-year-old was born in the hanun refugee camp in southern Gaza his parents were refugees after his education he was arrested by Israel at the age of 19 for what they called Islamic activities 2 years after the formation of Hamas when he was just 25 sinoa set up the Fe internal security organization al- Maj in 1988 sinoa allegedly planned the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers he was arrested and imprisoned after a murder conviction by Israel our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams sent this analysis from Jerusalem we understand that the appointment of Yahya Sina as the leader of Hamas was unanimous by the organization's leadership uh it was always likely in the wake of the assassination of isma hania an assassination blamed universally uh on Israel even though Israel has yet to comment directly on it it was always was likely that Yahya Sina would be uh the figure to take over there were one or two other candidates uh but Yahya Sina is by far the most prominent and I think what it tells us is that uh hamas's reaction uh to the assassination of is hania is one of total Defiance uh by killing uh if not a moderate definitely the most pragmatic uh member of Hamas uh Israel has now secured as the leader of Hamas the most radical uh the uh figure within the organization the man most committed to the use of violence uh the man generally regarded as the Chief Architect of the Dreadful Hamas attacks of October the 7th last year uh there is no interlocutor now uh for Hamas outside of the Gaza Strip everything is now going to be in the hands of yak sinat frankly most of it was already before this uh but he is now the if you like uh Undisputed uh political and military leader of Hamas it is going to make it very difficult if not impossible uh to conduct negotiations it's all a very cumbersome process of getting messages in and out of the Gaza Strip uh none of that is going to be made any easier as a result of this as far as the Israeli reaction is concerned well perhaps they anticip ated that their attitude towards Mr sinoa is the same as their attitude towards anyone associated with Hamas which is that he is a terrorist leader a man with Israeli blood on his hands and that uh the they will not rest until he like isma hania is dead Paul Adams reporting there
