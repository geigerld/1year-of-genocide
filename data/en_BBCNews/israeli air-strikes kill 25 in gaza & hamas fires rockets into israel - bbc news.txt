this just one of 160 air strikes by the Israeli military on Gaza overnight and into this morning the homes of Hamas leaders now being targeted as well as command centers and Rocket launching sites the hospitals here filling up rapidly with casualties at least 25 people have now been killed in the last few days most of them civilians and including five children according to Palestinian Health officials I think what's needed that Israel should have an end for this criminal belligerant occupation and they shouldn't be awarded for the war crimes they are doing Israel should stop once and for good uh The Siege on Gaza and stop suffocating 2 million Palestinian people but this morning aade Sirens once again in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv forcing people to Run for Cover as yet more more Rockets were fired from Gaza so far the attacks here and elsewhere in Israel have caused panic but not any casualties in part because the Israelis say they've shot down some of the Rockets with their missile defense system and they're now indicating they want to stop the attacks once and for all we tried to deescalate messages were sent we told Hamas to stop this rocket fire but they continued and now we are acting the Israeli Defense Forces are acting to bring about a situation where the people of Israel no longer have to live in fear already Israeli tanks have been deployed near the border with Gaza ready for a ground offensive if the ORD given at the moment it does seem that Israel is preparing for what could be a long military campaign Richard Galpin BBC News
