I was always dreaming and thinking about going to Palestine with my bike I just eventually decided to do it to gather funds for our fith Hospital in razza because the health structure inza is getting destroyed [Music] I not an illusion that I can change the massacr in razza or stop them but at the same time I'm not sitting without doing anything I just try to do what I can do when the war started it was the most surreal day for me that I ever bombed after the cloud settled after we were able to see the sun again because when you are in mid of the bombardments you don't see anything we went immediately to the neighboring house and started to dig for people when we carried her out a child was carried in front of me his feet were on my body too and I see okay that's the woman is alive the child is not alive it make me feel like I lost all hope in humanity honestly this is Gaza is Gaza when I left Gazza I was relieved for my mother only but myself I had the feeling that I wanted to stay because I W was not comfortable seeing my my family and my relatives in the situation they were were in the only thing we can do outside of to arus the main main highlight of my journey right now was visiting the families that suffered the genocide in St in Bosnia I felt like I'm with my aunt I felt like I with my mother you see that the people are sympathizing and not forgetting what's happening there I am try to get €300,000 for the field Hospital in res money doesn't change much but it's something we can do at least to help the people
