the Israeli Army says that it's retrieved the bodies of six hostages from gaza's Southern District of KH Unis in a joint operation with its internal security agency a statement from the hostages families Forum says that the recovery of the bodies crucially provides their families with necessary closure the immediate Return of the remaining 109 hostages can only be achieved through a negotiated deal it adds well this comes as the US Secretary of State Anthony Lincoln has traveled to Egypt as he continues to push for a ceasefire and hostage release deal these follow talks in Jerusalem yesterday where Mr blinken said that Israel had accepted what he called a bridging proposal and he then urged Hamas to do the same well a little earlier we were joined by our correspondent John donison who shared his Insight on this yes well in a short statement from the Israeli military and also Israel's intelligence agency the shinb they said the six bodies were recovered in carun in the south of the Gaza Strip the six bodies were yagev bab Alexander dansig avam Munda yuram meta Heim Perry and nadav Powell who was a British Israeli Citizen and all apart from 79y old avam Munda were already uh presumed to be dead it's thought there are up to 70 hostages who are still alive alive being held in Gaza and in the last few moments we've had a statement from Israel's prime minister Benjamin netan who of course has faced considerable criticism from some hostage families for not doing enough to free those who are being held and he said our hearts grieve over this terrible loss and this Grim news comes as there was hope that some kind of bridging proposal for a ceasefire deal would be taking some form of shape Anthony blinkin the US Secretary of State who is now in Egypt hoping to push that forward seemed a little bit more optimistic than arguably Benjamin Netanyahu when it comes to this bridging proposal he did but I think the truth is uh that the Americans and Anthony blinkin are the only ones who seem to be saying that this deal is close he said in his statement after meeting prime minister Netanyahu yesterday that Israel had accepted and supported this so-called bridging proposal to get to a ceasefire and hostage release deal Mr Netanyahu in his statement was far less forthcoming he simply said it had been a good and important meeting with Mr blinken and Hamas for its part has also been skeptical they of course are not even taking part in these latest ceasefire negotiations at the moment they've said any uh suggestion that there has been progress is an illusion now as you say Mr blinkin is in Egypt today and then later katar and he's going to be uh getting those two countries to continue to put pressure on Hamas to sign up to this deal but I think the truth is that while the Americans might be working towards a certain timetable I think they'd like to get a deal done while the Democratic Convention is taking place at the moment and certainly before the US presidential election in November I don't think that the key players in the region and that is prime minister Netanyahu and the Hamas leader in Gaza Yaya sinoa there's no sense really that they are working to the same timetable John Donis there reporting from uh Jerusalem there Anthony blinkin of course right now in Egypt so where as and when we get more details we're just monitoring the live shot there but as and when we get more details will of course bring that to you
