support our Middle East correspondent yoland Nell has this report explosions lighting up the night sky as Israeli missile defense shot down incoming Palestinian Rockets but not all homes in southern

day in Israeli history never before have so many Israelis been killed by one single thing let alone enemy activity on one day and if you're Americans and want to compare this to Something in American history then this could be a 911 and a Pearl Harbor wrapped into one Hamas now says it's holding 100 Israeli hostages like this 85-year-old grandmother yafa Adar whisked Away by militants in a golf cart y Asher is begging for the safe return of his wife and two small children after they were kidnapped by gunman while visiting his in-laws I want to ask of Kamas don't hurt them don't hurt little

thousands of Palestinians have fled their homes many seeking shelter in un schools as Israel HIDs back the International Community has rushed to support its right to defend itself but there have been warnings too about a growing humanitarian crisis Israel keeps saying the blockade and repeated assaults on Gaza are to destroy Hamas military capabilities and ensure security clearly and ex and expectedly its blockade and assaults accomplished neither and with Palestinians killed in clashes with Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank there are new signs of the violence spreading yoland Nell BBC News Jerusalem well let's get the very latest now from our correspondent Anna Foster who is in southern Israel for us morning Anna just describe the situation where you are morning Sally well even as you're talking to me now we're hearing very loud explosions still in the sky here in ashalon in southern Israel and as you were hearing there it has been a an intense night we've had missile barrages coming across here from Gaza and again the Israeli Defense Forces have been striking targets there this is one of the missiles that actually hit its Target most of them are destroyed by Israel's Iron Dome defense system but you can see here this is a a twostory block of flats and a missile from Gaza made a direct hit right into the center of them you can see at the Children's bike and toys on the floor I've just been talking actually to a woman who lives just in that flat there actually right above and she was saying that her and her husband when this happened they were stuck inside the door was jammed they were trying desperately to get out and she said they had to be they had to be rescued by firefighters people who live in this area are used to missile attacks from Gaza but really not the size and the scale that we've seen since Saturday morning and certainly not the kind of infiltration with Hamas militants coming through the fence from Gaza as we saw paragliding into this part of Southern Israel coming in by sea and wreaking that the Havoc which you have seen over the last couple of days and people here this morning they are out they are surveying the damage and they're very much wondering what this means next for them Anna thank you very much indeed well our reporter rushi Abu Alou is in Gaza this morning uh morning rushi just talk us through the situation there and what the latest information is that you have over the last last few hours yeah good morning just as we speak abaj of rockets were fired from from Gaza as mainly Hamas send message saying that it's in response to what they call Israeli massacres the in a statement Hamas this morning said that Israeli committed 11 massacres in in Gaza killing families and kids and children we have been getting reports since last night about air strike in inun in southern Gaza and in Rafa where civilian casualties were uh discovered under the rubble of those of those building and no statement yes or update from the health Ministry about the number of the people killed overnight but medical official in the main hospital in Gaza told the BBC about 40 people killed overnight which last night was the heaviest I think for years Israel carried out more than 500 air strikes targeting many places buildings houses uh and one of the deadliest attack was in shat refugee camp it's the densely populated refugee camp within Gaza City it's called the beach camp and they destroyed a a two-story mosque it's a famous called the Western white mosque is being destroyed by five six air strikes ER some of the buildings around the mosque the mosque were collapsed and they are trying to rescue people from under the the rubel the situation is escalating in a very dramatic way last night and and this morning with for the first time we are hearing some gunfire near the Israeli border about half an hour ago we heard Israeli helicopter engaging in in in in gun batt or in gun fighting near the Gaza border which is about like 2 km or 3 km this way uh in the third day Gaza is still H without electricity 80 85% of the people H they don't have electricity for 3 Days the most of the internet lines are are down the crossings that connect Gaza with the inter with the world is is completely closed Israel shut the main of the cross the main Crossings and there is no uh Goods or medicine or fuel enter Gaza no movement for people and goods since three days and RI we're also hearing as you mentioned that power supplies being cut we're hearing there are um there's a shortage of food and water too what can people do to find food and water when the supply chain is currently blocked well there is two sources of power in Gaza one is produced by the solo power station in Gaza which they said they have fuel enough uh for another 20 48 Hours the the main source of the power is lines coming from Israel and Israel decided the first day of this operation to stop supplying Gaza with those with those B so now the what what is available is quite small amount of of few of electricity and they are now being given to the hospitals to run the essential services and the water services but for the ordinary people they are unable to see electricity or Internet for the last 3 days most of the people about 85% of the people are not having this and because of the fighting uh just looking down is the main street to uh that lead to the downtown the shops are completely closed schools H uh universities businesses are shut for the third day and most of the gazan are staying
