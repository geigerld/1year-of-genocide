now the leaders of Egypt Jordan and the Palestinian Authority have condemned Israel for what they called the collective punishment of civilians in Gaza they've been speaking at a peace Summit in Cairo now in the last hour the UK's foreign secretary James cleverly condemned the actions of Hamas but said he's spoken to the Israeli government about its duty to act in accordance with international law I am sure we all share the revoltion at hamas's murderous acts of terrorism the targeting of the uh civilians the murdering of children the desecration of dead bodies and I'm sure we are all distressed by the plight of Palestinian civilians in Gaza whose lives have been made harder more painful and more dangerous because of the brutal attacks by Hamas on the 7th of October and we all mourn the Dead both Israeli and Palestinian James cleverly there well we've also heard from Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas he's the head of the Palestinian Authority which has control over areas of the occupied West Bank but not the Hamas ran Gaza Strip now he used his opening remarks to say that Palestinians will not be forced off their land and we warn against any attempts to displace our people in Gaza Beyond its borders we also warn against any evictions of Palestinians from their homes or displacement from Jerusalem or the West Bank we will not accept displacement we will remain steadfast on our land no matter the challenges the UN Secretary General Antonio guz described the scene out the Rafa Crossing as a human catastrophe after his visit on Friday a 20 TR vo of the Egyptian red crescent is moving today and I want to express my deep gratitude to Egypt for the central role Egypt is playing in this regard but the people of Gaza need a commitment for much much more a continuous delivery of Aid to Gaza at the scale that is needed and we are working nonstop with all parties that are relevant to make it happen excellencies let's be clear the Grievances of the Palestinian people are legitimate and long we cannot and must not ignore the wider context for these tragic events the long-standing conflict and 56 years of occupation with no end in sight but nothing can justify the reprehensible assault by Hamas that aoriz the terrorized Israeli civilians and those abhorent attacks can never justify by the collective punishment of the Palestinian people institutional humanitarian law including the Geneva conventions must be upheld and that includes protecting civilians and not attacking hospitals schools and un premises that are currently Sheltering half a million people excellencies our near-term goals must be clear immediate and restricted and sustained humanitarian aid for B civilians in Gaza immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and immediate and dedicated efforts to prevent the spread of violence which is increasing the risk of spillover to advance all these efforts I appeal for a humanitarian ceasefire now excellencies our sustained Collective efforts and resources have never been needed more as we focus on ending the Bloodshed we cannot lose sight of the only realistic foundation for a true peace and stability a two-state solution Israelis must see their legitimate needs for security materialized and Palestinians must see their legitimate aspirations for an independent state realized in line with with United Nations resolutions international law and previous agreements the time has come for action action to end this godol God awul Nightmare and action to build a future worthy of the dreams of the children of Palestine Israel the region and our world shukran Egyptian president Abdul Fat Al CI told leaders at that Summit that the aim is to end the humanitarian disaster in the Gaza Strip and revive a path to peace between Israel and the Palestinians we warn against any attempts to displace our people in Gaza Beyond its borders we also warn against any evictions of Palestinians from their challenges well for more on all of this let's go live to our BBC Arabic reporter Abdul Bas Hassan who is in Cairo at that conference for us thanks very much for joining us just bringing us up to date on the latest uh with what's happening where you are yes the participants are in a break now for almost half an hour expectedly they would issue a final statement uh after this uh break uh which mainly May feature According to some experts who have been following this event in Cairo a call for an immediate ceasefire number one number two protecting the civilian I from both sides number three of course the uh opening and increasing the span of the operation of extending Aid humanitarian assistance and food water fuel and other supplies uh uh to Gaza uh almost like an hour ago uh some Western uh foreign ministers have talked in uh the session uh they raised an among what they said that Israel has the ref the right to defend itself but the international laws in this regard should be respected this is their call others have promised more uh supplies and more uh funds for supplying Palestinians with needs especially Norway and Canada uh of course the main call still is an immediate seiz fire and uh some some of this who spoke minutes ago have called for the International Community represented in the security Council to reconsider it stand some of them blamed the failure or what they called failure by the UN Security Council to try to find a solution an immediate solution for the current conflict and the others of course said or demanded that the roots of the issue should be addressed in a wider consideration of the needs demands and uh the conditions of both sides uh there are calls that or remarks including destruction wouldn't bring or would not bring uh Prosperity therefore they considered both sides are losers and therefore the uh call for a permanent solution markedly by the establishment of Palestinian State remained a a major call here and of course uh a call for immediate release for hostages but still the uh uh demand for supplies for Gaza is rising here um Abdul Bas one thing that struck me is that this conference that you are at doesn't have representatives from Israel Iran or the US so how much progress can be made when everyone isn't actually around that table let's consider the fact that some countries especially the United the Europeans said they don't expect a lot from the uh conference but at least it is the first political consensus here for a group of leaders a group of head of state to discuss this issue after 15 days the US is represented by and and someone said it is the lowest representation by its Char Affairs in Egypt while of course some other European countries are represented by their head their Prime Ministers including uh uh uh Italy and uh uh therefore the what's expected here today is just a common ground on what should be done now immediately and of course waiting for more inter from the United the UN Security Council okay for the moment Abdul bassir Hassan who is live at that Summit in Cairo for us thank you very much
