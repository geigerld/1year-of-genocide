I want to return to our other breaking news in the last at Israel's Supreme Court has ruled that there is no legal basis for excluding Ultra Orthodox men from the military draft and that those who are eligible for service must be drafted well let's go live to our Middle East correspondent yolan Nell who is in Jerusalem yolan just explain what the uh court has ruled this morning well this is a decision by the Israeli Supreme Court basically saying that after a legal Arrangement uh expired that allowed Ultra Orthodox Jewish men to avoid conscription in the military um that really there is no reason for them now not to be uh conscripted and this could affect tens of thousands of men and also um will affect the the funding the Public Funding that goes uh to the Jewish seminaries where they've been studying uh if uh they continue um to have students who are avoid military conscription so this really has wide ramifications in Israeli Society where 12% of the population now a growing percentage of the population are Ultra Orthodox Jews and is something that will have real political implications too with ultra Orthodox Jewish parties uh playing a key role in the governing Coalition for them this is really uh the number one issue to avoid uh Ultra Orthodox Jewish men from serving in the military to allow them to dedicate their time uh to religious study instead um and it is something it's not totally clear at the moment uh what the ramifications of all that will be but certainly it could lead to large numbers of men uh being called up um and it comes at a time such a important ruling which is an issue that's been going on for for decades really causing divisions um in Israeli Society um but it's really come to a head at the time of the war in Gaza where we've got Israeli military leaders saying that there is this huge strain on the military and they have a shortage of Manpower a shortage of combat soldiers yes you mention the ramifications particularly for Benjamin Netanyahu in the government at the moment while the war in Gaza is continuing indeed and there had been sort of attempts in the past by the Supreme Court to put this issue back to Parliament to allow Parliament uh to rule on exactly uh what should happen for Ultra or Orthodox men uh whether they should continue to be allowed to be exempt U from the military uh but there has been a failure for that to happen even with this uh current government you can see uh within the Coalition that there are real splits on exactly um what should be allowed in terms of exemptions um and that has led really at a committee stage uh to Parliament just kind of holding off uh on new legislation even at a time when as I say these legal arrangements had expired there was now no framework the Supreme Court said uh to allow Ultra Orthodox men to continue to be Exempted um now in Israel I mean just as a bit more context the Army is really seen as being the People's Army a place where people from all walks of life go to share a joint experience um in their late teenage years um and that is really what is seen as being the strength uh of the Israeli Army and the beginning o of the state of Israel the late 40s it was just a tiny percentage of ultra Orthodox Jews um and so allowing them to have exemption after the population was really um just so badly affected by the Holocaust was not seen as being a big issue but as the ultra Orthodox Jewish population has grown and grown demographics have changed in Israel this idea of sharing the security burden more equally has become a really hot political topic yolan now with the latest injury thank you very much indeed
