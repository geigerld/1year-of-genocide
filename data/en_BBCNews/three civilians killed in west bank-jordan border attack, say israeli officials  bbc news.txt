well let's turn now to events in the Middle East Jordan has launched an investigation and closed the king Hussein Bridge after three Israeli civilians were killed in a shooting attack at a border crossing with the occupied West Bank the attacker who was shot dead by Israeli Security Forces was reportedly a truck driver from Jordan who arrived at the terminal and opened fire on Customs workers the incident comes amid High Regional tension overnight there were missile exchanges between Israel and the leban militant group Hezbollah with a number of projectiles being fired from both directions across the border well let's speak to our correspondent in Jerusalem Mike Thompson Mike can you bring us up to date with the latest on the news that we broke in the past hour about that shooting yes this truck driver had uh driven towards the king Hussein Bridge alen be border crossing as it's also known and he'd opened fire after leaping out of his truck with a gun he opened fire on uh Security Forces there and he' killed he killed three civilians now they were described as civilians there also apparently according to the Israeli ad Ministry uh they are actually um security private security people who were shot dead uh the uh border crossing as you mentioned has now been closed on both sides um and uh so nothing will be passing through there for a while and the truck is being searched for the possibility that there may be explosives and then therefore further Carnage on the way and how much does the uh exchange of fire overnight between uh Israel and Hezbollah add to concerns around tension escalating in the region well it's continued concern really because there have been these exchanges now since the beginning of the war in Gaza but they've intensified lately and August saw the biggest number the biggest monthly number uh s across the border uh of course in both directions too because there were more than 50 were fired by Hezbollah in Lebanon uh early this morning and Israel also uh fired quite a few missiles rockets at uh at Lebanon to knock out rocket launch sites um and apparently yesterday uh three uh emergency workers who've been trying to put out fires caused by these projectiles um were killed but it's going to add to tensions because the speed are very large is really operation in the West Bank for more than a week that only recently stopped in Janine uh leaving at least 39 people dead and this is fueling concern that if it if it carries on spiraling this violence you know we could see something uh not that far distant from the awful events happening in Gaza yes it adds to tensions and perhaps also adds to the pressure on the Israeli government because of course we've been uh hearing of increasing levels of protests just bring us the latest on that Mike yes last night there was what the organizers of the the rallies which were held right across Israel said was the biggest demonstration so far and there have been seven consecutive nights of these they say an estimated 750,000 people across towns and cities around Israel came onto the streets 500,000 in Tel Aviv alone now it's not clear yet just how much a demonstration of this size is going to put how much pressure this is going to put on Benjamin Netanyahu the Prime Minister because he's also getting a lot of international pressure as well as what we're seeing internally and indeed some too from his defense minister yo Galant who does feel that more effort needs to be made to find a way around the impass on uh sealing a ceasefire hostage release deal Mike Thompson our correspondent in Jerusalem thank you and there's uh a lot more on that story on uh the BBC News website of course
