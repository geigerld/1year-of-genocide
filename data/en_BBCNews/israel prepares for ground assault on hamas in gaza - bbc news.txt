the Israeli Army says it is preparing for a ground assault on Hamas in the Gaza street so far tens of thousands of troops have been deployed to the border with Gaza Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that they will crush and Destroy Hamas which launch the attack on Israel on Saturday well the US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is in Israel and speaking alongside his Israeli counterpart at a joint news conference in tviv he condemned Hamas which he regards as a terrorist organization now this is no time for neutrality or for false equivalence or for excuses for the inexcusable there is never any justification for terrorism and that's especially true after this Rampage by Hamas and anyone who wants lasting peace and security for this region must condemn and isolate Hamas Hamas does not speak for the Palestinian people or their legitimate hopes for dignity security and statehood and peace alongside Israel as a former commander of Central Command the deliberate cruelty of Hamas vividly reminds me of Isis right let's get some analysis now on the Israeli military operation with Shashank Joshi he's defense editor at The Economist magazine here in London thank you very much for coming on the program good afternoon so uh this idea of a ground Invasion soon firstly do you think it is coming soon and and what are the the the the chances of achieving its aim of destroying Hamas well yesterday I would have said to you this ground invasion was probably imminent today following the Israeli call to evacuate the north of Gaza and move this very large population to the South which is which is going to take time I'm I'm less sure I think the Israeli government in military seems to think it will take a couple of weeks at the very least and it's unclear to me whether they will go in until that's done um given that they want to be able to operate on the ground with as few civilians as possible uh Urban Warfare is always extremely messy destructive very harmful on civili and the IDF would prefer to operate in in extremely dense builtup places like Gaza City without civilians so I suspect we will see a ground Invasion but I think it will take time to come and in response to your second question well the stated Israeli objective is to destroy Hamas destroying a terrorist group that has occupied a uh urban area for 15 16 years and has built 500 kmers of tunnels underneath it and is embedded in uh uh the social economic and political fabric of this territory is is not easy and I suspect if previous Ground Wars in Gaza took a couple of weeks we're going to see an Israeli military involvement here that goes on for months and if it really is going to obliterate Hamas as Israeli officials have talked about we could be in for a commitment of years which of course is a much bigger proposition so an operation lasting years potentially well it entirely depends on the Israeli political leadership and and how they see their aims if the aim is to make sure there is no Hamas left that Hamas cannot reassert itself once the Israeli Army withdraws from Gaza that there is no uh uh tunnel capability no Rockets no uh command centers no senior leadership none of these things you know this let's not let's not pretend this is anything other than an enormous open-ended campaign that I think will take a long time it is not something that can be done in weeks okay that's pretty sobering what about the idea that for two reasons there may well be large number of civilians there still one that people simply can't move we've been covering the difficulty in the logistics and two we've heard from people there who simply say they won't move they won't leave their homes so given there will in all likelihood still be civilians in the area does that change any of the calculations well Israel will be aware that the greater the civilian casual the greater the impact on their International reputation including in Europe and particularly in America where they need American political support and I would just say although America has Israel's um has given Israel its full backing now we just heard that clip from Lloyd Austin it is worth casting your mind back 20 years to the Israeli operation in the West Bank when they went in with massive Force Under Ariel Chiron and even back then the George W Bush Administration although initially supportive eventually told Israel to those actions because of the cost on the Palestinian people so setting aside the legality and and the laws of war around this the political and diplomatic constraints on Israel I think are going to be pretty pretty high um as this operation goes on okay shasa ji thank you very much for your analysis thank you thanks
