now though let's turn to the latest on the Middle East and the United Nations security Council has again delayed a vote on a resolution calling for a halt to the fighting in Gaza it's the fourth time it's been postponed this week it has been delayed since Monday as member states try to work out a draft that the United States won't veto our United Nations correspondent Neda torfi has the latest from New York what I heard from one Diplomat is that they've made more progress today than they have all week and that they are narrowing the gaps what we have received is the latest draft resolution and it is different in key aspects from the last proposal now instead of calling for a suspension of hostilities the draft now calls for Urgent steps to immediately allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access with creating conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities so the wording there toned down from the original draft the resolution ution on the table now also appoints a senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator that will then appoint a un mechanism to try to speed up Aid into Gaza uh so it's all quite a mouthful but these are the proposals on the table this was made to try to uh prevent a US veto to get the United States on board with this resolution that's Neda toik at the United Nations well after the meeting ended the UN ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas Greenfield spoke to reporters we do have that resolution now we're ready to vote on it uh and uh it's a resolution that will bring humanitarian assistance to those in need it will support uh the uh the priority that EA pass in ensuring that we put uh a a mechanism uh um on the ground that will support humanitarian assistance um and we're ready to vote for it that's the UN US ambassador at the UN well let's cross to Joe floto who is our Middle East bureau chief he's live in Jerusalem for us Joe thank you very much for joining us um let's talk about this um resolution how significant would it be if the UN signs up to it look I think at the moment we're seeing in uh New York uh diplomacy meeting reality so what we've got here uh are two sides who are uh violently opposed to each other but are have very different views on when the next ceasefire should happen so Hamas and the other Palestinian factions fighting in Gaza have come out very publicly and in conversation with uh Egyptian mediators to say there will be no uh Paws no negotiation for a transfer of hostages uh unless the the the conflict finishes unless the the ceasefire is permanent on the Israeli side they say well we're not going to agree to that because we are fighting an enemy who inflicted a huge amount of suffering and damage on our country on October the 7th and continues to fire Rockets into Israel the Israeli Prime Minister says we won't stop until Hamas is destroyed but Israel is open to a longer ceasefire in exchange for hostages but I have to be realistic here I mean last night an Israeli senior official told us that they're not actually in a negotiation at the moment although they are having useful talks with mediators so the two sides are very very far apart and in the middle well we've got 2 and a half million people in Gaza 1.9 million of them are uh displaced from their homes and the UN is reporting uh severe hunger uh and disease spreading amongst those people not to mention of course uh the deal is climbing as the military operation continues every single day and how much Aid is at the moment getting in we know quite a bit got in where there was the pause in fighting but since that has resumed are any trucks getting in dayto day so trucks are going in uh they vary dayto day uh how many go in sometimes it can be up to 200 trucks a day and then that flow goes down the UN is saying look uh we need to speed this up and if Israel were to open fully it it's Main terminal with Gaza on the Israeli side then that could be fulfilled uh currently uh there is a a very slow encumbersome uh operation to check every single truckload of Aid and that is controlled by Israel Israel says that's necessary because it doesn't want anything going to Hamas that would help it prosecute its War uh and at the moment there's not enough Aid going through by anyone's assessment apart from Israel Israel says there's plenty of food still in Gaza the markets have food and it's actually the un uh who could speed up their supply of trucks for inspection something that the UN flatly Rejects and said that's not true Joe floto in Jerusalem thank you very much indeed well we can speak now to Sam block who is director of emergency response for World Central Kitchen in Gaza which has been working to provide meals for Citizens inside Gaza Sam you're in Rafa which is in the south of Gaza what is the situation like with you where you are so in Rafa uh we're working both in Northern Gaza and in southern Gaza but in in southern Gaza we've seen just an incredible condensing of the population uh the whole southern part of Gaza normally has about 280,000 uh people living here and we we now have uh well over a million so there there is people absolutely everywhere uh seeking some sense of of safety um we're we're feeding as many of them as we can we're currently U providing enough food via our trucks coming across for at one meal a day about 22% of the population but that is obviously not even close to enough um we're we're we're doing all all that it is that we can we sending as we have a lot of trucks in the pipeline we've had about 400 trucks enter Gaza already um and we have a lot uh waiting on the Egyptians side uh to come in there is the the the there is food on the markets on the so to speak markets lots of little Street vendors a lot of which are reselling um uh humanitarian food that's been donated it's kind of become the informal economy you need one thing you you you know sell or trade one thing you receive but all the food uh coming from within Gaza is is becoming on very very short demand and while there is food in those markets it's three to four times what the average uh cost would have been there's a a severe uh scarcity in addition to that some people may know there's been very very little propane means for people to cook food uh here in Rafa you know Southern Gaza every possible every tree you know every time you drive anywhere every day you see less and less trees so people are resting to anything possible um to create heat in order to be able to cook fuel World Central Kitchen is bringing in Alternatives we've designed in engineering um alternative to propane cooking cooking stoves and fuel sources uh but it's still simply notal you mentioned you're in the south of Gaza what is the situation like in the North is it is it much worse there the reports are um really really hard hard to handle uh I will be going up to to to Gaza City tomorrow uh especially even in the hospitals you know we're getting reports uh from the hospitals to where they they would prefer water over medical attention because that's what how immediate the need is so we will be taking food and water up there again it's been trickling up it's very challenging to get the food into Gaza but into Southern Gaza but then to get it up to even the hospitals and Northern Gaza it's extremely challenging so we're hoping to be able to push more up we were able to push a lot up during the last ceasefire we're definitely hoping for the ceasefire to really get as much as we possibly can to northern northern Gaza and Gaza City are you hopeful of that happening at any point in the near future hopeful is a hopeful is a big word um things are are changing here daily so you really have to um you really have to be addressing every every situation from day to day moment to moment and and being as ready as possible we've you know have multiple contingency plans every single day for every action that we do so uh yes hopeful but then also constant planning and backup plans to do as much as we can okay s block director of emergency respons of world Central Kitchen in Gaza thank you very much for joining us
