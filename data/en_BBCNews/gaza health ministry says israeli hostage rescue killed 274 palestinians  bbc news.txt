the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza says 274 Palestinians were killed during Saturday's Israeli offensive on the nerat refugee camp the operation led to the rescue of four Israeli hostages taken by Hamas during the October the 7th attacks they were freed during the raid in broad daylight Israel has previously estimated there were fewer than 100 casualties footage from the areas our AXA Hospital shows badly wounded people lying on the ground the top Diplomat Joseph Burell has condemned the killings describing them as another Massacre of civilians Mustafa bouti is the Secretary General and co-founder of the Palestinian national initiative and he spoke earlier to my colleague maxing croell and gave his reaction the latest development in Israel and Gaza well there is a great amount of anger because in the process the Israeli Army committed as Joseph pel said a horrible Massacre killing no less than 218 Palestinians mostly children and women bombarding whole neighborhoods for no reason and injuring in addition to that 400 people many of whom will die because Israel has already destroyed most medical facilities and hospitals in Gaza it was a horrible act uh of course we want all the prisoners to be released but there was another way to do that which is to conclude a deal at this rate at this rate Netanyahu will need 20 years of massacres to release the rest of the 120 Israeli prisoners well Israel of course disputes that this was a massacre and it it does seem that the number of casualties is contested but it certainly with scores but Israel's view is don't take hostages then we won't need to free them and civilians won't be at risk do I do Israelis take hostages we have uh everybody talks about the 120 Israeli prisoners or hostages as you called them but nobody speaks about the 14,500 Palestinians in Israeli presence including 5,000 who were kidnapped in Gaza nobody speaks what was remarkable is that the Israelis said that the Israeli prisoners who were released were in very good health condition and then well well taken care of well except except we know other hand on the the other hand let me finish on the other hand 14,500 Palestinian prisoners are subjected to torture 52 Palestinian prisoners have been killed already in Israeli prisons since the 7th of October the Israel the Israeli the Israeli government contests those accusations government spokes person of the Israeli government 12 there are 116 hostages left 40 of them I believed to have been have died whilst in Gaza everyone always talks everybody talks about everyone talks about an either or situ situation that that one thing is separate from the other all of these issues are tightly bound up you've mentioned this deal How likely is it that you think a ceasefire deal will really come to pass when we we've got all of these different elements which could force Hamas to dig in or could force the or persuade the Israelis that well we've rescued four we'll try and get some more of the hostages out and tell you what Israeli leaders say what Israeli opposition leaders say they say that Netanyahu cares only about himself he doesn't care about the hostages who the Hamas who the Hamas Mr B I know you you you've told us that you have no link in any way with Hamas but who do Hamas care about they're using people surely as civilians as human Shields and there will inevitably be civilian casualties in any sort of operation at all if that's what if that continues I would really appreciate if you allow me to answer please your questions uh and please don't interrupt me uh I don't sometimes I'm I'm Sor Mr I'm sorry it's it's an opportunity here to explore some of the things that you say before you move on to make a the next Point each of your points requires and deserves some attention because you if you if you accept only the Israeli Narrative of course you will say so but you have to to see our narrative as well and the narrative here is that this whole problem is related to the fact that Israel is occupying us since 60 since 57 years Israel is displacing us since 76 years that's is the roots these are the roots of the problem and there are Palestinian prisoners I'm not defending Hamas I don't belong to Hamas but I'm saying there is a better way of getting the Israeli prisoners safe which is to conclude a deal and the deal would mean release of all Israeli prisoners and release of Palestinian prisoners some of whom have been in Israeli jails for 43 years what and a complete and total ceasefire and end of this war you know how many people the Israeli Army killed up till now 46,000 including for 15,000 children that's why gues the United Nations Secretary General decided to put the Israeli Army on The Blacklist of Those Who Kill children along along with Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas and as I as you would expect Israel Israel has rejected that label let me finish here let me finish why do you keep telling me what Israel says I am not I you don't represent Israel I know what Israel says I don't represent Israel and I don't represent the Palestinians but I was robust with the uh uh the Israeli uh commentator I spoke to an hour ago which you may not have heard this is not about whose side I believe we're trying to interrogate both narratives final question from final question to you to what extent is all of this a faia of Palestinian politicians generally for generations to get a grip of their own situation surely there must be a better way to run Gaza if if Hamas are the best people have to choose from they'll stick with Hamas are they really the best option for the Gaza Strip you know this is an excellent question and my answer to you is that we would have had much better leadership if we were allowed as people to practice our right of democratic elections who stood against our elections in 2021 Israel who did not support our free Democratic elections United States of America why don't the world allow us to elect our leaders freely and democratically as everybody else is allowed to do and as your people are going to do in Britain we need democ Ry we need the right to choose our leaders and Israel and the United States has no right whatsoever to impose on us leaders or collaborators that would sustain the Israeli military occupation of Gaza which should not continue it has to stop the end of occupation is the way to get to peace and democracy and prosperity for everybody that was a Mustafa bouti there speaking to Martin crool uh let me just bring you a line of uh breaking news that we have this is actually coming from the Roy's news agency saying that the um the Hamas armed Wing is uh saying that three Israel hostages were killed including a US citizen during that Israel hostage uh operation that we were talking about earlier in Gaza so that is as I said coming from the Reuters news agency um and in a video posted on uh the um hamas's um telegram channel on Sunday saying that the host were killed um as part of that Israeli military operation in which uh some of those hostages that we were saying the four hostages freed there well uh Yosi bin is a former Israeli Justice Minister and peace negotiator and he initiated the Oslo Peace process and the informal Geneva peace Accord and I spoke to him a little earlier and asked him what impact that that Israeli military operation will have on further negotiations to release more hostages well I I believe that what happened yesterday was of course very important since Hamas doesn't show any Readiness for exchange of the civilian hostages the babies the old the elderly people in their hands with the Palestinian prisoners H but apparently it may it may have an influence on Hamas now if they understand that Israel will not just wait for the answer whether they want such an exchange or not but if they don't answer it will release as as many hostages as it it can and it is not easy and as you said there were civilian casualties on the Palestinian side but if Hamas is actually hiding the hostages in the this civilian homes it cannot complain about Israel trying to to save them the impact may be ER I'm not sure but I hope ER accelerate the the the ER willingness of the parties to negotiate about a deal in this deal all the the hostages should be released and the Palestinian prisoners would release an exchange a big much bigger much higher number than the Israeli hostages but the main question for me the main question is whether we are going now to something like the President Biden plan which was offered already more than a week ago to both sides or are we actually playing games with each other not to be the ones who are rejecting it wholeheartedly but not accepting in and and whatever and if Hamas is planning to remain in Gaza which I believe is bad news for the Free World we we heard that the H master and health Ministry has said that 274 Palestinians were killed in that raid four four hostages released as we know does that seem proportionate action to you it is not a question of proportion Israel is has all the right in the world in my view to release these innocent people these innocent babies and elderly who are in the hands of of Hamas now it it may cost a price and I'm very sad really it is not just a liap service I'm very sad to see a people who are be becoming the on the Palestinian side the victims of such act but they should address Hamas and know that if Hamas is hiding our people in these neighborhoods Israel will not say oh since you did such a a very clever thing and hid them in those neighborhoods we will not try to release our people we should as long as Hamas is not releasing them it is our role not only our right to release as many Israelis as possible yes speaking to me there
