over a thousand people have been killed in this conflict and as the UN secretary uh General there said most of them are women and children will Israel now pause stop and change its rule of Engagement uh every death is a tragedy in fact it's not true by the way that the majority are women and children the majority as far as the figures that we've seen some 80% are actually men of fighting age but obviously every death Every Woman every child every individual who's not a militant it's an absolute tragedy it's really it's a double tragedy we we we we're we're sad because of the loss of life but we're also sad because unfortunately Gaz are in the hold is in the hold of a terrorist organization Hamas which is literally putting these people in the front line but if we look at uh the images that we've been seeing uh of that un's shelter in bitth hananon that was targeted the majority of them were children the fact is if you look at the UN just over the last couple of weeks we've had two cases where the UN has admitted that un School have actually been used as storehouses for missiles for rockets and missiles and when you think about what that means you have a terrorist organization that is placing within schools we've seen houses houses where civilians and children are are booby trapped one of the most fundamental humanitarian principles is let us try and leave civilians out of the equation unfortunately you know when every democracy thinks that the goal of a military is to protect their civilians we have Hamas that thinks that the goal of civilians is to protect their weapons indeed but that particular School the UN has said and ban kimun has just said was full of uh civilians and the IDF were given the coordinates for that particular once again the fact is that particular incident is still under under investigation and the fact is the UN itself is still investigating that incident it's not clear what is clear is that it's made absolutely clear that there were terrorist organizations Hamas firing from the V vicinity of the school so it is absolutely not clear that the casualties tragic casualties were caused by Israel it's worth remembering that some 10% of Hamas missiles never leave the Gaza Strip they actually land on their own population it's an absolutely tragic situation but your strategy it's not working is it when civilians are killed when this number of civilians are killed the strategy isn't working Israel's strategy is not working um the fact is in a situation there is no democracy that has found a Fail Safe Way dealing with brutal terrorist organizations that hide in civilian areas but as we're talking now Israel has managed to uncover some 30 terrorist tunnels that run from the Gaza Strip under Israel in an attempt to blow up or kidnap Israelis and manag to decommission them we estimate that of the 12,000 rockets and missiles that Hamas has in the Gaza Strip many of them long range missiles that have been smuggled in from Iran system though the Iron Dome protects Israeli citizens from these Rockets but the people in Gaza are densely populated area do not have that level of protection the I'm not going to apologize for the fact that more Israelis haven't been killed the fact is 75% of Israel's population some 5 million people have to leave their lives Within Reach of bomb shelters and even Iron Dome doesn't work in every circumstances but as far as the Gaza Strip is concerned when you think about the miles and miles of concrete reinforced tunnels some 20% of the building equipment shipped into Gaza for the purposes of building schools and hospitals why doesn't Hamas allow people to go and protect of children dying homes flattened you pause for a second and think this we we absolutely appalled but we also have to remember that Hamas unfortunately is relying on the World to care about Palestinian civilians more than it does itself we have one side in this equation which is causing a which is committing a double War crime targeting our civilians hiding behind their civilians Israel committing war crimes no absolutely not the if civilians are being killed and the un uh has uh indicated that they're they're concerned that Israel is committing a war crime would you say Israel is then is Israel is engaging in serious attempts serious legal advice working closely with other democracies in how to deal with this but you have to remember that when a terrorist organization hides from behind civilians saying that you have cart blanch saying that you have free range to do anything you like is simply not an option not an option for Israel and not option for same that Israelis are uh you know air strikes against civilians air strikes against I don't think I think the I think more and more and you have to look at public opinion survey in the Gaza Strip to realize how disappointed people are with the Hamas leadership they can't speak publicly because they are under threat of gun they are intimidated but quietly they realize that Hamas has done nothing to increase the prosperity of their now the Palestinian people have nowhere to go and Rockets are being fired on them day and night the fact is we are making it absolutely clear we are taking on additional risk Israeli soldiers we send in ground troops because shooting from the air is more of a risk we give advanced notice of where we are actually going to be attacking to try and enable school is here and the fact if we think about the fact that within the Gaza Strip of 15 to 20,000 Hamas militants with 12,000 missiles in that situation to try and limit the amount of damage the damage that we've done shows that we've been taking extraordinary care in extremely difficult circumstances uh Ambassador we'll just uh keep you there for a second because I'd like to bring in Mustafa bouti who's a member of the Palestinian legislative Council and head of the Palestinian national initiative he joins me now from rala we've been speaking to uh amb TP here and he is saying that thousands of rockets are are being fired on Israeli civilians so what will it take for Hamas to stop these Rockets yeah thousands of rockets and nobody is killed it's a a simple psychological warfare that I I I don't want to see but in reality Israel is not just not a democracy as he claims but Israel is behaving like a fascist country when when they don't recognize the fact that they are killing children and women and continue the propaganda of Defending such unacceptable behavior and when the racism in Israel and among Israeli leadership reaches a point where a member of keset elite shaid stands in the Israeli Parliament and says we should kill all Palestinian women so that they would not give birth to Palestinian children who are snakes this particular Behavior this is a language the SE when there is a call for a ceasefire Hamas continues to fire these Rockets no let me cl explain and I am aware of all the positions and I've been talking to them this morning Hamas and all Palestinian groups are unified in accepting and demanding ceasefire immediately because we want this horrible attack on our people in Gaza to stop we want this attack that has killed so far 1,34 people mainly 90% of them are civilians and the fact that person is a civilian but in in at an age that makes at an age where he can be in an army does not justify killing him he's a civilian we are talking about 6,000 people injured what will it take for the Palestinians the Palestinian leadership to come to the negotiating table so that their people do not continue to experience this level of Bloodshed what we need is Israel's acceptance of two things first of all to stop immediately their operation in Gaza to stop the attack on Gaza to stop the aggression on Gaza and to accept to lift The Siege on the people of Gaza because The Siege on Gaza is causing the worst humanitarian crisis ever it has been responsible for the fact that the poverty level is so high it has it has been responsible for the fact that 90% of the people cannot have drinkable water according to International standard it is responsible for the fact that H there is a big seage problem in Gaza it is responsible for the fact that fishermen cannot fish in the sea and the tunnels the tunnels were an act of self-defense they can all be abolished tomorrow if Israel stops these acts and let's remember that this is not just about Gaza Gaza is only a small tiny problem everything started with the West Bank because the whole aggression started by Israel was started in the West Bank when 27 Palestinians were killed while they were peacefully demonstrating when Israel conducted an act of collective punishment arresting no less than 1,000 people including our members of parliament and the cause of everything is the occupation there has been an occupation that has been there for 47 years and has transformed into a system of aparti and segregation Mr isra does not want to stop occupation that'ss has said that uh uh the people of Palestine are very disappointed in Hamas and the Palestinian leadership are you letting your people down by by not coming and having serious discussions with the Israelis on the contrary people are disappointed with Israel not with Hamas or any other Palestinian political faction in reality president Abbas has been conducting negotiations with Israel for 21 years all he got is more expansion of settlements all he got is a system of enslavement of our people well he obviously has isra was the one that broke Israel was the one that broke negotiations that were conducted by Mr Kerry so Israel Netanyahu is saying the following he does not want two State solution he does not want one state solution so what does he want a system of enslavement a system of Oppression a system of aparti we will never ever accept This Ti fat continue if Hamas doesn't stop the Rockets uh Israel will continue with with its air strikes no no Hamas is ready to stop all the Rockets actually as I said these Rockets did not did not kill really people most of the people people who were killed on the Israeli side and I don't want anybody to be killed but out of the 44 people killed 42 Were Soldiers invading Gaza Soldiers the the those who are killed are women and children if the Iron Dome wasn't there then more Israelis would get killed well luckily they were not and we don't want them to die but on the other hand when I see an ambassador of a country that claims to be a democracy who doesn't care about the fact that 1,33 people people have been killed mostly children and women and civilians when I see a man who doesn't care about the fact that 30 families were completely eliminated including the father the mother the grandfather the grandsons the children they were all eliminated when I see a man who doesn't care about the fact that 6,000 people are injured and he thinks that we are subhuman beings then this is unacceptable the fact is that Israeli propaganda is trying to dehumanize Palestinians to justify an OP that is unacceptable I'll just bring in uh Ambassador t uh as a WR of reply um it's absolutely shocking to hear somebody representing an organization that has deliberately put men women and children In Harm's Way to protect its terrorist leaders who are hidden in the basement of hospitals the fact is if Hamas was to stop firing we don't want a screaming match here but Mr bouti has said but don't mislead the public you know me very well and you can't CL fact five times over the last few weeks has accepted ceasefires including the Egyptian proposal supported by the Arab the United during those humanarian windows we've seen Hamas continuing to fire rockets and celebrate the death of Israeli civilians which of course is something that no Israeli would ever do this is not true because those who are dying are Palestinian civilians not Israeli civilians and you cannot mislead the world anymore the world already knows the facts and the reality you cannot continue to mislead the world about the fact that you are occupying another people and oppressing them and this cannot continue we need our freedom and we are entitled to it
