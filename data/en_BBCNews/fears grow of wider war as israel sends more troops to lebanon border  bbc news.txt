Israel's defense minister says the country is opening a new phase in the war and the center of gravity is Shifting to the north his warning came hours after a second wave of blasts swept across Lebanon exploding walkie-talkies left at least 20 dead and more than 450 injured yesterday hundreds maybe thousands of electronic Pages used by the armed group Hezbollah detonated simultaneously killing at least 12 and leaving more than 3,000 in hospital tonight our security correspondent Gordon Carrera looks at this new form of technological Warfare I'll be talking to our International editor Jeremy Bowen amid grave fears this is about to escalate across the Middle East today a division of the Israeli Army has relocated from Gaza to the North of Israel reinforcing troops there well let's go straight to Beirut now our senior International correspondent Ola garan is there Ola so Sophie tonight we are in New Territory this is a new phase of the war Israel says so Hezbollah which is last as a terrorist organization by the UK and the US is also saying the same here on the streets today in Beirut in the Hezbollah stronghold of dahia we saw fear and chaos and panic when reports started coming in of a second wave of explosions casualties were being rushed away for treatment one young member of Hezbollah said this is is a terrible time for us we have never seen anything like it we are encouraging our supporters to get off the streets to go home to try to stay safe now in the past 24 hours hezbollah's communication networks have been Shattered by Israel but it would be a mistake to say that the organization is defeated far from it it's promising revenge and we expect to hear more about that tomorrow in a speech by its leader Hassan Nala Hezbollah coming to bury its dead in South Beirut today casualties of a new chapter in Middle East Warfare killed not by air strikes but by exploding pagers apparently a message from mosad among the dead an 11-year-old boy but even the mourners weren't safe suddenly the sound of another blast chaos and panic filling the street and a rush to evacuate one of the Wounded the authorities say this time walkie-talkies exploded not just in Beirut here at a cell phone shop in the southern city of sidon Israel is being blamed for the past 24 hours of unpr precedented attacks well one more ambulance there passing by we've been seeing them in the last half an hour or so also fire brigade trucks people have been looking at the sky worried there are drones they're beginning to leave the area to get off the streets the attacks began yesterday afternoon with explosion ions in food markets in homes in restaurants soon casualties were streaming to hospitals almost 3,000 wounded in an hour doctors say many lost fingers and many were blinded it has been a nightmare probably this is the worst day of my life as a physician unfortunately we were not able to save a lot of eyes um I can tell you that probably more than 60 to 70% of the patients and ended up with with eviscerating or removing at least one of their eyes and we're talking about young population about patients in their 20s from Israel no admission of responsibility but the defense minister yav Galant says a new phase of the war is starting Hezbollah which is Iranian backed has been Waging War with Israel since last October the two sides trade in fire across their shared border over the past 24 hours Hezbollah has been shaken and humiliated but it's still better armed than many nations Israel too has plenty of Firepower and today released this footage of its troops training near the Lebanese border A source told the BBC that a second division of the army has moved to the area there are growing fears of allout war orar and BBC News Beirut well these ongoing attacks have stunned people in Lebanon and caused widespread fear our security correspondent Gordon Carrera has been looking at this new form of technological Warfare and he's with me now nor Gordon these have been extraordinary attacks taking Communications devices people carry around and turning them into weapons to be used against them today handheld radios walkie-talkies were exploding suddenly in Lebanon this was what was left of one of them it follows yesterday afternoon when thousands were injured by small explosions in people's hands and Pockets this was the culprit a pager which can receive text messages pages and walkie-talkies are Old School Technology but something Hezbollah turned to recently because it feared its mobile phones could be tracked this map details the location of injuries sustained in yesterday's attack the vast majority in the capital Beirut but how was it done today Washington said it didn't know uh the United States uh did not know about uh nor was it involved in uh these incidents and we're still Gathering uh the information and Gathering the facts so what do we know if we look at the debris of this pager you can see part of a brand name here it's gold Apollo now now that's a company based all the way over here in Taiwan the owners today said they'd not made the pages involved though instead they had licens making them to another company called BAC Consulting now BAC Consulting is based in The Bu Budapest the capital of Hungary and the BBC's Nick Thorp went to visit today this is the registered address of BAC Consulting here in Budapest and in fact there's very little sign that they're based here at all just a a piece of paper with their name alongside 12 other company names behind the geraniums very few people have been coming in and out of this building all day no one seems to know anything about this company at all so this is debris left from a pager after it exploded so Israel looks to have intercepted the supply this year of thousands of pages to Hezbollah and here tiny mounts of high explosive inside a signal was then sent which meant 5 seconds after a pag of buzzed to say there was a message it blew up something similar may have happened with the radios today supposedly Japanese made they also arrived a few months ago but why now one theory is that Israel's spy agency Mossad had put in place the capability to be used in the event of an allout conflict in neighboring Lebanon but has B became suspicious about the pages and so mosad decided it was a case of use it or lose it triggering first the pages and then today the radios if that's right then it's not quite clear whether there is a wider plan behind launching the attack it has sewn confusion and fear and inflicted many injuries but it may also spark a response Sophie Gordon thank you well our International editor Jeremy Bowen is with me now it's almost exactly a year since the October the 7th attacks how dangerous a moment is this for the Middle East I'd say really dangerous as dangerous as any in the last Almost 12 months since those Hamas attacks which by the way this last year has been the most dangerous year since 1948 when Israel fought and won for its independence um why is it so dangerous right now well that's because at the moment there seems to be no possibility of diplomacy getting through and D escalating the situation that's because it depends on a ceasefire in Gaza and that isn't happening either now while Israel has scored a really significant tactical Victory here uh there is a potential longer term serious strategic downside because Israel has humiliated its enemy in Lebanon there's no no question about that but it doesn't get Israel closer to its strategic aims the things it wants to do that is to stop the rocket fire over the border into Israel 60,000 plus people have been evacuated for almost a year from their homes as a result of that they want to go home and they want to push ESB as well back away from the border I do not see how these attacks get Israel closer to that now Israel of course defends itself self-defense against a a terrorist organization is what it would say uh but there are plenty of people criticizing Israel as well for using Force somewhat indiscriminately as well as hitting military targets those Hezbollah Fighters also hitting members of their family Killing Children Killing bystanders in markets uh so Israel under pressure with that and one more thing as well uh the UN General Assembly is sitting at the moment in New York and there was a big vote today uh and by a vote of 123 to4 with 43 abstentions uh the general assembly supported a Palestinian resolution saying that Israel must end its unlawful presence in the occupied territories within a year it's non-binding but it shows just how isolated the Israelis are
