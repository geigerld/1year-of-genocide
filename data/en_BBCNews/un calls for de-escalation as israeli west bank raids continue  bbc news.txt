hello I'm Gea gorami thanks for joining us we're returning to our top story in the Middle East where a large scale Israeli military operation in the occupied West Bank is continuing into the second day Israel says five Palestinian Fighters were killed whilst hiding in a mosque in the city of taram according to Palestinian sources the death tollar has now risen to 17 people since Israeli military operations began the BBC has not been able to verify those figures earlier the UN Secretary General called on Israel to Halt its major military op ation in the north of the territory immediately well I'm joined by our Middle East correspondent John donison who is in Janine John just bring us up to date with what's going on where you are well here in Janine eight Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since yesterday uh one person today and we just actually saw an Israeli uh military bulldo ahead towards the refugee camp which sits behind me in uh need so this operation is ongoing a lot of the focus is in taram as you say which is a Palestinian City to the west of here just driving into Janine this morning all but one road uh was closed blocked off by the Israeli Army and we were told and warned by uh Palestinian taxi drivers that their cars were being shot at uh by Israeli soldiers Israel for its part of course says it's carrying out a counterterrorism operation and is trying to protect its citizens and what is the the response of the people that you might have spoken to and how are things likely to unfold in the next few days have we got had any guidance from the Israeli military well in terms of what people are saying to us here we were just basically asking people on the way into Janine whether it was safe uh to go in and people are obviously worried normally this is a vibrant bustling busy uh City and today it is absolutely deserted all the businesses virtually are shuted up and no one is out on the streets everyone is in their homes as for how long it's going to go on uh well we don't really know Israel uh says as I say that uh they are determined to tackle uh militant groups here in the northern West Bank they say that they have been stockpiling weapons is alleges that those weapons are being funded by Iran and certainly when I was in taram late last year you do see people uh militants with very very uh sophisticated weapons which cost a lot of money on the black market now people tell you that many of those weapons are actually being smuggled in by criminal gangs from Israel although some smaller weapons are coming in uh from Jordan and John um have the Israelis given any further information or is it known on the ground about which militant groups are operating [Music] there well the one they uh are sort of making uh the most announcements about is a senior commander in nor shamps the refugee camp uh in taram he is affiliated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad and they say he was killed uh yesterday uh in a Israeli operation there we have had a statement from hamas's military Wing which came late yesterday saying six of its members have been killed but we are also aware from doctors at the hospitals in this part of the West Bank that a number of civilians have also uh been killed too John donison thank you very much there live in Janine for us well a little earlier I spoke to Aisha Mansour the West Bank director for medical aid for Palestinians and she told me about her work and what she has seen on the ground thank you for having me um our work focuses on supporting the healthcare system and part of it is also supporting the emergency response uh since yesterday we're seeing the largest Invasion by the Israeli military into the West Bank since the second and since 2002 we woke up yesterday morning to news that the Israeli forces have invaded the towns of Janine tulam uh and Tas as well as nabas later cutting off the North and limiting access to the north um with you know major major uh attacks going on in those towns and what does that mean what does that mean for the people that you are working with yes I mean today the news is that there have been 18 people uh killed um with with our partners our partners are reporting that um accessing Healthcare and accessing the injured have been very difficult uh during this Invasion the paramedics prcs Palestine red crescent Society has reported that their teams are having difficulty being able to access patients and injured in order to for them to provide the health care needed and and take them to the hospitals that are needed we're also um hearing from our partners that hospitals are being blocked and um anybody coming into a hospital or leaving a hospital is being checked um ID checked by the Israeli military and uh in in terms of uh how many of your staff were able to move around and how they are affected too can you give us a sense of of you know how big your charity is without obviously giving away any difficult details yes um most our team members are based here in ralo where I'm based and actually yesterday on the day of the um Invasion our team members were supposed to go up to Janine um to meet with some of our partners including the Palestine red crescent Society Unfortunately they weren't able to go because of the invasion so so these kinds of regular invasions that have been occurring um since 2023 but more even more frequently since um the war on Gaza from starting last October uh these invasions have really limited the ability for our team to travel and access um those areas to to follow up with our partners it's also limited the work of our partners our partners are are having more and more difficulty uh accessing the healthc care facilities accessing the patients and really uh under International humanitarian law um healthcare workers should be able to to do their work they should be able to access patients patients should be able to access the healthcare services they need they need and they should be able to do all of that safely without being attacked uh who reported that since October last October there have been over 500 attacks on Health Care personnel and Facilities this is against International humanitarian law obviously the the Israelis um might push back on the term Invasion and they said that they are targeting um militants you know terrorists as they put it um in terms of the the risk to civilians for any military operation can you give us a sense of of what life is like in terms of where people live how densely packed people are yes well um based on the reports we're receiving from our partners uh people are unable to leave their homes I mean they're they're basically stranded in their homes uh while all of this is happening um while this is happening the Israeli forces are Destro destructing the infrastructure so the water system is destroyed electricity isn't infected communication lines are are impacted so people are stranded in their homes without electricity without water without being able to go out um in fear of the snipers and uh one of our partners reported that some people in t Kim tried to leave their homes and were shot out and they immediately returned to their homes uh about a month ago just to give you an example about a month ago we visited and I along with my team we visited tulam Camp to visit one of our partners and on the way to the camp we saw the destruction that had happened from a previous incursion Israeli incursion I mean the whole side of the road one side was uh was fixed and we were able to drive despite it being a a dirt road still not paved but the other side of the road was extremely um dug deep in very deep down people living on that side of the road would not be able to leave their homes because the road is I don't know how many meters down from you know from the from where their homes are so this is the situation Aisha Manu West Bank director for medical aid for Palestinians speaking to me earlier
