there is growing concern about the dire state of hospitals in Gaza this map shows hospitals in the Gaza Strip the UN says 20 out of 36 are no longer working the biggest alifer is not functioning at all according to the World Health Organization Al sher's head of surgery has told the BBC that a third premature newborn baby has died because of a lack of power there are reports that gaza's second biggest Hospital Al cuds has run out of fuel it's now five weeks since Hamas designated a terror organization by the UK government killed more than 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 200 hostage since then Hamas officials say well over 11,000 people have been killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza well let's go live to Jerusalem now and speak to our correspondent Tom baitman good morning Tom another week be begins just talk us through what's been happening overnight well what we have is this really desperate situation at as shifer Hospital you were hearing about the World Health Organization talking about a perilous and dire situation and that is because of the fact that around the hospital now now there is very Fierce fighting they're talking about intense bombardment and armed clashes and So within the hospital on top of what has been you know a very very uh an extremely difficult humanitarian situation for weeks now it is effectively completely closed apart from what the Israelis say are safe evacu evacuation rootes out now Palestinians say that it is simply not safe there are dead bodies lining the route that people have been shot at uh and people killed when they um have tried to leave so it's extremely perilous and in the middle of all this this huge crisis with 36 now premature babies taken out of the Intensive neonatal intensive care unit because it stopped functioning because of the loss of power uh now being kept in a uh cardiac surgery room without the right equipment they're not in incubators they can't be kept properly warm they have Desperate needs and the doctor there Dr Maran abusada telling the BBC that he fears those babies will die unless either the hospital gets fuel to power incubators or there is a safe uh evacuation for those babies but it takes very specialized Medical equipment to do that okay hence the call on the on the part of the who for action on this in the meantime there's been conflicting reports coming through overnight uh about the hostages uh prime minister uh Benjamin netan who is speaking to the US Network NBC saying that a deal is is possible could come about and yet we're getting reports from Reuters via Reuters Hamas saying no they've stopped talking because of the attacks on Al shifer well first of all when it comes to the hostages we have had for weeks speculation uh the sense that perhaps a deal uh to release a large number of hostages in exchange for a ceasefire and possibly also the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel those kinds of uh discussions have been going on for a long time and at various points um people have said uh including leading officials that something could be close and then hasn't come to fruition so it's hard to read too much into either what Benjamin Netanyahu is saying or the um these denials by um Hamas I mean my sense talking to somebody uh over the last week who's familiar with the negotiations is that you know the process is very intense it is certainly happening um the one of the big problems is actually around communication because you have katar uh which hosts the political offices of Hamas acting as mediators um but certainly the isi media it's being suggested it can take anything up to 2 days for messages from the Israelis and responses to come back from um Hamas so it's clearly very very difficult but it seems that that possibility does remain on the horizon of a possible uh release and potentially um a large number but beyond knowing that the discussions it seems have been continuing up until this point I don't think we can speculate much more okay thank you for now Tom bitman in Jerusalem for us well now let's bring you a special report from our International editor Jeremy Bowen who assesses what could happen next in Gaza and in Israel the beds were full when mosab soier was brought in wounded gaza's Medics have to improvise and a photo of premature babies at chifa the main hospital in Gaza swaddled to stay alive after their incubators stopped working when the power ran out all born in the cruelty of War war in the other Hamas Israel Wars it would be time for a ceasefire by now and back to the same uneasy status quo until the next explosion news teams can't cross into Gaza so they come to stot the nearest Israeli town to look in perhaps the biggest question is what happens in Gaza the day after who's going to be in charge Israeli occupi an international Force Palestinians if so which Palestinians This Time It's Different the cost in lives from the Hamas attacks to Israel's response has thrust the conflict into unknown territory with Israel on the attack prime minister Netanyahu rejected America's day after plan the US wants the Palestinian Authority Rivals to Hamas to run Gaza after the fighting and then a Palestinian State alongside Israel Netanyahu opposes Palestinian Independence and wants Israel to control security Danny atom once the Israeli spy Chief said that's why the Prime Minister snubbed Israel's most important Ally Israel should not stay too long in the Gaza Street one secondly it will not be able to leave the Gaza Strip unless all the abduct are in our hands back in a peaceful situation and we won we succeed Hamas we won the war against Kamas now there is a need to Define what does it mean exactly to to to win I Define it as the collapse of Hamas as a body as organization ER losing its ER a chain of command Israelis are united behind their army but not their prime minister these demonstrators outside his office in Jerusalem believe he is pandering to the Hardline Jewish nationalists who keep him in power another big question for Israelis is the future of their prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu he was a divisive figure before the 7th of October and since then a lot of Israelis have started to blame him for for the security and intelligence and Military errors that allowed Hamas to attack with such devastating consequences there's anger that after Hamas killed and abducted so many mostly Israeli civilians military and intelligence Chiefs accepted their share of the blame and the Prime Minister did not and pressure is growing for a ceasefire in exchange for hostages what is fighting Hamas okay of course the the the Hamas needs to be taken down okay but the question of how to do it is also a significant question and before I want to kill one single terrorist I want each and every one of these people home I want the 10-month-old baby home I want that the 86-year-old home I want that more than I want dead terrorists once they're home we can finish the job the pain and hatred Unleashed since the 7th of October might overwhelm all those who still believe in peace not permanent War almost every day in the West Bank they bury more Palestinians killed in Israeli raids this side of the occupied Palestinian territories is becoming the war's next Battleground the only answer Western leaders say is to revive the two-state solution independent Palestine alongside Israel a failed idea that survives only as a slogan Sab sidam an adviser to the Palestinian president has heard it all before I think it's empty it's meaningless if it continues to be this way if you want to do things don't just walk uh don't just talk just you need to walk the talk and you need to implement things if we continue with this uh slogan earing without any results whatsoever we're getting nowhere when this war started Joe Biden warned Israel not to be blinded by r as America was after the 9/11 attacks by alqaeda now Israel's tactics are alarming the Americans they reiterate support for Israel but say too many Palestinians have been killed by the war machine they helped Israel build inside Gaza Israeli military sensors say we can't show the faces of soldiers we filmed senior Western diplomats firm Israeli allies told the BBC that ending the war and dealing with the aftermath will be difficult and messy the wall between Jerusalem and the West Bank is a monument to the death of the last peace process so what do we know well events since the attacks of October the 7th have shown that this conflict is not something that Israel can manage and the rest of the world can ignore there's also the history of a century of conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of this land and that shows that there's no military solution so if the current Bloodshed doesn't lead to a new and serious attempt to make peace then there'll be more Wars for more Generations but War hardens hearts in Gaza today in a brief pause thousands more Palestinians fled the Israeli offensive jery bow BBC News Jerusalem
