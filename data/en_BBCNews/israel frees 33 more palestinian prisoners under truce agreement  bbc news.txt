and a temporary ceasefire in Gaza has been extended for another two days as more hostages were released last night American officials say a further 20 Israelis are expected to be released as part of the continued truce with Hamas designated as a terrorist group in the UK with the latest here's our Middle East correspondent Hugo Bea the flight back to Freedom 11 hostages returned to Israel last night after more than 50 days in Hamas capital ity they included the three-year-old twins Emma and Uli they were captured with other relatives when Hamas set fire to their home they were freed with their mother shut on but their father is believed to remain in Gaza also released were brother and sister Ares and Sahar Calderon their relatives spoke about his relief as he waited to see them again I'm finding that it's difficult to go from a state of endless anxiety about their fate to to a state of relief and joy I believe it will take time this is an exciting and heart feeling moment but we also understand that is the beginning of a difficult Rehabilitation process for S and Aras who are still young and have been through an unbearable experience the choose between Israel and Hamas allow the return of dozens of hostages but dozens more are still in captivity over 150 of our hostages men women children babies who's taking care of them who is holding a 10 months old baby kir bivas I'll tell you ruthless terrorists are holding him hostage in Gaza we call on the international organization especially the Red Cross to use every tool at their disposal to gain access to our hostages to make sure they're receiving the medical care they need in return 33 Palestinians were released from Israeli jails this is the moment 17-year-old Muhammad Abul alus reunited with his family in East Jerusalem a two-day extension to the temporary ceasefire has been announced by Kat the US says Hamas has committed to releasing another 20 hostages women and children in Gaza the truce has allowed much needed Aid to be delivered as a humanitarian crisis continues Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war against Hamas isn't over this is likely to bring even more suffering for Palestinians in Gaza Hugo basa BBC News Jerusalem wel you speak life to Hugo now on breakfast and Hugo so a two-day extension to this truth now but what else has to happen for that to be extended further yeah John that's a very good question and I think the Biden Administration that has been heavily involved in these negotiations uh they uh want this deal to be extended again because they say that they want to see everybody released we're talking about 170 hostages around 170 people who remain in captivity in Gaza and I think Hamas is saying that they're not holding all those people so this could be uh an obstacle in in guaranteeing the release of all these captives and the youngest hostage is a 10mon old baby so uh today uh we're expecting to see 10 hostages being released uh overnight the office of the Israeli Prime Minister confirmed that they had received a list uh with the names of those people expected to be released later today and for every Israeli hostage freed three pois are going to be released from Israeli jails now obviously the extension of this truth means that more Aid is getting into Gaza uh the UN Chief Antonio garish welcomed uh this announcement yesterday he described it as a glimmer of hope and Humanity but he also said he wasn't enough okay for now Hugo thank you very much
