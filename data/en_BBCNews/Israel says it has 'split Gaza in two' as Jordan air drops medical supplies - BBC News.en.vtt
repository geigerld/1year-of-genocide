00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
that uh a single incident could uh spark
 

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.749 align:start position:0%
that uh a single incident could uh spark
a<00:07:12.840><c> much</c><00:07:13.039><c> more</c><00:07:13.319><c> violent</c><00:07:13.840><c> confrontation</c><00:07:14.599><c> here</c>

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:14.759 align:start position:0%
a much more violent confrontation here
 

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:17.189 align:start position:0%
