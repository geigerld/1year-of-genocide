Middle East next and the Israeli Army says five of its soldiers were killed when they were mistakenly fired on by one of its tanks in Northern Gaza two shells were fired at paratroopers in jabalia these images show the aftermath of an Israeli strike in jabalia Israeli ground forces re-entered the area earlier this month with more his our correspondent Dan Johnson in Jerusalem we know that five soldiers from the IDF lost their lives yesterday in the north of Gaza this is in jabalia an area that the Israeli military has had to return to having previously declared it cleared of Hamas Fighters earlier in this conflict around January they completed military operations in that area but have had to go back there in the last few days and that's raised a question over the sustainability of Israel's military strategy here whether they are actually able to sustainably clear out Hamas for good and that is something that is now playing out at the top of Israeli government we have the defense minister yav Galant challenging the prime minister to set out a clear plan for how Gaza will be governed once the military operation is over and if I show you the front pages of some of the Israeli press this morning you've got yav Galant and prime minister Netanyahu there the headline says this is no way to run a war and on this paper you've got a headline saying that a military government in Gaza would mean only blood and sacrifices without purpose you've got the Jerusalem Post there saying Galant slam Netanyahu indecisiveness on Gaza and the defense minister said he'd been asking for these assurances repeatedly since October but the Prime Minister had not been able to lay out any clear plan of how the Palestinian people in Gaza would be governed after the military operation concludes there are questions about who will represent them how will they rebuild their infrastructure what will the role of the Israelis other nations and international organizations be prime minister netanyahu's response to that challenge yesterday was just to say say that his priority right now is to eradicate Hamas and that he would not consider any sort of Deal or power sharing arrangement with the Palestinian Authority who he considered to be supportive of terrorism so that question remains open in the meantime there is this division at the top of Israeli politics which has now led to some in the government calling for the defense minister yab Galant to be sacked from his role yeah interestingly there another member of the war cabinet Benny Gant in support of what Mr glamp said yes there has been support he's been defended by Benny gance others calling for him to go saying that the defense minister failed on October the 7th that he' continued to fail and that he should now be removed from his position so the focus now is on how Benjamin Netanyahu responds to that will he keep Mr Galant in his position he tried to sack him a year ago before the October the 7th attacks and there were Mass Street protests that erupted then that meant uh Mr Galant was able to stay in his role there's a suggestion here that his position in calling for a clear plan is puts him in closer alignment with what the Americans want to see and everyone seems to accept that once the military operation is over Benjamin netanyahu's future doesn't look like it can continue at the top of Israeli politics so perhaps this is Mr Gant positioning himself with the Americans as a future Prime Minister not just to conclude the war but then to lay out a future for Gaza Dan Johnson reporting from Jerusalem
