let's um take you to the Middle East now as the Hamas senior figure the group's political leader Ismael hania will be buried in Qatar we can take you to uh these live images that we're getting um from Doha uh the burial is expected to take place um he he hania was uh killed um after attending the inauguration of Iran's new president in tran um he' he'd actually been living in in Doha though with other members of the Hamas political office and he'll be uh buried in a cemetery in lucil north of Doha um after prayers in that mosque which I assume is the Aman Muhammad bin Abdul wahab mosque which is the largest mosque uh in the country we saw in pictures yesterday that thousands turned out for the funeral procession in Iran um with Iran supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Ki leave leading those prayers for the Hamas leader um it's Israel has not commented on that strike uh which which killed uh hania um but we heard um Benjamin Netanyahu uh Israel's prime minister of course saying his country had delivered uh crushing blows to its enemies in recent days uh Hamas has uh said that the death of hania will have major repercussions on that let's bring in our uh Middle East correspondent yolan Nell who's in Jerusalem so yoland as we're looking at those pictures uh from uh katar that we're getting coming in live tell us more about what we are hearing about those potential repercussions well certainly Israel remains on a very high state of alert uh security wise um that killing of Isel hania came on the back of the assassination of a Hezbollah Commander um which Israel says um was carried out um in response to his uh the Hezbollah uh killing of uh 12 children in a rocket strike in the occupied Golan Heights last weekend um and the expectation uh really is that um you know both strikes were really involving figures who were too senior they cannot be ignored they also real security breaches as far as hasbalah is concerned with this Commander uh being killed in its stronghold in the south of Beirut and also um is hania although Israel says it was not responsible it's widely blamed um for his assassination and he was killed in tan inside an accommodation block that really belongs to the Islamic revolutionary guards there um so there is an expectation of a real response we had last night a speech by the Hezbollah leader Hassan n that was closely listened to here he talked about how the killing of its Commander meant a new phase in the conflict with Israel and he said too that there would be very well studied retaliation he also referred uh to Iran of course Iran is a key back of Hezbollah also uh supports Hamas and said that Hamas uh that rather Iran could not remain silent um with the killing of that Hamas leader on its soil um so I mean what we've seen going into both uh the main Israeli and Lebanese airports a number of flights being uh cancelled or delayed uh we know that uh we had the uh Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaking last night to uh the US president to Joe Biden the White House said that they discussed US military deployments to support Israel against missiles and drone strikes but we also had Joe Biden talking to reporters afterwards and when he was asked about the a killing of is hania and what it meant for a ceasefire and hostage release deal he said that it was not helpful we we seeing more detail too about actually how uh isma hania was killed what what do you think that tells us about Israel's um if if it was indeed Israel Israel's capabilities I mean the indications according to reports um after there were initial reports that this was some kind of of an air strike perhaps even one uh involving a rocket launch nearby that the latest reports um including in the New York Times quoting well-placed security officials um including in Iran uh speaking Anon anonymously suggest that actually a bomb had been planted in that accommodation which appears to have been used routinely by is Han on his trips um to Teran um and that is what killed him and his bodyguard it seems to have been a very precise attack because we know that uh others including um other leaders of armed groups from around the region were staying very close by uh and they were not affected by this um the Iranians haven't said much officially about what exactly happened here um but this does suggest a very precise uh intelligence operation uh and that could be another reason why uh Israel has not commented here um it did say that it had not carried out through the military spokesman any um additional air strikes Beyond those which it had had already taken responsibility for in the region in recent days y LEL in Jerusalem for now thank you very much
