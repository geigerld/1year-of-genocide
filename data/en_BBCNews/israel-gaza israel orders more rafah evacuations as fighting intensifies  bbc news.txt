the Israeli military says about 300,000 Palestinians have left the city of Rafa since Monday when Israel told them to move to a nearby District of Gaza the Israelis have declared a narrow Coastal strip at alasi to be a safe humanitarian Zone but the UN says it has no running water or proper sanitation Israel is planning an assault on Hamas fighters in Rafa and has ordered tens of thousands more residents from Eastern districts of the city to leave evacuation orders have also been issued for thousands of people in parts of Northern Gaza last night a long awaited US Government report criticized Israel's use of American supplied weapons in the Gaza War saying it's reasonable to assess they have been used in breach of international humanitarian law in some instances this reports from our Middle East correspondent your land now now a ghost Town parts of Rafa that were crammed full of people just days ago are rapidly emptying out Palestinians fleeing in their thousands as Israel signals it's now set to push in further from the East issuing new evacuation orders there's no choice we have to go to the coast like everyone else Ahmed says Israeli air strikes and artillery shelling have caused panic and Palestinian casualties Israel says it's taking action against Hamas in one of its last strongholds here attacking a launch site for Rockets fired at an Israeli city but with Israel's capture of one main border crossing and another blocked off by fighting this is the fifth day with no Aid getting into Southern Gaza there are severe shortages of food clean water and fuel deepening the humanitarian crisis so far Israel's military is describing its offensive in Rafa as limited but the world is watching to see if this turns into the full scale Invasion that the country's allies have warned against and as Israeli tanks and troops await orders near the Gaza border there's been another strong statement from Washington it says that with some of its strikes on Gaza such as this attack on a residential building late last year reportedly killing over 100 people many of them children in Israel may have used American supplied weapons in breach of international law Israel has consistently denied any violations and yet the new report May yet have an impact on plans back here in Rafa where there's already a growing sense of emergency yoland Nell BBC News Jerusalem and your land yoland joins me live now from Jerusalem your land what more can you tell us are there any fresh updates as evening approaches in Gaza well we've had the Israeli military talking about how its forces have been involved they say in face-to-face combat in the areas around Rafa saying too that there were four Rockets fired towards the Kem Shalom Crossing in the Southeastern corner of the Gaza Strip uh where AID has been unable to get through um for the past few days and we've had the Israeli military too saying that across the whole of the Gaza Strip and the past day it has carried out dozens of strikes um these have not just been in Rafa but also in the center of the Gaza Strip where funeral has been taking place for some 25 people who were killed in an air strike overnight Palestinian Health officials saying that at least 37 people were killed in the latest uh air strikes um we know too that the Israeli military has been issuing evacuation orders for tens of thousands of people in other parts of the Gaza Strip in the north uh particularly in the area of jabalia and that's significant because this is an area that Israeli forces previously withdrew from now this could be a sign that Palestinian armed groups are moving back and that they're planning to return there they're planning to return there yes what more could we expect from the Israeli military because obviously we saw earlier in the week when it issued some orders for people in eastern Gaza it then sent ground troops into those areas um what can we expect to happen I mean I mean the US assessment a couple of days ago was that what was happening in Rafa remained um a limited um more precise operation not the fullscale ground Invasion which there's been uh so much concern about even we can see though at the moment it's still causing this new humanitarian crisis in the south of the Gaza Strip what is happening at the moment um but really you know all eyes are are on the borders to see if there are going to be more forces uh Crossing in if this is going to be a complete ground invasion of Rafa um you know previously we've had Israeli leaders saying that this is something that needs to happen in order for Israel to be able to declare a full Victory um over Hamas in this war and to try to bring home Israeli hostages and uh and your land of course all eyes are on the alasi area where now nearly 300,000 people I believe to have moved to what kind of a humanitarian situation is there of course since the War Began there have been serious concerns about the provision of basic services on that part of the Gaza [Music] Strip yes the Israeli military calls this a safe Zone says it's recently uh been expanded but you know un agencies say really it's anything but uh people there have not been protected from the fighting and because you know humanitarian supplies are so restricted anyway um they have not got uh in that location these Sandy Junes uh really close to the the beach um o of the Gaza Strip um proper uh sanitation proper Water Supplies still the same severe shortages that we're now seeing across Southern Gaza it remains an extremely desperate situation thank you very much that's your land now there in Jerusalem for us
