and that is gaza's Civil Defense Agency saying that about 100 people have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a school on Gaza City well we can go straight over to our correspondent Jenny Hill who's in Tel Aviv Jenny good to have you with us just bring us up to date with the latest yeah this is being described as a horrific Massacre by gaza's defense um agency Civil Defense Agency which is run by Hamas they say that three Israeli Rockets struck the school in the darj district of Gaza City this morning they say that the school was being used as a shelter for displaced people and there are suggestions that those people may have been at morning prayer when the attack happened it is then reported that a fire broke out following the strike with emergency workers uh scrambling to rescue people from inside the building now the Israeli military has confirmed the strike but they say that the school was housing a Hamas command center it's the second strike on a gazan school in as many days and in fact Israel has repeatedly struck schools in Gaza in the last week or two each time the military insists that they are in effect pursuing legitimate targets that the schools are housing Hamas bases they also insist that through the use of precision missiles and intelligence they are doing their best to mitigate the loss of civilian life our correspondent there Jenny Hill in Tel Aviv Jenny thanks for bringing us the latest and I am joined in the studio now by Muhammad Taha from BBC Arabic who's also been following the very latest uh Muhammad we've seen some really devastating scenes this morning many too graphic too horrific for us to be able to broadcast fully but just tell us more about what you've been seeing there and apparently the velocity of the these smart missiles that Israel used is causing the bodies to be uh to be uh cut and the bodies to be un un identified uh actually we saw uh different shelling in Gaza so we saw this shelling with heavy bombs that are destroying the whole buildings completely uh and we saw these smart uh bombs that are targeting very very precise uh targets uh so the difference between having a massive attack on a place that could Target the the the 5,000 people who were uh were sheltered in this uh in this school that would have left us with hundreds of people uh dead but targeting the prayer area precisely in the school left the school building in large intact but the the the building that has been affected uh is is the prayer area that and left more than 100 people died there were uh we understood that there were around 300 worshippers uh praying at that time when this High Velocity bum uh three rockets as we understand um um strike that prayer area and caused this amount of death but unfortunately the horrific scenes that we saw and that we cannnot uh U presented to viewers is because this high velocity of of missiles Muhammad as we know uh Israeli authorities say that they were targeting a Hamas Command Center within that school so I just wonder do we know then whether there was the possibility for these civilians who presumably were seeking shelter to receive any kind of warning about this in many cases the Israeli forces would issue a warning to the the people uh before uh targeting a building or a school or a hospital they ask people to EV evacuate they ask people to move from fighting area but apparently in this time Israel wanted really to Target uh Hamas members who are were apparently praying at the time we understand that Hamas members are religious people and they are an ideology they are fighting for a cause fighting for sake of as they say sake of God sake of their Nation sake of of of having a a an independent state so they would be praying at that time in the morning prayer which is happening with their local times between uh 4: and 5 a.m. in the morning so when Israel just struck that uh prayer area a few minutes after the beginning of the area they would know that there are members of Hamas were praying at that area so they didn't care much of giving a warning they wanted that Target no matter how civilians would die in that attack and know Muhammad you and I have been looking at images throughout the course of the morning families crowding around people that they have lost people who are injured there at the hospital but I just wonder at this stage in the conflict realistically what kind of hope is there for the health system for these hospitals to actually be able to really save the lives of people who have been injured to treat people when we know that the health system of course um has really been facing the consequences of this ongoing conflict unfortunately the health system in Gaza cannot deal with such incidents there is an only one Hospital working in Gaza which is alahi hospital is partially working uh the hospital that we saw picture of is sha is not working properly alifa compound is out of service al- madani hospital is out of service there are many hospitals that are out of service I heard reports that are saying many doctors are were arrested by the Israeli forces many uh doctors were killed this system relying so much on the foreign aid or also the doctors that are volunteering to come from foreign countries or other countries to come and help in their leave time or in in their free time but unfortunately the hospitals they do not have uh enough equipment uh enough medications or enough facilities to deal with that and this is the biggest biggest question now if there are men more than 100 people died there are uh maybe a a similar number of injured people who cannot find any uh Medical Aid and unless uh the world would would do some something for these people by by by rushing to to save their lives and and and making sure that they are civilians Worth to be lived live and give them give them uh the opportunity to to to heal and and continue with their lives and viewers will just be able to see there on their screens the very latest pictures there of the scene at that school there in Gaza Muhammad Taha from BBC Arabic across the very latest developments in this story as ever we thank you for being with us well we can speak now to I'm in the professor of Middle Eastern studies at the Australian National University thank you very much for being with us um we know that more ceasefire talks were expected to start next week in light of what we've been seeing and what we've just been discussing there with our correspondent Muhammad that strike on the school in Gaza uh over 100 people k according to Hamas authorities where does that leave the situation in your assessment this further complicates the process of negotiating ceasefire and it is a slap in the face of all those countries and that is Egypt Qatar the United States United Arab amates which have really wanted a seire to be inforced and I I it is very clear that that Israeli leadership does not want ceasefire and they are still determined uh on their original aim that they must really wipe out U Hamas but in the process they're also killing so many civilians now and and it's that's why the whole thing is become so horrific and the Israeli attack on this school really comes on the top of uh attacking two other schools in the last week which have resulted in a killing uh of scores of innocent children which basically amounts to an Israeli policy of trying to wipe out the second generation of gazans so that they are not going to be able to uh Prevail in the future and as we know Israel has said that it is targeting a Hamas Command Center at a school there but just taking a look at the picture more broadly we know that Yahya sinoa now the head of Hamas all of these things taken together how do you think this is comp licated the possibility for peace for any kind of meaningful breakthrough during those upcoming ceas fire talks I mean as you said it is making it very complicated and this is the we were told by the Israelis months ago that they cleared hamos out of the Gaza City and yet they keep continuing bombing Gaza cities and also all those areas which they have said that they have uh destroyed Hamas and how long they going to really continue to do that they can always claim that there is Hamas members somewhere and as a result they can kill also hundreds of innocent people and this is what is really happening and I think in the view of many analysts this constitute what what you what can be called State terrorism I mean this is what Israel has been trying to do and it's be become extremely provocative and and basically trying to inflame not only the Palestinians but also all those people who sympathize with the Palestinian cause in in the Arab world and the Muslim world and of course as we know the US UK among those governments uh which view Hamas as a terror organization as well um I just want to talk about the broader backdrop of this um and that is of course Israel waiting to see if an attack from Iran Rises how closer do you think this war could be edging towards spiraling into a broader conflict here well it is really aging towards that and uh of course uh there is a lot of pressure on Iranian government at the moment uh to restrain itself but at the same time not the equal amount of pressure has been put by the United States and other allies of Israel to restrain Israel from these provocative actions uh Israel is has continued to Target uh um hisb figur uh amamos figures as well as Iranian commanders and sites and that does not really serve the cause of bringing about peace and stability uh I think we are at a flash point at the moment and if Iran and hisb uh carry out their promise of responding to to Israeli attacks uh then we will see the beginning of uh a major regional inter Inferno that nobody may be able to control it at the end and I think this is uh the this is now the right time for the United States particularly for the Biden Administration to really pull Israel into line and they can only do that by stopping supplying of arms to Israel which enable Israel to continue this not only against Hamas and Gaza but also targeting uh other uh supporters of uh Palestinian cause in the region you mentioned there the Biden campaign I just wonder how you think that this will be viewed internationally cognizant of the fact that the Biden Administration um is now also looking at a Harris campaign do you anticipate any pivot in strategy from the US bearing in mind it is the close IST Ally of Israel well Camila Harris has voiced stronger support for ceas fire and also observation of uh human rights by Israelis and Gaza uh and of course that is irritated to the leadership particularly prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu uh and I think this sort of Massacre uh cannot really help uh the situation as far as the Democrats are concerned and I think now the Democratic candidates will have to really come out and to express their horror about the whole thing but then on the other on the other hand you have the Republican candidate the former prime minister to Trump who has said that uh if he wins the election then uh um he will give the whole of the West Bank and Gaza to Israel so there is a a real uh debate going on in the United States at the moment and but Israel Lobby is also very active in the United States to make sure that only those who are elected that support or the Israel and it remains absolutely committed to Israel uh Supremacy in the region and we should just say uh there that Israel once again says that it was targeting a Hamas Command Center in a school we are nevertheless seeing a very high civilian casualty number Aman cyel professor of Middle Eastern studies at the Australian National University we thank you for your time my pleasure
