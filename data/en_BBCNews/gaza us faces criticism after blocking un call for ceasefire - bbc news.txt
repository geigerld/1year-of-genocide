the US has faced Fierce criticism for vetoing a United Nations security Council draft resolution that called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in the Israel Gaza War the Palestinian president Mahmud abas has uh released a statement this morning saying that the veto makes the US complicit in what he describes as war crimes against Palestinians it says that he condemns the American position as a flagrant violation of all humanitarian principles and values and he holds the US responsible for the Bloodshed of Palestinian children women and elderly people in the Gaza Strip while the US Envoy said that such a ceasefire would be dangerous and unrealistic every other member of the 15 member Council backed the resolution with the exception of the UK which abstained Israel thanked the US and said that a ceasefire would have given Hamas which is classed as a terror group by many Western governments a chance to regroup our Middle East correspondent Hugo bashet has this report in Gaza there's no safe place says the UN Secretary General the Health Care system is collapsing hospitals have become Battlegrounds and Palestinians have no shelter and everything else needed to survive he says this was the scening hunis in the South yesterday in the aftermath of an Israeli air strike as the military pushes ahead with its war against Hamas hours later at the UN in New York the Secretary General called for a ceasefire and had this warning there is a high risk of the total collapse of the humanitarian support system in Gaza which would have devastating consequences we anticipate that would result in a complete breakdown of public order and increased pressure for Mass displacement into Egypt I fear the consequences could be devastating for the security of the region but the US which is veto power ignored his calls and voted against it our goal should not simply be to stop the war for today it should be to end the war forever break the cycle of unceasing violence and build something stronger in Gaza and across the Middle East so that history does not keep repeating itself Britain abstained in the vote every other member of the security Council back the ceasefire we call for further and longer pauses to get Aid to Palestinians and allow space for further hostage releases but we cannot vote in favor of a resolution which does not condemn the atrocities Hamas committed against innocent Israeli civilians on the 7th of October in Gaza the situation for civilians grows more dire by the day the world food program is warning of widespread famine and says nine in 10 gin are not getting enough food our life is extremely difficult says hassanin another displaced Gaza resident now in Rafa there's not even water this is what we face every day he says as the fighting continues more people are being killed and the suffering of survivors is getting worse Israel says it is taking steps to protect C in Gaza but the world is asking is it enough H BBC News Jerusalem well it's been confirmed this morning that one of the Israeli hostages still remaining in Gaza has been killed um this is a picture of Saha Baruch who was from kibuts Barry I just want to read to you uh what his community uh have released as a statement just in the last few hours this morning they say it's with great sorrow and a broken heart that we announced the murder of sahab Baruch 25 years old he was kidnapped from his home on the 7th of October by Hamas terrorists and taken to Gaza and murdered there we share they say in the unbearable grief of his parents Tammy and Ronnie his brother guy and NIV uh his family and all of his loved ones and it also goes on to say we will demand the return of his body as part of any hostage release deal we won't stop until everyone is home that's a statement from uh kibot bear which is the kibot where Saha Baruch 25 years old lived and has been confirmed to have been killed in Gaza well let's get some more reaction to that vote at the UN Security Council last night that we've been uh discussing throughout the morning I spoke a little earlier to Dr Mustafa bouti he's president of the political party the Palestine National initiative and I asked him about that us veto that had been used on calls for a ceasefire the United States of America and Britain did not support ceasefire means they are participating in this crime they are covering up the terrible crime of genocide that is happening now in Gaza and the terrible other crime of of of ethnic cleansing that the Israelis are conducting against the people and a third war crime which is collective punishment depriving people from every possibility of having a normal lives I heard you the the representative of Britain saying that she wants to condemn the killing of Israel is fine we don't want any Israeli or Palestinians to be killed but why is she saying that the killing of 32 children should be condemned while she's not saying that the Israeli killing of 7,500 Palestinian children should also be condemned that is a double standard and what happened in the Security Council is very dangerous it sends a very negative message to the whole world that from now on we don't live and the the world is not living according to international law it's important to say that Israel strongly refutes those claims of genocide and ethnic cleansing in particular um I I wanted to ask you about specifically you touched on it there what the US and the UK were saying at the UN Security Council they said that a ceasefire Now does not provide a lasting resolution to this what is your suggested path forward to actually make sure that Hamas does not not provide an ongoing threat to Israel while also protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza Hamas was reacting to what Israel was doing I'm not justifying anything but to to think that the world history started no no let me finish Anna let me finish it was it was it was the these were massacres on that day I mean you're saying they were reacting you're saying you're not justifying it but it is important to say that these brutal attacks on isra civilians and we we should make that you should allow me to answer you can I answer you please can I answer I think what is happening yeah I am quoting Mr goes the Secretary General of the United Nations that nobody can doubt is a good man he said things did not happen from a vacuum we have been oppressed by the Israeli Israeli occupation since 50 6 years that's Dr Mustafa bouti president of the Palestine National initiative I also spoke earlier on to Assaf Sharif who's a former Consul general of Israel in New York uh he is in Tel Aviv um and he explained a little more about uh his perspective on the current situation in Gaza the problem is that we see that even during the ceasefire and on a daily basis that the uh trucks of food and gas and uh uh other humanitarian Aid that are are getting in they are not going going to the citizens since there are no un people in inside Gaza and the Israelis are not controlling who gets the food we see that the leaders of Hamas are taking the food and all this Aid to their people so we can bring in as much as that's not quite correct though is it because you you said you just just for for for accuracy though you said that the the UN aren't inside Gaza but onra the UN relief and works agency are operating inside Gaza yes and I feel sorry for them because every day they are get the the one that are getting in are being robbed the trucks are being that there's a mob running towards this uh uh trucks of food or humanitarian Aid and then come a truck with the five or six or seven people of Hamas and they're just taking everything this is the daily basis there are a lot of videos and you see more and more people in Gaza are desate civilians that we're seeing in these videos AR they I they're definitely without a doubt suffering and we feel I personally feel sorry for every innocent people in Gaza definitely but what's the solution if we bring more Hamas will have more and then the situation will only continue if we'll have a ceasefire now we try that you know this is not the first operation since Israel evacuated from Gaza in 2006 and every two years we have two or three years we have an operation and after two weeks the UN said let's do a ceasefire and it continues and you know Kamas took costes the Israeli people but they also took hostages uh uh some of the the innocent citizen in Gaza offers but if we will not put an end to the regime of the Kamas it will just continue for two more years so we'll have it a two weeks stop or two years stop but it will continue we have to get rid of this government and make sure that the citizens of Israel and the citizens of Gaza will not suffer from this Administration well let's talk to uh Steven Erlanger who's the chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe for the New York Times uh thank you for joining us here on BBC News let's talk about the the US position first of all because they are of course Israel's main political and military ally but there's been a lot of criticism about that position that they took at the UN Security Council last night not a surprising one um what is your assessment of what what the US perhaps wants to do next well the US would like this over with but the US also wants a mass taken out of power in Gaza so the US has given Israel time but the is ticking Israel has urged um sorry the US has urged is Israel very strongly to let more Aid into Gaza uh the slaughter going on hurts Israel's reputation it hurts the United States reputation but for Hamas to win it only needs to survive in power and no one really wants that to happen to be honest not the people of Gaza I assure you cuz I've spent a lot of time there not the Saudis not the jordanians not the Palestinian Authority not Israel not America but to defeat Hamas you have to defeat them ceasefire would simply stop the fighting and it would it would leave Hamas in place that's the argument that's the American argument so Biden is giving Israel time but the time is not unlimited and they have urged Israel very openly including from vice president to be much more careful about civilian death at casualties to use uh less bombs and smaller bombs uh to really bring this to a halt but they're not going to let a ceasefire stop it in the middle the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin was speaking just the day before yesterday and talking about the gap between Israel's stated intent to protect civilians but the the reality of what was happening on the ground and the fact that he he felt the need to say that publicly does that suggest that he doesn't think Israel is listening to what he's saying either publicly or privately I think that's an issue I mean the Americans and Israelis are talking every day almost um about all this but Israel has its own national interests and at some point is going to do what it thinks it needs to do I mean it's listening to the United States it's listening to Britain it's listening to Germany but it doesn't always agree it's the same with the with the desired end State the Americans want a two-state solution they want the Palestinian Authority to somehow take over power in Gaza BB Netanyahu says no way but for that to happen you need a new Israeli government you need a new Palestinian government and you need the hostilities to end there's a long way to go I'm afraid and Stephen for how long do you think that that Israel will continue to get partic particularly us backing when you touched on this to to continue this military operation as the number of Palestinian deaths and and injuries continues to climb that that there will surely be some sort of of cut off date for that backing won't there well it's flexible but I I would think it's more a matter of two weeks I don't think it'll be much more than that I don't think it'll be even another month St eringer thank you uh for joining us from the uh New York Times
