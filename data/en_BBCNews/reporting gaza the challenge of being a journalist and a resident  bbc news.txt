The most beautiful Eid is Abu Al- Fass caressing the candle. You, Razon Al-Sha, come on, come on, one, two, no. Yes, I cried because of a happy video. In this video, the results of the general secondary school for twin girls, and all of this atmosphere was very happy, and my brother brought sweets, and I also saw the house in the video.  And the car is all gone. It's all gone. 's gone. Since I started my work in the media, I've been covering conflict and covering wars. I mean, I covered all the wars that happened in Gaza. I mean, there's something different, I mean, and strange. Just because it means we understood that there was an entry by elements of Hamas into  Israel knew that we were starting to analyze that the reaction would be I am part of the battle and my family, where are they doing? What is the situation of the event itself? Journalistically, how do I want to cover it? You are running a giant institution. I mean, look, the big dilemma is that you also want to maintain the policy or  The line is a liberation for the channel. I swear to God, Wael’s topic greatly affected me personally. It means targeting journalists. I mean, I started saying that, well, I am a journalist. I mean, by chance, his family was in the same area that my family was in, in the Nuseirat camp.

Security or safety, but of course we cannot do that and we do not even provide it for ourselves. A short while ago my daughter spoke to me and told me that there is no bread in the house that we are in. Could you please bring us some bread, but of course there are two bakeries that are located in the area that Adnan is in. Sorry.  I did not mean that I wanted to stir up these sorrows or these feelings, and there was a challenge in front of me: to be a professional and not to be a human being and not to be like people in a difficult matter. Let him stand by it so that a thousand does not become dust. I am now in a cemetery in the Tal Al- Sultan area in Rafa’, meaning I am.  For the first time in my life, I see this scene. Now a large mass grave is being dug, and we have received news that the army wants to hand over a number of these remains. At that time, there were between 80 and 100 bodies. He handed them over. They were in a large box in a truck. The smell is difficult. We cannot open the box. These have been delivered.  The bodies were transported by the Israeli army to the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing. Now the local authorities here are burying them. I apologize. There is a smell. There is a very difficult and unpleasant smell. Also, for the first time in my life, I see this scene, this cruelty and this ugliness. Now, I mean, we are leaving the city of Rafah. I mean, what we worked in there last.  The days of coverage of the Gaza Strip, and here they end, meaning our last days in this city and in the Gaza Strip, and here the news coverage stops for me in this war. Peace, if the situation makes us abandon what is riding, and the emptiness of Gaza is dear to us. Comfort. Of course, I am the first and last choice in Gaza, and I must return to it. I mean, when?  It'll end no one knows
