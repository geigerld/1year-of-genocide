now the US Department of Defense has accused Iran of launching the Drone that damaged an oil tanker off the coast of India the attack happened 320 km Southwest of veraval and caused a fire on board which was extinguished let's speak live now to our correspondent ambran Ethan who's in Delhi for us and ambran the Iranians saying they had nothing to do with this but uh tell me the latest that you are hearing now what's happening in the Red Sea in the past 48 Hours has really shaken the commercial shipping operations now the US Central Command has issued the latest update listing out the number of attempts made on tankers and other commercial ships passing through the Red Sea they say two anti-ship ballistic missiles were fired by the huti rebels uh from emen and they are regarded as the proxies of Iran and none of the ships were damaged and again four drones were shot down by a us warship and two other ships were hit one had a narrow Miss and no Norwegian ship however another Indian tank was hit by a drone but not uh much damage or casualties now we are talking about the attack on Friday when India bound ship which one of the British Maritime agencies said Israeli Affiliated a tanker carrying oil from Saudi Arabia to India came under attack about 200 iCal miles off the coast of Gujarat state in India that has also shaken the confidence of the industry now the US blames Iran saying for the first time that are directly involved in an attack but the Iranian authorities they deny so it is still a mystery who carried out no one has admitted responsibility but what it shows is that how one of the busiest routs now has come under attack by these Rebel groups or some some others that is threatening the industry yes that's the The Wider concern isn't it in terms of what the authorities are saying what what are the Indian authorities saying about this the Indian coast guard has given an update on what happened to MV km Pluto that was the tanker that was attacked off the coast of India on Friday now this ship was damaged it got fire but it was extinguished it also took in some water now a Coast Guard ship is accompanying this tanker so it is likely to reach the port at Mumbai tomorrow to assess damage and to carry out any repair work and then they will decide the future course of action and in fact the Indian coast c also deployed tonier surveillance aircraft to make sure that the ship doesn't have any other threat in that particular area so it is a concern for India which heavily relies on oil and other supplies from the Middle East so it's not only in the Red Sea now it is spreading to other areas but people might question how come a drone far away from any other country nearly 2,000 or th000 km away can hit a Target whether it was launched from another boat or a ship so that is a question for defense experts to answer and Ean there in Delhi thanks very much there thank you
