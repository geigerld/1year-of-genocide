now Palestinians have been fleeing gaza's Second City Han Yunis after the Israeli military ordered evacuations of part of the city in the South again a ground operation has already taken place there and people Express their anger over being displaced once more they announced that we should evacuate out of the Eastern parts of kulas where should we go tell us where to go when we were displaced from Rafa we had to spend 2 weeks out in the open we peace not war enough is enough we are slowly dying this is unfair what is our fault we are innocent civilians it comes as Kat the arm of the Israeli Army responsible for logistical coordination issued a clarification after the European hospital near hanun was evacuated too they said the call to move towards the al- mawasi humanitarian Zone does not apply to the patients in the European hospital or the medical staff working there however on the found evacuations had already taken place Dr Muhammed Tahir is a British surgeon who's been operating at the European hospital near Han Yunis he works with fuder scientific a group of medical professionals he says he was ordered to leave I'd been at Al nassa medical complex where I was lecturing a medical students I returned to the European hospital to start my operating and then uh we got the the news that the hospital was being evacuated of course I found that to be uh very very strange because I always assumed the European Hospital would be one of the safe havens in Gaza um and yet the news was confirmed to us that it was actually in the red zone and had been um uh deemed unsafe our team uh Mission uh and our leaders uh asked us to leave uh and we've been hosted by a very uh generous NGO by the name of cadis right now but um prior to leaving of course we witnessed all the uh injured um of varying severities uh forced to stay in the hospital and all the persons and families that camped in the hospital were evacuating the state of uh panic and the extent of the fear was extremely palpable uh some people have nowhere to go some people have nowhere safe to be I asked our Middle East correspondent Sebastian Usher what we know about the current situation in the hospital well I mean it's been a slightly confused situation as you were saying um the Israeli Army says that it didn't issue a specific evacuation order for the hospital but I think uh there the medical staff and patients people there seeing what has happened elsewhere during the 9 months of Israeli offensive against Hamas and Gaza what's happened in other hospitals felt that uh the safest thing was to evacuate and the Health Ministry in Gaza run by Hamas did Issue it says an evacuation order for people to leave some of the patients have been taken to NASA Hospital others have found shelter elsewhere as you know we are not reporting directly on the ground we're receiving information from uh our freelance journalists in Gaza we we we don't know exactly the situation of hospital at the moment how many people are still left there but it hasn't come under any attack as far as we know uh the Israeli Army issued a statement an hour or two ago saying that it did carry out overnight strikes on some of these areas towns and villages to the east of Han yunas where they issued the evacuation order on Monday evening uh first of all in an audio message and then online um and people did start to leave then and then when these strikes began to happen more more more people started uh to flee their homes now remember hunas is a second City in Gaza it's a place that we saw images of after the Israeli troops pulled out a month or two ago when people began to return home of total devastation people described trying to find their homes that they could no longer recognize the streets where they were but despite all that many people did return as they were fleeing the latest subsequent offensive against Hamas by Israel down in Rafa where many people have been fled to so what we've been hearing and as what we were hearing there in the interview you had with someone from the area is that people are once again on the move some people who've been displaced already maybe five or six six times Sebastian Asha there in over the last few minutes we've heard from the United Nations that they say 250,000 people in southern Gaza have been affected by Israel's new evacuation order so 250,000 people affected by that evacuation order according to the UN
