Israel has a genocidal intent against the Palestinians in Gaza the charge of genocide leveled against Israel is not only false it's outrageous the highest court of the United Nations has ruled that Israel must take all measures to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide but Israel has been accused of allowing controversial statements to continue BBC News Arabic has investigated statements by Israeli leaders soldiers and on the internet we ask what action has Israel taken since the ruling at the international court of justice since hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023 and Israel's subsequent military campaign in Gaza both sides have used inflammatory language some Hamas officials have made speeches about repeating the acts and Hamas leaders have been accused of war crimes but because Hamas is not a state it cannot be taken to the icj Israel however can be taken to the icj it has signed the genocide convention and incitement to genocide is also punishable under Israeli National Law but what is considered a genocidal act the UN defines genocide as acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part in National ethnical racial or religious group the convention outlines five punishable acts one of which is the direct and public incitement or call to action to commit genocide the deputy speaker a member of the prime minister's C party made these comments weeks after the icj's order he'd previously called to burn Gaza in a postern x he said he deleted it following a request from the platform but he didn't apologize and controversial comments have been made since the ruling by those in Israel's government [Music] this call by Israel's national security minister for Palestinians to leave Gaza voluntarily a population of more than 2 million was made just two days after the icj ruling common calling for the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza have been made by soldiers on the ground since October 7th there have been videos by IDF soldiers mocking and celebrating the destruction of Gaza the IDF told the BBC that it handles videos posted by Soldiers with command and disciplinary measures and that in some of the examined cases it is concluded that the expression or behavior of the soldiers in the footage is inappropriate we consider the the calling to uh displacement of the Gaza population as part of the ethnic cleansing that is ongoing in Gaza that is part of the of the genocide certain statements let's say by itamar benir and others you know I'm definitely not going to defend such statements but they do not rise to the level of genocide certainly un special reporter Franchesca albanesi however says we can see that it's impossible to return Gaza to what it was because 70% of it has been destroyed because over 33,000 people have been killed 14,000 of whom are children so the incitement against the people of Gaza has translated in fact into into uh concrete actions so there is a direct link I mean it cannot be missed Franchesca Alban's criticism of Israeli policies in Gaza have been strongly contested among others by Israel and its Ally the United States in Gaza this link between what politicians say and what's echoed by soldiers was a core part of South Africa's case during the icj hearing in January they claimed Israel's political leaders military commanders and persons holding official positions have systematically and explicit terms declared their genocidal intent and these statements are then repeated by soldiers on the ground in Gaza and gave this example this speech was addressing soldiers before the ground offensive in Gaza amalik comes from Biblical story where Israelites are ambushed by the amalik people and God commands destruction women and children included the war against amalik is described as a me of war in Jewish text it is a war commanded by God and includes defending Jewish life under which it is considered obligatory to fight I think Nan's reference to Amal in the modern context of this war was highly problematic was um using a term that's vague and could be understood in different ways in order to Rally support um especially among the religious um C prime minister netanyahu's office says he was talking about Hamas in connection to amalik and not Palestinian civilians to understand the reach of the term amalik the BBC investigated online mentions since the start of the war filtering those to ones associated with Gaza war and narrowing that down further to mentions just in Hebrew we collected over 3,600 mentions and found they reached a total of 6 million users mention speak around the time of Mr netanyahu's speech and again at the beginning of December when this video went [Applause] viral this religious language and ideology has become part of the messaging within Israel at least in some communities it was also expressed at an annual conference that took place for all Zion shivas Jewish religious schools in Israel Rabbi ilaali gives a lecture which he describes as being about the treatment of civilians in Gaza the following clip went viral and has been watched over a million times we have added our own verified translations one description of a me for war which Rabbi Mali discusses in his lecture includes a Commandment that states do not allow a soul to live we contacted Rabbi Ilah Ali about his lecture his legal representative replied saying the rabbi's lecture has been grossly misrepresented and that he made it very clear that anyone following the biblical commandment today would be causing the Army and the nation extreme harm the rabbi said that it is forbidden to harm the civilian population from a child to an old man we managed to track down the full 47 minute lecture and Rabbi Mali thus conclude the following however earlier in the lecture he discusses the position of Jewish text in relation to civilian populations and says this it Ma a lawyer from the Israeli group tag me ear that campaigns against racism and discrimination ask the police to investigate Rabbi Mali on suspicion of incitement to commit genocide violence and terrorism he says he's waiting to hear if that will happen two days before the court hearing in January Israel's attorney general said any statements calling for intentional harm to civilians contradict the policy of the state of Israel and may amount to a criminal offense including the offense of incitement currently several such cases are being examined by Israeli law enforcement authorities and while no report has been made public the icj confirmed it received the report it requested from Israel on what action it's taken the BBC has not been able to verify whether any criminal investigations have been opened to determine if statements could be inciting genocide whether there investigations of course depends on whether in their view uh any arguable incitement to genocide has happened Hamas hides behind civilians and inevitably some of those civilians have uh regrettably and tragically been harmed the BBC contacted Israel's State Attorney Police Commissioner and Ministry of justice for comment only the ministry of Justice replied saying they have to balance the constitutional right to freedom of speech while safeguarding against harmful incitement it's a case the icj issued the interm order because a final verdict will take years and while there's no end inside to this deadly and long-standing conflict between Israelis and pales inian inflammatory language from both sides continues it's unclear what Gaza will look like or how it will be governed once a final ruling is eventually issued
