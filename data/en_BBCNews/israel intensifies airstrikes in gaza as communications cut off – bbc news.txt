let's go live to Jerusalem straight to our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams and Paul just quickly first of all as we shift phases according to Israel's military your assessment of what we were just listening to well I think that note of urgency was was very very marked wasn't it Matthew uh this was I think the sternest strongest most perhaps impassioned warning from the Israelis that we have seen so far and I think it's also the first time that they have said that when this is over you can go back uh this is obviously addressing the fears that many many Palestinians have which is that if they leave their homes they're never going to go back to to them because the homes won't be there all somehow they will be driven uh further maybe even South into Egypt so I think that was quite a not noticeable addition to uh his remarks uh as for how long this latest operation is going to go on well the defense minister has said the oper operation will continue until further notice and he has referred to the fact that we have accomplished a phase in the war so clearly the Israelis feel that they are doing something slightly different now uh whether this is something that is going to continue in the coming days or we we don't know or whether they feel they have somehow accomplished something we also don't know that the attack by Hass was unprecedented the response is unprecedented but also the situ with the hostages unprecedented I think this is really interesting Matthew the pressure the sense of pressure on the government is mounting day by day it's really really palpable there's another demonstration going on uh in Tel Aviv today as you've already mentioned the uh relatives are demanding uh to meet with the Prime Minister and the defense minister that meeting we believe is going to take place later this evening and if I can just read you for from a the statement put out by a spokesperson for the hostages and missing families we are tired of slogans they say our Lov ones time is running out and they have been held in appalling conditions underground in the dark for 3 weeks some wounded and every additional hour could be a death sentence we expect the Prime Minister and defense minister to arrive with clear answers on how to bring the hostages home that's those are really strong words and I don't think the Prime Minister can ignore that this sense that both among Israelis but also among a number of foreign governments including the United States they they really really want the Israeli government to do whatever it takes to bring hostages home and there are some people with long experience of dealing with Gaza who say we should be pausing now we should stop the fighting now to allow an opportunity to get the hostages out that doesn't mean we won't return to the fight uh eventually but just for now that should be priority number one Paul Adams there in Jerusalem thanks very much well the bombardment in Gaza is continuing I was just looking out of the corner of my eye another plume of smoke there and we've seen that in the intensification of this over the last 18 24 hours that the scene of the skyline there you see the clouds of smoke uh they have been throughout the course of the last little while as Israel moves phases and our correspondent telling us just what that was like on the ground and of course at the same time Communications cut off but we were able to finally reach our correspondent rushi Abu Alou in Gaza a little earlier he used a satellite telephone to communicate with us have a listen to this it's about 13 14 hours Gaza without communication without internet and without mobile signal the Palestinian Health Minister just issue a statement saying that about 400 people were killed overnight in the Israeli air strikes in the north Israel said that they have expand their operation especially in Gaza City and the north here in canun also there was many air strikes overnight with about 20 people killed about 15 targets around this area and around the middle camps people are really worried since the Israel is cutting all the communication uh people can't communicate with their relative with their friends in Gaza City and the North and people were really in panic I saw people in the streets today less people in the streets than yesterday people are afraid of the next stage of the operation they believe that cutting the communication this is the first time ever since Hamas took over Gaza and four Wars before uh we haven't seen Israel completely cutting the communication with Gaza uh the humanitarian situation is also getting worse and wor with Israel not allowing food and medicine I've have seen people struggling to find water here in the hospital people are struggling to find fuel to run the generator and work in the in the hospital the medical crews are struggling the ambulance services is almost shut down since the morning they they say we don't know where to go and how to communicate with the people after an a strike they they wait for anal any news from the people on the ground and then they move quickly to the to the scene and back with casualities here in the hospital so it's real catastrophic situation our correspondent there on the ground in southern Casta let me
