hello and welcome to BBC News in the last hour we've been monitoring a speech from the Hezbollah leader Hassan nasrala giving his first public response to two days of attacks in Lebanon using sabotage communication devices the number of people killed has now risen to 37 with over 3,000 people wounded in a moment or two I'll talk once again to our security correspondent Frank Gardner but let me tell you a little more about what hezbollah's leader has been saying because he accused Israel of been behind behind that operation over the last couple of days which he said crossed all red lines thousands of pages were targeted by the Israeli enemy and detonated at the same time with this operation the enemy crossed all rules laws and red lines he didn't care about anything at all not morally not humanely not legally well that uh is still going on we are monitoring that all the time with our teams inside The Newsroom but Frank Gardner our security corresp has been with me through the last hour monitoring what the hezb leader has been saying worth just underlining hezb of course a prescribed terrorist group by the UK Us and other Western governments but what have you picked out so far some of what he says is true some of it isn't he said our Command and control system is undamaged oh yeah right it's absolutely trash I mean they're in real trouble they're reeling operationally from this so they're in no position to fight a war right now other than the low-level exchange of far they're doing across the border but where I think he's right is where he says bring it on we welcome you know an invasion by the Israeli Ground Forces we will receive them here and actually the last time Israeli Ground Forces did go into Lebanon Southern Lebanon in 2006 in a major offensive they did get a bloody nose um it ended in a very very inconclusive uh sort of stalemate essentially and Israel found Hezbollah to be a much tougher nut to crack than they thought um you know they had and I said this in the last hour but they had pre-positioned a lot of their anti-tank devices they had some very powerful uh russian-built cornet for example anti-tank weapons uh mines that were buried under the exact bit on the road where they thought the Israeli tanks would probably try and maneuver um so if Israel does decide that it is going to go full Tonto on this and do a fullscale invasion of Southern Lebanon which will be its third major incursion into that country then in recent years then it could be really quite painful for Israel it's going to be very painful for Lebanon if that happens um so what this talk was about was not signaling here's exactly what we're going to do here's how we're going to fight back no it was more of a pep talk it was rallying the troops it was first of all paying tribute to those uh First Responders and emergency health workers who had rushed to donate blood and to deal with the wounded he uh hailed as heroes or their Fighters who've been injured in this but it was primarily saying we've had a taken a big hit here we don't deny it but we will be stronger from this we're going to emerge more resilient and actually don't underestimate the resilience of organizations including prescribed terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and others to be able to bounce back from things like this because they hide amongst the people This Is War amongst the people a and he's repeated only again in the last few minutes there'll be tough retribution and just punishment for the blast we've seen over the last couple of days I mean Hezbollah sit there in Lebanon just remind viewers I mean we've heard comments and condemnation from the Lebanese government in terms of the civilians impacted by those explosions how much influence control do they have on the Lebanese government huge I mean they are a political party as well I mean it's very odd they are an anomaly in the sense that they are both a political party and a very much a part of the fabric of Lebanese political life alongside other parties Lebanon of course is a multi-confessional um country it's a it's a small place where people speak French Arabic and English you've got um Sunni Muslims Shia Muslims and Hezbollah tend to be well they are in fact entirely Shia Muslims following the Shia branch of Islam and you've got Drews you've got Christians marinite Christians and so on you've got all these different elements and so it's been always a really difficult balancing um act to try and keep the place on an even Keel and of course they had a horrific Civil War that lasted from 1975 till 1990 um and the fear now is that Lebanon could once again be plunged back into Warfare just as its economy is in a really powerless State let's look at the situation from the other direction your assessment on the Israeli strategy because of course it's a coalition government we know that Benjamin Netanyahu were extending the war aims but under huge pressure from the far right the extremist within his own coalition government so in terms of Israel's strategy what do you discern from what we've seen over the last couple of days I think there may well be a bit of a gap between what the military Chiefs want and the security establishment on one hand and necessarily what the politicians want this is the mo let's be clear about this this is the most hard-right government in Israel's history since 1948 the security minister itamar bavier is um he's been convicted of terrorism offenses he controls the police um smotrich um is the um the Finance Minister these people are very much tied into the settler movement they believe in not the West Bank and an independent event ultimate State for the Palestinians but this this is Judea and Samaria and this is the god-given right of the Jews to live there and they would like to C they'd like to see the place um cleansed as it were of um the Palestinians who've been living there for centuries so underlying all of this all the stuff we're talking about here in Lebanon and pages and Gaza and all the rest of it underlying all of that is this open running saw that the Palestinians and this was brought to light in the UN yesterday the Palestinians want their own independent contigous Homeland in West Bank with East Jerusalem as their capital and most of the International Community backed them in that including Western governments but it strongly resisted by this government and Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli Prime Minister knows that if he if he makes a deal that is against the wishes of the far-right elements of his government his Coalition will collapse he'll have to call elections and he will probably lose and many people speculate that he will then end up in court on corruption charges possibly even facing jail that is the backstory to what is going on at the moment
