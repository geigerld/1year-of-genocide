at least nine people have died in the biggest Israeli military operation in the occupied West Bank for 20 years last month the international court of justice ruled that Israel's continued occupation of the area captured in 1967 breached international law violence has been increasing in the West Bank since the Hamas attacks of October the 7th with the UN saying more than 650 Palestinians have been killed and that there's been violence against Israelis this latest massive operation involved Israeli forces simultaneously entering the cities of Janine tulam nablo and tubas in what the Defense Forces called a counterterrorism strike from Janine Lucy Williamson sent this report it was a message of force delivered quietly at first Israeli soldiers seeking their targets Street by Palestinian Street by morning hundreds of troops backed by armored bulldozers had arrived in the refugee camps of taram nablas toas Janine home to Armed Palestinian groups and unarmed civilians at least 10 Palestinians have been killed Hamas says six of them were its Fighters massud Naja said he was injured when he opened the door of his house to young men asking for water we felt like something came down on us from the sky and there was an explosion I was unaware of what was going on when I put my hand on my chest it was all shrapnel in blood in Janine army vehicles surrounded the city's two main hospitals ambulances stopped and checked by military Jeeps Israel's foreign minister has urged his government to use Gaza as a model for dealing with armed groups here saying that Iran was backing them and that this was a war for everything that Israel must win the IDF and our security forces are operating in tarim Janine and other places from which murderous attacks have been launched we will fight to eliminate terrorism wherever it emerges almost 600 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank by Israeli forces since the Hamas attacks but Fighters here are still presenting Israel with new tactics and new threats Israel's Army has been targeting the same areas in the same cities week after week for the past 10 months determined to dismantle the armed Palestinian groups based here now it's launched a wider more coordinated operation across the West Bank on a scale not seen for 20 years in alfar camp near tubas mobile phone footage showed showed red cresant staff lined up against the wall of their compound in front of Israeli troops arriving in Janine today the West Bank head of the red cresant you've had 10 months of these sorts of incursions how worried are you by what's happening today I'm very much worried because it seems there's a new stage there's a new uh they are escalating scaling up their operation when they talk about evacuating civilians and using the Air Force to bombing the camps this reminds us of Gazza as night fell explosions and gunfire from Janine's refugee camp dusk can be a signal to test the Army's control the war in Gaza is changing this conflict an old front creating new fears in the face of a regional War Lucy Williamson BBC News Janine and Jeremy boen is with me our International editor Jeremy another escalation in this region yeah um West Bank at Boiling Point um now if you listen to what Israel says they say it's all about Iran Iran is behind uh an increase in Palestinian violence armed groups well it's no secret that Iran does support Palestinian armed groups someone has to pay for their their Weaponry there's no question question about that but why escalate now when Israel has been hitting these same places for months and months and months and arresting thousands of people killing hundreds well the root of it is is of course the long conflict over control of the land between Israelis and Palestinians uh there's Politics as well uh Netanyahu is said very emphatically there will never be a Palestinian State uh the Palestinians want this land the West Bank as a big part of theirs so by I think by doing this prime minister Netanyahu is weakening the Palestinian Authority which does want a Palestinian State and which the Americans say should be a big part of the future not just in the West Bank but in Gaza which again that is something Netanyahu is very much against so weakening his enemies there in the Palestinian State and also today as well part of the the the growth of violence has been the activities of armed settlers the Americans sanctions the settler group and a notorious settler leader today saying extremist settler violence causes intense human suffering is bad for Israel's security Now um last Point really that the Israeli government's position is that all this land is Jewish land Palestinians disagree they want it as part of their state but what's happening right now is that it's on fire
