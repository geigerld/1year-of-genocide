Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the country is at War and will win after a surprise attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas saw thousands of rockets launched into Israel from Gaza dozens of militants appear to have entered Southern Israel there is a state of emergency across the country let's have a look at what we know so far these rocket attacks struck Tel Aviv and areas surrounding Gaza the town of ashalon seeing several major explosions uh news channels in Israel reporting 40 Israelis have been killed with seven 140 injured details of the Palestinian incursions are unclear but gunmen have been reported in towns near the border with Gaza and Israelis are being told they need to stay inside there are also reports of a number of Israeli soldiers being taken captive by Fighters Hamas saying it has a big number of captives and among them Hamas says is senior officers israeli's military targeting Gaza very strongly in the past hour or so at least 198 Palestinians confirmed dead there well let's uh bring you some of that statement from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who addressed the nation in a video statement that was released on social media citizens of Israel we at War not an operation not an escalation a war this morning Hamas launched a murderous surprise attack against the state of Israel and its citizens we've been it since early morning I convin the ads of the security service first of all I instructed to cleanse the settlements of the terrorists who had infiltrated this operation is being carried out during these hours at the same time I ordered an extensive Reserve mobilization and a retaliatory war with a strength in scope that the enemy had never known the enemy will pay an unprecedented price in the meantime I call on all citizens of Israel to strictly obey the instructions of the army and instructions of the home command we are in a war and we win it Benjamin Netanyahu there many pictures coming to us at the BBC and we're verifying them for you this is a bulldozer destroying the Border fence between Israel and Gaza Palestinians are chanting and pouring through gunman reported to have opened fire as I was talking about a little bit earlier on the town of stot and reports of Israeli military vehicles being attacked on the Israeli side too with some taken back across the border into Gaza now this shows you here in this video Hamas militants celebrating they opposing for pictures on what is said to be an Israeli army tank and I think we'll see in a moment as well footage of what appears to be this vehicle here an Israeli military vehicle captured by the militants Israeli journalist and orthog Gideon Levy is in Tel Aviv which is among the cities that's been attacked and he told us about the scene that he wok up to this morning I don't remember T Aviv in this situation for many years I just went out to the streets the streets are totally empty restaurants cafes everything is locked down and there is a very heavy feeling of of surprise of shock and of fear from what is still expected to happen when the first Rockets fall I was jogging in the park the noise was terrible and and ever since then T Aviv went into a new phase first of all there are many more Israeli kill than the official number because things are still very unclear and still are still going on in many towns in the South so expect much bigger number of of casualties it's an inevitable result of months and maybe years of Israeli arrogance of the feeling that Israel can do whatever it wants and will never be taken accountable and never pay any price for the programs of the settlers in the West Bank Beed and supported by the Israeli Army for the arrest for the attacks for the killings of innocent civilians in the West Bank and also for violating the status quo in the temple Mountain I just got now a report that in sukot this sukot there were five over 5,000 Jews going in a very provocative way to the temple mountain and and all those things are feeding the fire and what is a surprise is the capability of Hamas not their intentions because nobody in Israel had foreseen that they have such impressive capabilities in the South there are still battles in certain towns and and Villages settlements over at least T of of Palestinian fighters who are inside Israel and they have hostages this is very very dedicated this situation in the same time Kamas declared they have 35 captured I don't know if this number is right but if they kidnapped 35 Israelis into Gaza it will be very hard for Israel to release them and it will be very hard for Israel to attack Gaza now as long as 35 Israelis are in their hands again I not sure about the figure but this would Hamas declares so and there are t of of Israeli air Jets which are bombing Gaza and and soon we will know more now there is a lot of smoke about everything and the full picture is not very clear right now exess for journalist is quite limited now to those places and we are quite depending on the messages of the of the army spokeperson who is not always reliable in Israel but there are also immediate questions for example most of the troops that should have been around Gaza were busy with the settler celebrations in the West Bank and if you become a a security company of the settlers for all their crazy celebrations in sukot and Gaza is left with very few soldiers then those things can happen and someone is responsible for this and this is only one example for many questions that will arise now but as I said it's too early to to judge because we know to little Gaza is a cage is the biggest prison in the world nobody spoke about lifting The Siege and you know people who live now 17 years in a cage want to resist and if they have the possibility they do it and I'm surprised that they had a possibility because the barrier I know the barrier around Gaza billions of of dollars were spent there to build this unbelievable barrier under the surface and above the surface with all kind of electronic devices and finally you see that the spirit of resistance is many times stronger than anything else and they broke it and penetrated into Israel which is now shocked finally by the end of the day by the end of the war the pal will pay for it a unprecedented price with this right-wing government I really I'm quite scared from the Israeli reaction people are talking already about erasing whole neighborhoods in Gaza people also talk about reconquering Gaza and all this will lead to more Bloodshed and to more despair
