hello I'm Marian maseri a very warm welcome to the Daily Global on BBC News let's start in the Middle East where in the last hour Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will not be satisfied with anything other than total victory over Hamas he also said Israeli troops have been ordered to prepare to operate in Rafa in southern Gaza let's listen to some of what he had to say tonight I am here to tell you one thing we are on our way to a complete Victory the victory is our reach it's not about years or decades it's about months the IDF is doing wonderful work it's working systematically in order to achieve all of the goals of the world that we the at the political ranks have given it which is relinquishing Kamas releasing the hostages and making sure Gaza is not threatening Israel anymore to begin with I said that the final Victory is our goal this was the decision I brought to the government at the beginning of the war and we will not we will not be satisfied with les on the next half an hour we're expecting to hear from US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin following his talks with Israeli and Palestinian officials now those talks come after what many people see as a positive reaction from Hamas to a proposed ceasefire deal which was put together last week but Mr blinkin has now met both the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and president Isaac Herzog and has described a ceasefire deal as both possible and essential well some reports suggest the plan provides for a truce of at least 40 days in return for the release of Civilian hostages held by Hamas for now though the war which broke out in October continues the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza said at least 100 people were killed overnight and there has been heavy further heavy bombing of Southern cities including in Rafa meanwhile Israel says 31 of the hostages held by Hamas and other groups in Gaza are now known to have died well let's hear now from Mr blinken about the ongoing hostage situation the hostages are foremost uh on our minds and in our hearts uh and uh as as you know uh we now have uh a response from Hamas to the proposal that was uh put on the table Way Forward we're looking at it intensely well Gerson Basin was an Israeli negotiator for 17 years says he gave his assessment on the ceasefire negotiations the Hamas response does enable some room to maneuver if Hamas would be willing to separate the first phase from the second and the third in other words if Hamas wants a ceasefire now for 45 days which is something that I think the Israeli Army would like as well this could be done and we could see the release of Civilian hostages from Gaza those who were remaining alive well with me now is BBC's chief Chief International correspondent lease duet and Lee a difficult job for Mr blinkin this puts him in a very very tough position all we've had is these very public remarks by prime minister Netanyahu a ferocious rebuke to these really incessant efforts by the United States and its Arab Partners to come up with a plan and it's hard to square prime minister netanyahu's description of the Hamas counter offer as delusional with the remarks we heard yesterday from the Qatari prime minister a key mediator in these talks he described it as positive uh Anthony blinkin in his first remarks we'll wait to hear from him shortly he had said that it was the best way forward a lot of work still to be done but trying to give a sense that there was still something to work for but listening to prime minister Netanyahu you had a feeling that this was dead in the water now he may saying that for public effect it is known you know sources say that sometimes in private negotiations he adopts a different tone and a greater Readiness to consider proposals but the Israelis seem to see this as an effort by Hamas to end the war on its own terms which is utterly unacceptable but it's interesting what gersan Basin said which is which goes to the heart of the matter now is it possible to salvage something from this proposal the Hamas counter offer is a three-phase one over about 135 days and the first phase which would include a a temporary pause of about 45 days would release the most vulnerable of the hostages women children the elderly the ones of which there is greatest concern about greatest there's concern about all of them but those first in exchange for some prisoners and some desperately needed humanitarian aid but we make it we'll see just what kind of a tone um and blinkin adopts uh it's it's very cuz this is all there is right now and it's all about tone isn't it really because if you heard the tone of Mr Netanyahu you could feel there that there was no consiliary element in his tone at all but there never is his manra has not shifted an inch total Victory absolute Victory and tonight he said it was within touching distance it was a matter of months now as you know when you've reported on your program there had been assessments by his own military team that actually they weren't that close that Hamas was actually even in the north of the Gaza Strip which has been raised to the ground where Israeli forces in large part moved away from to concentrate on the south Hamas was reestablishing civilian control Hamas is still able to fire rockets at Israel and of course alarm Bells Are Ringing right up to the UN Secretary General Antonio guz said if you carry out what you say is your plan then to go for for Rafa at the southernmost corner where half of the population has been pushed this would be the disaster of disasters in the meantime people are still dying in Gaza uh we saw the Hamas ran Health Minister saying over 100 were killed uh just in the last I think day or so over 27,000 Palestinians and of course there are still Israeli hostages being held there I mean this is the I mean Mar we just reported that 100 died you know before all this if one person died it would have been a story now given the enormity of this staggering death toll the United Nations says that if you try to tally up the Dead the missing and the injured it's actually 100,000 people which some 177,000 children having one having lost one or both parents that's a 5% of gaza's population and prime minister Netanyahu and the public opinion in in Israel backs him they want him to hit Hamas hard as well uh are saying they want this war to continue but tonight of course we've heard of the anguish of the families of the hostages they of course have been there's been that blow that 31 families were told their loved ones are dead that's a fifth of the hostages in Gaza so tonight they are urging the Prime Minister and others again to put the lives of the hostages first before the military plan
