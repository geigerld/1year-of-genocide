we've heard from the French President saying that Israel must stop killing babies and women in Gaza Emanuel macron told the BBC in an exclusive interview at the aliz palace that there was no justification for the bombing saying that a ceasefire would benefit Israel while recognizing Israel's right to protect itself he said we do urge them to stop this bombing in Gaza he's been speaking to the BBC's Europe editor Katy Adler we've had weeks of Aid organizations sounding the alarm about Gaza and so you've now said that humanitarian pauses in fighting aren't enough and there needs to be worked towards a ceasefire are you disappointed that other world leaders aren't joining you in that call like the us or the UK no I hope they will and let's be clear I mean I was one of the first leader to call H prime minister and president of Israel after the terrorist attack the 7th of October we clearly condemned this terrorist attack and terrorist group and Rec recognize the right of Israel to protect itself and react but day one we say that this reaction and the fight against terrorism because it is led by a democracy should be compliant with International rules all of war and and humanitarian international law and day after day what we saw is a permanent bombing of civilians in Gaza and I think it's it's very important to say the whole story but I I think this is the only solution we have this is fire because it's impossible to explain we want to fight against terrorism by killing innocent people you've talked about the fight uh against terrorism needing to be merciless is is the word you Ed but not without rules and you've just referred there to the high loss of civilian life life in Gaza do you think Israel is respecting those rules the international rules that you're referring to uh look in the very first days it's clear that the emotion The Compassion um created a situation where everybody was just close to Israel and beging them and U sharing the pain and we do share the pain and we do share the willingness uh to got rid of terrorism we we know what terrorism means in France but I think there is no justification precisely to attack civilians what I would like just to clarify with you are you saying that Israel is guilty of breaking International humanitarian law potential war cries no I'm here look I I think it's not the proper way to approach the question we do recognize their right to protect themselves and and one month after this terrorist attack I think it would be not the right way to deal with a a a partner and friend just to say you will be condemned and you are guilty de facto today civilians are bombed de facto this babies ladies is all people are bombed and killed there is no reason for that and no legitimacy so we do urge Israel to stop I'm I'm not here to I'm not a judge I'm a head of state I just remind everybody international law I call for a ceasefire and I will urge them for a ceasefire for a minute against this fire that was Emanuel macron well let's bring in our panel Andrew fiser former director of policy at the labor party under jery Corbin and mo ay executive director at the Georgetown Institute of politics and public service interested for you both for your reactions there to what Emanuel macron had to say Andrew I'll start with you yeah uh look I think it's very welcome that he's joined the majority of world leaders we shouldn't forget who are calling now for a ceasefire in this conflict um and it leaves President Biden and Richie sunak in the UK increasingly isolated in not backing a ceasefire we saw the UN you know over 120 countries uh backed a ceasefire only a few I think 14 voted against the us one of them um so this is really important and in a significant shift and look Emanuel macron is obviously a diplomat ahead of state but the fact that he's saying to Israel you have to abide by international law is a clear recognition that currently they're not we've seen white phosphorus being used in densely populated areas we've seen the carpet bombing of Civilian areas um you know we've seen a Siege imposed on a civilian population um which all of which are illegal under international law it's very clear that Israel has not acted within international law um in this uh reaction to the terrible events of the 7th of October so it's a significant intervention from Emanuel macron and I hope it has influence both in the UK and in the US because at the end of the day there is no military solution to this it is going to require a ceasefire and talks and a peaceful settlement that the Palestinians and the Israelis have been let down by their leaders and by the international Community for at least 30 years since the last big serious attempt to try and get there Mo with regards to the kind of International Community do you think other leaders will look at what Emanuel macron had to say take on board those comments and start to think they might air theirs more strongly uh perhaps I think a lot of the world is still um uh a lot of the world is really torn they want to see Israel exercise its right to self-defense they know that Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization and that it itself is uh acting against the best interests of the people they purport to represent Hamas itself is working against the best interests of the Palestinian people preventing many of them from leaving uh using them as human Shields and so you know I I think a lot of the world is still trying to Grapple with this I think people are increasingly horrified by the scenes and the images we are seeing of the devastation in Gaza and of all of the people who uh who died uh in as a result of the military action I found it interesting that the Israeli Ambassador uh to the un uh used the opportunity to attack the UN for accepting hamas's propaganda some of it is propaganda and i' take anything Hamas does with a with a grain of salt but but at the same time we are seeing these images for ourselves we are seeing the devastation for ourselves we know whatever the number is too many civilians are being killed I'm happy to see that the human that there's now going to be a daily humanitarian pause Israel seemed to be uh forced to take that step by International pressure the Biden Administration has been very aggressive in pushing that but they do need to take more steps in their legitimate effort to eradicate Hamas uh to protect the civilians and I'm not sure they're doing that well right now
