fore Canada with Canada hand [Music] I was very comfortable with my life I had a very beautiful house it was a pent house on the beach had um very nice car uh my kids were in a private school they learn English and French it was a very nice life and then the 7th of October came it was 6:00 a.m. in the in the morning I'm hearing a lot of noise hearing a lot of rockets flying to Israel in the first six hours there were only Rockets from Hamas but then after that the response started and the rockets started flying from both sides we took the kids the Escape bag and we took the decision to move to my father's in-law house I got to the house and I'm looking around and it's just just an empty house burnt destroyed fully no walls there's nothing in the house like full destrction I didn't feel that much of sadness I don't know why but I think it's like any other gazin now anything materialistic just worthless it was 3:00 a.m. in the morning where we get a phone call from d was a recorded message saying that for your safety you need to leave the North and head to the South as soon as possible I was shocked I was in a shock I'm running for my life I'm trying to protect my family's life it was still so dark bombing were everywhere but we were like you know what we're not going to take a chance to stay for one more minute so we started moving with our cars to the South to friend house the 150 square M apartment we were around seven families around 60 people it was just very very difficult so every night when it gets dark We Gather in a small Corner in the house me my two daughters and my wife we close the ears of our of our kids and sometimes we get scared ourselves so we leave our kids and we SC we close our ears and we tell them to put their hands on their ears because it's very difficult and it's extremely dark there's nothing that you can see so you keep on holding your kids so that they don't run away and I got a call from the Canadian embassy saying you know what you're able to evacuate you your wife and your two daughters but not your parents you're you're you're wearing the life of your daughters with the life of your parents there's no way I'm leaving and I'm leaving my parents behind and they're old and they need me but then something happened and it was a sign for me that I had to leave so there was bombing right beside us uh my older daughter SOA was playing she has diabetes uh her sugar liver was around 300 when she heard the boming she got so scared so her sugar level dropped from 300 to 30 all of a sudden and that means that she can get G aoma at any second and that means which is worst that she has to be hospitalized and there's no hospitals operating at that time they're all full of wounded people full of dead people so she can't really have a place to be hospitalized at and now I'm here to a certain extent comfortable with my family and that's where I get the feeling of guilt and shame see it's not drinking that's my sister she's with my parents yeah no internet so it's not drinking that's the problem is that I really can't concentrate what am I going to do uh here unless I'm sure that they're safe when we got here and we were at the hotel at the beginning and I asked them I'm like What's the most thing that you like about Canada and both of them subconsciously they answered like we love about Canada one thing that there's no war slowly but surely I'm trying to get them out of like the memory that they had for the past 30 days continuous bombing and this going to take me some time for sure until they're used that this is the normal life and what we used to live there it's just not normal and no one should live
