let's turn to the Middle East now the United Nations says the amount of humanitarian Aid entering Gaza has decreased by 2/3 since Israel began its military operation in Rafa earlier this month the Israeli military says it has established full operational control over the fideli corridor along the Gaza Egypt border discovering dozens of rocket launchers and at least 20 crossb smuggling tunnels there so far a national security adviser to Israel's primee Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he expects the war against has to continue for at least another 7 months let's go to Jerusalem now and speak to our Middle East correspondent yolan Nell um let's let's just talk first of all if we can about um this fidelia Corridor can you tell us a bit more what about what it is and what Israel says it's found yes this is the 14 km strategically important strip of land uh that lies on the Gaza Egypt border now the Israelis saying that they have effective control um of that Corridor now and talking about what they have found there saying there have been multiple rocket launchers and rocket launch sites they' found pointing out that they say in recent weeks something like 70 rockets and mortars have been fired by Hamas from the Rafa area um suggesting really that it was locating some of these launch sites very close to the border with Egypt uh to try to avoid uh Israel going after them and perhaps making a mistake and firing into Egypt um they've also found they say some 20 tunnels which they believe were used to smuggle weapons into Palestinian armed groups like Hamas um and they say there may be more of these tunnels they're locating them and destroying them along this border area now all of this is likely to ratchet up tensions further uh between Israel and Egypt Egypt's concern will be that Israeli forces will try to maintain a presence along this Border in the longer term and also they've been saying that you know Egyptian security sources talking to the Egyptian media that that the tunnels are being used they say as an excuse by Israel to justify its Rafa offensive um and they say that uh they have dealt themselves effectively with smuggling tunnels particularly over the past decade okay thank you so much Yan now for us there live in Jerusalem we can speak now to British Army veteran and chief executive of the intelligence company Cil line Justin Crump hello to you Justin how we're just hearing it from yoland a little bit about um what the Israeli Army says that it's discovered how significant is this that it now controls that area of the Border I mean it's a really important piece of ground for Israel uh if you think of any military force that's attacking an adversary I mean one of the things you want to do is surround the adversary you want to cut that adversary off uh from Supply and Hamas almost certainly wasn't getting supplies through Israel so Israeli suspicion has always been on the border with Egypt um certainly milit planning would assume that there was some permeability of that border whether it was the Rafa Crossing whether it was tunnels obviously Egypt would argue with that but from the Israeli point of view controlling that border Cuts Hass off um from further Supply or does a lot to stop it from doing that it also stops his Safe Haven as you've heard there this um use of that border area uh as an area that Israel can't really strike because it's too close to Egypt it's an area that Hamas have used to stop our weapons to launch weapons from uh and we've seen examples of that and of course the Israelis have found launch positions of of rockets that were exploiting the position so very important what we call sort of vital ground or key terrain for Israel in this war right and in terms of the relations as y land was mentioning between Egypt and uh Israel presumably tensions will be heightened now because of what's going on there yeah because the agreement over Rafa goes back to 1979 and of course when Israel was in the Gaza Strip there was an agreement that Egyptian forces Israeli forces would be matched by mutual agreement I mean the two Nations have fought several devastating conflicts in that area and obviously neither side wanted to see the other build up uh troops now obviously that fell into abeyance when Hamas uh were in Gaza when there was a blockade of Gaza by both Egypt and Israel uh and control of that U but we're now back to the point that the Israelis are opposite the Egyptians On the Border fence and actually one Egyptian Soldier killed in the last couple of days and what appears to have been an exchange of fire with the Israelis moving along the corridor so um it certainly is more tension Egypt arguing strongly that they have controlled the tunnels you know and saying as we've heard there it's an excuse Israel pointing out the ttles but to be fair it's not clear that all of them crossed the border um but they're certainly present along that area it was certainly a big Hamas operational area so I think Israel feeling Vindicated but perhaps not as much as they'd like Egypt feeling defensive but maybe with something to actually take on board here so a lot of surface tension how much it's going to really affect relations uh I think to be seen at the okay and what about um this National Security adviser to Benjamin Netanyahu saying that they expect the war against Hamas to go on for at least another seven months I mean if you think of the sort of conflict this is and you think back to say the war on terror or something like that the the military phase can sometimes be the easiest part of it and then you've got to build afterwards and this ties in I think with the um the US commentary that they want to see a plan for the day after the fighting stops because the fighting won't really stop I mean I don't think Israel can achieve a purely military Victory against Hamas that settles this and then there will be peace and rebuilding and prosperity this is going to be a long running um saw for Israel I think in terms of how they deal with the future security and rebuilding of the Gaza Strip uh and it's a real question as to how Israel avoids it going on not just another seven months but another seven years I think at various levels of intensity and certainly they haven't achieved their even stated military aims uh yet let alone their political ones okay well thank you for your thoughts appreciate your time that's Justin Crump thanks around
