organizers of the Eurovision song contest say they are assessing whether Israel's entry breaks the rules on political neutrality after it was claimed that singer Eden Goan song October rain made reference to the current conflict in Gaza well Israel has warned that it would withdraw from the competition if the ballot is censored well there are two specific sets of lyrics that have caused uproar I can read some of them to you now who told you Boys Don't Cry hours and hours and flowers life is not a game for the cowards now the reference to flowers is significant because according to the Israel hom newspaper it is a military slang term for war fatalities and these are the other set of lyrics that are being scrutinized there's no air left to breathe there's no place no me from day today well let's cross live now and speak to Adrien Bradley who joins us on the world today he's an Eurovision expert Adrian good to talk to you uh talk to me first of all about what the main controversy is here between the two sides between Eurovision and Israel so this there's been quite ongoing pressure from a number of countries that are entering Eurovision about Israel's participation in the Eurovision the Ebu have been very clear that they're not they don't want to ban Israel they've said that it's a competition for broadcast is not governments and they've said that the the broadcast itself has complied with all the rules but when it comes to the song The Ebu has really strict rules on politics in songs they' banned songs before and this is area where they're in dispute with Israel right now and it's we don't know exactly we we we've heard from papers some reports of What lyrics are ow and the broadcaster can publish the entire lyrics of the song for everybody to see on Wednesday night after these were leaked because the song itself wasn't due to be released um for another couple of weeks but the normal process is that the Ebu will approve or not approve a song and if Israel if it isn't approved and Israel don't make Chang ches or don't submit another song they won't be able to take part in Eurovision and it feels doesn't it Adrian that Israel is saying look we're not going to change the song it's this or we're out it does feel like that and there there's kind of been precedent for this in 2021 bellarus were disqualified this was around the political crisis that was going on in their country and the ACT their were told to change their song now this was a band that used to mock anti-government protesters in their songs and believed in the lyrics they've done that again they were asked to change the song they did actually put in a new song which the Ebu said was also inappropriate at that point they were disqualified and it also happened in 2009 Georgia had a had a song called We don't want we don't want to put in which the Ebu said the lyrics were criticism of a Russian leader which uh Georgia denied they refused to change it and pulled out of a contest that year so that there's been precedent for this it does sound like from all the statements that can be Israeli broadcasters made that they aren't going to back down so they're asked to make any ch to the song they won't take part um and we're getting very close to when there has to be a deadline so March the 11th is the deadline when all the delegations get together and the songs have to be agreed so if they haven't come to agreement by then they won't be taking part okay Adrien Bradley good to talk to you thank you very much indeed
