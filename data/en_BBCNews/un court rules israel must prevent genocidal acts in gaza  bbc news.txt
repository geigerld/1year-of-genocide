Jeremy we've heard point and Counterpoint we've heard the the legal mechanics but big picture what's next well big picture is that first of all we haven't heard from the Israelis what they're going to say I think we can guess they're not going to be at all happy with this uh under the terms of uh the court of which they are a member they are supposed to follow through and do all these things they will argue they're doing a lot of them already uh Israel this is one of the provisional measures Israel must take all measures to prevent any acts that could be considered genocidal including killing members of a group causing bodily harm inflicting conditions asde to bring about the destruction of a group preventing birth so it's not saying you've got to stop your War it's saying You' got to fight it in a very different way and Israel has been saying throughout it is fighting it within the constraints of international humanitarian law and this is the un's most senior Court saying that they're not doing that and they need to do it ASAP without prejudicing the uh consideration the court will give to South Africa's petition in over a long period okay Jeremy very grateful for your analysis really appreciate you being with us uh you mentioned the Israeli government there we will be hearing uh in around an hour's time from Mark regev who speaks for the Israeli government if you're just joining us you're watching BBC News we've been watching a ruling in the international court of justice which has been giving a provisional ruling on a case brought by South Africa against Israel a case of genocide one of the most serious war crimes if not the most serious War crime that can have action brought against it the icj rules on State against State cases both South Africa and Israel are signatories to the genocide convention which is why the icj has been ruling on this case we can go live now to the ha and our correspondent Anna hollan who's been watching proceedings in the court and Anna talk to us about the reaction when these preliminary rulings were given uh well uh we were inside the courtroom reaction there was very quiet as all the journalists were trying to follow exactly what this means what the judges have ordered is that Israel stick to its obligations under the genocide convention something that actually Israel has maintained it has done throughout this entire process ever since it responded to the Hamas attacks on the 7th of October uh so just to run through what uh judge Joan e Donahue said uh she ordered that uh Israel must take all measures within its powers to prevent any genocidal acts it must ensure there are no statements that could be seen as incitement to genocide I'm just looking at some of the reaction coming through already from various uh human rights groups this is being seen as a victory for South Africa which brought this case under the genocide convention and yet all the judges are really doing is saying that Israel must uphold its existing obligation something it says it's already doing uh to bring you a reaction quickly from Human Rights Watch uh they say the world Court's Landmark decision puts Israel and its allies on noticed that immediate action is needed to prevent genocide and further atrocities against Palestinian in Gaza to remind you uh genocide is the intent to destroy in whole in part an entire ethnic racial religious or national group that will be dealt with later on the merits of the case this is purely about the provisional measures requested by South Africa designed to prevent any escalation and any actions that could constitute genocide under the genocide convention okay Anna hollan who is in the ha for us Anna thank you very much really appreciate it let's go now to South Africa and speak to Kingsley maabela former Chief of Staff to uh South Africa's foreign affairs minister uh Mr makab thank you very much for being with us sir what is your immediate reaction to this ruling by the icj good afternoon what a pleasure to talk to you it's um the ruling actually um Vindicated sou Africa's concern about the possibility that there's genocide going on in G that's one H but the Judgment the Judgment was quite lengthy in spelling out what what what they think are Prim facty evidence that genocide may be going including statement made by Senor Israeli officials and so on so the take from this is is the responsibility of Israel as occupying power to take appropriate measures to prevent genocide I think that's what everyone takes out of that of course it was not expected that the court would interfere with the what is essentially a mandate of the security Council to order a ceas fire Sara didn't get that but Sara got at least the greater part of what it requested and and actually the majority of Judges voted in favor of S afa's View uh you mentioned an important point there there was no order of a ceasefire now you say that in many ways South Africa wouldn't have expected that but it's certainly something it would have wanted is there a feeling or will there be a feeling amongst Mr ramapo's office that this doesn't go far enough and that the court could have done more well in the absence of a a ceire judgment the responsibility of course is squarely a place on Israel to take I think that's that's enough on its own uh you would you would know there been a cronous debate within the security Council around the question of ceasefire of course Israel takes out of this judgment the fact that it wasn't ordered to um seize the hostility immediately but there are certain measures that are required to be implemented with immediate effect including preserving EV evidence there really it has been a very bad judgment for Israel in my view the icj Mr Mela does not have enforcement Powers it can issue this provisional ruling but it does not have enforcement powers and in any case Israel has not only said that it is already doing its utmost to prevent harm to civilians but it's also said that it may not adhere to any icj ruling how will South Africa react if that comes to pass well well it would it would be a very big problem in terms of pivate Regulation perception if Israel really refuses to implement any of the measures that the court came up with I think it will lose out in terms of the face around the world but U really um the question of Israel expecting not to honor this it's something else of course article 59 of the of the Court spells out that its decision is advisory but it's a prudent advisor it's very wise advis that one who think Israel would hit the call would heit this advice Mr M thank you very much for being with us
