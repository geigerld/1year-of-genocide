hello you're live with BBC News I'm Anna Foster here in Jerusalem Israel has intensified its military operations in the south of the Gaza Strip the IDF says it's hit more than 400 targets since a week-long truce between Israel and Hamas collapsed in the early hours of Friday morning well this is the scene live right now outside the al- NASA Hospital in the southern gazen city of Khan Yun the place that many people from the north have fled to Palestinian Health officials say at least 240 people have been Ked killed since the truce came to an end at least seven Palestinians were killed in an Israeli attack in the early hours of Sunday near Rafa we're also keeping an eye on what's Happening further north in Gaza this is the view live from Southern Israel looking across at the Gaza Skyline which since that fighting resumed we've seen once again regular plumes of black and gray smoke on the horizon and in the midst of all of this Israel has come under renewed pressure from Top figures in the Biden administ ministration in the US the defense secretary Lloyd Austin has said that Israel is driving the civilian population into the arms of the enemy and that that would be a strategic defeat well let's start with this report on the latest from our Middle East correspondent Hugo basher hunis in southern Gaza Palestinians have been seeking safety here now a target for Israel's attacks Hamas leaders are thought to be hiding in hunis and people have been told to evacuate further south the bombing of the city was the heaviest in the war so far residents say the Israelis told us that canun was a safe Zone which led us to flee here now even kanun has become a war zone where are we supposed to go our children are strand landed on the streets this was the scene when Aid arrived in huis a 100 lores with humanitarian supplies entered Gaza from Egypt yesterday eight agencies say it's still not enough in Israel the agonizing weight continues for the families of the hostages who remain in Gaza around 140 people are still captive Hamas says no one will be freed until there's a permanent ceasefire in Tel Aviv last night thousands gathered to call for the release of the hostages yena tanov whose 50 was freed with her mother just two days ago her husband Vitali was killed by Hamas their son Sasha remains in captivity I'm happy and excited to stand here in front of you I came to say thank you because without you I wouldn't be here and now we have to go back and get my Sasha the rally was interrupted by blaring Sirens warning of the risk of incoming Rockets prime minister Netanyahu spoke for the first time since the end of the ceasefire he insisted military pressure was the only way to free the captives we will continue the war until we achieve all its goals and it's impossible to achieve those goals without the ground operation from Israel's main Ally the United States a clear message he cannot repeat in the South what he did in the north I have repeatedly made clear to Israel's leaders that protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza is both a moral responsibility and a strategic imperative talks between Israel and Hamas have collapsed the families of the hostages hope for them to come home in Gaza people hope their guns will once again again fall silent well earlier Mark regev who is the senior adviser to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to the BBC about what will happen to Gaza once the Israeli government has eliminated Hamas so it'll be in a better bit situation because Hamas has been controlling Gaza for 16 years and not only that has has that been terrible and horrific for the people of Israel but that has been very sad for the people of Gaza because what have has Kamas bought the Gaza STP what have they bought the Palestinians in Gaza over the last 16 years poverty Bloodshed misery surely the people of Gaza deserve better than this extremist uh regime Terror regime that that doesn't give a hoot about the wellbeing of the people of Gaza and is happy to sacrifice the very last Gaza and as long as they can advance their very very extreme crazy agenda well our Middle East correspondent Hugo Basher is with me here in Jerusalem and that is a really important part of this whole story isn't it Hugo what happens if and when Israel managed to remove Hamas from Gaza what happens the day after that oh exactly and uh there have been discussions about the Palestinian Authority which controls uh the West Bank which is the other uh Palestinian territory taking control of the situation in Gaza so it is obviously you know something that has been discussed not only in Israel but also uh by uh Israel's Partners uh The Americans in in particular but I think now the main concern is about what is happening in Gaza right now as this Israeli offensive continues we've been talking about the humanitarian situation uh in Gaza and how the situation has been desperate for the population there because there have been widespread shortages of basic supplies humanitarian agid the the agid that is being delivered right now uh the UN Aid agencies have been saying that it is simply not enough to meet gaza's needs and we've seen pictures of hospitals now uh completely overwhelmed by the high number of casualties following these recent attacks having to operate with very limited resources so yes there is a lot of discussion about what is going to happen after and if Hamas is removed from power in Gaza but the situation right now is very concerning let's talk a little bit more about that Israeli military operation because we've seen twice now in the last few days both Lloyd Austin the US defense secretary and Anthony blinkin the US Secretary of State who was here a few days ago saying publicly that Israel needed to act according to International humanitarian law if they're saying these things in public like that does it suggest that they think that Israel is not listening to what they're telling them behind the scenes yeah I think it's very very interesting to see there has been a change uh in the tone from the statements coming from senior American officials uh the US uh defense secretary uh said uh yesterday that it was a moral responsibility to protect the civilian population of Gaza essentially suggesting that uh the ferocity of of the attacks in Gaza could drive people to support Hamas uh essentially saying that it could be driving your you know the population into your enemy's arms I think those were his words and the US vice president also saying that uh you know Israel has the right to defend itself but too many Palestinians have already been killed in Gaza so again I think the message has been very clear here that Israel uh needs to do more to protect the Palestinian population the civilian population of Gaza as he goes ahead with this offensive and that we uh Israel should not repeat uh in the South what he did in the north so uh Northern Gaza was the main focus of the initial phase of the Israeli offensive and we're see now that um you know most of the attacks or many of the attacks have been focused in southern areas of the Gaza Strip especially hunis which is a major uh city in in the South hundreds of thousands of of people have been Sheltering in hunis after fleeing uh Northern Gaza and this is where uh members of the Hamas leadership are believed to be hiding so it is a very desperate situation for the population there
