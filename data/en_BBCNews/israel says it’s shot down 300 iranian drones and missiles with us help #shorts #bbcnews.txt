the country is waking up after a very long night it wasn't really a surprise uh the country was sort of waiting for that to happen there had been warnings from the Israeli authorities as well and here in Jerusalem we heard the aate alert at around 2:00 in the morning and we you know almost instantly heard loud explosions indicating that air defense systems had been activated and again the Israeli authorities saying that 99% of the missiles and drones that were fired by uh Iran were intercepted this was an unprecedented attack for the first time ever Iran uh launched an attack a direct attack on Israeli territory so this is a very dangerous moment here uh but I think there have been some efforts already to try to deescalate tensions and perhaps the Americans telling the Israelis that do they do not support the idea of an Israeli retaliation
