within the last half hour the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza has announced that more than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since the conflict began on October the 7th well that number equates to about 1.3% of the 2.3 million population there let's go live now to Jerusalem and our Middle East correspondent Yulan Nell so it's quite a an extraordinary toll isn't it it is indeed and we're hearing from the Hamas Swan Health Ministry that there were more than 80 people killed uh overnight in the Gaza Strip most of those actually apparently waiting for Aid uh in Gaza City um when witnesses there say that there was shelling uh by Israeli tanks um and still an unclear picture um from about exactly what has happened there um but overall now this really uh Grim Milestone has been uh passed the uh Health Ministry in Gaza is really the only official source source of data that we have for casualty numbers um and uh it's the one that's relied on uh by the UN and others and it's saying that uh the majority of those who have been killed are women and children uh since the 7th of October and also more than 70,000 people have been injured as well these figures rely on bodies being brought in uh to hospitals or seen uh by medical workers so they can be uh properly registered um but actually it's thought that real death toll is going to be much higher than this because there are several thousand people who are still considered as being missing in Gaza many of them buried under the rubble of buildings that have been hit by Israeli air strikes now it's important to say that these figures do not differentiate between those who are civilians and and those uh who are uh Fighters with Hamas or other groups in Gaza uh when we've asked the Israeli military uh for comment here it says that uh some 10,000 people um terrorist ists are estimated to have been killed uh during their their operations and youand tell us about the latest progress on any on moves towards a ceasefire well still uh in the background here we have this big diplomatic effort going on to try to get a new longer term truce agreed that would see more of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza Freed at the same time and you have an Israeli delegation a Hamas delegation who are in in katar katar of course are key mediators here and the real hope has been um that a new deal can be agreed in time for the Islamic holy month of Ramadan which starts on about the 10th of March um there's a lot of us involvement here President Biden has spoken very optimistically about an agreement being in place by the start of next week uh but the other parties involved have sounded much more cautious there saying that there are still um big gaps to be bridged and I suppose one of the the issues is is if if they do do an exchange of of prisoners for for hostages the concern in Israel is always who they let out um as they saw that one of the people who they let out in in a prison exchange before was someone who then went on to plan the October the 7th attacks indeed so it's often mentioned uh by Israelis that um the biggest prisoner exchange that there ever was for an Israeli soldier held captive by Hamas and Gaza saw the release of Yahya Sina Who is the local uh Hamas leader in Gaza seen as a mastermind of the 7th of October attacks um that of course uh makes it very difficult for people to accept the notion of uh these these prisoner swaps and it is thought um that in exchange for some 40 of the remaining Israeli hostages held in Gaza that's um really a minority of them um that we would have in exchange for that some 400 Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails this is according to the reports that have been leaked out and they would indeed uh we're told include some who have been convicted of serious uh offenses of terrorism by Israel um they would be seen as having Israeli blood on their hands youan n with the analysis there from Jerusalem thank you very much
