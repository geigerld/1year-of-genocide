President Biden has urged Hamas to accept a new Israeli proposal to free hostages and bring about a lasting ceasefire Mr Biden speaking from the White House unveiled the three-part plan which would begin with a six- week ceasefire in which the Israeli Defense Forces would withdraw from populated areas of Gaza there would also be a surge of humanitarian Aid as well as an exchange of some hostages for Palestinian Prisoners the president said it was time for this war to end Hamas issued a statement saying it was ready to deal positively with any proposal offering a permanent Ceasar and a complete Israeli withdrawal well shortly after President Biden spoke Democratic and Republican leaders invited the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address a joint meeting of Congress the date of the speech has not yet been set our first report this hour is from our correspondent victon Maven after almost 8 months of Israeli response to the 7th of October attacks by Hamas Gaza lays largely in Ruins with the lives of Palestinians who call it home turned upside down more than 36,000 have been killed across the region according to the Hamas run Health Ministry hundreds of thousands are displaced and Aid is struggling to reach them the conflict has put the US Israel relationship under immense pressure but in a surprise move President Biden unveiled a new peace proposal and ceasefire offer from Israel I know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and we'll call for the war to continue indefinitely some some are even in the government Coalition and they've made it clear they want to occupy Gaza they want to keep fighting for years and the hostages are not a priority to them well I've urged the leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal to despite whatever pressure comes President Biden outlined a three-phase proposal that would begin with an immediate 6 we ceasefire at the same time Israeli forces would carry out a withdrawal from Gaza Israeli hostages in Gaza would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners and 600 trucks of humanitarian Aid would be delivered there each day in the second phase Hamas and Israel would negotiate a permanent end to hostilities the final phase would include a major reconstruction operation in Gaza with international support among those urging Hamas to get on board was foreign secretary David Cameron posting on social media let's seize this moment and bring this conflict to an end for President Biden resolving the conflict has become a political imperative ahead of elections in 5 months time he's been losing the support of some younger voters and Muslim voters both have been vocal in their dissatisfaction at events in Gaza for Palestinians in Gaza if hamus agrees to this deal it will be the start of a long road to rebuild some semblance of the lives they once had Vincent mcavin BBC News well with me now is Muhammad T from BBC Arabic to discuss this further Muhammad we've had proposals before what's in this one and what's new it is an Israeli proposal it does not uh include a permanent ceasefire it does not include a full withdrawal from the Israeli forces from Gaza which are the main two demands of Hamas so what is hamas's response to this so far Hamas said we are responding positively to this uh these proposals they say that President Biden said that he he mentioned permanences fire he actually me mentioned permanent cation of hostilities they say that he mentioned full withdrawal from Gaza he only mentioned withdrawal from the Israeli forces from the inhabitant areas uh how much pressure will be on Hamas now to accept this and what is the next stage do you see of these proposals going forward of course there is a huge H pressure on both parties on the Israeli parties uh party on on Hamas party to accept the ceasefire this war went so far with about 40,000 civilians died in Gaza with a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza no a single fully function hospital no school working and this and these civilians are really want want their life to come back again along with the families of the hostages that are expecting to to get the hostages back huge pressures from both sides to what extent they they would they would refuse this proposals and continue the War I highly doubt that and on the Israeli side Benjamin Netanyahu President Biden mentioned it even he's under pressure from within his own government to carry on the operation until what they see is the defeat of Hamas indeed these proposals from Israel would guarantee to to isra to to have presence in Gaza in in the inhabitant areas that this presence will allow them to restart the war at any time hunt Hamas members at any time being responsible in in the security in Gaza it is all about who will appear winning this war Nikki so if Hamas would accept uh that they go to these proposals without a guarantee of a permanent ceasefire permanent withdrawal they might appear that they lost the war and if the Israelis would accept any proposal that that would include permanent ceire full withdrawal they will appear that they lost this war M from BBC Arabic thank you for joining us with the latest on that
