well as we mentioned on Foreign Affairs President Biden confirmed that he had ordered the US military to build a temporary Pier off the coast of Gaza he said it would ensure a massive increase in aid for Palestinians he warned Israel that humanitarian assistance should never be used as a bargaining chip protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority as we look to the Future the only real solution to the situation is a two-state solution over and I say this as a lifelong supporter of Israel my entire career no one has a stronger record with Israel than I do I challenge any of you here I'm the only American president of isra Israel in Wartime but there is no other path that guarantees Israel security and democracy there's no other path that guarantees Palestinian can live in peace with PO with peace and dignity well let's speak to our Middle East correspondent yolan Nell who is in Jerusalem so we heard that warning to Israel that Aid should never be used as a bargaining chip how has that message gone down in Israel well we haven't had an official response but certainly it's been picked up as you'd expect by the Israeli media and that along with a promise by Mr Biden that Israeli hostages Who Remain uh in the Gaza Strip will be released that he is dedicating his efforts to working on that and we know that were of course um some Israeli hostage uh families and former Israeli hostages uh in the chamber where Mr Biden uh was speaking now a lot of focus here is on that plan for a new uh temporary uh port for Gaza a temporary Causeway that would be built to allow uh Supply ships bringing Aid um to get close to Gaza at the moment it doesn't have any kind of deep sea port um a lot more explanation of what exactly that that means um because there was a briefing given by the White House in advance of the State of the Union Address um it appears that a ships will uh go to Cyprus um and there Israeli Security checks will be carried out and then um there will be uh us warships uh or US military personnel involved offshore in the overseeing uh proceedings but there will be no us uh military boots on the ground in Gaza involved in the construction of this Causeway um we understand that it could take a month or two to complete um and of course that won't address then the immediate need uh to get Aid into Gaza but it does look like President Biden really wanted to have some kind of a concrete step to show that US military action was being taken amid a lot of frustration with its close Ally Israel um it's been calling for weeks now to increase the flow of Aid going into Gaza yeah do you think the fact that they having to build this pier is a sign that Benjamin Netanyahu isn't listening to the us about getting more Aid in on the ground well the calls from the US and uh from un agencies have been for Israel to open up uh more border crossings uh into the Gaza Strip to allow Aid to get through um and to allow Aid distribution to take place more effectively of course what we've seen is um the US and uh Jordan other countries resorting to Aid drops uh in recent days which is not a very effective way of getting Aid to those who need it the most um I mean is Isel does have its own container Port uh ashod just about a 40-minute drive uh to the north of the Gaza Strip there's been a lot of resistance in Israel to using its facilities to bring in Aid and so Aid at the moment is mostly going in um via Egypt it's flown in there and comes in through the crossings uh on the in the south of the Gaza Strip yanel in Jerusalem thank you very much
