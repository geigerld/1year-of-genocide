the United Nations says nearly a million Palestinians have fled their homes in the Gaza Strip in the week since Israel launched its military response to the killings and kidnappings by Hamas the entire Enclave has been hit by Israeli strikes from Gaza City in the north to Rafa in the South the border crossing there at Rafa with Egypt has remained shut since the Hamas attacks last weekend crowds of Palestinians and foreign Nationals have been gathering at the Crossing after new that an evacuation route made temporarily open our correspondent John donison sent this report and a warning that you might find some of the images in his report upsetting outside the main hospital in Rafa ice cream full some of the Dead have been here for two days yasak katab tells us these freezers are meant for food he says not bodies and this is right in the south of Gaza where people are now being told to evacuate to hundreds of thousands are now heading in this direction but Egypt says it won't open the crossing even for foreign Nationals until Israel agrees to allow Aid in and Hamas also controls this border and has a say on who is allowed out the nearby United Nations school is packed with those seeking shelter but it was already at full capacity before this latest evacuation order as Palestinians what did we do for this to happen to us Hannah alabi asks she tells us she ran out of the house Barefoot with nothing when Israel bombed her neighborhood and came straight to the school at noon today many were were praying one would think for better times many of those here are children still smiling despite it all around half gaza's population is under 18 and some are old beyond their years rames bahum is just 15 this is his fifth War I can barely stand it he says and look around you at all these kids ask them do you want to live or not we just want to be secure it goes on our dream is to live that's all we want John donison BBC News well the World Health Organization says an order by Israel to evacuate more than 20 hospitals in Northern Gaza is T to mount to a death sentence for some of the sick and injured the W has expressed particular concern for people on life support and newborn babies in incubator health centers in the South are also at maximum capacity tens of thousands of civilians are moving ahead of an expected Israeli ground offensive in Gaza earlier on I spoke to Dr Natalie Roberts she's the executive director of the humanitarian organization medson Frontier UK she described the Grim situation for the people of Gaza it is as you've described just now pretty catastrophic I mean they've had a week of Relentless bombing so thousands and thousands of bombs dropping down a very small piece of land in the North and the South of Gaza so producing many dead but many many many many more wounded at the same time with the electricity and water having been cut off now a week ago and we're getting to the point where really there is no access to clean water and no electricity to continue running the medical facilities anyway and now in the last couple of days these evacuation orders and and that's just led to Absolute chaos you know we have 300 staff in Gaza some of them have managed to move to the South are trying to transfer patients to the South some of them have no choice but to stay behind in the north and try and continue to run Medical Care in the north either way they're describing utter chaos and and a sense of Despair well I want to to talk a bit more about that because we've heard about journalists being targeted we've heard about air strikes on civilian infrastructure how dangerous is it for your teams on the ground I mean it's incredibly dangerous the majority of our teams are Palestinian so they they come from Gaza they live in Gaza they never seen anything to this scale before um we're seeing ambulances being hit we're seeing medical facilities being hit and as people were moving south yesterday they were saying they could hear the bombs they didn't feel in safety so they're you know they're incredibly worried about being caught up in this about being injured themselves many of our staff have lost family members um our International staff as well they're stuck in the same situation either having to to stay in the North or choose to move to the South and and and the same the same scenario applies to them you know even once they get to the South there's no way for them to stay they're trying to find you know a place on the floor somewhere in a school um on a mattress that there really is you know this this sense that there's no way out there's no Escape medson some Frontier is known around the world for its uh Aid work uh keeping away from politics how easy is it for your teams to operate around some of these border crossings like close to Egypt where the authorities there have shut things down I mean yes we're very used to working in war zones we're very used to negotiating our way into into war zones and to get our supplies in to get our our staff in um and currently at the moment the the only border crossing the Rafa border crossing is closed to us as it's closed to everybody else um so we can't get supplies in we can't get staff in we can't get our staff out so you know we're facing the same situation as everybody else at the moment despite the fact we've been working in Gaza for such a long period of time for the people who are fleeing um heading for that that border crossing the rougher Crossing what kind of support do they need I mean first of all they need to have some reassurance that they can travel in safety um that they can move in safety on the roads and we saw yesterday that that doesn't seem to be the case that the bombing continues even on these safe roads um we need them to be reassured that once they get to the crossing they will be allowed to cross in safety um that there'll be met with some sort of Welcome um and with humanitarian Aid if they manag to enter Egypt for example and also a reassurance that people can return home um I think there's a lot of concern that people don't want to leave their homes and they particularly don't want to leave Gaza knowing that they might never be able to go back so so obviously you know the reassurance of safety and the reassurance of you know you should be able to go home at the same time people have chosen to stay at home and people have chosen to stay working in the hospitals in Gaza City for example you know they they're terrified at now that means that they're labeled as a Target um and and there needs to be reassurance that hospitals will still be protected that Medical Care will still be protected even if people who stayed in the north of Gaza that was Dr Natalie Roberts from Medan sun frontier well the US has ordered a second aircraft carrier group to the Eastern Mediterranean according to American officials the USS Eisenhower is part of American efforts to deter hostile actions against isra or any efforts towards widening the war
