in the Middle East the United Nations says that it's had to Halt its humanitarian operations in Gaza it comes after the Israeli military issued a new evacuation order for the area where AID workers were operating from the UN is the primary Aid distributor inside the territory which has been devastated by 10 months of war between Israel and Hamas the UN agency unra one of the key humanitarian groups working in Gaza spoke about the deteriorating situation the space that people have been confined to is so minimal um there are tanks uh in areas that used to be designated as safe areas um and this is just another Testament to there being nowhere safe in the Gaza Strip people have nowhere to go there is nowhere to find safety it's very limited access to humanitarian resources um because the humanitarian operations are also being displaced Within These evacuations orders and the humanitarian response here is being completely strangled and limited to our ability of what we can do well elsewhere in the region Medics say one Palestinian was shot dead by an Israeli settler and five others were killed in an Israeli air strike in the occupied West Bank the Israeli Defense Forces confirmed the strike in noam's Camp east of the city of tarum and said its Target was what it described as a command room of a terasa let's speak to our Middle East correspondent yoland now first of all yand tell us more about this uh these incidents in the West Bank um so certainly n Shams is an urban refugee camp in the north of the West Bank it has seen successive Israeli military raids uh particularly since the start of the war in Gaza and we're hearing from Palestinian Health officials that there were five people who were killed in this air strike on house uh in the camp uh two of them were children aged 15 and 16 this is where the Israeli military has said um a command center had been set up by Palestinian armed groups um this was an attack that took place about 10:30 local time last night also um last night there's videos on social media where you can see um that people are rushing around in this small village uh close to Bethlehem in the south of the West Bank called Wadi Rahal um and these bursts of gunfire this is where local people say that armed settlers entered into the village late at night they started attacking homes when men went outside uh one man was shot and killed three other people were wounded there has been a real increase in Israeli military rates in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza with the Israeli military saying it's acting against what it calls terrorist groups and at the same time there has been this surge in Violence by extremist settlers um attacking Palestinians and taking over more land your land for the moment thank you very much let's go live now to rala and speak to Mustafa bouti General Secretary of the Palestinian national initiative Dr bouti thank you very much for joining us here on BBC News in is in Gaza um the IDF say that they give warnings to civilians when they're about to launch a strike to what extent if any does that happen in the West Bank well uh I don't believe they do that in Gaza but they definitely don't do any of that in the West Bank people suddenly find themselves subjected to air strikes it is important to remember that West Bank is an occupied territory by Israeli Army since 57 years and when Israel uses air strikes against occupied people it is a total violation of international law since the 7th of October Israel conducted 80 air strikes on different places in the West Bank in mainly in refugee camps like n Shams and the tul Karim refugee camp uh the outcome is that 640 people have been killed including no less than 170 children and all these 80 a strikes there were during there these attacks there were no warnings whatsoever Israel says that the Target in the West Bank was a command room of a terror cell is how they've described it to what extent the talks sorry do answer that well I don't think a 15 and 16 year children are are are Terror leaders I I think Israel lies and they continuously lie and the biggest lie here is that Netanyahu claims that he wants to have peace but at the same time Netanyahu does not want to end the war in Gaza by continuously undermining all negotiations and now he wants to expand the war into the West Bank but they just regarding those talks though Hamas have not even turned up have they no they have they've been in Cairo and they have received all the proposals and they've discussed them and they responded to them but they've not done so directly have they it's been via other conduits no no no we we never had Israel would not sit with Hamas to negotiate neither would the Americans all the time negotiations happen through mediators which are Egypt and Qatar so nothing changed Hamas was there but Netanyahu is under mining the this is not my opinion this is even the opinion of many people from the security Israeli apparatus and from the negotiating team who are leaking to the media that Netanyahu is undermining the negotiations cont continuously because he doesn't want to achieve an agreement he wants this war to continue he wants to keep his occupation of a and he knows that the end of the war is the end of his political career and he doesn't even care about the Israeli prisoners who are dying because of Israeli bombardment as well and of course these negotiations do go on and they're supposed to result in the hostage release as well as a ceasefire uh Dr Mustafa barouti from the Palestinian national initiative thank you for your time
