Israeli commanders have been deployed all over Gaza as the bombardment continues Hamas says its Fighters are involved in clashes with Israeli forces the Hamas run Health Ministry estimates at least 400 Palestinian civilians were killed overnight Aid agencies say they've lost contact with their workers after all phone and internet services were cut Heavy Artillery is pounding Gaza constantly the Israelis say they're making the Earth shake and as residents of one of Gaza City's refugee camps inspected what had happened in the night that was how it felt it's like an earthquake said aladi no one's paying us attention it's an execution many Palestinians believe Israel wants to force them out of Gaza and they interpret it as a threat not a warning when Israel's Army tells them again to move South from places like this as for the Israeli people prime minister benjaman Netanyahu issued a solemn warning the war inside the Gaza Strip will be difficult and long and we are prepared for it this is our second war of independence we will fight for the defense of the Homeland inot the Israeli town closest to Gaza the streets where Hamas killed civilians and soldiers 3 weeks ago today are deserted the danger didn't stop zela Cohen and her son driving down here to bring a picnic to her daughters who are doing their military service they sat down in a car park not far from the border wire the war they said was about survival Hamas had shown it wanted to force them out you can hear the War aren't you scared I'm scared but if my daughter here so I go I go where where she's she's here and you bring you bring lunch yes to all the soldiers you know when you live side by side with the people and you come to understand that you cannot trust them so what what what you do what the answer for that what any other Nation would have done much more that we are doing right now and I'm assuring you much more that we will ever do the new phase of Israel's assault started last night with dozens of air strikes Israel believes overwhelming military strength can pacify Gaza but military power alone has never brought lasting quiet let alone peace in this conflict's long history Israel claimed one of its strikes killed a senior Hamas Commander Israeli tanks and soldiers moved forward into the North north of the Gaza Strip gaza's visible from a hill in stot Israel will resist pressure for a ceasefire and there's another Factor the more Palestinians that Israel kills especially civilians the greater the levels of anger and outrage elsewhere in the Middle East among Israel's friends as well as its enemies now that doesn't guarantee that the war would spread but it does increase levels of anger and volatility in a part of the world that is already very fragile Israel's ground war has started containing it here is now the biggest political and diplomatic challenge in the world Jeremy bone BBC News in southern Israel in gazer itself most people are now unreachable the
