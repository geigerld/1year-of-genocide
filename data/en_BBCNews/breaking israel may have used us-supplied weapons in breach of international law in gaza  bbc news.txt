now we're just going to bring you some news that's been uh developing while we've been on air tonight the US government has said that Israel may have used us supplied weapons in breach of international humanitarian law in some instances during the war in Gaza these findings are in a review ordered by the White House let's find out more from our correspondent Tom bitman in Washington uh what more do we know Tom Jane this has been a long awaited report report by uh the state department here after as you say President Biden ordered a review of in fact seven countries and the way in which they were using us supplied weapons now that had come of course under growing pressure on the president particularly from Human Rights organizations and from parts of his Democratic base to investigate and verify whether or not Us weapons were being us used in breach of international humanitarian law in Gaza now such was the work that has gone into this the state here missed its own deadline on this by 3 days but we've had the report in the last 10 minutes and the key line is this it says it is reasonable to assess that weapons supplied by the United States have been used by Israeli Security Forces since October the 7th in instances inconsistent with International humanitarian law now that that is clearly a rebuke of Israel but it stops short of saying that that should then lead to any uh further withholding of us weapons because it says it takes its assurances about dealing with and investigating these incidents as credible so a very important line there uh I think it signifies the way in which President Biden has been caught in a bind between parts of his base who want more weapons withheld from Israel and those who say that he is already not showing enough support to his key Ally in the region
