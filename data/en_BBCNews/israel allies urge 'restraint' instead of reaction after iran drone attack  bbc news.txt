let's now talk about what is happening in the Middle East where the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reconvened his War cabinet following a missile and drone attack on Israel by Iran over the weekend Iran has sought to justify its attack saying Western countries should appreciate its restraint Israel's allies including the US and the UK urging restraint rather than retaliation our chief International correspondent Le duet has the latest welcome to Jerusalem well the big question across this region last week was what will Iran do next and now this week the same question is being asked about Israel it's War cabinet met last night for three hours to deliberate about uh Israel's response after that unprecedented attack by Iran in the early hours of Sunday morning 350 suicide drones cruise missiles and ballistic missiles and now again today the war cabinet has convened No statement yet about what they will do but reports coming out of the deliberations so far indicate that there is a consensus emerging that Israel will have to retaliate not now but at a time and in a manner of their own choosing this kind of tension is reverberating in capitals around the world including in New York last night where the UN Secretary General Antonio gues led a special meeting of the UN Security Council warning that the region was on the edge of an abyss it's one of the few places where Israeli and Iranian top diplomats can see each other face to face Israel underlined that Iran in his words had crossed all red lines Iran said its attack was a move of legitimate self-defense and today Iranian officials are saying that they acted with restraint that's not how Israel sees it or its allies let's just take a look at all the latest developments with this report from our Middle East correspondent yolan Nell Israel's air defenses called to action in the early hours on Sunday fighter jets battled waves of Iranian drones and missiles fired at Israeli targets it marked the first time Iran has attacked Israel directly from its own soil explosions could be heard widely including in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv Israel says that 99% of more than 300 drones and missiles launched by Iran were intercepted some of those that got through hid here in the sensitive never Team Air Force Base in southern Israel nearby 7-year-old am Huna was seriously injured when a missile fragment struck her house the children were frightened and wanted to run away from home and that's when the Missile hit our house the Israeli War cabinet met yesterday to plan its next move one of its members Benny Gans said Israel would exact a price from Iran when the time is right and last night the UN Security Council met in an emergency meeting following the attacks Israel called for sanctions on Iran and reiterated its right to a response this attack crossed every red line and Israel reserves the legal right to retaliate we are not a frog in boiling water we are a nation of lions following such a massive and direct attack on Israel the entire world let alone Israel cannot settle for in action we will defend our future Iran's ambassador to the UN told the meeting that its actions which were in retaliation for a deadly air strike on its Consulate in Syria were Justified these countries especially the United states have shielded Israeli from any responsibility for the Gaza Massacre while they have denied Iran inherent right to self-defense against the Israeli armed attack on our diplomatic premises amid Rising tensions the attacks have received widespread International condemnation the scale and nature of Iran's heinous assault the first direct attack from Iran on Israeli soil poses grave risks to the security and stability of citizens across the Middle East now world leaders are pressing for deescalation in a bid for calm in the region the Middle East is on the brink the people of the region are confronting a real danger of a devastating fullscale conflict now is the time to diffuse and deescalate all eyes are on Israel and how it responds yolan Nell BBC News Jerusalem so an a moment of unprecedented military action a war of words and intensifying diplomacy even world powers who normally disagree on most issues are now sending the same message the Kremlin in Moscow saying it was extremely concerned about the possibility for escalation the French President Emanuel Macon saying that everything had to be done to avoid an conflagration in the Middle East and this morning Britain's foreign secretary Lord Cameron has been sending a message to Israel to see uh its taking down of Iran's wave of projectiles as a victory and not to retaliate I think it's important to be respectful on these occasions a country has had a massive attack uh from a dangerous and malign actor in the region they will be considering they are considering the Israeli cabinet has been uh meeting already to consider that our advice is don't retaliate you know take the win recognize Iran has suffered a double defeat defeat as all the almost all their weapons were shot down and defeat because the world can now see their true nature that the right thing to do is to Pivot now and look at Hamas and say they must release the hostages so we wouldn't be supporting retaliatory action but we're respectful of other countries Lord Cameron well last night the UN Security Council two members the United States and the UK condemned Iran's strike and in the midst of this criticism Iran has spoken out again today a foreign Ministry spokesperson defended Iran's action saying it would acted in Restraint instead of making accusations the Western cont should appreciate the Islamic Republic of Iran's rest Str and responsible actions towards the stability and safety in the region Western countries should blame themselves and answer to public opinion for the measures they have taken against the seven months of war crimes committed the view from Iran well for a very long time Iran prided itself on what it called strategic patience in other words not responding immediately whenever it was provoked or threatened but in ton now senior military and political officials are using a new phrase they call it a new equation to get some insight into Iran's thinking we're joined by Muhammad Ali Shabani he's the editor of amaj media welcome to BBC News Muhammad thank you for having me this sounds like a very dangerous moment with Iran saying that from now on there is this new equation that when it is hit it will hit back immediately is that how you understand it those are the precise words of the U chief commander of the irgc indeed he stated that not only Iranian Personnel but any Iranian assets and interests that may be hit will receive a direct response from Iran and I think this is a a reaction more than an action and what I mean by that is that the April 1 bombing of the Iranian Consulate in Syria which initiated the uh Iranian attack that we saw on Israel was a kind of change in the rules of the game so to speak the previously diplomatic premises were off limits and Israel appears to have wanted to change that what we're seeing now from Iran side is to say okay we're going to change the rules of the game so will we so this is a very dangerous period because both sides are trying to lay out new rules of the game both sides aside from this tit fortat want to establish a powerful deterrence in other words to make it clear to their enemy that they there will be a cost if they do strike now there are some observers who say Iran strengthened its determins by showing its willingness to send this wave of missiles and drones but others say it has weakened it because almost none of them reached their target how would you see it I think there's always two different ways of looking at what happened uh to me the operation was carefully choreographed it was telegraphed in advance days in advance to Iran's neighbors to the United States Iran also made the launches of for instance drones from its own territory which meant that Israel had many hours of of forewarning I think that in a real life uh direct confrontation which Iran has warned that he will engage it unless if Israel continues to take action against Iran things will be very different there will be no advanced warning there will be no choreographing drones probably will not only be launched from Iran and most importantly of all Iran's Reg allies will also participate and in such a scenario I think very easily a group such as Hezbollah and Lebanon can overwhelm Israeli air defenses so I think what this episode told us all is that uh the countries which shot down many of the missiles I think did both Iran and Israel the faith they've acted to provide both sides with a faith- saving way out they allowed Iran to say that we can claim victory we took action that was unprecedented can also allow Israel to say that we also achieved Victory by shooting down most I hope that makes sense and how does Iran see its position in the region now of course it has its allies and proxies the so-called axis of resistance but beyond that it has been on the telephone repeatedly to foreign ministers in Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates how does it see its positioning now I mean one major shift is that only a few years ago countries such as the ones you mentioned Saudi Arabia and the UAE would have welcome a confrontation between Iran Israel or Iran and the United States um things are very different now because partly these countries have initiated normalization processes with Iran Iran is very eager to continue that process so I think there's a mutual desire in the region among Iran and its Arab neighbors to lower tensions and here I think they're joined by the US they're joined by Europe so I think the the owners right now is on Israel and this next steps mad Ali Shabani of amaj media thank you very much uh for joining us here on BBC News with your Reflections and insights into the thinking in Iran after this unprecedented attack Iran says it did inflict considerable damage it said its missiles did hit the nativo airbase in southern Israel Israel admits that yes indeed they did take a direct hit but say the damage was minimal so the again as always Lucy in in war it's the facts on the ground but it's also the perception of what what happened on the ground which tends to drive these conflicts Le is that there in Jerusalem
