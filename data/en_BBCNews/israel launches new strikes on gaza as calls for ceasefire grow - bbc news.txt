israeli aircraft have carried out dozens more airstrikes on gaza in the early hours of monday as the conflict enters its second week it comes hours after israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu rejected international appeals for a ceasefire officials in gaza said that nearly 200 palestinians had been killed in the past week 10 israelis died in rocket attacks launched from gaza well a series of attacks early on monday rocked gaza city for 10 minutes covering a broader area than the raids 24 hours earlier in which 42 palestinians were killed one local resident we spoke to said he had never seen strikes of this magnitude the israeli military said it had destroyed 15 kilometers of tunnels used by hamas it also said israeli aircraft had hit the homes of nine hamas commanders meanwhile more rockets were fired from gaza at the israeli cities of besheva and ashkelon no word yet though on casualties on either side in these latest attacks i spoke to our diplomatic correspondent in jerusalem paul adams and asked if there had been lenny let up this morning from either side uh no lucy in a word more rockets fired at israel what about an hour or so ago fired at ashkelon and some other towns in the south no reports of significant damage or casualties and we are as you say still waiting uh to get some indication of the damage caused by the israeli airstrikes on gaza overnight which clearly were very substantial indeed i think this is the second or third night in which we have seen really very very intense activity uh perhaps the pace of activity increasing uh as uh israel recognizes that maybe time is running short for uh to be for it to be able to carry on this operation um the the israeli defense forces are saying uh in a briefing this morning that this operation will continue uh for the time being that it may take a little while longer you mentioned the tunnels that were attacked overnight they were saying that this system which they call the metro under gaza consists they say of hundreds of kilometers of tunnels and they have been attacking them relentlessly for several days not to destroy every uh every every uh stretch of tunnel but to particularly target the the connections the the nodes between tunnels in an effort to make it impossible for hamas to operate uh in this network uh quite interesting details about what they're doing and uh and also no sign that it's going to come to an end any time soon paul antonio guterres calling for an end to what he calls utterly appalling violence i mean where are we at in terms of the diplomacy well there's a lot of it going on but but no discernible results so far an american envoy has been here since friday he has met israeli officials he's met israeli arab leaders because let's not forget we had several quite uh shocking violence on the streets of israel between jews and arabs and he has met palestinian leaders and there is also the involvement of the un uh with their coordinator here in jerusalem he is also conducting quite a lot of discussions one thing worth remembering about this is that it's complicated by the fact that because the united states regards hamas as a terrorist organization as do many other countries it has no direct contact so it has to rely on mediation involving other parties egypt and qatar are both involved in those conversations but so far to no obvious avail paul adams there i'm joined now by beltrue the independence middle east correspondent in jerusalem bell lovely to see you i know you've been speaking to colleagues and others in gaza today what have they been telling you well they said that last night was pretty ferocious once again i got a message from one of them at about 2 o'clock in this morning this morning saying that he had counted about 50 airstrikes in less than 10 minutes a lot of them are cowering at home with their children again it's a reminder that in gaza they don't have bomb shelters they don't have a system like the iron dome they don't have any early warning sirens although the israeli military say that they do often warn buildings especially high-rise buildings before they hit them in these kinds of intense levels of bombardment as we had earlier this morning those warning systems are not put in place so for many of the civilians they don't know where these things they don't know what the targets are they don't know where it's going to land and so they're sort of cowering in their homes um but as your correspondent said there it looks like there wasn't as high uh death toll as we had on friday morning which was the highest death toll in this week-long offensive well we're hearing really heartbreaking stories on both sides i know you've spoken to a father who lost his entire family and it seems like a miracle except for his little baby boy absolutely it was a strike that hit during that really bad night so sort of it was friday morning that took out an entire home there were two families in there actually um part of one larger larger family his wife and four children were in that building the entire building uh came down and we thought that all 11 of them were killed which is two women and the rest children but rescuers were able to bring out from the rebel a five-year five-month-old baby called alma the father hadn't been in the house that night he said his wife had gone to have dinner with her sister-in-law for eid because this is you know a religious holiday that's taking place at the moment despite the war she stayed the night with her sister-in-law and that proved to be a fatal decision but his baby was pulled out miraculously alive and is now being treated in gaza's larger hospital um ashifa but he of course is absolutely heartbroken he said to me his entire family was wiped out in an instant and didn't know why his family was targeted he said their children they were women they'd never fired rockets they were in their special clothes for eid having dinner together when it happened it is a miracle that the baby survived and you mentioned bel he's being treated at the largest hospital in gaza we are hearing that two senior doctors have been killed in some airstrikes as well how have the medical services and gaza been impacted by all of us well i was speaking actually to a spokesperson yesterday for medicine from frontier who run a clinic for burns units and supporting our shiva hospital which is as i said is the largest hospital in gaza they said indirect fire destroyed their entire sterilization unit they said that their staff is it was too unsafe for them to move around it was stuck at home it was massively impeding their ability to be able to treat the wounded this is the case across the strip actually the gaza's health ministry said several different medical clinics and hospitals had been hit not by direct fire i'll make that clear by indirect fire and at the same time as you mentioned two senior doctors were killed in their homes one of them gaza's only neurologist who was killed with his five children um in a massive bombardment on his streets in addition to that i've heard reports from medics both international and palestinian on the ground that the roads surrounding shiva hospital which is as i said gaza's largest hospital have been hit which has made it very hard for ambulances to be able to get access to the medical center and made it very hard for medics to be able to bring the wounded in so it's very very difficult at the moment for them to be able to treat the wounded and they say you know this could mean that the death toll is actually higher than it needs to be and what is happening bill in terms of other infrastructure in gaza what are you hearing about the damage done to things like power lines and what could potentially happen to fuel and water supplies as well well i was actually just speaking to uh palestinian officials yesterday about the fuel issue now gaza already suffers from massive electrical power outages at the moment uh there's only four hours of power a day for those families that actually have access to the grid so there's also places where they have no power whatsoever and that is because gaza is running off one of only four turbines left of its power plant and it according to the their statistics their fuel will run out basically tomorrow which means that one turbine will stop working completely there is some power lines coming from israel but they've been severely impacted it's only operating at about a third of the power as it normally would have because several lines have been hit by the fighting there is some confusion over who's responsible for that so the israelis have said or israeli security officials have said that um rockets that have not made it over the border are responsible for targeting those lines whereas the palestinians say it's the air strikes but either way the same outcome is going to happen which is that people across the across the strip which is only 40 kilometers long but home to 2 million will not have any power that will impact hospitals who will have difficulty trying to run their icu units their ventilators and the water supply because water pumps will not be working so we're talking about humanitarian crises over humanitarian crises at an incredibly difficult time for the population of gaza
