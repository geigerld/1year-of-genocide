go live now to Southern Lebanon our Middle East correspondent Hugo Bea is there for us and Hugo welcome to you the situation there is also one that the world is keeping its eye on because there have been those rocket attacks haven't there from your location into Israel Hugo so tell us what's happening there yes samanth and this morning we had an announcement from the Israeli authorities saying that they would be evacuating villages in Northern Israel uh next to the border with Lebanon 28 uh communities to be evacuated we don't know whether this is a mandatory or a voluntary uh evacuation but the reality is that most of the residents have uh already left in some of those communities my colleague uh Anna Foster has been to some of those communities in recent days and she said that most people have left because of the violence that's been happening that in that part of the country and um one of those communities is the community of Shula where yesterday A man was killed the first Israeli civilian to die as a result of an attack carried out by Hezbollah here in southern Lebanon and uh this announcement came a day of of intense exchange of fire between militants here in Lebanon Hezbollah and the Israeli military and I think uh in the last few minutes we had some reaction from a spokesperson for the Israeli military saying that those attacks yesterday attacks that were uh carried out by Hezbollah happened uh after Iran gave orders uh to the group to carry out these attacks so this is reaction from the uh Israeli Army a spokesperson for the Israeli military again showing how tense the situation uh is along the uh Lebanese Israeli border and obviously hasbalah is supported by Iran uh and I think there's been a a lot of pressure uh in recent days from Western countries warning Iran against escalating uh the situation here and uh and the Iranian foreign minister has been visiting some countries in the region he was here in Lebanon uh where he met the leader of Hezbollah uh Hassan nzala and uh he also reacted to those comments being made by Western leaders saying that well if the United States wants to prevent an escalation of the conflict it should tell Israel to stop uh the aggression in his words against civilians in Gaza so again it shows how volatile the situation is and I think there are fears that Lebanon could uh you know be dragged into this conflict okay Hugo thank you very much for dating us there from Southern Lebanon
