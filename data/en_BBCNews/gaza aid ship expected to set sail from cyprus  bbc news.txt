start with the war in Gaza and a ship carrying humanitarian Aid is expected to set sail to the territory from Cyprus this weekend it's part of a planned Maritime Aid Corridor it's a joint operation between the EU us UK and United Arab Emirates aiming to bring supplies from Cypress to the coast of Gaza the UN says a quarter of gaza's population is on the brink of famine and children there are starving to death organizers hope the plan could allow additional Aid to be brought in in but they contined to press Israel to allow more deliveries by Road these are the latest pictures from lanica in Cyprus as you can see Aid is being loaded onto a ship which is due to depart in a couple of hours the European Union's ambassador to the US told the BBC a little more about the plans for the maritime Corridor hopefully the p uh the pilot the first try to to to get Aid already happened over the weekend but uh it it takes some time to make sure that uh it's not only once in a once in a time but it's a sustainable way to provide aid for the for the people in in Gaza and Palestine to make sure that we alleviate ease the situation in in the region Cyprus for a long time have been a a part on on the way uh to uh to to the region so hopefully this could really help because five of the EU member states is is on board and uh and we see it as the possibility to to increase fre the aid and to have a possibility to provide it as soon as possible here's Pentagon spokesperson Patrick Ryder importantly there will be no US forces on the ground in Gaza finally in terms of timing we're working to set this up as quickly as possible but we expect that it will take several weeks to plan and execute once operational the actual amount of Aid delivered will depend on many variables and will likely scale Over time however we expect that deliveries via jots could provide more than 2 million meals to the citizens of Gaza per day for the latest on the maritime Aid corridors I spoke to our Middle East correspondent W Davis in Jerusalem of course there are several possible routes to get Aid into Gaza where there is a huge humanitarian crisis uh children dying from malnutrition a real risk of famine according to the UN 300,000 people particularly in Northern Gaza without any real adequate food or Aid some trucks are getting in clearly not enough so uh the U EU uh the UAE and other organizations have come up with this plan for a sort of a maritime Corridor and this would entail a ship leaving Cyprus today car towing a barge and on that barge would be around we understand 200 tons of Aid problem is that when it gets to Gaza there's no port in Gaza there's a war going on there's no obvious way to safely uh remove and then distribute all of that Aid and it's a real logistical nightmare we've been asking questions but haven't really had any satisfactory answers this is a test run this weekend if it works and it's a big if I think then that will become a regular route for aid from Cyprus towards Gaza of course we then got the separate Joe Biden plan to build a temporary Port facility off the coast of Gaza uh that would be built by American Army Engineers but critically no American boots on the uh military boots on the ground but that's two months away at the very least all the while the aid agencies is saying look the best way to get Aid into Gaza is through Israel uh let's try and persuade the Israelis and I know Lord Cameron the UK foreign secretary has been talking to the Israelis about opening up the port of ashod that is just to the north of Gaza it's a huge container Port it's only half an hour 40 minutes away from the eres Crossing into Gaza and that would be uh the aid agencies in particular say a much more practical way of getting badly needed Aid into Gaza meanwhile while that's not happen happening while there's a disagreement between the Israelis and various agencies and there is no ceasefire this Maritime Corridor is the favored method of hopefully getting Aid into Gaza although it probably won't be enough and what the are the Israelis saying about um their military campaign and the latest from there it's interesting you know this ceasefire that everybody had hoped would be in place this weekend simply hasn't happened the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his priority uh a couple of days ago at a military graduation ceremony he said that Israel will continue its military operation in southern Gaza not to do that would be to admit defeat despite the international pressure Mr Netanyahu acknowledged the level of pressure he's coming under to to agree to to a cease fire to allow more Aid in but I think reading between the lines for for Mr Netanyahu his priority is this as he would see it this unfinished military business in Gaza and what more of any hopes of ceasefire talks with Ramadan approaching now just hours away yeah that that's a really good question I think they haven't given up on that Hamas have left Cairo now but the Qatari and Egyptian mediators are ready to to talk to Hamas and the Israelis indirectly hopefully get them back around the table and agree to a a 40-day Seas fire that's the this Paris framework uh if that doesn't happen the war continues if it happens and there are significant obstacles to allowing it to happen but if it happens then of course one of the big beneficiaries would be more Aid officially to a to get into Gaza uh through roads through Israel which is a much more effective and efficient way of getting Aid to the people who need it
