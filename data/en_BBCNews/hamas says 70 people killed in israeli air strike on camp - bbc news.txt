at least 70 people have been killed by an air strike in the AL magazi refugee camp in Gaza according to the Hamas ran Health Ministry body bags have been piling outside the alaxa hospital where many of the victims were taken Israel says it's investigating the incident it comes amid scaled back Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem and across the occupied West Bank let's take a look at some live pictures this morning we're showing you now the scene in southern Israel on the border with Israel looking out to gasa our correspondent Joe Winwood has been monitoring the latest developments for the people of Gaza there is no rest bite this was once a residential block reduced to Rubble multiple generations of families are said to have been killed seemingly caught unawares we were having dinner when suddenly the bombing started without any warning in instant our house collapsed the victims were taken to the nearby al- AXA Hospital in a population as young as this children are so often the victims this incident already has one of the highest single death tolls since this War began and it is expected to rise the Hamas run Health authorities say more than 20,000 people have now been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its offensive Israel maintains it tries to avoid civilian casualties and blames Hamas for hiding amongst the population yes yes the IDF released new footage showing what it says are tunnels under the strip used for military purposes Hamas operates from civilian areas it uses them to cover its terrorist activity it is a very complex challenge that we face and we do it well so our forces in the field achieve good results like the Brigade that found the tunnel Network while the vast majority of Destruction has been in Gaza the west bank has not been spared in the place where Christianity was born they marked the birth of Christ by remembering the deaths this conflict has brought we used here to have the lightning of the tree Christmas tree in the middle here and we used to have a big Christmas Market in the playground down in the school and we used to celebrate every night at least for a week before but this year we are just praying By Night the Holy Mass and we will pray for peace but those prayers are yet to be answered this has been the most devastating conflict between Israelis and Palestinians in modern times and it shows no signs of ending Joe Inwood BBC News now let's go live to Cairo Egypt where we can speak to Sadam s he's the regional development lead at anera that's the American near East Refugee Aid NGO now I understand uh s Saddam that you have been coordinating some of the aid that is going through to Gaza from the Rafa Crossing tell me about the situation when it comes to Aid at the moment um thank you for hosing me um today and Merry Christmas to everyone um I've been deployed as an era um uh I'm already I'm I'm based in Jordan I've been deployed to Egypt since the beginning of the war trying to coordinate the entry of Aid um through Egypt to Gaza so far anera been um you know a little bit successful in um in allowing some of the aid to get in into Gaza that you know we're focusing on food um so far anera been been able to distribute over 8 million food barcels vegetables baskets doing shelters cleaning um we were able to do over 1 million medical treatment um for the health facilities inside inside Gaza with five bbub health clinics um and and winterization inside Gaza as you know you know we're we're looking inside Gaza the situation is very dire we're looking at nine out of 10 people who are eating less than one meal a day um and and and this is a a testament you know by uh the world food program and the integrated food security uh classification that was activated just recently that is uh ringing the alarm that we're looking into a famine in Gaza um we're looking at 85% of Gaza that is being displaced we're looking at 1.9 million people out of their homes and San how much relief has this UN resolution the security council's vote last week made if anything in terms of a difference to the aid that's getting through unfortunately since the very beginning of the war and this is a a reality humanitarian Aid um is um is not enough um the amount of trucks that are are are going in inside Gaza are not enough on normal day before the war we were looking at minimum 500 trucks going inside Gaza today we're looking at less than 100 trucks going inside Gaza and we're looking into a a catastrophe because the displacement the need is massive um children are reported who have dehydration they're not eating um they the word food program are saying nine out of 10 people are eating less than one meal a day so that is a testament that the aid that is going in is not enough and we need more of that uh and we need more humanitarian Aid to be allowed in there are many organizations like anera who have great responses the very beginning of the war because of the humanitarian situation inside Gaza that we need to support and push for more humanitarian Aid to get in inside Gaza and Sadam is there anything more your contacts and on the ground can tell us about this air strike today at the Alm uh Al magazi refugee camp uh we're hearing that at least 70 people have been killed that absolutely absolutely like we have a team um we've been operating in Gaza for over 45 years our team are from Gaza humanitarian workers are um are at at a critical position you know because of the communication blackout uh uh uh uh the bombardment that is happening in a very um chaotic way we're we're hearing every day from our team about the risk of Distributing aid but as well about the bombardment that is happening all over Gaza that is challenging the humanitarian distribution inside Gaza that is creating barriers even if you have Aid it's still very difficult to get that Aid to where it's needed so we need a ceasefire we need more humanitarian Aid getting into Gaza to support children women the people who are the 85% of people who are displaced inside gazan okay Sadam s from anera thank you very much for bringing us up to date on the work that your organization does and on the situation in Gaza thank you well we can now cross live to Bethlehem and join our correspondent there Shima Khalil uh shimer a much more subdued Christmas this year reini Bethlehem feels and looks very very different Christmas is supposed to be the height of the season of celebrations here in Bethlehem the eyes of the world would have been on this place the birthplace of Jesus for celebrations leading the world into uh the marking of Christmas and yet it looks nothing like its festive self I've been here for days and I've been at the at manger Square where the huge Christmas tree is supposed to be where it would be heaving with activity with pilgrims and tourists celebrating Christmas none of that is happening instead yesterday at in the place where the tree was supposed to be many uh dozens of Palestinian children held a flag a Palestinian flag and waved it with a message of solidarity for gaza's children the scouts were holding banners saying we pray uh for Gaza Gaza is in the heart and you do feel that these images that come out of G AA including of course from Al maazi where you what with what you saw in Joe's report and what you've been reporting they hit very close to home here because many here um also have family and friends trapped inside Gaza I spoke to one young man who's on the phone to his father and his father is trapped in a church in the east of Gaza City and his dad was telling me there's just destruction all around us and they're very reluctant to move because he says that the roads leading to areas in the South are extremely dangerous but also he said that many people who have moved to supposedly safer areas um have been killed and that's the complaint that you hear even from people that made it out of the razi they've been evacuated from Gaza City to come to Central Gaza only to be hit like they had last night shim I wanted to ask you um as well about reports that we're hearing that Egypt has now put forward a new proposal for a ceasefire we've been hearing in the last week or so that talks have resumed and then we haven't really heard much more what more can you tell us about these latest reports shimer yeah this is another proposal from from the Egyptians remember when isma Hana was in Cairo last week there was a bit of hope that the negotiations could be underway s serious negotiations would be underway they've hit a setback when Hamas came out and said there will be no deal to exchange hostages without a ceasefire which is out of the question for um the Israeli government this is a three-phase proposal um which could see um which could see weeks uh of separate weeks uh of humanitarian pauses but crucially negotiations on the initial uh on on releasing the um all civilian hostages in the first phase then uh female soldiers in the second phase and then um all the hostages ultimately in exchange for several Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and and and crucially H the hope is and for a push for these humanitarian pauses we've heard uh reports from the Israeli media of officials saying the cabinet the war cabinet is going to meet later today to discuss this an official was saying look this is a first draft there are going to be many other drafts until a decision is made and we we've heard that several times remember reini with the UN resolution a as well but potentially this could lead to some serious negotiations but I think what doesn't change is The Stance of both sides remember Israel has suffered one of biggest losses Soldier losses um in the last 48 hours and Benjamin Netanyahu has had to acknowledge this but said the war is not going to stop this is going to be a long War Hamas keeps firing Rockets H in Israel this week sirens were sounding near T aiv and unless that's those two stances budge humanitarian Aid and that ceasefire is not going to be possible and I think this is where the biggest the big challenge for Egypt and other negotiations negotiators is going to be difficult Christmas this year for so many sha Khal reporting for us from Bethlehem thank you very much
