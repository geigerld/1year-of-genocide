hello I'm Lucy gray the Israeli military says its forces have advanced deep into the Gaza Strip the IDF said a joint action of ground sea and air forces had seen troops break through Hamas front lines of Defense in the north of the Gaza Strip and Israel forces were at the gates of Gaza City the Palestinian red presentant says overnight loud explosions and shelling could be heard in the city including close to Al's Hospital meanwhile more people are hoping to leave Gaza today following International efforts to open the Raffa Crossing to Egypt Gaza border officials said the crossing would continue to operate some 7 and a half thousand foreign passport holders would be able to leave Gaza over about 2 weeks Palestinians who've been wounded are also expected to be taken to Egypt where they'll be treated in a new field Hospital our Middle East correspondent yolan Nell has our first report which contains material you may find upsetting gazans call it their gateway to the world finally yesterday the Rafa Crossing opened for the first time in more than 3 weeks some foreign citizens were allowed to leave the war zone for Egypt including some Britains though details weren't given but many others are still waiting so this is the third time to came to the border and nothing happened as they're told your name is not there so I have to go back to the school to the Shel call the shelter waiting for the bom at the other end of the Gaza Strip in jabalia more Israeli strikes Hamas says nearly 200 people were killed here in 2 days and across the region the humanitarian crisis deepens the head of the biggest UN agency in Gaza entered to see for himself I was shock by the fact that everyone there was asking for food food was asking for water we I saw almost every children trying to express their way that they need to eat they need to have water but the war continues relentlessly 24/7 it's almost 4 weeks since Hamas gunman stormed the border and killed 1,400 Israelis Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by the UK government here the Israeli Army shows what it says are the weapons used against its citizens in the 7th of October attacks pull out the safety throw this into a room close the door shut and uh it takes the temperature inside the room to 3,000 de during the explosion it burns incinerates everything inside the room nothing comes out siren warning of incoming Rockets interrupted the event near Tel Aviv when Hamas launched its attack a retired Israeli General Noam tibon drove down from from Tel Aviv to rescue his son's family using a rifle from a dead Israeli soldier he fought his way towards their home this is the biggest failure in the history of the state of Israel it was a military failure it was an intelligence failure and it was a failure of the government with both sides now preparing for a long difficult war in Gaza those who are making it out of Rafa are the lucky few most are left to face the fighting feeling nowhere is safe yoland Nell BBC News Jerusalem well let's speak now to Anna Foster our correspondent who's in southern Israel and the air strikes continue and particularly um let's talk about jabalia the refugee camp that we were Hearing in Yul land's piece there that there have been more strikes there and the UN Human Rights a agency talking about how this could am amount to war crimes so we had confirmation uh late yesterday that there had been another Israeli strike on jabalia uh and we'd seen two the day before one on the refugee camp area which is a lot of people packed into a very small space and one on the town now Israel say that they in those three separate air strikes that they destroyed uh Hamas command and control infrastructure they say that they um they killed at least one senior Hamas Commander and and various Hamas cells um the problem is of course that they are working in these builtup civilian neighborhoods now the Israel Defense Forces told people living in Gaza to move South particularly in the north of Gaza because they said that would be the focus of their operations that would be the battlefield but for many people they weren't able to to move South and for those who did and found themselves displaced with no homes here living in tent Sheltering where they could in the streets no food no water in this desperate humanitarian situation we know that many people chose to go back to the north again and there have been questions raised about whether or not Israel should be targeting these civilian areas now Israel says that Hamas are using those civilians as human Shields and therefore in order to try and eradicate Hamas from Gaza which is their state at aim after those attacks on October the 7th they need to focus on the command and control centers you know the places where Hamas infrastructure is both on the ground and buried underneath it uh but the problem is when you think of the size of Gaza how small it is a lot of that is wrapped into civilian areas and that is why we are seeing after these strikes these numerous uh civilian casualties often as well of women and children and President Biden has now said that there has to be a pause in fighting to facilitate the release of hostages at least uh but Israel still pushing back on any idea of pausing things isn't it yeah Israel are very clear that that this is a an existential fight for the the security and and the existence of the Israeli Nation you know they they have been pointing to other countries around the world and they say when there have been similar barbaric attacks on their soil then these countries these countries push back um the problem is with with Gaza as we've been reflecting is that it is as we were saying a very small very small place with a very dense civilian population it's not a place that people can choose to leave if you think of of War zones in other parts of the world often the civilian population when War breaks out have the opportunity to leave but of course in Gaza um access in and out is controlled by Israel um so the more than 2 million people who who live there they can't actually leave Gaza at all the best that they can do is move to another part of the strip away from the fighting and you were talking there about the raff of Crossing you know Yan's report we saw some people starting to leave foreign passport holders some people with duel nationalities but as yoland was reflecting there that is really only a very very tiny fraction of the number of people who are stuck inside Gaza during this this ongoing at times constant bombardment thanks very much Anna Foster for us there in southern Israel let's go live now to Aman and we can speak to Toby frier spokesperson for Unice I suppose that is the one positive that's happened yesterday was this 400 people able to leave Gaza and among that some injured people and and this setting up of a field Hospital in Egypt what can you tell us about that yeah I mean it's it's very hard to find positives obviously at the moment but I think you know UNICEF welcomes the you know opening of the Border particularly for Urgent uh medical cases and and especially for children you know we welcome that we've been supporting the the government of Egypt providing some medical supplies for that fied Hospital close to the ra border crossing but what we really need to see is obviously a stop to to the killing of children and the maming of children which continues to go on and we've seen the the Carnage recently in in jabalia um and and that's really our number one goal is to keep pushing for that immediate humanitarian Seas far as the UN Secretary General said UNICEF has said numerous times and and we keep saying that day in day day out because the new normal is really horrific right now and can you tell us how and who is deciding uh who gets to leave who is it that's going in and deciding which injured people are being able to be taken to this field Hospital in Egypt well it's very difficult for me to provide you know specifics on who's coming in coming out uh but I think the number one thing is that urgent cases particularly children are able to go out and get the critical medical support that they need and the reason is the medical facilities inside the Gaza Strip are at such strain already you know massively massive strain limited access to medical supplies we heard from the World Health Organization the cancer hospital is is really uh you know you running out of fuel almost shutting down so it's a Breaking Point essentially inside the Gaza Strip so any relief at least for for very for injured civilians injured children is is welcome I see that msf Midtown s Frontier has got a few people who left yesterday some of their staff working there left yesterday they're know they're regrouping and and uh getting more people ready to go in if they can get them in are you getting the sense that Aid workers inside Gaza are wanting to leave well I mean you se you know in un we have a rotation policy for international staff members uh you know to bring new people in when you can to to to Fresh up new new uh individuals to support the humanitarian response the number one thing really is is as we say is sort of around staying and delivering because now the needs are so immense you know across the Gaza Strip to do whatever we can on the ground with our staff in the area to provide that access to lifesaving supplies you know medical equipment water particularly and sanitation hygiene kits Etc to get particularly to the shelters that are so densely populated right now and do you know anything about how negotiations are going in terms of uh the discuss discussions about a possible pause to allow the humanitarian Aid workers and more Aid in uh do you get any insight into that I mean obviously we've heard from President Biden today talking about how there has to be a pause he was talking about it so that the the hostages could be brought out or got out somehow um but do you know how those negotiations are going at all well I mean we do advocacy with whoever we can to get a pause to get a humanitarian ceasefire uh that's the number one thing right now because we also need to scale up uh the life-saving supplies that can get inside the Gaza Strip so some Aid has been as we say you know trickling in but it's nowhere near enough I me you and secret General said it's completely inadequate um and and that's so absolutely vital that we can scale up those numbers of trucks coming in with with the life saving supplies medical equipment water because the the issue now is that children are being killed injured every day but also there's the threats of outbreaks of diseases and other issues arising you know staff members talk about their children being forced to drink salty water and suffering from dehydration diarrhea Etc so it's it's Absol urgent now that we scale up that that access okay well thank you very much for talking to us Toby fricker there from UNICEF
