we begin with the latest in the Middle East President Joe Biden is to speak with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later today and that's as Israel faces Global condemnation for what what it calls a mistaken air strike that killed seven Aid workers in Gaza the United Nations has suspended overnight Aid operations in the strip for at least 48 hours to evaluate Security in the wake of the attack on Monday the head of the charity that the victims had worked for has accused Israel of deliberately targeting his staff Israel's economy Minister near barcat says it's nonsense to suggest that the IDF deliberately targeted Aid workers describing the incident as a tragic mistake sea Dilly reports John Chapman James Henderson and James Kirby the three British men among seven Aid workers killed by Israeli air strikes earlier this week they were working for an aid charity their humanitarian mission to distribute food but what I know is that we were targeted deliberately nonstop until everybody was dead in this Convoy humanitarians and civilians should never be paying the consequences of War this is a basic principle of humanity at the at the time this looks like it's not a war against terrorism anymore seems this is a war against humanity itself Israel says it will investigate but it insists the aid workers died as a result of a tragic mistake there's no way in the world that Israel would Target people that come to give people Aid that's nonsense I'm sorry give us a bit of uh of respect that we we care about those people and it's the same people that helped Israel we will never Target people like this targeted or otherwise their deaths are among thousands in International concern is growing even among Israel's closest allies it doesn't really matter how they made the mistake at the end of the day you have seven dead Aid workers who are there trying to deliver humanitarian assistance in non- diplomatic speak America is losing patience other allies including the UK are also applying pressure on Israel responding to concerns about a growing humanitarian crisis of course the extra Aid won't work unless there is proper deconfliction unless Aid can be taken around Gaza and we avoid the Dreadful incidents like we see we've seen in the last couple of days that is vital and Britain will be watching very closely to make sure that that happens and 600 prominent lawyers including three retired Supreme Court judges say they're watching how the UK government reacts in a strongly worded letter to ministers they say the UK risks breaking international law if they don't stop providing weapons to Israel the UK prime minister Rishi sunak said an independent investigation should take place into the death of Aid workers but he stopped short of agreeing to cross-party calls to suspend UK weapons exports to Israel sea Dilly BBC News well our Middle East correspondent yolan Nell brought us this update from Jerusalem well we have the Israeli military saying that it's conducting this thorough and transparent investigation um it's also viewing proceedings and saying that it's looking at setting up a joint situation room where you would have the Israeli military working with International organizations to coordinate the distribution of Aid on the ground I mean there's still continuing diplomatic Fallout from all of this and we have been hearing um that the US President Joe Biden is expected to speak for the first time since the killing of these Aid workers um he supposed to speak to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he's previously said he's outraged and heartbroken by what happened but what he hasn't shown yet is any willingness really to kind of uh use more of the US leverage against Israel um when it comes to its dis dissatisfaction over the conduct of the war particularly when it comes um to uh US military assistance that is given we had overnight comments that were made um by uh the US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin talking to his Israeli counterpart yoav Galant we're told that he was demanding concrete steps um to improve the coordination with different foreign aid groups said that this was all going to complicate efforts um to to flood uh Gaza with agid which was the commitment that they had had uh from the Israelis and also um made a connection here between Americans concerns about uh the idea of a ground offensive by Israel a fullscale ground offensive in Rafa in the very south of the Gaza Strip because uh the the US concerns about that have really been on humanitarian grounds because of the numbers of displaced people there interestingly we also heard some comments from an Israeli diplomatic correspondent about Rishi Sak's conversation uh with the Israeli Prime Minister um particularly related to the the deaths of the three um Britain who were killed in this Israeli air strike in Gaza and he was saying the correspondent said that if there was no change um in the the situation regarding humanitarian Aid getting into Gaza then the UK might have to declare Israel in violation of international humanitarian law that's something that would have uh real consequences um Downing Street has not wanted to go uh Beyond its initial kind of readout of that conversation between the two prime ministers uh hasn't directly commented on what we've heard here in Israel
