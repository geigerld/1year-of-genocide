welcome to the program we're going to start in the US the Senate approved a $95 billion Aid package for Ukraine Israel and Taiwan the approval comes after months of political arguments Senate Republicans are still divided on the bill and previously voted it down it includes $60 billion for ke 14 for Israel 10 billion for humanitarian Aid in Conflict zones including Gaza the bill now heads to the Republican controlled House of rep Representatives where we don't know what will happen so it's not a done deal yet and in the last hour the US President Joe Biden said this America can be trusted America can be relied upon and America stands up for Freedom we stand strong for our allies we never bow down to anyone and certainly not to Vladimir Putin as I've said before the stakes in this fight extend far beyond UK Ukraine if we don't stop Putin's appetite for power and control in Ukraine he won't limit himself just to Ukraine and the cost for America and our allies and partners are going to rise for republicans in Congress who think they can oppose funding for Ukraine and not be held accountable history is watching history is watching history is watching failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment will never be forgotten right n as you can see standing by North America correspondent Nom great to see you uh let's get to the moments of history that Joe Biden was just touching on in a moment but first the technicalities where does this stand where are we in this process well so a flaw vote later four months later we're finally in this position where this uh this bill has been passed by the Senate but as you mentioned there it's not a done deal because now it has to go to the house and the house house is controlled by the Republicans the Speaker of the House the Republican Mike Johnson has already indicated that uh this is going nowhere um so I mean in terms of what happens next so um he Mr Johnson has to decide whether to bring the package to a vote in the chamber is he going to amend it and then send it back to the senate or is he going to ignore it entirely without getting too much into the weeds with it if let's just say he decides to ignore entirely the House Republicans who did vote for the assistance to to Ukraine for this this package uh they could uh join the Democrats in filing a what's called a discharge petition and basically that would that's a rare parliamentary procedure that would basically circumvent Johnson and then there'd be a vote but I don't want to get too much into the weeds with that at the moment we've got to see uh what happens next if it goes to the floor it could take weeks it could take months before it even lands on President Joe Biden's desk if at all so okay using that cliche phrase we'll see what happens next no no we love getting into the weeds uh on on this program so I appreciate that greatly uh let's talk about the politics of it though from a kind of step back position what is the opposition from some to this package border security uh that's one of the issues first of all because uh this is a narrower Bill and uh basically Republicans particularly those who are to the very you know right of the party those who are very closely lined to Donald Trump they want very strict border security laws as part of this and that's that's what you know they have said that we don't want to pass a security bill without this the other thing you've got to remember here is that Mike Johnson the house uh the Republican leader the speaker of the house and many of those Republicans who are closely lined to Donald Trump who is likely to be the front runner who is the front runner and likely to be the Republican party's presidential candidate uh they don't want want to continue supporting Ukraine they just they they they say they would rather the money be spent here in the US and so uh there is this pressure on them for this bill not to go through now the Speaker of the House denies that there's that pressure from uh former president Donald Trump but that that's some of the politics that's playing in the background here Nam thank you so much for that now it's not just the Politics as n was talking about their real life implications we're going to speak now to Kira rudik who is a member of the Ukrainian and Parliament leader of the golos party thank you very much for coming on the program hello thank you so much for having me so what's your reaction to what's happened there in the Senate and what potentially could still happen there in the US oh well we are very happy that the process is moving on but it is not final and I think the toughest uh challenge is still ahead of us um so basically there are so many people whose lives well-being and ability just to exist and to keep fighting depend on if the politicians in the United States will figure out uh and find an agreement and finding their hearts ability to move forward uh to keep the promise that the United States have made you know it is incredibly hard to explain to people who are fighting at the front what is going on and like how did it change from as long as it takes to uh it's still four months and we do not have confirmation for for this Aid okay can I just ask you about the the the numbers here $60 billion do heading to Ukraine if this goes through un amended give us an idea of what that would be used for well it's uh not going to head to Ukraine there will be 10 billion that will be used for the aid for our state so we can cover on the our budget expenses and the rest will be spent for the military expenses and mostly they will be spent inside the United States to pay for the ammunition to pay for the missiles to pay for uh additional manufacturing of the weapons and then at some point this uh uh these weapons will go to Ukraine so we are talking right now about um a really important and critical project for us because that will imply having ammunition that we have a shortage of uh having their air defense systems having um different kinds of critical supplies and um it we we really needed badly all of that four months ago can you imagine like what is going on right now and especially given uh given the fact that we have no deadline for that and no uh understanding on when those missiles and when those weapons will arrive to Ukraine uh after if the bill will be passed and what about the progress I know you can't draw a direct line from this bit of money coming through and success or otherwise on the battlefield of course but give us an idea on the state of the military situation now and then if and when any funding comes what that could change well I'm not a military expert but I can tell you couple of things to have an idea the first one is that while there are there are those delays in the support from the United States uh there are three countries that do not have any delays in production weapons it's Russia Iran and North Korea and they are manufacturing weapons and supplies to get ahead in ability to attack us and it is really really dangerous and it was dangerous last year but right now they're getting more and more of that and we see the attacks at the front intensifying the question is for how how long our army will be able to hold them off and this is uh again an existential question for all of us well the second sign is that ammunition That was supposed to be manufactured in Europe is also delayed so uh we understand that everybody's trying to help us but we are paying for every day of this delay with the lives of our citizens because almost every night another uh peaceful city of Ukraine is being attacked ACT people die lives are destroyed and uh it this nightmare just continues and continues and we do not have much to contradict to that do you have any understanding or sympathy with the view of some Republicans in the US that they simply want money spent in the US for example on their border well uh we are talking right now uh when we talking about the 60 billion about less than a chunk of percent of the United States military budget and I think we as a country have shown that we can use those money very effectively and efficiently by weakening Russia and destroying so many of their forces so many of their um weapon Supply soldiers we are the only country in the world who does not have a fleet but is able to destroy enemy's Fleet like almost 20% of that so whatever money are being sent to Ukraine its money very well spent okay Kira rudik thank you very much for coming on the program thank you thank you and glory to Ukraine
