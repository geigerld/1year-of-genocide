hello I'm Kylie pentello well we start with the latest on the Israel Gaza War where fighting has continued to rage across Gaza with Fierce tank fire and air strikes in hanun in southern Gaza which Israel sees as a stronghold of Hamas residents have reported intense gun battles between Israeli troops and Hamas Fighters there many people have been trying to move to the southern Border Town of Rafa which continues to see an influx of people seeking safety our correspondent Shima khil sent this report from Jerusalem a massive Israeli bombing in Northern Gaza turns an extensive network of Hamas tunnels into dust these IDF pictures show a well equipped infrastructure of long and branched out tunnels in which the Army says senior Hamas members moved and operated in central Gaza more than 150,000 people were ordered to evacuate two of the area's biggest refugee camps and this is where they were told to go for safety the area of derl Bah itself reeling from the aftermath of strikes we were sitting at our homes peacefully and all of a sudden a missile hit and destroyed my house my neighbor's house the whole neighborhood my children are displaced now and we don't know where to go have mercy on us help us it's a devastating situation people are sleeping on the streets in Rafa now gaza's most densely populated city according to the UN there's no letup in the bombardment children were killed here 26 people were killed here I'm terrified I'm scared and the thought of me being killed or my my other brother being killed just crossing my M repeatedly I already lost my older brother brother I can't lose my younger brother and this is what Egypt's seesar proposal is up against an expanding military operation in Gaza and a continuing barrage of Hamas Rockets into Israel a delegation of Hamas members is in Cairo now for further discussions but there is no guarantee that either side is going to agree to this and if they do it will be a long drawn out process for now the displacement continues and gazans are running out of places to go shy Mahal BBC News Jerusalem meanwhile Israel has responded furiously to South Africa's application on Friday to the international court of justice to rule that Israel has carried out what it called genocidal attacks in Gaza Israeli foreign Ministry spokes person Leo haat said Israel rejects with disgust the blood libl spread by South Africa in its application to the international court of justice while he goes on to say South Africa's claim constitutes a Despicable and contemp pous exploitation of the Court well our Middle East correspondent yolan Nell is in Jerusalem and she told us more about that response from the Israelis the Israeli government isn't sitting today because it's the Jewish sabbath but this was a very strongly worded response that we had from the foreign Ministry spokesperson and at the same time though I think some of it would be expected it's often um quite a difficult relationship with South Africa because um o of the fact it has very strong support uh for the Palestinian cause um often identifies the ruling ANC party in South Africa between the Palestinian nationalist struggle and its own past struggle against AP parde and Yan we um heard about those uh gun battles in hanun what more can you tell us about what's happening yes so residents of hunas were telling us that they could hear very loudly uh gum battles taking place on the streets presumably between Hamas Fighters and and Israeli soldiers who are there deep in the heart of this city the main southern city o of Gaza seen as a place where perhaps the Hamas leaders the likes of Yahya Sina whose Hometown it is he is the leader of Hamas in Gaza perhaps they could be hiding in underground tunnels there um that's what the Israeli military thinks uh We've also had Israeli artillery pushing into the city artillery shells um and also uh more Israeli air strikes three people killed according to medics um by an air strike earlier this morning um and so really that does appear to be a main focus still of Israel's ground offensive but at the same time it is pushing into these three Urban refugee camps in the center of the Gaza Strip where there've also been air strikes ahead of the advance of Israeli tanks overnight and we're seeing many pictures aren't we of those being displaced uh by this latest offensive the UN saying around 150,000 uh people are there safe places for people to travel I mean it's extremely difficult what we're seeing is that people are using whatever means they can either fleeing on foot using donkey carts in some cases a few people have got their vehicles with enough fuel and to make the journey and they're sort of going in short hops as they fled um from these different camps in the center of Gaza Strip as Israel's ground offensive has advanced just in the past week heading first to deala a big town there which has also been hit by air strikes as we um and then going south into Rafa the town on the Egyptian border um but of course this is now the most densely populated part of the Gaza Strip there are hundreds of thousands of people who are displaced there uh the UN says that it's extremely difficult uh to deal with in terms of they're seeing now a spread of disease in the areas where there are these overcrowded shelters and people living in very difficult conditions some of them sleeping rough or else in sort of makeshift that they've set up
