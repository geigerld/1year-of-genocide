America's top Diplomat who's on a visit to Israel has said it's a decisive moment and maybe the last opportunity to reach a ceasefire in Gaza US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin who's already met Israeli president Isaac Herzog is currently holding talks with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu Israel and Hamas have accused each other of lacking the will to compromise Mr blinkin says it's time for all sides to agree a deal without excuses this is a decisive moment um probably the best maybe the last opportunity to get the hostages home to get a ceasefire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security uh I'm here as part of an intensive diplomatic effort on President Biden's instructions to try to get this agreement to the line and ultimately over the line uh it is time for it to get done uh it's also time to make sure that no one takes any steps that could derail this process joining me now is our correspondent Tom bitman who traveling with the US Secretary of State and our Middle East correspondent Yulan Nell who's in Jerusalem and youan land the stakes are incredibly high for this visit aren't they uh they are indeed and we know Mr blinken's just gone in to talk to uh the Israeli Prime Minister this is a meeting that is taking place behind uh closed doors um we don't have official details but we know that the the US um is really putting uh this bridging proposal on the table to try to bring Israel and Hamas together to overcome the outstanding issues that following on from this Doha Summit last week where you had the US and Cat and Egyptian mediators present along with an Israeli negotiating team now if you look um at the comments while the Americans are sounding positive I mean really from the the latest statements from Israel and and from Hamas as well um you know not that same positivity um certainly from the Israeli Prime Minister's office um they're saying that Hamas is sticking to its positions of of refusal um Hamas has really accused the prime minister's office of adding uh new conditions uh to the negotiations which they say are meant to sabotage the talks I mean you can look at the different sort of sticking points as they emerged coming out from from both sides um really first of all moving from the first phase of the three-phase plan um which is supposed to be the ceasefire and hostage release deal with Palestinian prisoners being released uh from Israeli jails as well uh and then moving from that first six week phase into the second phase which should be uh working towards a full ceasefire uh that is a problematic area you also have um where Israeli forces would remain in the Gaza Strip which strategically important locations um Israeli forces want to remain in uh after the Gaza War Hamas of course has been demanding a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and and then also so we're we understand there are issues around um the Palestinian prisoners that will be released from Israeli jails as part of all this as well you landel thank you very much over to Tom now and you've been traveling with the US state department parties and there's been ramping up the language but what other pressure can the US put on on making sure that these parties come to resolution well the way they are trying to apply pressure is by creating a sense of urgency and you heard it there with Anthony blinkin saying this is maybe he said the last chance and that there should be no more excuses I think the problem is that that sense of urgency and in effect a deadline being imposed by the Americans looking ahead to a week from now where they're hoping to get some kind of break through and to get it over the line as Anthony blinkin has said that deadline is being imposed by Washington rather than the sides at War here and that matters because for there to be enough incentive for both both the Israeli Prime Minister and the leaders of Hamas to clinch this deal they have to feel that sense of urgency too and my senses we're not really at that point and that's why I think the American optimism is really outmatching what you feel on the ground here the approach of Mr blinkin who is by his nature a pretty cautious US Secretary of State has been quite a traditional one which is to show sort of tough love when it comes to the Israelis in general and Benjamin netan who in particular is not one for the sort of diplomatic arm wrench the question now is about how tough and how much love and I think um we're going to see that over the next few hours he's due to hold u a small press conference here in Tel Aviv this afternoon I doubt we're going to be hearing particularly sort of critical messages against Mr Netanyahu himself as opposed to many of his critics both at home and abroad who believe that he is sort of stringing the Americans along uh for his own political survival Mr Netanyahu himself says that he's just simply pushing for a tough deal against Hamas in order to ensure um Israel's safety but the fact remains that the Americans do not have a strong track record in this conflict in terms of leveraging um the Israelis to change course at critical moments when they have wanted to now they dispute that really uh when you push them on this they believe that they did get the Israelis to do more about opening up um humanitarian assistance um and also to to pull back the um scale of the offensive particularly in the south of the Gaza Strip but I think many critics of the Americans will say they simply haven't applied enough leverage and now you have what they are themselves describing as a critical moment where they have to push both sides but in this part of the trip Benjamin Netanyahu over the line as they put it make him take a deal and stop trying to squeeze more concessions out of it I don't have the sense yet that they're really doing that and Tom briefly where does Mr linoln go go next after this on to Egypt yeah um we head to Egypt um tomorrow uh crucially there will be you know the Egyptians are one of the most important mediators in all of the this along with the kares um the role there is that they're able to pass messages much more directly uh to Hamas and Gaza uh and so that is another part of applying this pressure and the Egyptians also crucial when it comes to that sticking point that yolan was talking about around the south of the Gaza Strip because Mr Netanyahu said that he insists that Israel will remain present uh along the so-called Philadelphia Corridor that's basically um the border with Egypt Israel says that's to stop smuggling and to stop Hamas rearming Hamas say it simply means continued Israeli occupation and therefore not an end to the war so this is a fundamental Point um Brett mcgurk who's one of the key Administration envoys uh here in the region has been working on that with the Egyptians over the last couple of weeks trying to create this sort of bridging um proposal which is meant to bring the two sides together on this their statements both of them last night were very defiant um sticking to their positions digging in that may be in part tactical in terms of negotiations but no signs yet of a breakthrough on that so I think what he'll be doing in Egypt will be crucial to that particular Point Tom bitman thank you very much indeed
