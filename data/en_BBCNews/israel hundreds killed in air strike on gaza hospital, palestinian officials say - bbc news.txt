let's return to those live pictures coming into us from Gaza following reports of an Israeli air strike on a hospital in central Gaza these are pictures we understand of another hospital in Gaza where patients from that strike on another hospital are being brought to the health Ministry in Gaza is reporting that there have been 500 casualties in that Israeli air strike uh we don't have those figures verified but they are reporting that 300 people have been killed just want to show you those still images as well that we've had in and this is pictures that we've had which have been verified of this Hospital the Al Ali Hospital in the center of the Gaza Strip following that air strike well let's talk to our correspondent John Don and who is following all the developments in Gaza John welcome to you little information coming into us just bring us up to date on what we do know about these reports of a strike on this Hospital well look certainly at this stage it looks to be one of the most deadly attacks of this conflict so far it's very difficult to get an accurate picture of the numbers at this stage this is the uh Hospital run by the Baptist Church it's right in the center of uh Gaza City close to the main Square uh we've seen the first images coming in uh showing buildings on fire and as you say in terms of numbers we've got the civil defense Authority in Gaza talking about 300 people being killed and the health Ministry saying 500 but I should say at this stage uh it's difficult really for anyone to know but we're getting images of the injured being uh rushed to hospital in Gaza other hospitals I mean you have to remember that at this time there will have been hundreds if not thousands of people displaced from their homes Sheltering in this Hospital uh thinking it was a safe place we have contacted the Israeli Defense Force uh for comment but we've not heard back yet and just give us a sense of the geography you said it's in central Gaza and you described it as being run by the Baptist Church so this would have been very well known um a location as a hospital yeah absolutely certainly everyone in Gaza would have known uh where it was it's actually not that far from the BBC office in Gaza I've walk past it at many times when I was working there uh and it's uh you know there's not a large Christian population in Gaza but this was run by uh the Baptist Church so every hospital uh in Gaza at the moment is not just a place where they're treating thousands of casualties it's also a place where people are seeking shelter we've seen the pictures from shifa hospital also in Gaza City where you got thousands of people camped out in the hospital and in the hospital grounds and we think it will have been the same there yeah and just looking uh for any kind of reaction from Israel and as you mentioned no response as yet do you think we can expect one fairly soon well they're going to be being asked uh what happened uh was this a mistake were they targeting someone or something specific uh in that hospital or below that hospital uh they're going to be at being asked because of course we've got uh Joe Biden arriving tomorrow and the Americans have been urging uh Israel to limit the number of Civilian casualties and if Joe Biden arrives here tomorrow morning and we're getting confirmation that we've got people having been killed in their hundreds in a hospital uh in in an apparent Israeli air strike then um that presumably is not going to go down very well yeah and give us a sense of I mean how many people may possibly have been there I know it's impossible for you to say exactly but given that so many people have been displaced and they have been moving to places of what they think is safety like hospitals like schools yeah I mean look we know that about 600,000 people have uh moved South after that warning from Israel to evacuate their homes uh last week but there are lots of people who can't move or didn't want to move you know the injured the vulnerable uh people in hospital they can't move so a lot of people have been uh just heading to anywhere they think is uh relatively safe though that that could be schools it could be un facilities it could be hospitals we know that we've also heard this evening uh that a un school has been hit in the center of Gaza City six people killed there including some un staff and the United Nations body there in Gaza calling that uh strike outrageous we've got people just packed into anywhere they think might be safe apparently in the south of Gaza near Rafa you've got 8,000 PE people packed into a warehouse with very very limited facilities so people are going anywhere that they think was safe but a hospital not even a hospital is a safe place yeah John Hamas of uh released a statement calling the attack on the hospital in the Gaza Strip a war crime it said the hospital was housing hundreds of sick and wounded and P people forcibly displaced from their homes as a result of other strikes the statement says hundreds of victims are still under the rubble um obviously we just have their words at the moment we are waiting for any kind of response from Israel who have just said that they will look into it
