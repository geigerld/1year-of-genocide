well Hamas ended the ceasefire yesterday afternoon uh the after several days of uh ceasefire they uh began shooting at the biva and we uh retaliated and we'll continue doing that uh these ceasefires are pretty peculiar we seize and they fired us again and again and again um if they want this whole thing to go away they need to stop shooting at us and disarm Gaza and uh then we could uh continue living side by side some will though question the timing of course when you you ended the seasar or indeed whether you say Hamas ended this ceasefire because of course it does coincide with your strike the Israeli air strike on a top Hamas Commander yeah you know in any case uh we're always uh looking to to get the commanders of uh these Terror groups we're we're you and I are in the same uh boat here if I may say fighting radical Islam I mean we're talking about the Islamic State we're talking about Hamas we're talking about radical Islamic states that want to uh create a big caliphate from Baghdad through Tel Aviv into London whenever you identify a mega terrorist you have to take him out like Bin Laden like El bagdadi if possible let's talk about the people that who are being killed because whatever way you look at this there unequal number of casualties more than 2,000 Palestinians killed mostly civilians that against 66 Israelis mostly military me the figures just don't add up why are you killing innocent people we're retaliating to uh over 3,000 Rockets shot at us let's make no mistake Hamas has decided to shoot rockets and missiles on Israel from within uh civilian concentrations this is a very cynical and cowardly approach but can I ask you H how many uh Israelis need to die for us to gain your sympathy Hamas want you to lift The Siege I mean why is it so difficult for Israel to do that if it will bring about peace no we have no Siege there's no Siege going on in Gaza every day there's uh dozens and dozens of um shiploads or or um trucks of uh food and medicine and humanitarian needs flowing into Gaza that's not a problem the problem is that what they try and and bring into Gaza is also weapons and more concrete to build more tunnels in order to kill more Israelis and that's unacceptable so the general rule is anything that's humanitarian will go in anything that can uh create weapons in order to kill Israelis we won't allow in very quickly yes or no you going to go back to those peace talks in Cairo no I I uh think that the those talks are over uh once Kamas has started shooting at us missiles again and again we're not going to uh conduct talks under uh a threat of uh shooting uh we're facing a very determined radical Islam group and we have to beat it and we will
