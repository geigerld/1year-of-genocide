the ceasefire ended at 8:00 in the morning and in the minutes at hours after that truce ended we've seen and heard a number of explosions here in Gaza uh our team has seen the plume of white smoke of Palestinian Rockets being fired from Gaza towards Israel and we've also seen and heard a number of incredibly loud explosions which indicate that Israel as it says has resumed its air strikes on Gaza as I speak to you now I haven't heard reports of casualties uh but very clearly there will be a sense of fear among the residents of Gaza just looking around the streets I can see very very few people uh out and about at the moment it is of course the day of rest but I think many people will have heard the fact that the ceasefire is over and they will not be confident enough to go out into the street and to resume their normal lives Hamas says it's not yet got anything from those indirect negotiations uh in Cairo it wants an end to Israeli restrictions an ability to use the ports of Gaza an ability uh to get people to come and go from the borders but Israel says that its priorities are very different it wants Hamas and other groups including Islamic Jihad to disarm for good and so there is clear gap between those sides the Israeli side and the Palestinian side and once again the people of Gaza find themselves listening to and experiencing explosions
