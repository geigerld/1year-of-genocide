well in the last few minutes the leaders of the United States the United Kingdom France Germany and Italy have put out a statement on the Middle East they said we express our full support for ongoing efforts to deescalate tensions and reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza and they stressed there was no further time to lose and they then called on Iran to stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel the Pentagon says the US defense secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered a guided missile submarine to the Middle East he's also told an aircraft carrier strike group to sail to the area immediately and more quickly while the deployment of additional fighter jets and warships was announced earlier this month as Washington seeks to bolster its presence following an escalation in violence between Israel and Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah our correspondent WEA Davis explains in terms of talks what might be likely or possible this week yeah well there's there's calls for and hopes for the the resumption the restart of indirect talks mediated by the qataris the Egyptians and the Americans between Hamas and Israel that might lead to to peace talks and might lead to an end to the to the fighting temporarily and a release of hostages but we've got a long way before we get to that point uh there are those hardliners in the Israeli government who are opposed to any deal yet between Israel and Hamas and the new Hamas leader Yaya Sina is said to be reluctant to agree to some of the new terms that Israel is being is putting forward we're not quite sure what those Israeli terms are so there's no sense yet that these talks will definitely happen either in Cairo or Qatar later this week but as you intimated there there is increasing International pressure for a resumption of those talks because of the increasing tensions and threats in the region more people of course being killed in Gaza Israel continuing its military operation against Hamas and Gaza hopes but but still some concern that those talks might not even start we Davis there in Jerusalem
