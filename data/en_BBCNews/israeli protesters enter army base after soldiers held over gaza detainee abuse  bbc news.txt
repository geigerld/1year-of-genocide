the Israeli Prime Minister has called for calm after demonstrators including farri right politicians forced their way into two military [Applause] bases Benjamin Netanyahu said he strongly condemned the disturbances the protesters were angered by the arrest of soldiers accused of severely abusing a Palestinian detainee Israeli media reports suggest the Palestinian prisoner had been sexually assaulted by the reservists Israel denied allegations by human rights groups that suspected Hamas Fighters suffer systematic abuse in detention we're going now live to Jerusalem to speak to our Middle East correspondent yoland Nell yoland we've heard about these nine soldiers that have been uh detained soldiers who are working in the said man Detention Center can you tell us more well we saw those Rowdy and chaotic scenes uh at the detention center it's a camp uh for Palestinians who have been uh picked up during the course of the Gaza War um and it's really become uh quite notorious with Israeli rights groups uh International media including the BBC investigating what's happening there um we've been hearing uh in recent months how uh Palestinian detes are routinely Shackled to hospital beds they've been kept blindfolded and kept even wearing nappies um and really um when the news broke that these soldiers had been detained for questioning for the the sexual assault of a detainee believed to be a member of Hamas um we're told according to Israeli media reports that he had been left unable uh to walk um well crowds gathered uh outside the military base and then what we saw was actually some of those uh protesters breaking in as Israeli military investigators arrived at the site later on uh they broke in uh to a second uh military base where there's a a military court and really you know that's got uh the Israeli military Chief of Staff uh denouncing all of this calling this unlawful uh Anarchy um we've had the Israeli Prime Minister and other figures denouncing it uh but you also have um an prominent member of Israel's Hardline government the cabinet minister bezel smotrich who is from the far and of course as you said there were farri right members of parliament who were among those who broke in at the site well bezel smotrich said on social media that the soldiers who had been detained should be treated as Heroes not criminals and yand what does this tell us about divisions within Israel uh not just between government members but uh between you know different groups within Israel and also uh within the International Community over pressure about how Israel is conducting itself in Gaza yeah I mean so really what we see here are the very partisan divisions um that are on display in Israel at the moment particularly with this Hardline government in place uh the Israeli Prime Minister relies on the support of these uh far-right Ultra nationalist uh parties he couldn't remain in power without them and that is really fed into to some of the political divisions the social divisions that already existed within the country and then on top of that yes you know this other dimension Israel is currently facing uh cases before International courts it's accused uh of war crimes a lot of accusations over its uh conduct of the war in Gaza International pressure it strongly um denies uh those accusations of war crimes and yet you know the Israeli military always says it independently investigates any cases of of wrongdoing of alleged use that come to light and it deals with them accordingly what you have here is Israeli ministers even apparently undermining uh the Israeli military procedures yoland thank you as ever for updating us from Jerusalem there Benjamin Netanyahu says his country will deliver a severe response to the missile strike on the Israeli occupied goolan Heights the attack on Saturday struck a soccer field in the town of melem killing 12 12 young people Mr Netanyahu cut short a tour of the United States to visit the site of the attack on Monday he conveyed his condolences to the local community which is mostly made up of the Arab durus minority on Sunday Israel fired on S sit in South Lebanon it says belong to the militant group hisbah Israel blames hisbah for the attack an accusation the group denies amiddle East correspondent Hugo Bea is in South Lebanon with the latest so the wait here uh in Lebanon continues uh yesterday uh the prime minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu again said that Israel would respond to the attack that happened on Saturday and that this response would be severe now we know that there has been intense diplomatic activity trying to limit this uh Israeli response the Americans in particular are heavily involved in these uh efforts to try to contain uh an escalation of hostilities here and I think the goal of these uh efforts try to prevent an escalation that would put Hezbollah in a position where the group would feel they have to respond to any kind of major Israeli attack uh and I think uh an attack on the capital of bayout Hezbollah has its base in the southern suburbs of Beirut or any Israeli attack targeting a Lebanese civilian infrastructure could be seen by Hezbollah as a major escalation as a major provocation and could uh spark uh a response by Hezbollah that was Hugo Bea there
