Chris gunnis the rest of the world now wants to know from Israel how you justify shelling a un School uh I must say that you need to ask this question leadership of Kamas when you see a terror organization that is using the most cical way children women uh to be a human shelter to uh amount uh amounts of rockets uh that have only one goal to shoot on the cities of Israel to uh Herm civilians just civilians uh they they have no uh territorial claim from Israel because Israel made a withow in 2005 but since then Hamas keeps on shooting rockets on our cities and our children and unfortunately Miss hot Valley I have to say there were no rockets in this school the UN had removed them before this offensive began the UN told Israel 17 times of the location of this school Israel knew there were 3,000 people Sheltering there again how do you justify would like to remind you I would like to remind you since this military operation has started because Hamas decided to shoot and fire Israel's cities and Israel's children uh they were found thousands thousands of rockets in chifa in the hospital in G particular un schools in un schools I have to correct you in this particular case we spoke to the UN less than an hour ago to the man who runs these schools there were no rockets in that school there was no warning given to them and they told Israel 17 times of the location of the school and who was there so again I would like to remind you throughout this military operation time after time uh Israeli Army found rockets in those un schools you can't deny this fact uh specifically if you can say if if there are mistakes that are done in a military operations of course uh are you asking U me if Israel deliberately is harming children definitely not Israel is doing everything in order to prevent those harms but unfortunately Kamas leadership at this moment still using the uh civilians in Gaza uh in order to use those pictures you you enjoy uh showing to the world uh instead of using the Army in Israel that is saying time after time to the children in don't cooperate with these people now I would like to remind you that Israel didn't go to this military operation uh uh because we came up in in the morning and we' decided to go to this military operation we did that because we needed to defend ourselves defend our children 10,000 Rockets were shoot to Israel's border since 2005 those were against children in Israel in military elementary schools in Israel many many hundreds now of children have died Palestinian children have died there are not many people in the International Community who believe now that Israel is doing its very best not to kill civilians and what is the most densely populated part of the world many people are asking and I'd like you to explain to us what the moral line is for Israel now where does it stop okay unfortunately um as you know uh there was an Egyptian offer on the table for a ceasefire that Kamas refused to accept time after time Hamas wants to get reward for the fact it's shooting on our cities and on our children now I want to say that Israel can sit quietly and peacefully if it wouldn't have been Hamas again trying time after time to kidnap children uh would like to remind you that three children were kidnapped and murdered in the most uh cruel way uh by Hamas and Time After Time Israel needs to defend itself now no uh proof at the moment uh that the international Comm Community is offering us uh and after that going to demilitarize demilitarize so can I can I ask you about that we have heard from Hamas and we have heard from fata and Islamic Jihad as well that they will not accept any ceasefire offer unless we see a lifting of the siege of Gaza do you think that your leader Benjamin Netanyahu will accept that condition ever of course not um as you as you know uh unfortunately uh no one in the world is doing the work for Israel um if wouldn't have been our soldiers that now cleaning Gaza from the terror tunnels so those T tunnels that were supposed to be outside of Israel uh as part of uh elementary schools kindergartens so if you see Benjamin Netanyahu says he will not accept this when do you think this will come to an end how long will this go on for uh the truth is if Hamas would have decided to uh to say I'm not going to use uh this uh Terror power anymore it would have stopped unfort we know how ter organizations working and it doesn't seem like at the moment when they have still over 10,000 rockets in Gaza itself and still there's a work in when it comes to the tunels uh that now Israel is working very hard to find each one of them uh we still need to work on it and unfortunately no one in the International Community can promise US that the day after the ceasefire we won't have rockets on our cities again and I would like to offer you to come to the south side of Israel to Tel Aviv to Sirens are sound here day after day and everyone need to be in shelters this is not a daily life in a normal country a normal country goes to defend on our cities
