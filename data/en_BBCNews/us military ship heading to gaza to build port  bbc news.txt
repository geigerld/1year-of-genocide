hello you're live with BBC News I'm Anna Foster here in Jerusalem let's take a look at the latest situation around Gaza you were seeing there just a moment ago images of a fresh airdrop of Aid which has been happening over Gaza this morning we know now that the the US military along with the Jordanian Air Force have been carrying out regular airdrops of Aid with the parachutes and the pallets uh heading down to the people below who so desperately need them but there is another option to take aid in which is now starting to come into play as well and that is the option of taking Aid into Gaza by SE now the US Army says one of its military support ships has actually set off from the US uh it's set off from the port of Virginia and it's heading to Gaza to build a temporary Pier there which would enable ships to unload aid but that is expected to take at least 2 months before it's actually in place and there is again separately this uh cypriate ship well it's a Spanish ship in Cyprus which is loaded and waiting for clearance to actually head towards Gaza here's the latest there's little hope to be found amid the rubble in Gaza another night of Israeli strikes has taken its toll images like this travel around the world across the Atlantic Israel's main allies seiz them too the US President Joe Biden said he still supported Israel's rights to defend itself but he cautioned the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the extent of the military operations he was sanctioning he must he must he must pay more attention to the innocent lives being lost as the consequence of the actions taken he's hurting I my view he's hurting Israel more than helping Israel by making the rest of the world it's contrary to what Israel stands for and I think it's a big mistake just two weeks ago Mr Biden was optimistic a ceasefire deal could be in place by Ramadan but now with just hours to go there's no sign of an imminent breakthrough that means other options to get Aid into Gaza at scale are still being sought as the fighting continues military air drops above the strip deliver some food but not enough but that still won't meet the growing and desperate need this mother can't find anything in Gaza to help her child I feed my daughter with water just so she doesn't die water is not recommended and it's even forbidden for a baby of her age in Cyprus an aid ship is ready to set sail loaded with supplies the charity behind it say they're confident they'll be able to unload them when they arrive off gaza's beaches in the longer term a US ship that will build a temporary peer to do the job has set sail but the Project's completion date is still 2 months away and while it's constructed the pressure on Israel to get more help to suffering civilians will continue Ana well let's head straight to lanica in Cyprus and speak to our correspondent Quentin Somerville who is there at Quentin do we have any idea when this Aid ship might set sail local media is reporting that it will leave some point this afternoon apparently they're waiting for final security clearances uh from from Israel which of course supervises pretty much all of the aid that that makes its way into Gaza um the there's about 150 to 200 tons of Aid on board and it has everything from flour and rice to pre-prepared meals and water um it's quite a long journey it's 210 nautical miles normally that Journey from here in larica to Gaza would take about 15 hours but because the pulling that big heavy barge it might take longer and the the organizations have involved have said a number of times the most difficult part of the journey will be the last mile you just touched on that in your report because Landing in Gaza will be very difficult it doesn't have a functioning uh port and of course in parts of Gaza all law no or all Civil Society really has broken down since Israel's bombardment and ground Invasion so the and the need from the people in Gaza is absolutely desperate so there is always that danger that when this ship appears on the horizon and gets closer to Shore that people will start making their way towards it will enter the water we've seen some pictures from World Central Kitchen which is one of the Charities involved which seems to show a temporary Pier being built inside Gaza uh there's heavy lifting equipment large Boulders and rocks are being moved towards the foreshore to to make way for the preparation for when this ship finally gets underway and starts that Journey and Quenton you were saying this is the the first ship it's got an amount of Aid on board but when we look at the air drops the sea Corridor that's due to open will that actually fill the the void that's being left by far fewer Trucks Than would normally pass into gar are doing so since the War Began not by a long shot there is a very quick and effective way of getting Aid into Gaza and that's by truck and that's by Road two entry points in southern Gaza one from Egypt and one from Israel that system isn't functioning properly you might even say it's not fit for purpose uh certainly the British government and other governments have been pressurizing Israel for months now to let more trucks in there it's just over 100 trucks a day that are getting in before the war Anna it was over 420 trucks a day the need Clearly Now is much greater that would be the quickest easiest mechanism but there's a lot of resistance and very little movement from Israel on that front so these very complicated very intensive efforts are going on instead Maritime corridors and air drops and they are they're a dropping the ocean in terms of gaza's need because we we we keep hearing the uh how dire the situation is in Gaza and it gets worse every single day but it should come as no surprise to anyone the UN has been warning for months that that strangulation of humanitarian Aid by truck into Gaza would have catastrophic consequences and we seem to see those those consequences seem to be coming to realization now
