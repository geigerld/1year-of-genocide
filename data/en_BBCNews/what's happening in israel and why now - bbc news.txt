this conflict is extremely complicated and it's difficult to explain to people exactly what is happening let's uh cross live now to someone who I think can help with all the questions that people have been searching for online and indeed sending us here at the BBC our Middle East editor Sebastian Usher is in The Newsroom very very very very ready as always to help with uh questions Sebastian and I suppose that the first question that we need to ask you is why is this happening at this moment in time well I mean there are quite regularly eruptions in the conflict specifically between Hamas which controls Gaza and Israel the last one we saw was back in 2021 the last really big uh uh uh confrontation was in 2014 but there have been a number of wars that have taken place uh since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 and and Israel uh imposed a blockade which has held ever since so those tensions are always there in the past we have usually seen uh the conflict although it's had terrible consequences in the numbers of people killed particularly in Gaza from the air strikes that uh Israel launches in response to Rockets being fired by Hamas uh but that it it it's been within a certain kind of lines that both sides seem to accept that they don't cross in order to take it into you know Uncharted Territory what we've seen this time is that those lines have been crossed those lines were crossed essentially when Hamas uh Fighters infiltrated into Israel and caused I mean the worst uh uh incident uh for Israel pretty much since its Inception with hundreds I mean at the moment we're saying at least 700 Israelis having been killed so that is the real huge game changer here that is why this is such a serious situation but those pressures those tensions as I say they don't just exist in Gaza as far as the Palestinians are concerned but in the occupied West Bank where we've also seen a major rise in tensions in almost daily clashes between uh is uh uh the Israeli military which mounts regular raids into uh the main towns in the occupied West Bank and they're met often with Palestinian fighters who who who fire back who throw rocks uh EXP exp of devices uh we've seen several hundred Palestinians many of them Fighters but some of them civilians killed over the past year and a half and that so this hasn't come out of nowhere but the surprise is the way that Hamas executed its attack on Israel Sebastian many people uh have been searching this particular question and and it is is Palestine is Gaza an actual country it it it's not officially formally a country as such I mean Gaza is part of a Palestinian territor as as I was just saying there's there's Gaza there's the there's the occupied West Bank and there's East Jerusalem and it and its surroundings which is seen as part of the Palestinian territories um the the the the Palestinian Authority the PLO which uh is essentially the original uh real driving force of Palestinian stat ship declared that it was a state many decades ago and some countries have accepted Palestine as state but uh there are a number of others who haven't the us being perhaps the main one um so what it has at the moment is that the UN it has uh uh Observer status non-member Observer status which is essentially close to being uh accepted as a state but not a state and we still talk about uh the peace process that has been going on for years but it's been stalled for a long time now the main objective through much of that was to create a Palestinian State the so-called two-state um solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict another question many people have been asking Sebastian is does Hamas represent uh Palestine no it doesn't represent Palestine I mean it is one of the two main factions as I say it has controlled Gaza since 2007 holy uh uh um controlled Gaza since then it won the last elections in the Palestinian territories in 2006 it then fought a battle with fata which is the party uh that essentially runs uh uh the occupied West Bank and it drove them out so it's been in control since then it's an islamist organization it's ideology originally comes from a Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt so I mean Palestines themselves uh many of them are not Muslims they are Christians there are face there as well so it certainly doesn't represent the entirety of the Palestinians by any means it does represent for a number of Palestinians not just the islamist uh ideology which some support but also the sense of resistance to Israel seen as the most actively uh uh um the most active in that resistance as we're seeing once again here the pales authority the PLO fata have moved towards in in the past three decades to essentially accepting Israel's right to exist and no longer confronting it militarily h has never changed uh from its military stance towards Israel that it sees Israel as its enemy and it will fight Israel as we've seen regularly uh this being the most extreme example of the of the uh uh that we've seen so far Sebastian another question that is one of the most searched on the Internet is who are the Palestinians can you explain that with to us given obviously there a very long history So within the time frame obviously yes no there is a long history I mean the word Palestine dates back I mean at least 2,000 years it was used in Roman times it was adopted uh in the early days of Islam uh it was Arab sized there was um a Palestine existing uh as I mean again we can't say as a state but as a region for a very long time and people identifying as Palestinians for a very long time the Mandate that existed under the British uh that came before Israel was established at its dependence in 1948 1949 was known as Palestine so I mean Palestine is very much an accepted uh way of referring to that region but there are many problems with that it you know in terms of uh how large a part of that region is seen as Palestine who it should belong to uh these counternarratives that there are I mean many uh Israelis would go back further they would go back to the biblical denomination of many of those areas talking of Judea and Samaria and other words like that so I mean though historically it is a fact and there's no question about uh the sense of there being a Palestine and there being a Palestinian people the actual way in which that's interpreted is still open to question and depending on what perspective people are looking at from s Main's you know a very live debate but certainly for the Palestinians who identifies as pales opinions and that's not just in the palestin territories but beyond the the the huge diaspora both in the w g camps that spread across parts of the Middle East but well beyond that they obviously naturally 100% see themselves a Palestinians even if there is no formal Palestinian State as such at the moment and Sebastian finally one of the biggest uh or the most asked questions online is who backs Hamas well I mean financially one of its main supporters has been uh Qatar but Qatar would make a distinction between supporting the people of Gaza uh who obviously have faced immense problems economically uh it's one of the poorest areas in the world um they would say that the money that they give through Hamas because Hamas controls Gaza is for the people that it doesn't support necessarily the political uh uh um agenda of Hamas it doesn't support what Hamas is doing now necessarily it does believe in um the Palestinian bid for its own State uh for its own identity it supports that 100% it does believe that the Palestinians face huge problems much of them they believe uh resulting from Israel and its occupation but it would not say that it directly supports Hamas as an entity you have other countries such as Iran which do openly support Hamas and what it's trying to achieve and and we've seen since this assault uh happened that Iran has very openly come out and shown its backing and said that it uh uh believes that Israel is essentially reaping the wind uh that it swn so and and also in in military terms in the past maybe not so much now but a lot of the hardware a lot of the missiles that uh G that that Hamas was somehow able to get despite the blockade around uh uh Gaza were Ian made in more recent years they've been able to manufacture many of those themselves within Gaza Syria again the the so-call AIS of resistance and then other non-state players particularly hasbullah for example in Lebanon which did make a gesture um by firing some mortars towards Israel uh in in in uh on on the second day of this assault but hasn't so far committed itself beyond that Lebanon as a country supports again the right of the Palestinians to resist to defend themselves but the government such as it is in Lebanon wouldn't go all out in support of Hamas so there are backers um but it's not hugely widespread I would say the most important would be Iran and cata financially at least Sebastian thank you very much indeed Sebastian Asha there giving a full explanation to all of those questions that you have been uh searching for online
