well let's move on to events in the Middle East and Benjamin Netanyahu says that the UK's decision to suspend some armed sales to Israel is shameful posting on X the Israeli Prime Minister said the decision will not change Israel's determination to defeat Hamas adding that Britain's misguided decision will only embolden Hamas he said Israel is pursuing a just war with just means he added with or without British arms Israel will win this war the UK suspended 30 out of 350 arms export licenses to Israel saying there is a clear risk the equipment could be used to commit serious violations of international law it follows a review by the foreign secretary David Lamy who says the government had a legal duty to review all export licenses a foreign Office document outlines the government assessment that informed this move and it focuses on three key factors humanitarian saying Israel has not fulfilled its duties to ensure essential supplies get to people in Gaza with insufficient levels of aid treatment of detail with a government assessment saying there have been credible claims of the mistreatment of detainees and conduct of hostilities saying it's not possible to reach a judgment on allegations about Israel's conduct due to mass casualties and difficulties in getting reliable information from Gaza well UK arms sales amount to just 1% of Israel's defense Imports amounting to around 42 million pounds in 2022 the suspended licenses affect equipment like parts for fighter jets helicopter Ops and drones the UK defense secretary says the move won't have a material impact on Israel's security and insists the UK remains a staunch Ally our determination to stand with Israel to be part of the collective defense if they come under direct attack again as they have done before remains Resolute and absolute well Britain's Chief Rabbi is amongst those who have criticized this decision ifra mvy said on X it Beggars belief the British government a close strategic Ally of Israel has announced a partial suspension of arms licenses he added sadly this announcement will serve to encourage our shared enemies well I'm joined Now by Sir Alan Duncan a former member of Parliament and UK government advisor member of the conservative party of course uh when in active in politics um so Alan Duncan thanks for being with us what's your response to this um Announcement by the British government uh not so much an advisor as a former foreign minister actually but doesn't that doesn't matter too much uh I think uh the government has got this absolutely right indeed I'm surprised that it wasn't done a long time ago uh under the conservative government uh beforehand um I think probably what has happened is that the advice the legal advice inside the foreign office and the department of trade is so clear uh that they cannot legally continue with some of these arms exports to Israel and given what's happening with the use of arms I think this is a a proper thing to do anyway because I think that Israel is out of control I think that its response to October the 7th has been utterly excessive and indefensible uh and so I think this is the right decision and I hope that all leadership contenders for the conservative party will confirm that they adhere to international law and therefore agree with this decision do you think it goes far enough because obviously you're you're you're a known um you've known been known politically here in the UK for um not being fully supportive of of everything that Israel has done I mean how far do you think the UK government should be going yeah well I think they should go further and more than that I'm I'm quite a serious critic of what the uh Israelis have done I think their conduct has been despicable for a long time I mean this is much more than about the excessive uh activity in Gaza where we now see over 40,000 uh deaths many of them children women and the complete destruction of their habitable space I mean what they've also been doing in the meantime and I think there's been insufficient uh International condemnation this is they have raised their activity of colonization on the West Bank so what you have is massive settler violence uh supported by the Israeli Defense Force uh which is why I think there is an added element to the illegality of what Israel is doing that on the west bank they are taking over their neighboring country's land and what you have is settler violence they're armed uh they're bashing up Palestinians whose rightful land it is and doing so with the support of the IDF which means that to all intents and purposes you have state-backed terrorism in the West Bank many would say that that your position politically effectively plays into the hands of Iran and withdraws support for a key UK Ally which is important for you know British national security I don't think that argument holds one jot I think what really matters is a defense of international law and I think I would suggest that whenever you are interviewing anybody uh including the chief Rabbi to say do you agree that un resolutions which say that uh West Bank settlements are illegal uh mean that indeed they are illegal and if they don't accept international law you've got to throw back the question well who then is the extremist okay so D we will leave it there thank you very much indeed for joining us
