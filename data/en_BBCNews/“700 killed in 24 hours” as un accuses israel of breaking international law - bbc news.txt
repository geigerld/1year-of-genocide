are our human rights the fun and the friendship of childhood they grasp what they can knowing how brutally it can be lost FAL Keen BBC News Jerusalem the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza is evident and the UN agency responsible for Palestinian refugees says that because of Israeli restrictions on Aid it will run out of fuel tomorrow Israel disputes the lack of fuel the BBC's Gaza reporter Rashi Abu Alou reports now from a hospital in car munice in southern Gaza on the increasingly desperate struggle of ordinary people behind this door doctors are fighting to save the life of n ABA she was badly injured this morning while she was pregnant in an air strike in the AL neighborhood in doctors rescue the baby by cerian quick cerian operation her husband was was killed alongside members of the same family but the mother is inside fighting for her life and for her baby the hospital here in Naser are struggling to cope with the number of people injured I have seen people treated in the corridor of the hospitals people are treated in the courtyard of the hospital because today was one of the deadliest attack done by Israel by Israel so far this hospital is among like the three four Hospital in the South it's the area where Israel asked 1.2 million people in the north to flee but this is the biggest one and it's it's been struggling without without fuel to run the main generator in the hospital and also they said they have to councel all of nonessential operation and they are only treating people with life saving injury uh correspondent Rashi Abu Alou reporting that from Gaza well Jeremy is with me um Jeremy as we heard earlier the UN at pains to be evenhanded in criticizing both sides Israel and Hamas but that doesn't make the Israeli government's life any easier I think it makes them really really angry that they're getting any criticism at all they are absolutely infuriated and totally reject any suggestion that there could be any equivalence in what's going on uh Israelis are always very aware Israeli politicians generals leaders that when they start a military operation if you like two clock start ticking the first clock is how long they need to get to fulfill their military objectives and in this case they're talking about sometimes perhaps months not weeks the other clock is how long it takes before the United Nations and their friends as well as their enemies demand a cease fire and I think that What's Happening Here is because so many people are being killed that the worst um the largest number of Israelis killed in a single day in the history of their state and since then more than 5,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza in just a couple of weeks uh I think because of that that diplomatic clock has gone into hyperdrive and so people in the UN are saying we've got to have a cease fire there's got to be a way of getting humanitarian Aid in safely and people have to stop dying the Israelis on the other hand are saying they have barely started the ground operation hasn't started yet now what normally happens what is happening right now is that the Americans cover them their diplomatic backs and also Britain's helping the French helping French president macron was was here as well but I think this pressure will continue to mount because of those scenes coming out of Gaza and I think the Israelis will not be put off by that though they are aware that if you like the legitimacy of their operation will ultimately be affected by the numbers of people being killed but don't forget all the estimates are that if the Israeli army goes in on the ground to Gaza and the Prime Minister Mr Netanyahu was saying again today to soldiers that the next phase is coming and you will be the spearhead if that happens there will be many more pal Palestinian casualties so I think there there going to be a lot more anger at the United Nations and other places and I think the Americans are going to be protecting them vetoing resolutions they've already vetoed one that they see as uh as detrimental to Israel's interest but it's interesting that right from the outset President Joe Biden has been saying yes Israel has the right to defend itself but it has to do it within the framework of international humanitarian law and tonight no less a person the UN Secretary General is saying that that is being violated
