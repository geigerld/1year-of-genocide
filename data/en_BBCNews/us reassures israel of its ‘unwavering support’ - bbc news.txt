these are some of the other key developments this hour the United Nations says more than 338,000 people have now been forced to flee their homes in Gaza as human itarian situation worsens ahead of a possible incursion into Gaza Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has established the National Emergency Unity government with leader of the opposition Benny Gant meanwhile the UK foreign secretary has announced that the government set to facilitate flights to help British citizens leave Israel Anthony blinkin and Benjamin netan who as we've been mentioning have been speaking at a joint news conference in Israel let's have a listen in to what they said we know Hamas instead of promoting the well-being of its citizens rules repressively and dedicates the resources it has to Terror tunnels and Rockets we know Hamas didn't commit its heinous acts with the interests of Palestinian people in mind we know Hamas does not stand for the future that Palestinians want for themselves and for their children Hamas has only one agenda to destroy Israel and to murder Jews no country can or would tolerate the slaughter of its citizens or simply return to the conditions that allowed it to take place Israel has the right indeed the obligation to defend itself and to ensure that this never happens again as the Prime Minister and I discussed how Israel does this matters we democracies distinguish ourselves from terrorists by striving for a different standard even when it's difficult and holding ourselves to account when we fall short are Humanity the value that we place on human life and human dignity that's what makes us who we are and we count them among our greatest strength that's why it's so important to take every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians and that's why we mourn the loss of every innocent life civilians of every Faith every nationality who've been killed tragically the number of innocent lives claimed by hamas's heinous attacks continues to rise among those we now know that at least 25 American citizens were killed we joined families in Israel in the United States around the world in mourning their immeasurable loss just some breaking news lines that have come in to us via the Reuters News news agency which says that Israel's military Chief of Staff has said we did not meet the challenge of protecting Israel and uh goes on to say we will learn we will investigate but now is the time for War uh presumably responding to criticism over Israel's intelligence failures um at the weekend well now let's go live to our chief International correspondent Lee duet who is in Sarat for us yes to pick up on that phrase reini now is the time for war and here in the South as you can hear the sound of artillery all the signs all the SES are that Israel is preparing for an intensification of this war as we drove into stat which at this point is less than a mile from the Gaza border uh there was the constant sound of heavy artillery you can and I think you can see the the plumes of black smoke Rising that's Gaza City in the background now under nonstop bombardment and we've been reporting on BBC News the humanitarian consequences of Israel's attacks on the Gaza Strip Israel continues to say that it's only attacking Hamas infrastructure only aiming to take out hamas's leaders but as always in war it's also a deepening humanitarian crisis and they're feeling it here in Sou Israel sarot has always been on the front line when it comes to increased confrontation between Israel um and Gaza the Rockets have come in here year after year decades after decades the whole town many places are now shut but some people still want to say saying they can't afford to leave so when we arrived in stat this morning we met the mayor Alon davadi who's appealing to the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to help him evacuate this town you have asked prime minister Netanyahu to evacuate all the residents of your town of course because I want to give the to the government and to the Army a time to make the war against the Kamas and the Jihad and this is a dangerous place now because we are so close to the Gaza to the border of Gaza I know that I speak with you a few time in the last days you see all the and of the missile that land on the town you see on the injur that injur from the rocket we have people that died from that it's a good for the family that Liv in the road to be outside from the city people have not left already you haven't asked them to left yes people left but imagine if you you have your family you cannot rent a hotel for one month from your money this is responsible of the country to give them the H support that they need what's the M toot now you always bear the brunt you're so close to Gaza whenever there's a a crisis erupts we love our city will our government the states of Israel in my heart is breaking when I speak with all the family that that lose their you know father mother that murder for murder with the teror murder them the terrorist murder them my bre my heart is breaking but we need to make the job with the people we need to take care to the people that live here and and thanks to God I hope that we have the courage to continue and to crush the Jad in theas are you angry at your government that this has happened no I'm not angry I'm angry about our love of today I will say something you know you are in the BBC you always and I know that you are do it because you are want that the world will be good Jad and Kama it's a organiz organization that take money and the support from Iran jiad and Hamas don't care about the future of Gaza and don't care about the future of Israel but you must care about the future of Gaza it's your neighbor it's just that if we want if you want that the future of this area will be good we need to find the way to take the Hamas and the Jihad out from Gaza to take all the weapon that they have outside from GDA if they don't want to do it we need to kill them we need to destroy them not for me for you and for all of us and because that I said to the GU the the the Prime Minister take your time if you need one month two months to make H the war from today and it take you two months to destroy them let's do it let's do it just take the people out give them the supply that they need and we pray together me and you and everyone to to God that the God give us the power to destroy the the the evil this is it people here said that in 2008 2014 2021 it keeps happening no it's because when always when we start to make operation in Gaza after one week after two weeks the leadership of britania the leadership of United States and all the country say to netan and say to our prime minister stop stop we you need and I hear the Biden what Biden said I'm I said thank you for you to the president of United States of your support I say thank you for all the leadership of the country that support Israel you need to say to netan take your time if you need your our weapon if you need our soldier we need to destroy it and vage and vage the Hamas and the from the area well leas is still with us but before we go back to lease and Sarat we have an update from the Gaza Health Ministry uh the latest now is that, 1417 Palestinians have been killed since Israeli strikes on since Saturday and 6,268 have been wounded leas uh back to you now when we were talking too earlier we could hear the sound of artillery in the background how are people who want to leave Gaza going to be able to get safe passage well that is the big issue it it it's a very dangerous moment the people of Gaza every time there is a crisis like this they hear Israel's warning to the people of Gaza to leave and they say there's no there's nowhere for us to leave to there's nowhere uh safe enough for us to hide you we have to keep reminding our our our viewers that Israel pulled out his troops in 2005 but Israel still controls the airspace it still controls the waters it controls all of the crossings around this Coastal strip except one which goes through Egypt and and and Israel bombed it the other day so today uh the Egyptians pleaded with the Israelis please don't bomb the crossing at Rafa uh the Rafa Crossing is open today but they can only take in 400 a day and there will be tens of thousands of desperate people trying to get out if of course they have the paperwork to get out and that's why there are intensive discussions going on with the Egyptians the Americans many other countries including the British providing safe passage a way out through that Crossing and also allowing food and fuel to get in to help people who who can't leave I mean most people will want to leave if only for a short time is Egypt of course is wor that it'll have a huge influx of people and that as always in this region a temporary situation becomes a permanent one and no one they don't want to see a depopulation and also it's dangerous people are hiding in their basements if there's bombardment I mean look at that what's now the smoke that's drifting through the sky children elderly to walk on the streets their their there their there's glass everywhere the the rubble strewn across the streets it's dangerous inside the home and it's dangerous outside the home it's dangerous everywhere in Gaza now and Le we've been reporting throughout the day a buildup of troops at the border everyone's trying to guess when that Israeli land incursion might come what's your assessment and what are you thinking at the moment it is a very complex very dangerous undertaking the Israeli Defense Forces has said that the decision to go go in to to launch this kind of operation has still not been taken but everything around uh all the preparations all of the statements all of the pressure suggests nothing else that there will at some point have to be a ground Invasion this is something Israel has tried to avoid we saw in 2014 they made some kind of they did make incursions across the border they were trying to destroy the tunnels which were used by Hamas to bring uh to to penetrate into uh Southern Israel to bring in resources but they didn't go in for a full a full scale Invasion now the big question is are they going to go in are they going to try to reoccupy Gaza this will be fighting Street by Street house by house room by room it is a densely populated enclave and it seems beyond very absolutely certain that if Hamas took made all the preparations to carry out this unprecedented assault they will have also carried out unprecedented preparations to be ready when it knows that Israel will retaliate they are ready now they're waiting for Israel to come in as Israel prepares and all the signs are is that this is gathering Pace by the day one of the BBC's best lease du set please do stay
