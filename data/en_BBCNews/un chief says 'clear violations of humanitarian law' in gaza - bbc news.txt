next we're going to take a look at the diplomacy that's ongoing well right now actually in the past week we have seen a number of world leaders head to Israel uh to offer support and try to deescalate the crisis today it was Emanuel macron of France France here he is as you can see next to Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu he expressed solidarity with Israel says the first objective of the war should be to free all hostages and he says it was Israel's duty to fight against Hamas but he warned against enlarging the conflict let's take a listen I consider that this is an International Coalition in order to fight against these terrorist groups that we have to build I REM I just reminded my people in my language what we discussed about fight against terrorism humanitarian action rules to be respected but as well political process and obviously I warned against an escalation and I want esbah and some other regimes not to be part of what's happening I know how committed you are let me Express once again my solidarity my friendship and the fact that France stands with you so International diplomacy in Israel also in New York too a meeting of the UN Security Council is under away un Secretary General Antonio gues condemned the Hamas attacks and said he was deeply concerned about what he described as a clear violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza he said even War has rules and that the Hamas attack on October 7th did not take place in a vacuum nothing can justify the deliberate killing injuring and kidnapping of civilians or the launching of rockets against civilian targets all hostages must be treated humanely and released immediately and without conditions it is important to also recognize the attacks by amas did not happen in a vacuum the Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation well the Israeli foreign minister was not impressed with the secretary uh General's comments take a listen these kids witness orror which cannot be described by word Mr Secretary General in what world do you live definitely this is not our world this is a terrorist of Hamas what he said in there in Arabs he telling to his mother and fathers that he's proud that he has blood of 10 Jewish that he murdered what monster they gave a birth to Secretary General this is the world that we live foreign minister Eli Cohen there and in the last hour we have heard that he has also cancelled a planned meeting with Secretary General gues that was scheduled for this evening we also heard uh from the top Palestinian Authority Diplomat the ongoing massacres being deliberately and systematically and savagely perpetrated by Israel the occupying power against the Palestinian civilian population under its illegal occupation Must Be Stopped the security Council has a duty to stop them the International Community is obliged under international law to stop them it is our Collective human duty to to stop them now continued failure at this council is inexcusable and let's take you live to New York to show you that uh the meeting is still ongoing we are keeping our eyes and ears across it whilst we do that let's speak to Lieutenant General Mark schz former US security coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority uh who is now with the Rand Corporation an American nonprofit or organization thank you very much for coming on the program thank you Lois it's good to be with you can I just get your reaction first of all just to the uh diplomacy and the words we've heard from around that table this afternoon well I I think there are two realities um certainly the reality that uh you know from October 7th and what the uh families of the victims of that horrific terrorist attack and the subsequent kidnapping of 200 Israelis that are still being held by Hamas but there's also the reality of the Palestinian people and um I think it's accurate and important to highlight uh what is happening inside of Gaza uh specifically with you know the impact of the ongoing uh air and addiction campaign for Preparation uh for the ground offensive and as important but not spoken a lot about are the ongoing confrontations that are occurring between the Israeli security forces and the West Bank settlers provocations by settlers in the West Bank and the violence that's ensued over the course of uh you know certainly well before October 7th but in Earnest now since uh the October 7th terrorist attack and and I want to bring in the role of the US here what in your eyes is the role what what is it in practice in relation to its uh strong Allied relationship with Israel and what do you think it to be trying to do well certainly as we know they're our strongest Ally in the region and we're giving unequivocal support to uh the Israeli government certainly to the military to include the recent deployment of not only the two carrier strike groups but also senior military advisers to share our lessons uh that we experienced in Iraq uh both in the initi found as in Fusia and then subsequent to the liberation of mosul from from Isis so very important but also what we're doing to emphasize the importance of alleviating the humanitarian suffering that's ongoing um in Gaza as well as West Bank you know not welln but the US has historically been the largest single donor to support the Palestinian people from both humanitarian assistance as well as um security assistance in the West Bank so I think it's important that we continue to emphasize the rules of law as it comes to uh Warfare but also to do all we can in you know speaking with Israel certainly but also the broader International Community to alleviate the humanitarian suffering that's occurring in Gaza specifically and there have been reports in Us Media that the Biden Administration has been urging Israel to delay any ground incursion into Gaza more time for hostage negotiations is the presumption do you think that is happening or ought to be happening I I I there's certainly dialogue occurring um while there's ongoing discussions and negotiations and we've seen you've just reported the release now of four um hostages two American and two Israeli and ideally there will there will be many more um in the coming days so I I do think while dialogue ongoing it's important that um the ground offensive is not does not commence because once that occurs I believe any type of dialogue with Hamas with respect to releasing of the hostages will cease um I think also what's occurring behind the scenes is the discussion of the Strategic objective uh Beyond just eliminating the Hamas military capability and it's and the political cap you know political structure of H also what what is Gaza going to like in the Palestinians subsequent to this land uh okay will take place liutenant General Mark Schwartz thank you very much for your time we are right out of time would appreciate your analysis thank you I'm
