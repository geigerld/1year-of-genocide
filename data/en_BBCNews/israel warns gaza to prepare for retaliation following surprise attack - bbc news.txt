Israeli Prime Minister issued this warning in a televised address all of the places Hamas is active in in this city of evil all the places Hamas is hiding in operating from will turn them into ruins I'm telling the people of Gaza get out of there now because we're about to take action everywhere with all our Force this is how the attack by Hamas began yesterday morning armed men cutting through Israel's perimeter fence accompanied by a wave of Rocket attacks Hamas released this footage showing an Israeli tank being targeted it was a highly planned operation catching Israel off guard Israelis who' been at a rave in the fields near Gaza were forced to flee for their lives they were going three by three and shooting everywhere from two sides and I saw many people like people were dying like

leader of Hamas which governs Gaza has promised to end Israel's occupation of Palestinian lands we are on the verge of a great Victory and a clear Conquest on on the Gaza front in the Israeli city of

depraved a view shared by the US president innocent people murdered wounded entire families taken hostage by Hamas just days after Israel marked the holiest of days in the Jewish calendar is

News well let's go live to our report in Gaza rushi abalu uh rushi a very tense situation right now what's the latest that you're hearing inside Gaza yeah was nonstop chilling all night air strike strikes according to sources about 150 targets have been hit since the last night night and until now the explosions could be heard black smoke raised out of the Hamas Comm Commander buildings in in Gaza according to Hamas about houses belong to Hamas senior commanders and also local military commanders have been targeted destroyed about 20 22 people have been killed out of because of the last night night and this morning air strikes and this is bring the the overall diff diff beginning this operation to 252 people and over over 1,700 people have been injured some of them in a very critic critical condition appeal to be able to visit any nearest hospital and donate a blood for for this the this the the the picture here is completely different this morning from yeser from yesterday yesterday we have seen people celebrating Hamas firing thousands of rockets into Israel but this morning the situation is completely the opposite people are staying Indo the sound of explosions the the black smoke are almost across the Gaza Strip also the most of the areas in G are without electricity as Israel stopped the supplying Gaza with with the electricity so only 20% of the electricity needed are available for for Gaza so so most have no electricity and when there is no electricity always the Water Supplies will be affected lines are down since since yesterday and this morning one of the significant air strike that targeted what is called the Waton building it's a building that consider a h a hub for most of the internet providers in in Gaza so more more problem will be faced by the people of Gaza because of destroying this Tower which considered one of the for the internet and rashy you've taken us through what Ordinary People are facing inside Gaza at the moment what about Hamas there has been shock outside of Gaza at the size of the weapons Arsenal that Hamas were able to build up can you shed some light onto that yeah well for the last 17 years Hamas is in control of this territory it's a it's a place where they have a long Coastal border and Al and also a border with the sinin and I think Hamas was all the time not hiding they were all the time saying that we are preparing for such battle with Israel with the we are developing weapons we are smuggling weapons into into Gaza and also they are expecting Israeli to to react react or to what they have done yesterday and we have seen how how Israel hit hard last night and they they continue to do destroying most of the Hamas two three buildings Hamas Banks were destroyed infrastructure for Hamas military compound also so houses for their for their leaders were hit and destroyed so Hamas know the consequences of such to Israel and they must have been expecting that Israeli reaction okay Rashi
