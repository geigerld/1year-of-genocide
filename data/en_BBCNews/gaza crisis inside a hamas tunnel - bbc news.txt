[Music] well we're about to enter one of the tunnels that was discovered by the Israeli Army where I'm standing now used to be a potato field the tunnel was completely concealed we're at a depth of about 15 to 20 M that's about 50 to 65 ft now this particular tunnel we're told is one of the most professional that they have found it was built over the course of several years and a great deal of reinforced concrete was used several tons were to and the entrance here is very narrow and very small so we're going to have to crouch down to get inside well I've got to bend double now to to get in here you can see the roof is very much reinforced and very smooth the Army says there was a lot of work done to get this tunnel into operation along the sides you can see that there's a lot of work has gone in there's wiring there was electricity in here and there's a floor there's a roof it's not quite tall enough for somebody to stand comfortably but the Army believes it was big enough to allow several militants to pass through here and they say that that was the aim at the nearest kibuts the nearest Israeli Community is only a few hundred meters away and just yesterday a tunnel like this was used by a group of Palestinian militants they managed to cross the border below ground they reached an Israeli kots and they fired anti-tank missiles and killed five Israeli soldiers now Israel says dismantling and neutralizing this tunnel Network which it calls a terror tunnel network is the key objective of the offensive in Gaza the Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu says the operation in Gaza will not end until the tunnels have been put out of action
