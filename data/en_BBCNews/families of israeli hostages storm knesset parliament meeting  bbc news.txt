Visions in Israel Over the war in Gaza have been highlighted in the country's Parliament today the knesset families of Israeli hostages who are still being held in Gaza have broken through security and stormed a finance meeting well they were protesting that the finance committee was actually sitting deliberating while their children were still in captivity we're shouting shame on you and demanding that the committee members get up and act the families called for the government to do more to secure the release of their loved ones the protest highlights growing domestic descent in Israel about the war with Hamas that's now in its fourth month what it comes as Palestinians in southern Gaza say the Israeli bombardment is the most intense they've experienced since the War Began the Gaza Health Ministry says that9 Palestinians have been killed in the last 24 hours well let's go live to Jerusalem and to our Middle East correspondent Mark loen and Mark let's start with those events in the knesset Joseph get give us a sense of how much pressure Benjamin Netanyahu is now coming under from hostage families I think uh pretty significant pressure Matthew and growing by the day uh this was quite dramatic scenes although the numbers themselves were quite small but the fact that these uh that these family members uh managed to get into that uh finance committee meeting Ian we think actually they were probably invited by another committee into the conet and then once they finish their appearance they then sort of pushed through security into the finance committee you can just see the depth of emotion I mean one one person shouted we won't let you breathe until our kids come back another held a placard saying you will not sit here while they die there there is a real sense from many of the relatives of the 130 or so hostages who are still not back here in Israel unknown how many of them are dead uh that the the government is not doing enough to prioritize their release and last night on on Sunday night Benjamin nahu gave a a press conference in which he said he would flatly reject any hostage release deal that uh would ensure that Hamas allow could could regroup in in Gaza uh that Israel would have to withdraw its uh troops and that would allow Palestinian prisoners to be released from Israeli jails he said he would not strike a deal with as he as he put it those Hamas monsters so you know he is determined to push with this offensive with the aim in his words of complete destruction of Hamas uh but the families of the hostages and many Israelis in fact the majority of Israelis according to opinion polls feel that the priority needs to be the release of those hostages and Mark let's turn to events on the ground because reports from Southern Gaza from some people saying it's the most intense bombardment they've seen since the the war actually began yeah I mean the the health Ministry in Gaza run by Hamas has said that 50 people were killed in overnight bombing um and 100 people injured in around Kan Yunis uh there is intense uh bombardment now aerial and Naval around Kan Yunis which is where Israel believes the top Hamas commanders are holed up uh it is focusing also around a couple of hospitals in the South one of which has been stormed with uh Israeli troops uh arresting the Medics uh or taking them in for questioning the Medics inside that hospital and another one uh it has been surrounded we understand by Israeli tanks uh Israel insists of course that medical facilities are being used by Hamas uh to launch attacks against Israeli soldiers that is something that is denied by uh the Medics and by and by the authorities down in Gaza uh but uh there is a real sense that that the south of course Remains the focus of the military activity and that is that from from Kan Yunis uh more and more refugees are moving even further south to Rafa Rafa is right on the on the border with Egypt and that is where the vast majority of gazans are now taking Refuge it is is a city that before the war had a population of around 280,000 now has about 1.3 or 1.4 million people Sheltering there that gives you a sense of of of the sort of uh the inundation of people who have gone down to Rafa and the BBC has now estimated that about 75% of Han Yunis which is the main city in southern Gaza is now under Israeli control Mark loen there in Jerusalem thanks very much well I've been speaking to Maru Levy whose brother-in-law is one of the hostages being held in Gaza and I started by asking for his reaction to those scenes in the knesset and whether he shared their frustration yes of course I'm I'm I'm I'm part of the families and and we communicate all the time this weekend was very intense um ever since um Hamas published another psychological warfare video on Friday it led to a lot of frustration anger sadness among the family amilies and and so today every Monday families of hostages go to the knesset to Parliament to go to the different committees one of the Committees the finance committee uh there was an issue of entering so families decided to to enter without a permission and voice the pain um I spoke with with one of them earlier today um and I understand the reasons why they did it they want the Committees to continue discussing the issues of the hostages can you also see why their questioning the basic strategy the notion of Maximum Force to get more hostage releases except it hasn't yielded anything and there's a growing frustration among some of the family members about the basic strategy here yeah I think there there varing um opinions among the families about the strategy about the policy of the government and this weekend we saw uh several rallies one of which was held in front of the prime minister's residence in cesaria um I I understand why there is criticism of of the policy as you said it didn't yield the resorts we wanted hostages are not returning home um and then we receive news about um killed hostages every week uh and so we we beg and we don't beg we demand the government to take our voices into account and ensure that the policy they Implement in the Gaza STP uh ensure that hostages return home that needs to be this shortterm goal of the government uh and of this operation uh irrespective of the long-term goal of dismantling Kamas I'll come back to that point in a moment but let me ask you when and what you've heard most recently about your brother-in-law so the last we've heard about my brother-in-law was in in late November from one of the hostages that was released he was alive then but but sadly we have no news about him or about any of the hostages um hell captive byas I wish I I had a better answer but the ICC is not allowed to visit them we don't receive proof of life and the Israeli authorities do all they can to provide us information but obviously that's limited to an extent because of security concerns um and Kamas will will not provide us that information all they do is provide psychological warfare videos um as they did last weekend and then on Friday President Biden's middle east coordinator is now in Cairo trying to make progress on all of this us officials are reported as saying one of the further complications is that hass's demand is for a permanent ceasefire for any further hostage releases is that in your view a price worth paying I I I'm not responsible for making that decision um I think Israel has a v viable interest that it needs to Pres Reserve um if I look outside as an analyst let's say rather than a family member and understand the the complexity the GE political complexities that the government is facing I think that um we cannot allow Hamas to remain in power in the Gaza Strip after this operation after this war for the mere fact they committed to continue um during October 7 over and over again um and so I hope the the different stakehold will be able to bring both Israel and Hamas and their accomplices closer in the negotiations it seems like there are different proposals yes um families met the Prime Minister today and he said that Israel provided a counter proposal over this weekend um he couldn't elaborate about it and we hope that proposal will bring about some progress in negotiations a final question then because we're seeing a real intensification in terms of the intensity of attacks in the South around K Unice how difficult how excruciating is it for families every single day to to watch events on the ground when they have no idea if their loved ones are in that vicinity I think it's it's difficult um generally we don't want to witness war and suffering uh in our region so it's difficult to to see it difficult to read the news difficult to wake up every morning woring to that we hear about a loved one of us um being killed whether those or held hostage like my brother-in-law uh soldiers on the ground and I have compassion to any non-combatant who is involved in in the middle of this fight um uh it's difficult uh and I don't trust Kamas to be a good faith uh partner in in solving this crisis the opposite they're doing the opposite um they already killed a few of the hostages and release video that really make our life very excruciating I hope this will end soon um for the sake of everyone uh but I understand that it cannot end without the release of the hostages without the dismantling of Kamas Ashi Levy talking to me a little earlier on the program let's
