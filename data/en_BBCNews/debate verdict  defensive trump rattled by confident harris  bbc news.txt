US presidential candidates carela Harris and Donald Trump have attended a Memorial in New York on the 23rd anniversary of the 911 attacks it was a much more somber Affair after last night's head-to-head TV debate ahead of the election in November there were insults and a stream of personal attacks and they sparred on issues including abortion foreign policy and the economy both sides claim victory after the 90-minute debate watched by more than 57 million people from Philadelphia is our North America editor Sarah Smith at a September the 11th memorial service it was Donald Trump who orchestrated a cordial greeting this morning quite a contrast no camela Harris striding across the stage last night to demand a handshake from a reluctant Mr Trump see you have fun thank you it was contentious and ill-tempered with both candidates in attack mode stop with the continuous lying about this stuff what she says is an absolute lie yet again I said it at the beginning of this debate you're going to hear a bunch of Lies coming from this fell excuse me I have to respond another lie this former prosecutor had come prepared to push his buttons people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom provoking an unsubstantiated rant about illegal migrants in Ohio in Springfield they're eating the dogs the people that came in they're eating the cats they're eating they're eating the pets of the people that live there just watch both their faces he is clearly bristling with barely contained frustration she's enjoying mocking and laughing at him but deadly serious when attacking him on abortion rights the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body I have Miss Harris said she would try to reinstate the right to have an abortion but her vice presidential pick says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine he also says EX execution after birth it's an execution no a claim so outrageously untrue one of the debate moderators had to step in there is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born a fluster Donald Trump relied repeatedly on attacking the current administration's record on immigration why are we allowing these millions of people to come through on the southern border how come she's not doing it Democrats here say they are very happy with how KLA Harris managed to keep Donald Trump on the defensive going after him hard getting under his skin and leaving him looking angry and rattled so flustered he made an unexpected personal appearance to try and spin his own verdict I say the truth if I lose votes or gain votes I don't care but uh this was my best debate I thought it was very good I thought she was very weak on foreign policy she was very weak On the Border at the same time a confident Harris campaign immediately suggested a second debate next month she wants it because she lost do you have an answer well I don't know I have to think about it but if you won the debate I sort of think maybe I shouldn't do it why should I do another debate and we will win post debate celebrations in the Harris Camp were capped by a huge celebrity endorsement as Taylor Swift declared after watching that event she'll be voting for kamla [Applause] Harris Sarah Smith BBC News Philadelphia well as you saw there were plenty of claims and counter claims our analysis editor rosak kins was watching the debate from Washington and has been factchecking some of them Donald Trump says the TV debate was rigged his supporters are saying it was three against one because the two moderators fat checked him more than kamla Harris but he said much more that wasn't true immigrants in the City of Springfield Ohio are eating the dogs eating the cats they're eating the pets of the people that live there the moderators highlighted that ABC had contacted a city official who had debunked this claim and BBC verifier has also been told there's no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed injured or abused by individuals within the Immigrant community in total Trump was fact checked or clarified five times KLA Harris not once despite making such claims as Donald Trump left us the worst unemployment since the Great depression that's not true in 2021 When Donald Trump left Office Unemployment was at 6.4% in 2009 it was 10% on abortion Harris said if Donald Trump were to be reelected he will sign a National Abortion B that's misleading Donald Trump says he'll leave the states to decide their positions and if these statements went unchecked so did many others by Donald Trump on immigration he claimed we have millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails from mental institutions and insane asylums this is not supported by available evidence during one attack on Biden and Harris Trump claimed we have inflation like very few people have ever seen before probably the worst in our nation's history that's not true inflation in the US peaked at 99.1% in June 2022 and it's been above 9% at various points in US history so claims went unchecked others were challenged and this was different to the Biden Trump debate in June when CNN decided not to fact check during the debate though it did afterwards this is another illustration of how ever since Trump ran in 2016 the media has wrestled with how to respond to the volume of false and misleading claims that he makes in this debate both candidates made statements that require correction but Trump did so more than Harris it's not biased or rigged to point this out rakins there well our North America editor Sarah Smith joins us now the polls have certainly shifted since President Biden decided not to run again just how tight is this election looking well the poll suggests that it is still absolutely neck and neck so although CA Harris today is feeling confident after putting in a strong performance that does not mean she is assured a victory in November because consider this there are only 8 weeks to go until the election but it was just 8 weeks ago that the last presidential election saw Joe Biden's candidacy destroyed clearly a lot can happen in that short period of time last night did give voters a chance to see both of these candidates head-to-head for the first time they could compare temperament and demeanor but they were a bit short changed on policy detail and as we keep saying because it's true this election will be decided by very slim majorities in just a very small number of those key swing States Sarah Smith our North America editor thank you and you can hear plenty more on that debate on the latest americast podcast it is available now on BBC sounds
