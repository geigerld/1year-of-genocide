the United States and Britain have imposed new sanctions on Iran and its weapons manufacturers to punish tan for its missile and drone attacks on Israel last weekend at a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Italy Lord Cameron said he hoped the international response would persuade Israeli officials not to retaliate too strongly and see off a wider War White House officials said the sanctions were aimed at disrupting Iran's ability to produce the unmanned aerial vehicles that its military used to attack Israel by cutting off Global Financial transactions with those companies involved in building them at the UN Iran's foreign minister Hussein Amir had this to say in case of any use of force by the Israeli regime and violating our sovereignty the Islamic Republic of Iran will not hesitate to assert its inherent rights to give a decisive and proper response to it to make the regime regret its actions but in New York the UN Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez was decidedly downbeat about the situation in the Middle East warning that the region is on a precipice in a speech to the UN Security Council Mr Gutierrez urged all countries to exercise maximum restraint saying one miscalculation could lead to full-scale regional conflict it is I time to end the bloody cycle of retaliation it is I time to stop top the International Community must work together to prevent any actions that could push the entire Middle East over the edge with a devastating impact on civilians let me be clear the risks are spiraling on many fronts in Italy Ukraine was also on the agenda here's the UK foreign secretary Lord David Cameron on the support that KF needs Ukraine couldn't be clearer they need more ammunition we are helping to fill that Gap uh they need more air defenses that Gap needs to be filled no country has done more than Britain in terms of helping the Ukrainian Armed Forces helping the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian government and we look forward to hearing what foreign minister CA has to say today about the further steps that we need to take well let's get reaction then in Italy for us tonight at the G7 Jessica Parker and also our diplomatic correspondent who's in Jerusalem James landel James if I could just start with you does the Israeli War cabinet share the view of the Secretary General that things are as precarious as he believes they are oh I think they are aware of the consequences um of any further miscalculation uh if Israel's response to Iran's attack at the weekend does trigger an escalatory process uh yeah know I think they are incredibly aware of that but at the same time they are determined to respond and I think what they would want to do is respond and then leave it at that you hear that from spokespeople saying you know we need to act we need to do something they're aware of the consequences whether they are as aware as concerned as some of their allies uh have been uh signaling in recent days I think remains to be seen we simply don't know yet precisely what the Israelis are going to do they they say they are going to act we don't know how yet we don't know when uh there is some speculation it's no more than that that it's possible they might delay any action until after the Passover holiday but again that could be just people here in Jerusalem um wishing uh for the best a little bit of what's called optimism bias yeah Jess the the sanctions announced today were heavily trailed um ahead of the meeting will they molfy the Israelis is there any faith in a sanctions regime like this because they're obviously not the first sanctions imposed on Iran no I mean I think think the UK figures are 13 entities and individuals being sanctioned uh as you said linked to Iran's missile and drone program to add to the already existing 400 sanctions that are in place but look I think certainly the hope is from the likes of Lord Cameron um the British foreign secretary that this will be something they can sell again to the Israelis this idea of a win uh an act of solidarity sending a message to Iran but it's interesting um Lord Cameron alongside the German foreign minister analena bbok arrived here to Capri pretty late yesterday because they' come both of them from Israel where they'd been meeting with Israeli leaders as they were obviously calling on Israel to show restraint um in response to the Iranian attack that message has continued here although it has to be said discussions have now moved on uh to the war in Ukraine but I think it was interesting to note that after those conversations that anela bbok and David Cameron had in Israel Benjamin Netanyahu was very clear that Israel would be making its own choices the other discussion in Capri Jess was Ukraine uh they're returning to this idea of using the Frozen Russian assets or the the interest acrude from those assets to fund the war effort how far have they got with that because I know it is part of one of the bills that discuss in the US House of Representatives this weekend yeah it seems to be a pretty complicated idea and one as you say that's been kicking around for a really long time and there's been hesitancy before because of legal complexities as talking to officials here tonight they say they tell me the US is pushing this idea as you say using uh Frozen Russian assets the bulk of which are held in Europe um to use the interest to then get a loan in order to channel money to Ukraine in terms of whether this is going to happen obviously we don't know the indications I've had is that it certainly won't get over the line at this G7 foreign ministers um meeting if anything if they can get there it would be something they tried to finalize at the leaders G7 Summit uh later in the Summer James one of the the more alarming uh pieces of rhetoric we heard today from the Iranian side was that they're reviewing their nuclear strategy um they seem to be implying rather overtly that it they might try and seek a nuclear weapon if if Israel were to attack them I mean when you look at at how that might play out if you stretch forward and look at the implications of that we could soon be into a a new arms race yeah look the Iranians are in full deterrence mode at the moment doing everything they possibly can to minimize uh whatever Israeli response is coming and one of we've just heard it from that clip from um Mr Abdul Alan the the Iranian foreign minister speaking at the UN you've also had this um irgc revolutionary Guard general talking about this nuclear thing now at the moment uh Iran says that its nuclear program is purely civilian there are many countries in the west that do not believe them and have been trying to restrict that program for many many years because they fear that actually Iran is is trying to develop weapons grade uh n nuclear fuel that could be used uh to make a nuclear weapon so for Iran to say to become overt about its nuclear ambition you know would be a substantial step change it's part of the attempt to try and persuade the Israelis to minimize their escalation it could have the opposite effect it could encourage the Israelis to Target those nuclear facilities uh that they have done before and and could well do again so again every Iranians Trying to minimize Israel's response but Israel's still being pulled they want to respond pressure from the Iranians pressure from their allies you know they're in quite a bind at the moment they haven't finally made up their decisions yet just briefly James just a quick word on the qataris who've been talking today saying they they're going to consider whether to continue in the role as mediators why are they concerned about what's been going on look there are some American politicians who've been critical of the Qatar is saying they're not putting enough pressure on Hamas to agree a deal that they're you know they're hosting the Hamas leadership in Qatar alongside a big American base what's happened is the Qatar is a pushing back saying look enough of that you know if you guys push us any further we could you know draw stumps and leave this negotiation nobody really wants that so I think this is an act of the qataris pushing back against those American critics James landelle Jess Parker lovely to see you both thank you for your contributions tonight
