my staff are continuing to document several other cases in which family residences were destroyed with reported loss of civilian life and in which preliminary indication suggest not even a single member of an armed group was present then just two days ago on 21st July shells hit the AL AA Hospital in dear albella reportedly killing at least three people and wounded dozens of others including doctors these are just a few instances where there seems to be a strong possibility that International humanit humanitarian law has been violated in a manner that could amount to war crimes every one of these incidents must be properly and independently investigated
