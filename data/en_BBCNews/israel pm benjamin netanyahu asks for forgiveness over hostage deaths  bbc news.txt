the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin netan who has asked for forgiveness from Israelis for not being able to bring back alive the six hostages who were found dead in Gaza on Saturday we were very close he said we were nearly there in a televised address he remain defiant in his demand that Israeli troops must continue to control the Philadelphia Corridor in south of Gaza something Hamas has rejected Corridor along the Egypt Gaza border has emerged as a primary sticking in ceasefire talks he said it's a Lifeline for Hamas their oxygen and it will determine Israel's future let's hear some of what he said I am begging for your forgiveness that we did not succeed bringing them home alive we were very close nearly there and I would like to repeat once again this evening Israel will not move onto our normal agenda after that Massacre Hamas will pay a very heavy price for it the war against this axis of Evil in this specific war against Hamas the first crack and of course that doesn't bring about a deal whatsoever but the first crack was when we went into ravak and we took over the Philadelphia Corridor and and the RAF um trans Transit point because that was literally their way they actually could breathe and their oxygen they were hoping that Iran or hisbah would come and save them now that they're hoping that International pressure would now extricate them from that situation but the only effective change that would be enabled would be if we hold on to the Philadelphia Corridor and not vacate it not evacuate it because once we leave it we'll never be able to go back so that's a taste a sense of what Netanyahu was saying in that address just in the last 90 minutes 2 hours or so a little earlier President Biden said that a final deal for a ceasefire and the release of hostages held in Gaza is very close to being presented to Israel and Hamas by mediators but he told reporters he did not think that the Israeli Prime Minister was doing enough to secure an agreement Biden spoke to reporters as he arrived at the White House to meet us negotiators let's have a listen you planning to present a final hostage deal for the uh both sides this week we're very close to that what makes you think that this deal will be successful in a way that the other deals were not hope friends Eternal Mr President if do you think it's time for p prime minister Netanyahu to do more on this issue do you think he's doing enough no Mr President so that last answer there The crucial one is he doing enough no answered President Biden well let's take you to Israel itself now because there has been plenty of criticism uh by many thousands of people in Israel at well aimed at uh prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu these are the live pictures from Jerusalem people out on the streets urging uh their leader to do more to bring the hostages home there have been protests on the streets of Jerusalem similarly large prot protests in Tel Aviv as well happening right now they were taking place actually on the streets as Benjamin netan who was holding that televised address well a little earlier a strike went ahead today until a court ordered people to end it and returned to work the Nationwide industrial action caused flight delays and also hit medical centers schools and businesses our Middle East correspondent Lucy Williamson reports Israel's protesters and their prime minister are old acquaintances calls for a hostage deal have brought long established opponents onto the streets but the shooting of six hostages in a Gaza tunnel last week has broadened this movement they say and the mass demonstrations in Tel Aviv last night were a turning point I think the news of the six hostages the fact that they were alive and murdered right before they could have been saved that broke it after last night's Mass protests people are back on the streets again there are growing public and political demands on Israel's prime minister to make a deal but Benjamin Netanyahu protected by his parliamentary majority isn't listening but then much of the country isn't protesting the one-day general strike today largely unobserved even in left leaning Tel Aviv a Court ruled that the strike was political and ended it these protests are part of the well established opposition to Israel's prime minister analysts say and so far little threat to him I think that netan knows better than I do the best thing is to let it uh play as a safety valve to do some V ation and let people say we hate you you are murderer uh enough is enough two of the protest most vocal activists not in the street today but in the cemetery the parents of Hostage hsh Goldberg pollen burying their son for 23 years I was privileged to have the most stunning honor to be hersh's Mama I'll take it and say thank you I just wish it had been for longer tonight in Jerusalem the demonstrations began again Mr Netanyahu is used to opposition on the street but he's also facing demands from the US president and his own defense minister those demands may be harder to ignore Lucy Williamson BBC News Jerusalem let's speak now to Aaron David Miller Senior fellow the carnegi Endowment for International Peace Think Tank he's previously been an adviser on Arab Israeli negotiations to both Republican and Democratic administrations thank you for coming on the program thanks for having me so can I ask you about that pressure on prime minister Netanyahu from people in his own country out on the streets yet again right now and from the US president uh there Joe Biden what's your assessment of his position you know it's a rare combination you now have massive public protests on the streets you have the Israeli Minister of Defense openly charging uh in during a time of War at a cabinet meeting uh that the prime minister is advocating his moral responsibility and failing to make a choice you either have the Philadelphia Corridor or you can free the hostage and you have some pressure from the administration but I have to say that the reason we we are where we are is because in negotiations only when two parties believe that there is urgency to close when the advantages of closing the deal outweigh the disadvantages of keeping it open to have an agreement and within the last three days you've seen a demonstration the absence of urgency number one the decision by Hamas who issued instructions presumably that on the approach of IDF soldiers keeping in mind the Israeli operation to free hostages in nro in central Gaza um that they were to be killed that act in my judgment has created enormous room for Benjamin met netan to maneuver and it's constricted the room and the margin for pressure from the Biden Administration the second act was Nan's uh press conference today in which he turned the Philadelphia Corridor literally into the full Crum of Western civilization and the only the only alternative there's no alternative but is really control in order to beat the and he referred to it three times the access Access of Evil summoning up a a a quote from um former President George W bush in a speech in the wake of 911 so I think this these two leaders are simply unwilling they are able but they are unwilling to make the kind of arrangements and concessions necessary to even get a phase one deal which I still continue to believe is doable but well I you you've laid out there pretty clearly and without a great deal of optimism but I'm going to ask anyway you heard President Biden saying he you know thinks a a deal ready to put to negotiators on both sides is pretty close when you hear that it sounds like given the position that the leaders have put them M themselves in you don't think there's much chance of it actually happening anytime soon I think if the administration puts this last chance final proposal on the table unless barring some fundamental 11th hour change of heart it seems to me they're going to get the administration is going to get at best a yes but and if the administration believes this is truly the last chance and they do get a yes butt what do the administration going to do stop negotiating stop engaging I've seen this movie in negotiations many times you should only put a final proposal on the table uh and if in fact the parties uh are not prepared to accept it you need to be serious about walking away and frankly I don't think the Biden Administration in in the next 70 days in anticipation of one of the most consequential elections in modern American history has the luxury or option of walking away we are in a negotiators called the saac with no easy or quick way out president said Hope Springs Eternal Aon David Miller we must leave it there but um really appreciate us for you well you lending us your expertise and insight in those negotiations thank you one final significant update from this afternoon the UK foreign secretary David Lamy announced a partial suspension of arms Sports to Israel this is after a review Into the country's compliance with international law when taking military action in Gaza let's take a listen the assessment I have received leaves me unable to conclude anything other than that for certain UK arms exports to Israel there does exist a clear risk that they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law I have informed my right honorable friend the business and trade secretary and he is therefore today announcing the suspension of around 30 from a total of approximately 350 to Israel as required under the export controls act let's speak to our political correspondent Harry Farley in Westminster Harry good to see you so we should put this in some kind of context I suppose the UK isn't a a great exporter to Israel in this regard and it isn't a complete ban or anything like that but politically talk us through the significance here yes that's right leis you it's important to make those points it's not an arms embargo it's not a a complete ban on weapons exports you heard David Lamy Lamy the foreign secretary there saying you know it's about 30 of 350 existing licenses but as you say uh politically this is a very sensitive issue for the labor party the governing party here in the UK because they lost several seats they would have otherwise been have been expected to win in the general election earlier this year to candidates independent candidates largely standing on uh LA Pro Gaza tickets particularly campaigning on that issue now interestingly since David Lamy was speaking just a few hours ago the government has published a summary of how it made that decision to suspend some arms licenses and crucially it says that it's not simply based on Israel's conduct in Gaza it says despite the mass mass casualties of the conflict in Gaza it has not been possible to reach a determinative judgment on the allegations regarding Israel's conduct of hostilities but rather this decision is based on two par two other factors humanitarian the assessment that the government has done is that Israel has not done enough has not done all that it could to allow humanitarian Aid into civilians in Gaza and also the assessment or the summary of the assessment that the government has published says there have been credible claims of mistreatment of detainees and the volume and consistency of these allegations suggest at least some instances of mistreatment contrary to international human humanitarian law so the decision is been has been based on that concern about treatment of detainees and on the concern about the not enough humanitarian Aid getting through into Gaza not simply based on Israel's uh conduct in Gaza Harry thank you very much for talking us through that
