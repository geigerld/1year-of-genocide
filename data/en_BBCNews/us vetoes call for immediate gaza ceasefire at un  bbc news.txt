well let's take you live to the United Nations where the Security Council is hearing arguments around the situation in Gaza let's have a listen in as the United States is Linda Thomas Greenfield is currently speaking more period And so that ultimately we can together help create a future in which Israelis and Palestinians live in states of their own side by side in peace we're committed to engaging constructively on our resolution with you all in the days to come to that end and we will continue to tirelessly engage in direct diplomacy and negotiations on the ground thank you of the United States for her statement and I now give the floor to the representative of okay we're just going to leave that ongoing conversation uh in the UN General Assembly but what's been happening in the last few moments is that there was an Algerian draft resolution uh about a ceasefire in Gaza uh there were 13 votes in favor of that call for a ceasefire the UK abstained and the US blocked its passage with a Vita so this is the third time that the United States has exercised its Visa veto I should say on Gaza at the UN Security Council we were just hearing there from the United States ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas Greenfield well to unpack all of that I'm joined Now by Neda toi who is our un correspondent Neda if you could just walk us through what exactly has happened yeah well vir uh the United States again blocking an attempt in the UN Security Council to get a resolution through that calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire it is something the United States has objected to uh they have of course uh supported its Ally Israel and and their military operation it it's attempt as Israel says to go after Hamas but in quite frankly the almost the entire rest of the council has for months now been begging for a un Security Council resolution the Arab group of Nations warning that is what is taking place in Gaza amounts to the collective punishment of Palestinians something the UN agrees with as well saying the Arab group of Nations it amounts to a genocide and we heard the Algerian representative speak before the vote and he warned that the situation in Gaza was reaching a critical juncture where the call for a ceasefire would soon lose significance he said every Palestinian is a target for death extermination and genocide we must ask ourselves how many innocent lives must be sacrificed before the council deems it necessary to call for a ceasefire so we saw there 13 members uh endorsing that call for a ceasefire the United Kingdom abstaining the United States blocking it and the US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas Greenfield said that the resolution was wishful and irresponsible she actually put forward this argument that the resolution would put in Jeopardy talks that the United States is in at the moment with Israel Egypt and Qatar to reach a temporary uh pause uh in the fighting for six weeks to get all of the hostages released and the United States has actually proposed its own alternative resolution which registers its opposition to Israel's plans uh of a ground incursion into Rua and the Ambassador said to council members that that that their proposed resolution was not as some members claimed an American effort to cover for an imminent ground incursion but rather it was a sincere statement of their concern for the 1.5 million civilians who have sought Refuge that us proposal is still being debated just to break this down a bit so that our viewers can kind of understand all the different things that are being tabled um Algeria tabled something the US vetoed that the UK abstained what exactly has the US put forward then as its own draft and what's happening with that yeah so the United States over the weekend had signaled they were going to veto this resolution by Algeria and they have proposed an alternative resolution now that resolution for the first time does use the word ceasefire but it calls for a temporary ceasefire as soon as practicable now that very much Echoes language that we have seen President Biden using publicly saying that he's used that in talks with Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu again to get that temporary pause in fighting for 6 weeks to get the hostages released so it very much Echoes that language but it does does have also strong language on the US opposition to an Israel Israeli ground incursion into Rua saying that that would harm more civilians it would forcibly displace them potentially into neighboring countries a reference to Egypt saying it would be a threat to International Peace and security and so as I say Linda Thomas Greenfield the US ambassador said that that resolution is very much a sincere uh representation of the US's concern for civilians in rough uh but you know what we've heard from council members here regini is that it is time for an immediate ceasefire and and they want to see that in a security Council product okay n toi we'll leave you at the UN for the moment but I'm sure we will return to events there throughout the course of the afternoon
