thanks nafisa now if you're just joining us here on BBC News just to bring you up to speed with what's been happening Israel has confirmed that it has carried out a targeted strike Israel's Army says it has carried out a strike in Beirut targeting the Hezbollah Commander it says was responsible for the attack on the Golden Heights now we are joined by Hugo BGA who is in southern Lebanon Mark loen in Jerusalem as well as nafisa conad who is joining us from Beirut itself Hugo get us up to speed with with what's been happening we just mentioned that Israel has confirmed that it carried out this targeted uh strike into beout do we know yet casualties or how severe the the blast was yeah we are seeing some pictures of uh of the destruction uh at least one building partially collapsed uh in that area where this attack happened uh in the southern suburbs of Beirut again uh the significance of this attack is that this happened in an area that is controlled by Hezbollah in the capital uh beut so Hezbollah may see this Israeli attack as a provocation as an escalation uh in the hostilities and may decide that uh they have no other option than uh retaliate so I think this is uh the big concern here that this could lead to another escalation in the hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel there have been reports here in Lebanese media suggesting that at least one person was killed uh several people have been uh injured as a result of this attack this is a densely populated uh area of Beirut and this happened about an hour ago just after halfast 7 uh in the evening here uh in Lebanon and uh the Israeli authorities have confirmed that they were behind this attack uh They said that the Target was a commander that was behind the attack that happened on Saturday uh that hit the Israeli occupied golen Heights uh killing 12 children and teenagers and right after that attack the Israeli authorities promised a a response a severe response they blamed Hezbollah for the attack we heard from uh the defense minister of Israel saying that Hezbollah had crossed uh a red line with the attack and now this Israeli response has ol had claimed an attack uh on Saturday in the area of this explosion but then after the scale of this attack became clear it denied any kind of responsibility any kind of involvement in this attack that happened on Saturday and for days we've been waiting for this response Israeli authorities promising a uh retaliation and now this happened uh this evening with the southern suburbs of Beirut a Hezbollah stronghold uh being hit yeah thanks Hugo
