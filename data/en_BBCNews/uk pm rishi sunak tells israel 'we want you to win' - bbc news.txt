Chancellor Schultz who also visited here called Hamas uh the new Nazis he was right you fought the Nazis 80 years ago uh resolutely uh and the entire world supported your action President Biden called Hamas worse than Isis he's right too Hamas are the new Nazis they're the new Isis and we have to fight them together just as the world the Civilized World United to fight uh the Nazis and United to
