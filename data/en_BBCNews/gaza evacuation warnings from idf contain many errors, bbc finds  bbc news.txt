evacuation warnings by Israel to people in Gaza ahead of attacks have contained a host of Errors BBC analysis has revealed warnings contained contradictory information were confusing and sometimes misnamed districts experts say such mistakes could violate Israel's obligations under international law the Israel Defense Forces rejected any assertion the warnings were confusing or contradictory Stephanie heti reports has been under attack in December Salah Amed didn't know he was subject to an evacuation warning we didn't have internet connection and the communication Services failed when he did get online he found this two months into war with Hamas Israel presented this map a grid system dividing Gaza into hundreds of numbered blocks it was under International pressure to be more precise in warning people away from the most dangerous battlefields then it issued 100 of posts on social media and sent millions of leaflets and phone messages referencing this grid system we analyzed all the warnings published on the idf's Arabic social media channels since the 1st of December as well as the limited number of leaflets we could find photographed and shared online These Warnings contained Vital Information to help people get away from danger but they also contained errors we counted 26 separate warnings and 17 of them contained errors that made parts of them contradictory or confusing here you can see the idf's Arabic Twitter account in January at the international court of justice Israel's lawyers presented One of These Warnings as an example of the lengths it was going to to protect Palestinians we found two errors in that warning block 55 and 99 were listed in the text of the post but they weren't shaded on the map this type of error happened at least 12 times in one warning some of the blocks listed in the post post were on the opposite side of Gaza to those highlighted on the map in another the map on the post doesn't match the grid system this is block 2220 in the map on the post but on the grid system this is block 2220 and blocks 2221 to 2225 when presented with this evidence the IDF didn't address mistakes in maps specifically but said the text of the post was sufficiently clear and it said these posts were only part of a multifaceted and extensive effort to move ions out of Harm's Way Salah eventually found his block but it was cut in two his family were unsure what to do he left with his children but his in-laws stayed put until fighting escalated further if warnings are systematically unclear or it is not possible for civilians to make sense of them for instance because they lack internet access or These Warnings contain errors that lead civilians to places where they're less safe then the warnings do not fulfill the proper function that they ought to have under International humanitarian law the IDF say it's clear that many people moved to safety even after the warnings in our analysis it said IDF warnings have saved countless lives in Gaza Stephanie Hagerty BBC News
