the UK foreign secretary Lord Cameron has arrived in Jerusalem for talks with Israel's leaders about their response to Iran's drone and missile attack over the weekend he's also expected to discuss the continuing humanitarian crisis in Gaza the United Nations is launching a 2.8 billion appeal to provide Aid to the Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip and occupied West Bank with 90% of the money going towards Gaza meanwhile as Israel continues to meet to decide how and when might respond to Iran's missile and drone attack the US and EU look to impose new sanctions on Iran the White House has said they will Target Iran's missile and drone program and EU foreign policy Chief Joseph barell said the block was working on a sanctions plan after a number of EU Nations requested a tough response let's get the latest with our diplomatic correspondent James landel who's in Jerusalem James welcome to you what can we expect from David Cameron's visit there well I expect him to continue the message uh of restraint that Western leaders have been uh calling for uh ever since Iran attacked this country with missiles and drones over the weekend uh the Prime Minister uh had a call with the uh Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last night in which he said escalation was in no one's interests it would only deepen the insecurity of the region it was time for calm heads to Prevail as well as that message though I think the Prime Minister the foreign secretary will also be talking to the Israeli is about what more they can do to get Aid in to Gaza that's something that has been I think the focus has moved away from that because of the attention on Iran and I think also the foreign secretary is going to try and return some of the pressure back onto those talks to try and get a ceasefire in Gaza saying look you know it's up to um you know Hamas uh to accept a deal so I think those are the areas that he's likely to discuss when he meets Israeli leaders and also um those Palestinian leaders in the occupied West Bank James what more do we know about possible sanctions the US and EU are discussing over Iran well the Americans said yesterday that they are going to introduce new sanctions on Iran specifically over attacking the supply chains that allow Iran to build drones and build their missiles the EU also talking about that there's a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Italy later on today that um David Cameron Lord Cameron will also be at they're also going to be talking um about as well so I think there's an attempt to try and keep this Coalition of support for Israel that has grown as a result of Iran's uh attack at the weekend and try to operationalize it if you like and say look let's what we see what we can do to put more pressure both diplomatically and also economically on Iran as a result but remember sanctions take a long time to have any practical impact so in the short term it's purely about political positioning and putting more pressure on Tran okay James thank you well let's speak now to ammen saal Professor of Middle Eastern studies at the Australian National University Welcome to you thanks very much for being with us let's start with Iran several days on now from their attack on Israel what what's the view do you think in Iran from the upper echelons and those who were behind this decision to attack Israel directly do you think they view this as a a success well from their perspective it has been success because they basically wanted to uh reestablish deterrence and at the same time send a very strong signal to uh Israel uh that Iran is not a paper tiger and it is prepared to protect its Assets in the region uh because Iranian attack was very much in retaliation uh to Israel's bombing of the Iranian Consulate in Damascus um but at the same time Iran has made it clear that it's not uh there to uh open a big war with the Israel H and uh it uh retaliation uh was very measured and it did not really cause a lot of damage to Israel and it only targeted military bases uh but of course uh Israel was not able to uh deal with the Iranian missiles and drones on its own in fact many of those projectiles were shot down by the Americans and the British and of course also to some extent jordanians um so it also the Iranian attack in a way showed Israel's vulnerability in other words Israel is no longer an invincible power and therefore the only Power in the region and Iranians have really made a stand yeah you say it was very measured it crossed a red line by directly attacking Israel for the first time ever uh and you say also reestablish deterrence but we don't know what the Israeli response is going to be and there are those calling for a direct strike on Iran's nuclear facilities aren't they so it could still escalate and is that a a risk that the Iranian regime is is willing to take well absolutely but now uh it depends what Israel is going to do and if Israel wants to uh attack Iranian military and nuclear facilities and oil resources uh then obviously that is going to result in a much uh bigger uh escalation of this conflict the Iranian side has made it clear that they will be uh responding to any Israeli attack in uh much harsher way than they have uh in the past and so therefore the scene is really set for the widening of this conflict unless Israel is restrained and of course this is what the United States and also some of its allies including Britain are trying to uh do to basically you know ask Israel uh not to retaliate or at least not to retaliate in a way which could result in the expansion of the conflict doesn't this leave Iran increasingly isolated and under pressure at home we saw Jordan take part in shooting down some of those drones didn't we we haven't seen any of those Regional allies come out out in support or Regional countries come out in support of Iran and the people of Iran are under pressure economically as well they've been of course increasing protest against the regime over the past year 18 months so isn't actually the regime under more pressure well the regime is under pressure and uh but I don't think the regime really expected that the Arab countries or for that matter Jordon really coming out in support of Iranian actions uh I think the the regime is fully aware that it does not have the love of everybody in the region but it does have the support of Russia and has the support of China Iran has got very close strategic ties with these two powers and at the same time it has got plenty of assets and region that it can use against Israel and against the international supporters of Israel if they decide to get involved in Israeli LED war with Iran I'm in cycle thank you the United Nations has voiced concerns about escalating violence in the occupied West Bank it comes after a wave of attacks sparked by the killing of an Israeli teenager the UN has accused Israel's security forces of active participation in attacks on Palestinians by Jewish settlers the vast majority of the International Community considers the settlements illegal under international law although Israel disputes this here Hugo take CAU on CCTV a man setting fire to a car as Israeli settlers storm a Palestinian Village in the occupied West Bank Israeli soldiers watch outside and appear to do nothing across the West Bank on the weekend Israeli settlers went on a rampage this was the village of M near ramala on Saturday settlers set houses and cars on fire killing one man Jihad Abu alyah he was 25 and planning to get married in June Jihad was trying to prevent the settlers from breaking the house door of Sam house where dozens of the Town residents arrived in the home to prevent them from burning the house it wasn't the first time settlers attacked us but we weren't expecting a huge number of them the violence was sparked by The Disappearance of this Israeli boy 14-year-old bamin aim he went missing on on Friday and a day later was found dead the Israeli Army says he was murdered the attacks show how tensions in the West Bank are escalating since the Hamas attacks on the 7th of October more than 460 Palestinians and 13 Israelis have been killed if nothing changes there will be even more violence for this campaign and monitoring settlement activity the situation is unprecedented I think that H the level of the violence is the highest that I remember they feel also a lot of support from the government and probably from the public Le their public that their violence is kind of necessary against the evil which are the Palestinians it's not only settler violence that's on the rise raids by the Israeli Army have intensified killing many Palestinians the Israeli Army says it's investigating the aren incident caught on CCTV but across the West Bank many Palestinians are living in fear they wonder when the next attack will come Hugo basa BBC News
