time since the start of the Israel Gaza War Israel will temporarily reopen The erat's Crossing in Northern Gaza ashdod Port will also be opened for humanitarian deliveries and more Aid trucks from Jordan will be allowed to cross Israel to Gaza the call between Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu was their first since an Israeli air strike killed seven International Aid workers from the charity group World Central Kitchen sparking International outrage the White House is urging Israel to allow a dramatic increase of Aid into Gaza within hours or days sha Dilly reports in the heart of the White House a phone call with Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a clear message from the US president that his patience is running low Joe Biden told his cart that Israel must do more immediately to protect civilians and Aid workers in Gaza if he wants American Support to continue it's no secret that tensions between the two leaders have been bubbling for some time but the US is Israel's most powerful Ally in his hardest criticism yet Joe Biden called the growing humanitarian crisis unacceptable and said he expects Mr Netanyahu to take steps towards an immediate ceasefire the president made it clear that our policies with respect to Gaza uh will be dependent upon our assessment of how well the Israelis uh make changes and Implement changes uh to to make the situation in Gaza better for the Palestinian people and how much time are you giving them to make these changes to implement these concrete we we would hope to see some announcements of changes here in coming hours and days a clear message and one is is has been quick to hear within hours Israel said it had approved more humanitarian routs to increase Aid to Gaza the erors gate in Northern Gaza will be temporarily opened for the first time since the start of the war more aid from Jordan will enter through the caram Shalom Crossing this was the two leaders first call since seven Aid workers were killed in an Israeli air strike on Monday among the dead three British citizens working to distribute food Israel said their deaths were a tragic mistake for the families of the dead it's a claim they don't accept they were in deconflict zone um controlled by the IDF they were following all the rules and procedures Israel which are very strict Israel laid out the world Central Kitchen has never lost a staff person since they opened their doors so he felt reasonably confident that he could accomplish the mission um safely I grew up without having a father and now my grandson will grow up without having his father the United Nations said 500 Aid trucks would be needed every day to support civilians in Gaza right now though any progress is being welcomed by those who desperately need food water and Medicine sha Dilly BBC News well let's get more on events in the Middle East and speak to our correspondent in Jerusalem Yan now is standing by for as highand good to see you uh let's start with that phone call between President Biden and prime minister Netanyahu the first since uh the death of the seven International Aid workers on Monday tell us more about what happened in that call well this was a stark warning really from uh President Biden uh to uh Israel its close Ally uh that really it was prepared to to make changes uh in its policies towards Israel if Israel didn't change its conduct of the war and didn't do more to protect uh civilians in Gaza and also Aid workers and I think often in the past we have seen relatively little change um after these kinds of uh problems have have bubbled up between uh the US and Israel it's very telling that this time what we've seen within hours is a meeting of Israel's security cabinet and what we're told our immediate steps being announced to increase the amount of Aid going into Gaza and they are actually things that have been asked for repeatedly by Aid agencies by International diplomats so Israel has said that it's going now to open up uh the eras Crossing in the very north of the Gaza Strip This has for years been um the main uh crossing point for people to go in and out of Gaza controlled by Israel it's the location where we've of course been in and out in the past as journalists when we were allowed to access Gaza it's also going to mean that the ashdod port which is only about U 20 mi along the coast from the north of the Gaza Strip that is going to be uh used to process uh more shipments up to now it's had very limited use uh for Aid going into Gaza and it's something that could really make a big difference particularly in conjunction with using uh the areas Crossing to get into the north of Gaza where we've been told by the un uh that famine is looming largest and there'll also be steps Tak I'm told to uh have much more going along the Jordanian land Corridor which links up with the Kem Shalom Crossing in the south of the Gaza Strip and Yan do we know how soon any of this could happen well they have been talking about this happening imminently we haven't got precise timings we haven't got details yet of the quantities of Aid that will be involved or or what kind of details there might be uh when it comes to Israeli Security checks that will be demanded um but the US has said it welcomes the announcement uh by Israel but it will be watching really to assess uh what difference this makes your land in Jerusalem thank you
