we start this hour in the Middle East where America's top Diplomat Secretary of State Anthony blinkin continues diplomatic efforts in a bid to prevent a regional escalation of Israel's war in Gaza he'll hold talks with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia today on containing the international shipping threat in the Red Sea by the iranian-backed houthi rebels of neighboring Yemen before traveling to Tel Aviv ahead of his arrival in Israel intense Israeli air strikes have been continuing in the Gaza Strip as well as ground battles with Hamas Fighters Israeli forces say They carried out strikes on 30 targets overnight there's also deep concern over the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza where AID organizations say their doctors have been forced to pull out of one of the last functioning hospitals after the surrounding area was designated a combat zone by the Israeli military the World Health Organization says that if the alaxa hospital is stopped from operating it will be a moral and medical outrage W Davis sent this report from Jerusalem and and I should warn you it contains distressing images right from the start images coming from jabalia in Northern Gaza today are difficult to watch reporters quickly on the scene describe dozens of bodies lying in the rubble of a destroyed building many of them women and children unconfirmed Reports say at least 70 people were killed here in what was reported to be an Israeli air strike the Israeli military has not yet responded to a BBC request for more information across Gaza say Aid agencies the civilian toll is unbearable this the aftermath of another attack in Han unun Health officials say that even medical facilities including hospitals are unsafe as Israel's Relentless campaign continues against Hamas military targets the stock inside of this Hospital are heroes who are doing everything they can without sleep without food food without knowing if their own families are safe in order to save the lives of others so this hospital and the staff in this Hospital have to be protected with an increasing sense of urgency The American Secretary of State is on a Whistle Stop tour of middle Easter capitals with real concern about the humanitarian situation and the possibility of a region-wide conflict Anthony blinkin is being urged to use America's influence over Israel to demand an immediate ceasefire but even if Washington presses that point Israel's leader isn't yet listening we are not stopping until Victory the war must not be stopped until we achieve all of its goals the elimination of Hamas the return of all of our hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel I say this to both our enemies and our friends while aladu wishes fighting would end he's already lost family and several colleagues today the alaz correspondent buried his son Hamza also a reporter killed in an air strike after Israel says they were targeting a suspect and were aware of others in his car the latest of at least 75 local journalists to have been killed in Gaza paying the highest price to report this war to the world W Davis BBC News Jerusalem let's go live to Jerusalem now and speak to our Middle East correspondent Yulan Nell and Yulan can you just give us the context to what we are hearing um about what Anthony blinkin is going to be saying about about saying that Palestinians shouldn't be pressured into leaving Gaza just explain why why this has come about because there an Israeli ministers talking about this weren't there that's right there have been some Israeli ministers within the coalition government uh they're on the far right in particular that have been calling for forced displacement of Palestinians in effect uh from the Gaza Strip uh Washington has already issued sharp rebukes about that um and said that Palestinians must be allowed to return to their homes um in the north of the Gaza Strip first of all as soon as conditions allow so that will be uh part of Anthony blinken's message as he comes here otherwise we can expect him to continue this conversation about trying to stop the regional spillover of this war um he's also said that it's imperative that Israel takes more action uh puts a premium on protecting civilians in the Gaza Strip and also does more to help in terms of getting Aid not just into Gaza but allowing that Aid to be distributed where it's really needed and as we were seeing in we's report there um Benjamin Netanyahu remaining uh defiant in terms of any calls for a possible ceasefire um are are there talks still ongoing right now in terms of a possible pause in the fighting because there was a lot of talk about that a few days ago but that seems to have gone quiet well of course the ceries have been important mediators and this is something that was addressed when Mr blinken was meeting uh cat officials in the past day um and they have uh given assurances that there are still continued efforts uh to reach a new ceasefire deal with Hamas to bring home uh the remaining 100 plus Israeli hostages still held by Hamas and other armed groups in the Gaza Strip and we also saw unusually uh some of the hostage families heading to katar themselves to meet katerie officials uh trying to keep the issue uh of their loved ones on this diplomatic agenda uh Mr blinkin himself has put it high up on his agenda this issue of bringing back uh the Israeli hostages when he was laying out what he hoped to achieve in the Middle East okay thank you very much Yan now for us there live in Jerusalem
