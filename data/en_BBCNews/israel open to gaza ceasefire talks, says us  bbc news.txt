the Israeli Army has retrieved the bodies of six hostages from can yunas in southern Gaza these are the pictures of the men who had been captured in southern Israel during the Hamas attacks on October the 7th five of their deaths had already been announced but one was previously thought to have still been alive meanwhile US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has been in Egypt where he is pushing for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza he's met the Egyptian president Abdul fat Ali in Cairo Anthony blinkin has said it was up to amas to agree to a bridging proposal for a ceasefire deal in Gaza after he met Israeli officials in Tel Aviv Hamas has issued a statement saying claims by the us including President Biden that it was backing away from a ceasefire deal amus leading Hamas says it's Keen to reach a cessation of aggression and remarks by the US Administration give Israel the green light to continue the war Hamas also accused the US of bias towards Israel let's show you the latest pictures we have from Gaza where Hamas officials say at least 10 people have been killed in an Israeli military attack on a school that was housing displaced people the IDF claimed that the strike targeted Hamas fighters who used a hidden Command Center in the school the UN says almost 500 school buildings have been directly hit or damaged during the current conflict well let's hear now from sahiro Shaham he's been speaking about his uncle Abraham Munda he was taken hostage by Hamas fighters on October the 7th my uncle was was kidnapped from his house from his home in kibuts N Ro on that Saturday by Kamas terrorist this happened October 7th on October 8th he was abandoned by his government and on October 9th he was abandoned by the government and on October 10th and this continuously goes on went on until the day that he died he saw television and got and heard some radio broadcast I'm sure sure that he heard what is going on in Israel it must have broke his heart to see that you know people from his own government are objecting to sign a deal that will get him back home so yeah Hamas took him but the continuous abandonment is on the hands of the Israeli government they had plenty of opportunities to get him out together with all the other hostages together with in in so many cases we have counted 18 cases of the government of Israel torpedoing the initiative to get the hostages back 18 in the last 10 months well on those talks Anthony blinkin as I mentioned is in Egypt traveling with him is our state department correspondent Tom bitman well the intention of secretary blinkin is to try to drive this deal through you know we've had a fair amount of expectation mixed with optimism from the Americans about their hopes for trying to push some form of breakthrough they have thought within even the next week or so I have to say the mood on the ground as we've moved from Israel here to Egypt simply hasn't matched that expectation what we heard from secretary blinkin on Monday night was him saying that prime minister Netanyahu had accepted the American bridging proposal the language from the Israelis themselves has been a a bit less emphatic than that although the Israeli Prime Minister saying that he was committed to this um proposal but some suggestions within the Israeli press that this has been perhaps more mediation uh or negotiation between the Americans and the Israelis to get to a position than it has been between the Israelis and Hamas so far the purpose here in Egypt critically is to discuss perhaps the main sticking point and that is prime minister netanyahu's insistence as he's put it that there remain Israeli troops in the so-called Philadelphia Corridor that part of the Gaza Strip in the South that borders Egypt here um he believes That's essential to Israel's security so they can't be weapon smuggling for Hamas to rearm itself as for Hamas they say that's simply amount to continued Israeli occupation and therefore it is not an end to the war the Egyptians are critical on this because of course they share that border with Gaza that will be a key component of the discussions um between Mr blinkin and president president CeCe here and then we move to katar where um there will be further discussions with um key officials in Doha they of course like the Egyptians crucial to the negotiations and speaking directly to Hamas Tom bitman there as he was saying katar absolutely critical when it comes to these talks so let's get the perspective now of naah fani who is former director of Qatari defense intelligence joining us from Doha always good to have you with us who at this point is holding up the ceasefire thank you Lucy for having me well currently I think what's uh holding up the ceasefire is that the negotiation isn't over uh we've seen reports uh that uh Israel agreed on bridging proposals and then as you reported uh earlier the Israeli media kind of Pok some holes into that obviously the attacks today on the the evacuation Center as I see the numb in front of me growing to 12 killed doesn't help that that news happened and that thing happens in the same day um as well as Hamas Hamas has to understand that it won't get everything it needs and I think qatar's job with the United States and Egypt is to focus both parties on three main points number one the end of hostilities and and a ceasefire number two release of all hostages uh per a plan that agreed by by both parties and number three humanitarian Aid making the perfect the enemy of the Good Will neither help the Israelis or the hostages or the Palestinians and the civilians in Gaza but on that first point how will it ever be overcome when Israel wants to have a deal that will allow it to continue the war whereas it seems that Hamas wants a ceas file deal that ends it well that's the point if Israel wants a deal without a deal that that is by definition a non-deal um a lot of Palestinians are suffering the families of the hostages Israeli hostages are suffering I think the Israelis and the Palestinians represented here by Hamas and Gaza have to reach the uh understanding that they won't get everything they want uh they won't get a perfect solution but a a bridging solution that could lead to a further uh peace negotiation should be the goal we're past we're way past a perfect solution that was months in the past now the the whole region is trying to avert a regional conflict and and stop more death and Destruction for Gaza and hopefully return the hostages we have seen this optimism though expressed by Anthony blinkin and the US team it is not been echoed by any of the other parties how would you say you feel at this moment are you optimistic that any kind of deal can be reached I think by Nature that we've hadn't have this uh of an advance as per the reports that we're getting in months in just by that fact I am a bit optimistic but very cautiously optimistic because an optimism in today's atmosphere and and and today's um reality is different than optimism a year ago uh today we have to be optimistic while enduring a continuous death in Gaza today 35 uh killed in Gaza and and the number unfortunately is going uh possible Widing conflict so that type of optimism is I think what the negotiators the mediators have and what I have and I think in the next couple of days we will we will see if that optimism was well placed or unfortunately another opportunity has St between our fingers noan it's always good to have your thoughts and have you with us thank you for joining us from Doha thank you
