if you're just joining us welcome here to BBC News we're staying with that breaking news things very fluid the situation changing all of the time but Israel the media says 13 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza have been handed over to the Red Cross these some of the recent pictures they are thought now to be in Egypt under that deal broken by katar most of them we know are children now from the Rafa border crossing with Egypt ultimately they'll be taken to a military Air Base in southern Israel then onto an Israeli hospital and ultimately reunited with their families now as that is happening Thailand's prime minister confirmed a little earlier that 12 Thai hostages have also been released today all of the men as part of a separate deal with Hamas now under the main deal 39 Palestinian prisoners were also due to be released from Israeli jails later in the day now the Red Cross says it is for facilitating the release and transfer of both the hostages and prisoners and of course there is now a 4-day pause in the fighting it's 11 hours old but it is holding and as a result convoys of Aid trucks have already headed into Gaza those are the key planks as we look again at those pictures of those Red Cross Vehicles just going through the crossing point that happened about 20 minutes ago let's go back to Anna Foster she's there in Tel Aviv and and it's worth uh for anyone just joining us uh you explaining where you are because so many people gathered there just like they have been for weeks uh just waiting for this moment which will be such an important moment for Israel after 7 weeks that's right Matthew this this place this Square outside the uh Tel Aviv Museum of Art is is known as hostages Square now and this is a place where many of the the hostages families have come on on regular occasions they'd come here for vigils they've come here sometimes for for protests just a couple of days ago I was talking to the the mother of one of the hostages and and they had come here to to hold a piano concert in his honor he was a keen piano player so this is really the Hub the focal point uh for many of the hostages families for many people across Israel and that is why you've seen the crowds building here uh you see the posters the faces you know the names of these hostages that are on on everything from from stickers to posters just big you know lit up Billboards around Tel Aviv and around the country and people are gathering here now waiting for confirmation that those hostages have been released now as we were saying an Israeli Security Source has said that those hostages are now in the hands of Israeli Security Services but it appears not yet actually physically inside Israel because as we were saying they pass out of Gaza into Egypt first of all and then Israeli uh Security Services will bring them eventually back into Israel once again uh we also um have a quote now one of the main Israeli news channels Channel 13 is saying that the uh the head of maggan David Odon which is the Israeli Ambulance Service says that 13 Israeli hostages are in good condition and speaking because I think that was a key part of this deal as well and and in fact when we heard the qataris announce it yesterday we brought you that press conference here on BBC News one of the questions that was asked as as part of that press conference is are of those hostages that are being released those 13 are they alive are they well because of course these are are vital questions that you know people don't necessarily know the answer to um but the Israeli Ambulance Service MDA says that the 13 Israeli hostages who are being released today on on day one of this 4-day deal are in good condition and are speaking and I think the choreography of what we see today is is is important as well because this will hopefully you know people here are hoping that they will see this repeated over the next 4 days this is sort of the third part of what will happen today started with the ceasefire we saw additional trucks of humanitarian Aid pass into Gaza The Next Step will be the confirmation of the release of those hostages you know we've seen and we see those pictures again of those Red Cross Jeeps coming out of Gaza through the Rafa Crossing into Egypt you know all very positive signs all small steps along the way the next step I think will be the official confirmation from Israel uh that those hostages have been returned home that they are back on Israeli soil and then that will trigger if you like the fourth part of this deal which is the release of Palestinian uh prisoners who are being held in Israeli jails we've been watching as well those live pictures of OFA prison in the West Bank it's an Israeli detention center and over the next 4 days 150 Palestinian prisoners women and teenage boys in the main are expected to be released from there as part of this this deal a 2-hour window was the suggestion uh certainly in that press conference by the kataris yesterday that after Israel confirmed safe receipts of the hostages within two hours they would then release the Palestinian prisoners um the agreed Palestinian prisoners that are being held in OFA prison if that all goes to plan Matthew then it should repeat for the next 3 days and I think there are hopes on all sides that that that could potentially continue Israel has said that for every 10 additional Israeli hostages over and above the 50 that have been agreed they are prepared to continue to extend that ceasefire by 24 hours katav said that they hope that that this could be a more permanent truce I think depending on who you speak to that might be a that that might be a you know a big ambition to have at the moment but certainly this deal which has taken so long to agree on so long to negotiate it's further down the line than it's been so far and and it it seems we are close the international committee for the Red Cross um has told the BBC that eight of their staff traveling in four icrc vehicles have transported hostages across the border into Egypt as we've been seeing there was a doctor as part of the icrc team the hostages were handed over by them to the Egyptian authorities at the Rafa border crossing um it seems according to uh sources told the BBC see that Egypt have now handed them on to Israeli security sources um and the next stage will be the return of those hostages actually back to Israel to Israeli hospitals that are prepared and ready to receive them and where the families of those 13 are also waiting to be reunited with them
