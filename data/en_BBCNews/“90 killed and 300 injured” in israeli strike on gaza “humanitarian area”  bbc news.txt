at least 90 Palestinians have been killed in an Israeli air strike near KH unun in Gaza that's according to a mass run Health Ministry there which also says around 300 people have been injured the attack was inside a designated safe Zone al- maasi where the Israeli military had urged displaced Palestinians to seek shelter well Israel says it was targeting herass military commanders but it says it cannot confirm whether or not they were killed fergal Kean reports now from Jerusalem and just a warning his report does contain some disturbing details from the start the Israelis told them they would be safe here today they bummed alasi killing scores wounding hundreds saying they targeted senior Hamas leaders hiding among civilians we were sitting in the tent nothing was happening suddenly a rocket fell children were in pieces look at us world have some feelings the streets around the blast sits littered with casualties our cameraman arrived at the aftermath to find a refuge devastated at alnasser hospital the dead were taken out as the wounded kept arriving the bombs blasted through concrete and flimsy shelters and into the bodies of human [Music] beings what do they look like asks Muhammad sakur in pieces and cut up you find heads and hands here and there you find feet it was an ugly image this is the man Israel says was its main target Hamas military Chief Muhammad di accused of masterminding the October 7eventh attacks which killed nearly 1200 Israelis and saw hundreds more taken hostage his fate and that of his Deputy is unclear tonight Israel's leader said he'd approve the attack in advance salami there is still no absolute certainty that the two were eliminated but I assure you that we will get to all of the Hamas leadership one way or another Osama ahmad's father was one of those killed today a rescue worker I only saw you this morning he says but gone all such mornings and what faith here now in Israel's promise of a safe Zone fergal Keen BBC News Jerusalem well we can go live now to our Middle East correspondent Lucy Williamson who's in Jerusalem for us tonight so Lucy reports of 90 dead and we heard there the Israeli Prime Minister saying they're not sure actually they even got their target so does all this mean fresh scrutiny for Israel yes I think the size of this strike and the number of casualties including reportedly many children are likely to raise fresh International questions over where and how Israel targets Hamas leaders Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu a short while ago gave a press conference and he said he'd authorized the attack after asking military Chiefs three questions he wanted to know if there were any Israeli hostages in the area what kind of weapons would be used and also what he called what the collateral damage would be there was no reference in that press conference to the 90 people reported dead and none of the local Israeli media raised it either but it is likely to be raised as a question outside Israel a question about the civilian toll exacted in a strike against two military targets
