said Israel was not doing enough to protect civilians three British men John Chapman James Henderson and James Kirby were among those killed when a convoy carrying staff from World Central Kitchen was hit on Monday the charity released pictures of the aid workers overnight Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike was unintended and vowed to investigate our reporter graem Satchel has more the pictures tell their own devastating Story the team from the charity World Central Kitchen was traveling in a convoy of three cars you can clearly see their logo each car was hit in what looks like a Precision targeted attack the charity has now paid tribute to the seven workers who lost their lives including three British Nationals 57-year-old John Chapman who is believed to have served in the Royal Marines was working for the charity as a security advisor James Henderson who was 33 is also understood to have served in the Marines James Kirby was 47 and another armed forces veteran all three men were trying to protect their colleagues the charity described them as Heroes these seven beautiful souls were killed by the Israel Defense Forces their smiles laughter and voices are forever embedded in in our memories we are reeling from our loss the world's loss World Central Kitchen was providing vital food Aid in Gaza supplying millions of meals the consequences of the attack will be felt here first the charity has paused its operations putting immediate stress on an already desperate situation that's going to put civilians at risk at greater risk of famine people are already starving to death um and what we really need now is for a to get in quickly and to be able to be distributed safely the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attack was tragic and then said this happens in war overnight the head of the Israeli Army was far more conciliatory we are sorry for the unintentional harm to the members of wck we share in the grief of their families as well as the entire world Central Kitchen organization from the bottom of our hearts despite that apology there has been Global condemnation America described the attack as an outrage Britain said the deaths were completely unacceptable Australia has demanded accountability in Jerusalem more protests on the street as Israelis demand the safe return of their hostages pressure is growing at home and abroad but so far the Israeli government has been impervious to calls for a ceasefire and is determined to continue its fight against Hamas graah Satchel BBC News well Tess angram is a UNICEF spokeswoman and is temporally based in Gaza it's appalling that these Brave colleagues while just trying to H people in Gaza have been killed so it certainly have had an impact here on all of us in the Gaza Strip who are still reeling from the news of of losing these colleagues in terms of operations world kitchen plays such a pivotal role in providing food to the people of Gaza they' already provided millions of meals over the last few months so them taking this very understandable pause will certainly have an impact on the people of Gaza who are already on the brink of famine and just we cannot afford to not continue to to push forward and provide them with the food that they so desperately need well let's speak to our Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem your land Nel y land it's good to have you what more do we know around the circumstances of the strike at this point I mean the Israeli military says it's still investigating but we've had the chief of staff coming out saying that this uh was a mistake that followed a misidentification at night um he said during a war in very complex conditions uh the Israeli Prime Minister previously said this does happen in war time um but you have at the same time some Israeli media reports looking more deeply into what went wrong here and one in haret this morning is quoting um unnamed Army sources as basically saying that this is also a result of poor discipline as a result of soldiers and officers who are not um following rules and orders properly in the field and your land what has been the reaction so far from allies especially ones who've had Nationals killed in the strike I mean there's been a huge International criticism of both how Israel is um conducting this war but also uh really this has put a spotlight on the situation for Aid workers and the very very difficult conditions and dangerous conditions that they have been working under and I think there is now going to be um a kind of real effort to try to get Israel to put new mechanisms in place uh that will make it safer for Aid workers um to get back to work properly uh in Gaza and to be able to do what they have to do uh to to distribute much needed Aid across the Gaza Strip all right yolan thanks so much for that update and if you want to learn more about the aid workers who were killed in that strike there is more on our website and our
