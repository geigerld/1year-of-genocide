what would it take for Hamas to sign on to a ceasefire now we want a ceas fire as soon as possible and that's parallel with the lifting of The Siege on Gaza this is the demand of the gazan people I call on the United Nation Britain and the Americans to go to Gaza and ask them what they want and I am prepared to accept 100% the answer of the people in Gaza what the Americans seem to be working on is a two-stage deal where there will be a truce where the guns the Rockets will stop firing and then there will be a serious negotiation about how to boost the gazen economy how to ease the blockade on Gaza and to give the people of Gaza a better life are you prepared to accept a two-stage solution to this irrespective of the mechanism what is important to me is that we should be a genuine guarantee to lift The Siege on Gaza we had promises in the past but nothing was done Gaza is a part of the Palestinian land we have 1.8 million people living there they need to live without the blockade we need an airport a port we want to open up to the world we don't want to be controlled by border crossing that makes Gaza the biggest prison in the world people cannot go for medical treatment or to work why are the people of Gaza being punished with a slow death in the world's biggest prison this is a crime we want the end of the aggression the Hal of the aggression and the end of the sieg and we will accept clear and clar clauses about the ceasefire we are eager that the Bloodshed should stop in Gaza you talk of resistance How can any idea of resistance justify putting rockets in a school building how the how the This Is A Lie Frankly Speaking let Israel show the rocket launching PS Ina with respect this is not something that has come from Israel this is the UN relief and works agency which has said that up to 20 Rockets were deposited in a school building inside Gaza they are Furious the uh Secretary General of the United Nations has expressed his outrage he said those responsible of turning schools into potential military targets and endangering the lives of innocent children this is not true rocket launchers in Gaza belong to the resistance they are underground and Israel is unable to reach them this is why it pretends they are in civilian areas Israel is hitting hospitals mosques towers and buildings it committed a massacre in shua Taha district there is a new massacre in K east of UN that the world has witnessed this morning this is a Butchery in Gaza and the world is sitting Idol and it blames Hamas
