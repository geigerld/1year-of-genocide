Mark Leon Goldberg is host and founder of the global dispatches podcast and editor-in-chief of un dispatch a Blog about the UN and Global Affairs he joins us live from Denver now welcome to the program so break it down a little bit for us if you will what was the main practical purpose of this meeting in your view well the international court of justice its rulings are intended to be binding but it doesn't really have any way of enforcing its ruling so countries can simply opt to ignore without much Consequence the idea behind this meeting that was called by Algeria was to provide some you know political momentum to in a way compel Israel to abide by this ruling but as the previous segment indicated the ruling was interpreted in different ways by different member States including the United States who explicitly noted that the ruling did not call for a ceasefire so it really didn't change much of the Diplomatic Dynamics that we've been seeing at the security Council for the last several months now so whatever the result then could Israel simply ignore any ruling or resolution it seems to be doing precisely that um now it's a provisional ruling the final outcome of the question whether or not Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians as put forward by the application by South Africa that's going to take years and years and years to adjudicate so the idea is to try to get Israel to abide by these provisional me measures to do really three things one take steps to prevent genocide two stop the incitement of genocide and three allow more humanitarian Aid into uh Gaza as well to improve the humanitarian situation people might be asking why does it take so long why does the icj appear to move so slowly what are the factors involved well listen the wheels of Justice at the icj do move very slowly the most recent genocide case at the icj was in 2019 when The Gambia small West African country accused Myanmar of genocide against the rinia that was 2019 it took the icj four years to decide whether or not it even had jurisdiction to decide the question and the case is still ongoing genocide also is a very complicated and complex question of international law there's a lot of legal intricacies going into deciding whether or not genocide is indeed occurring so those two factors just the structural way in which the icj operates plus the tricky legal questions around genocide in particular all combined to make this a really lengthy and drawn out process that will take many years and let me ask you what do you make of the situation with uh unra then because it's in a difficult position but it its work is so vital and you saw members of the US State Department just this week reiterate how vital the work of unro is how it's irreparable in and irreplaceable among uh humanitarian agencies in unrea just at the moment that they were cutting funding to unrea now it is the main player to the extent that limited Aid is able to get into Israel uh into Gaza via those two crossings that are opening it is distributed by Ena within Gaza and it the humanitarian situation that is already perilous now will comp will collapse nearly entirely by May says unoa if funding is not restored it's a really really heavy heavy blow we have to leave it there mark Leon Goldberg we appreciate your time thank you thanks
