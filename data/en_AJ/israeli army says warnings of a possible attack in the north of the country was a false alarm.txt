now the Israeli Army is trying to calm fears after a false alarm sent people Nationwide scrambling for shelter warning sirens rang out across Northern Israel and flares were fired at the border as people across the country were told to seek shelter over a possible aerial infiltration from Lebanon the Army now says the Panic was caused by human error alaz need is in West Jerusalem H we started talking about this with you maybe some some 90 minutes ago do you want to recap everything that happened in the last hour and a half yeah certainly we what what we first got is actually this red alert app that most people here in Israel have on their phones that was pinging constantly about uh possible hostile aerial intrusion in different areas along uh the northern border of Israel with Lebanon and then we started hearing uh different statements coming out from different bodies uh the most important one was coming out from the head of the Regional Council in Northern Israel and he was talking about 15 to 20 paragliders who would have flown across that border and landed in Northern Israel uh and he was saying that those there were uh Fighters or people on those paragliders uh the Army though wasn't saying much except uh calling on people living in those areas to go to the shelters to lock themselves in and to make sure that they have enough supplies to stay for a long time inside those shelters and as you said SEL this really caused a wave of panic in all that North area of the country among two million people who live in those areas who scramble to go to those shelters but the Army was saying that it was there could possibly be an infiltration while the head of the Regional Council was continuing to say that um it there W there actually was an infiltration eventually the Army came out with a statement saying that the soldiers had been combing that area that they haven't found anything that they haven't been any Rockets launch there haven't been any infiltration or anything else so we actually reached out to the spokesperson of the Regional Council there and all we got as an answer was a text message saying you heard what the spokesman uh spokesperson of the army said I have nothing to add and and this really comes to the heart or just a demonstration about the level of anxiety the level of fear that has reach really gripped this country uh since this war started a few days agoa can I get you back uh on our earlier track to our earlier conversation which was about the politics in this because there was a significant development today we know how politically this is all going to be structured around Benjamin Netanyahu the Prime Minister now um You Were explaining to us that they now have a this sort of two-tier political system with a a political Unity governments and a war time cabinet yes and actually what we were talking about just now all this state of alert H happened shortly after there was this announcement that finally Benny Gans who's the head of the national Unity party and opposition party had reached an agreement with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu about forming this emergency Unity uh government and it's as you said it's in two forums two committees you have the war cabinet where you would have the defense minister yav Galant prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gans the head of the national Unity party who is also a former Chief of Staff a former Minister of Defense you have other two people who are also on that uh on that uh cabinet who are uh Danny eisenkot who is a former Chief of Staff as well and Ro Ron dmer who is a former uh Israeli ambassador to Washington they are there as observers now that cabinet is in charge of taking decisions on how to proceed with this war whether it is in Gaza or whether things would could expand on the northern border then you have the larger uh government and that is called the political security government that includes the members of the ruling ruling Coalition and with them Benny Gans and other members of his National Unity party now their role is to uh from what we understand is yes to continue to be part of this uh emergency government to deal with all other aspects of what is that what is happening during this current War now this emergency Unity government is not allowed to legislate or to take any decision that is not pertaining to the war and to this uh crisis nesset what part of the deal is that knesses is not allowed to pass any legislation that has uh that is unrelated to this war until this war ended but we spoke to some Israelis and many of them said that they were actually uh satisfied that they had reached an agreement because at this particular moment the is they the the leaders of this country the political leaders of this country should put all the divisions aside and they're deeply divid and those divisions were all the way up to the first day of this war all the way up to when Hamas crossed that border fence between Gaza and Southern Israel and then carried out those attacks well people here want those aside want to see these two main political leaders of this country standing together and trying to bring this country steer this country towards the end of the war to bring back security to this country that's H abdulhamid reporting from West Jerusalem thank you very much
