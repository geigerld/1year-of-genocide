Michael link is Professor of Meritus at Western University in London onario he's joining us live from there thank you very much indeed for being with us um if I understand it correctly this is the first time that Israel has been in front of the icj or in fact any other court International Court as a perpetrator rather than as a victim how do you assess the significance of what we're seeing over the next couple of days well the Israel obviously has understood that um this isn't simply a legal case case but it's a political case playing out on the theater of public opinion around the world um and uh it it thinks I think that it has some case to be able to make in arrain back to South Africa um it's going to argue I suspect tomorrow this is an educated guess that it will probably use footage uh from what happened on October 7th and it also will argue self-defense um those those would be probably the best two arguments I can think of that Israel will want to wind up raising but it recognizes the huge reputational consequences of uh any finding uh by the court and in provisional measures with respect to a plausible case of genocide being found against it so this is why uh it has contrary to its uh previous pattern shown up to want to be able to to argue this um uh at the uh at the court and I as I said I suspect we'll see uh plenty of arguments around those two particular issues that's something atrocious happened on a October 7th and Israel had the right and the necessity to defend its people by going after Hamas and Gaza I I want to kind of expand on that a little bit just for viewers who are who are joining us and maybe just uh trying to catch up with what's been going on in the he if I understand it from what you're saying Israel's claim will be based on its justification for the action that it took based on the the hamus Le attack into Southern Israel that happened in October the the the seventh against the South African case which is actually based on the nature and the scale of Israel's response is is that fair oh look you know um when you're in a weak uh position uh as a lawyer representing a client you want to try to argue your your very your very best facts uh and focus and try to get the court to focus on those and draw them away from the arguments the facts and the law that the other side has done I must say having watched uh the South African presentation of the day uh this really was a top drawer uh uh case example of advocacy all of the lawyers L to an extremely persuasive uh and strongly made case and that reflects you know the uh the top drawer um uh application that South Africa made uh two weeks ago to the court 84 pages single spaced over 560 footnotes um arguing the facts and the law and the need for a provisional measures and that was all echoed today uh by the lawyers in very calm measured fashion uh as they uh as they presented before the court as to why uh the atrocities they said uh that are being laid out on the television screens and the computer screens around the world needed to be stopped that was a an exceptionally persuasive case put to the court and if I was Israel then I'm going to focus on what I think are are my strong points which is October 7th and the right of self-defense prime minister Benjamin Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has already come rejecting the uh the hearings themselves um there has been a suggestion that they are baseless I believe is the word the word that um the US has used in relation to them if the court given the fact that this is not binding if the court finds in favor of South Africa but Israel chooses to essentially ignore that ruling what do you think that tells us about the state of international just Justice what kind of perception would people have of it at that point interesting you say that because among the very last points made by the south the lawyers representing South Africa today was that the that the very reputation of international law itself hangs in the balance with the decision to be made by the icj on the South African request and they laid out both in the written application and in some of the arguments made the number of times that Israel has defied resolutions coming from the security Council from the general assembly L uh and also Israel's Defiance of the ruling made almost 20 years ago uh at the by the international court of justice with respect to the location of Israel's wall that it's Building inside the occupied West Bank so all of those were were repeated reminders made by the South African lawyers with respect to the reputation of international law and I thought that was a an exceptionally uh incisive point that I'm sure many of the judges will be considering uh with respect to this you know the court is a is a legal Court the judges are well trained in in the law in international law in particular but they're they're mindful of the Court's reputation and they're mindful of obviously that Israel and the United States has taken strong exception to the icj hearing this case but it's also mindful the fact that South Africa has an outsized reputation in the world that it's bringing this as a if you like a disinterested party to the uh to the conflict in the in the Middle East um and it's making this compelling case about the centrality of international law if you're going to make any argument that's going to be listened to very closely by a judge on an international court it's about the way in which international law has to be protected and has to be enhanced in this world Michael
