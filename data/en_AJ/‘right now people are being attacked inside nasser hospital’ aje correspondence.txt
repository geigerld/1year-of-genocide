we start in southern Gaza where the Israeli military has besieged the largest medical facility in Khan Yunis these are scenes from NASA hospital overnight just moments after it was shelled Israeli forces stormed the complex detaining doctors and patients in central Gaza an Israeli air strike flattened the residential building in the noat refugee camp killing at least 14 people children are among the dead at least 28,5 76 Palestinians have been killed since October the 7th Hal Mahmud joins us now live from Rafa in southern Gaza let's start with the latest on a NASA hospital we understand in addition to the shelling it's been stormed what's happened to the patients the staff and the people taking Refuge there yes Sammy and just within the past 45 minutes right just right after I finished my earlier report uh a car uh drove all the way from the main road leading to Han un all the way to here to Kuwaiti Hospital carrying a doctor and two other people who were on their way outside of the hospital a Qui capture around the vicinity of Naser Hospital uh they were ordered by the isra military to evacuate they got through the checkpoints but then just minutes away from the checkpoints qu copters attack a drone fired at them uh injuring a doctor who was evacuating and two other uh people uh an all transferred here to Kuwaiti Hospital next to where I'm reporting uh from this is what's going on with evacuees inside the hospital they're asked to evacuate ordered Shar sharply by the military they go through a checkpoint and then within just minutes from there uh evacuating the hospital they are being uh they are shot at and fired at by either either attack drones or heavy Fire by Machine uh by machine guns but what's going on in right now at the courtyard of the hospital Israeli military bulldozed the Southern Fence of the hospital and stormed the courtyard from the southern part of the health facilities all the way to the main uh building the emergency uh building and uh rounded up doctors and nurses inside the hallway of the hospital now right now they're asking doctors to take all the injuries and the patients and put them in the old building uh of the of the health facility right this is on the northern part of the courtyard of the of the hospital this old building represents the building block and the foundation block of the hospital when it was established uh few years ago uh there are in there is increasingly uh devastating news inside the hospital as more of these injuries they need they need help help to move from one Department to another let alone walking a quite short long distance to get to the old building some of them are on on on oxygen tanks that they need to be carried with them Israeli military is preventing doctors preventing any of the nurse to help any of these injuries or the patient who suffer from a chronic disease from Health complications to lend him a hand to help them move from this from the emergency building all the way to the uh the Foundation Building there's also at earlier hours the let me just jump in there if I may just just to clarify make sure we're understanding what you're saying correctly then so a lot of the patients and staff and I I I assume you mean also those who were just taking Refuge from the displaced people they've been told by the Israeli occupation authorities to move towards the northern part of the courtyard so assumably there's still a lot of civilians inside the NASA hospital and the other thing you've mentioned is some of the people who were trying to evacuate were attacked by Israeli military drones after they crossed a checkpoint is that is that the picture that's emerging yes that's exactly what happened and three of those who were who just evacuated from the hospital got through the checkpoint to the Kuwaiti hospital and not right now are being treated inside the Kuwaiti hospital it it's quite long distance they drove all the way while bleeding as they were attacked by the quad captur those are attack drones fired at them they were injured carried by people in a car and brought all the way from Kan unun uh to the Kuwait Hospital uh right here next to where I'm reporting uh from what we're getting right now is the situation are getting worse by uh by the hour not only we have people who are inside the hospital being attacked by the is really invading forces inside the courtyard of the hospital but also people who are sustaining double injuries right now we're talking about the orthopedic department where people who suffered the critical injuries at the beginning of the war and since the beginning of the ground Invasion and because of the constant Shilling of the department and the building where the department is they are injured while they are on their hospital bed this is double injuries and they are now because the hospital is out of service completely let alone there is no oxygen as the oxygen station destroyed completely just putting the the their life at risk as the storming continue and the bombing continue and the uh the rounding up and a mass arrest is taking place right now but hany what's happening in the rest of Gaza now because there's a lot of concern about the supply of medicine and basic things like food for people since it seems a supplies have been disrupted for a while now nothing much is getting in yes not enough is getting in that that is correct and we compare the the amount of Aid that has been so far allowed into particularly here in ra City compared to to the greater needs of people displaced families and evacuates it's just a trickle amount of food right now not only we're seeing a depletion of basic necessities and supplies and particularly since the announcement of a of a plan to expand the ground invasion in Rafa City not only a scarcity of supplies and necessity but also if they are available prices just uh scaled up to double and triple uh the uh the amount just making it very difficult for those who are suffering from financial problems and they are in unable uh to uh to pay for the the prices the double prices triple prices of these goods and supplies we're talking four months and more than four months now no no payrolls going on no paycheck private sector completely destroyed and and suffer from economic Suffocation the employees of the Palestine Authority have not received uh salary on a regular basis within the past 4 months just increasingly difficult living conditions uh for people right now who are unable uh to meet the the the greater needs that the that their children their families need right now as of the the war continues to make their life very difficult this is what what have what people have been frustrated about it's not only the bombing right now that is killing them but also the difficult living conditions the spread of diseases the malnutrition that risk the life of their children and the most vulnerable groups in this war particularly happen to be children all right hany Mahmud there thank you so much for that update
