there is not much left of Gaza salifa hospital with widespread destruction everywhere and now accusations of heinous war crimes are emerging among the hundreds of reported dead decomposing bodies have been found in the compound after Israel's 2E Siege Witnesses say civilians were targeted indiscriminately the most agonizing moment is when the Israeli soldiers shot dead civilian men before our own eyes some were shot dead others were buried alive in ditches most of the dead bodies were bulldozed and buried by the Israelis I saw many young men handcuffed and blindfolded thrown in a ditch and buried with sand we witnessed it all it happened before our own eyes in and around the medical facility the stench of death is heavy burned bodies covered in sand an apparent attempt Witnesses say to bury any evidence along with the dead I have personally witnessed victims handcuffed blindfolded and buried in the hospital yard in the emergency unit we found dozens of dead bodies all of them were handcuffed with their hands behind their backs these are utter war crimes they are unprecedented we have never seen anything like this in any other War makeshift Graves have become a common sight here Israeli forces reported open fire on patients and medical staff during The Siege the situation was Indescribable we found people against a wall covered in blood their bodies had been left for days all their bodies had signs of decomposition thank God we were able to bury them despite their state human rights groups are calling on the international criminal court to take action it's quite disgraceful that until this very moment the prosecutor of the international criminal court still drags his his feet and not issuing arrest warrants it's important to mention the reason that we have uh such disregard of international law and human uh life in the Gaza Strip is the impunity that Israel has enjoyed and its military has enjoyed for for decades Israel said its operations at alifa compound were carried out while preventing harm to civilians but Witnesses have described the opposite under snipers and Israeli tanks we evacuated we came back hoping to find my belongings I have nothing left my house was bombed and everything is gone not too long ago the alifa hospital compound was a refuge for displaced Palestinians now it's part of a wider investigation into Israeli war crimes in Gaza Kya lope oan Al jazer make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from from Al jazer
