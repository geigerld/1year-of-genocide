Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas says only the United States can stop Israel from launching a ground attack on Rafa now he was speaking at the world economic Forum in the Saudi Arabian Capital Riyad abas repeated his calls for an end to the war in Gaza and for Israel to allow in more Aid and he warned Israel would try to push Palestinians out of the occupied West Bank after its done with Gaza Israel has been threatening to launch a full ground assault on Rafa where than 1.5 million people are Sheltering what is happening in Gaza what will happen in the coming days and what Israel will do by invading the city of ruffa all the Palestinians from Gaza are gathered in the city of Rua and only a small blow remains to get them all out then it would be the biggest disaster in the history of the Palestinian people we appeal to the United States of America to ask Israel to stop the ruer operation because America is the only country capable of preventing Israel from committing this crime Zan mravi joins us now from rala in the occupied West Bank so a statement from the Palestinian president Zayn but really will it resonate or have any effect amongst the politicians where he is or even you might say some impact back home well it is certainly a significant statement it is the first time that Mahmud Abbas has said anything like this it is the first time a senior leader from the Palestinian Authority has said anything like this and not mined his words but it has to be said that he is simply echoing the things that Palestinians we've been speaking to have been saying for the last 6 months what Palestinians have been suffering in Gaza and across the West Bank for 6 months and the reaction on the Palestinian street is likely to mirror a broader political response the people we've been speaking to say that what they see is um a a a a speech words from their leader that is far too late and far too weak uh one person described it as the musings of an analyst not necessarily the speech of a leader of a people that are under attack and one person described it as Mahmud Abbas seems to have hit his expiration date and is no longer really fit for purpose so in terms of the mood here in rala across much of the West Bank people have a deep a a lack of faith in their political leaders at these incredibly trying times for Palestinians in Gaza and across the occupied territories for the update thanks very much Z BVI there for us in rala Let's cross over to abdalaziz alashan a researcher focusing on Saudi foreign policy at Lancaster University's sectarianism proxies and Des sectarianization project he's live with us from Riad good to have you with us on the program has president abas sort of missed an opportunity here to emphasize how important for Arab Nations you might say to include Palestinians or the Palestinian voice in a future economic decision sort of cementing a a commitment that Palestine will be a state and one to do business with a sort of a psychological message could have been sent out here well first it's good to join you thank you very much for having me I I I agree I think as as a researcher and analyst of Sav foreign policy towards Israel and the pal Palestinian Israeli conflict uh I've always been consumed in the past few few years really of how can we generate more uh Arab support for the Palestinian issue or how can at least for example Mahmud Abbas and and and a diplomatic discourse can attract um uh Arab support and I think personally while we all support Mahmud Abbas and his in in in trying to call for uh a cessation of hostilities and and warning of the looming attack on on ra I think it was a missed opportunity personally to to Really gain uh resonance with the people and just say basically listen you know here we are in in the world economic Forum uh the we are talking about Regional stability and then for example uh Minister for the F Finance Minister of Saudi Arabia was talking about Regional security and development uh and that we can't have Regional security without uh Regional development Etc that he could have said well it is the occupation without an occupation uh we we can't have Regional development that basically we would love to participate more and become more of um he could have also let me just jump in there he could have also stopped some of the hypotheticals that are being sort of muted around at the moment some Regional capitals already talking about the day after and we've heard this from many quarters Saudi Arabia has said uh certainly one of the last statements a couple of months was no normalization with Israel until a two-state solution is firmly in place is that a red line do you think that Saudi Arabia is not going to Cross or is it a position that could be a flexible one depending on the ground realities I'll be very honest I think as much as it's an ideal situation uh the the position was always a a holding position it was a starting point of negotiations uh and basically when it comes to the Saudi position regarding the Palestinians the essence is yes a Palestinian State uh but I think more essentially it is what the Palestinian Authority will accept uh and therefore when one has that position and and Saudi officials historically have been you know on the record for saying you know what is good for them is good for us as then good for them Palestinians is good for us and therefore what does this mean this means that there is a negotiative process taking place of course you know this cannot be separated from the American Saudi situation or negotiations taking place as well so there is a great deal of balancing and also there's a great deal of uh moving parts that we just you know it's it just makes it very difficult to see normalization there are there are those moving Parts because consensus is required here isn't it the world economic Forum because before the US Secretary of State arrives one would assume that you need United Arab voice especially at this moment in time at such a delicate time when Rafa is the focus because a divided voice only emboldens Israel and its supporters yes well this is exactly what I think they're trying to do that's why yesterday was an important signal I think by meeting uh having a a CO the Arab coordinative group the six member Arab coordinated uh coordination group on the Min ministerial coordination group met yesterday and I think it was a sign or or another attempt to kind of uh create another unified front at least publicly uh to illustrate the fact that this is where the era position is going to Mo going to be this is where the position of those who are going to play an active role in in the day after in Gaza uh are uh where they're at and basically the situation now is that the United States can't do it alone it needs Arab Partners Arab Partners also the Arab states know that they can't do it alone and this war has unfortunately more One Big Mess where there's to be an external uh intervention uh an external proactivity um therefore it's to coordinate this proactivity no one could do this alone without saying with that said the United States is the only actor that could provide political leverage on Israel and that's what the Saudis and the Arab states are doing they're saying basically listen but we we have we could do we could deliver on certain things we can't deliver on Israel this is what we're ready to do for the day after now you have to deliver on Israel and what they're going to do for the day after that was the coordinated un unified stats and we will see what happens as we unpick this throughout our news out for the moment Abdul aiz alashan thanks for joining us from riet my pleasure thank you for having me make sure
