the Israeli Army says it has intercepted a surfac to a missile fired from Lebanon it says it was aimed at one of its military drones near Upper Galilee an Israeli drone strike then targeted the launch site in Lebanon tensions have been rising at the border between the two countries for 3 weeks thousands of people have been forced to leave their homes by rocket fire and skirmishes between Israeli forces and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah now some fighting took place near our reporter Ali hasham and his team oh Ali Hashim joins us now live from Nur in southern Lebanon and first of all Ali I hope that you and your team are all okay can you just explain what happened a short time ago well rest assured we're all okay um actually few minutes ago maybe an hour ago there was an attack with guided missiles on an Israeli uh military post the post that's just behind me now I think the some plumes of smoke that are clear then there was a drone now we didn't know whose drone is this is it aah drone or it's an Israeli drone and then when when we were standing the Drone exploded so it seems that drone was intercepted now till the moment we don't have a clear statement regarding what happened but we saw it exploding and then hitting the uh piece of land behind us an open area uh we spoke to the Lebanese Army regarding what's happening they're right now investigating to find the what's remained from uh this uh small drone or big drone we we don't know even the the size but it was very close so this was the situation there was an attack by the hisbah fighters right now there's also shelling behind us and Israel is ret ating I'll leave the camera of our we can see smoke rising from one of the one of the hilltops there as well this is this is the hanita Israeli position there are several positions here on this hill it's a it's a Border Hill between Lebanon and Israel in Lebanon they call it the launa hills so there are several Israeli military posts from the uh Edge okay there's another shell now from the military post on the edge of the Hill which is the Israeli Naval Base then this post that maybe you can see uh clearly and it's the hanita uh military uh position also there there's the uh shamut military position these are more mainly aimed at intercepting and communicating of course there are defensive uh military positions On the Border hasb has been hitting these uh positions for some time now since 20 days and now we're hearing more attacks now whether this is in uh incoming or ongoing we don't know mhm uh but at least there there is clear Israeli shelling going on right now and is this worse you can see it is this worse than what you have seen in in the last few days is this escalating at all well this is this has been the situation for the past few days but in the past couple of days things were were a bit calm today it seems things are escalating once again and let me just mention that also today on the Eastern side there was um an interception of an uh surface to a missile that was directed by hisbah on an Israeli military drone now the interception was through the Israeli defense systems and the interception happened over Lebanon that was a very huge explosion we had over here it's actually very far from here but it was a huge expl explosion what we are seeing right now maybe could be a a new phase we've been seeing the the situation gradually uh escalating from um kind of a depth of 2 3 kilometers on both sides to the depth of five kilometers recently the Israelis hit a uh uh one of the targets that was around 7 kilometers away from the border so what we are seeing could be also a kind of a gradual escalation a continuation of this gradual escalation and uh also given the fact that both sides aren't yet using their top Tire weapons in the in the confrontation hasah is not using its Precision missiles the Israelis are still limiting their scope of uh retaliation so this is uh maybe a bit early uh stages of of the front here it's still the the front is still an operation area that's becoming a warfront but you know there's a fine line yet there's a fine line and now with the situation gradually escalating in Gaza I mean ground wise with Israel announcing ground operations so it would depend more on how the situation is in the field in Gaza to see how things will escalate over here because they are linking it to the to to each other hisbah is linking it and at the same time the Palestinian groups are mainly Hamas is urging for more help from the Lebanese front and obviously this region is no longer safe for civilians we know thousands have been displaced where exactly have they gone what are they doing now well over the past uh three weeks many people living on the borders for example we are in in a Border Town in nakura and uh on the just the The Village after here is Al and these all Villages ones on this line most of the people decided to leave now where are they living leaving to some of them have already houses and this is a minority while while the majority will need to go to schools provided by the government maybe to family members to to the relatives this is how things are but till the moment the the the way the Lebanese government is dealing with the uh displaced people isn't really um uh going uh in parallel with the level of uh uh situation the situation is is is bad it's dire for people of the Border towns and they want more to be in a better situation I mean living in schools now the the winter is on uh is coming and uh you have schools students leaving their schools and going to another city or another region or another area so all these issues need maybe uh coordination they need services and they need budget at the time when the Lebanese government is bankrupt and this is another issue that the Lebanese are taking into consideration the government is bankrupt the people are already uh living and and and and going through all these difficulties economic difficulties since more than three four years with the currency uh uh losing its its value it's it's very bad times for the Lebanese okay thank you so much for that Ali we really do appreciate it hope you and your team uh stay as safe as you possibly can there thank you so much
