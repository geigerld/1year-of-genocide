the White House is saying that the US has information that Hamas Islamic Jihad uses hospitals in Gaza to conceal their operations and and to hold hostages and and you know citing intelligence sources not really providing sources what do you make of the the timing of these comments in particular uh well suspicious uh to say the least but there's only one thing that comes to mind Darin and I think it comes to mind to almost every person watching us today who have been watching events uh the past 20 years weapons of mass destruction weapons of mass destruction they haven't found a single weapon of mass destruction in Iraq after they destroyed the entire country and this was based on solid intelligence that was presented at the United Nations by Secretary of State Powell Colin Powell sted his own credibility 20 years ago and told the world trust us there is there is Weapons of Mass destructions in Iraq Iraq was destroyed and there were no weapons of destructions here we are again the Americans are saying trust us I think the two words probably the most dangerous words for a middle easterner is the Americans words trust us no one trusts them now in as far as the int is concerned I think there's something very important that was ignored I think intentionally about 10 days ago Hamas um proposed for the United Nations to send independent observers to the hospitals and to find out for themselves to look under and over and inside and so on so forth and to report about those uh headquarters and ammunition centers and all of that under hospitals shifa hospital and what have you that call was ignored but I think there's still room for that call I think those so-called the infamous uh humanitarian pauses could allow for a delegation an international delegation to go in and check for themselves but no I think the United States and Israel the United States echoing Israel about uh about those uh intelligence and by the way I was just looking because now we're looking at that Israeli uh spokesperson under some building in Gaza it was almost hilarious to the point of uh a comical if it wasn't tragic that they were showing a list of uh a calendar and the spokesperson was was showing us how those are the names of the terrorists in his words but in fact if you looked carefully it was all in Arabic and it said as with the Godfather would say Monday Tuesday Thursday Wednesday that's what it was it was the days of the week right and they were saying these were the names of terrorists it's the thing is when the United States comes out with these comments at this particular time when uh as we've been seeing and Reporting on the horrific scenes that are coming out of hospitals is there a risk that this encourages Israel to ramp up its uh operations in and around the hospitals you know to be honest I'm not sure if there's any more ramping up to do right I mean look what happened just the last few weeks the United States has given its unconditional support and said that you know Hamas is Isis I think there's nothing more damning and encouraging for the kind of genocide that we see unraveling in Gaza than comparing Hamas to isil so I think the United States set the tone from the very beginning when comparing Hamas to isol and from then on the demonization of Hamas did not stop now I'm not sure what Hamas is doing in Gaza I don't know but I would like to see evidence the problem with the Israel and the United States they keep they continue to say trust us but so far they have provided not a shred of evidence for what they're saying
