thank you for joining us Israel's Army is continuing its offensive in Central and Southern Gaza despite claims its shifting to a lower intensity phase of the war Israeli air strikes have targeted residential neighborhoods in Rafa and can Unis in the South leaving Palestinians searching for survivors under the rubble more than 23,000 people have been killed since October the 7th now casualties are also mounting for the Israeli military as Hamas Fighters confront troops across moner strip the Israeli military says four more soldiers have been killed in the Battlefront while Hamas says nine were killed that brings the number of soldiers killed since the ground Invasion began 10 weeks ago to more than 180 let's get the latest from our correspondent in Gaza Han Mahmud who joins us live from Rafa in southern Gaza honey so Israeli claims that it's began a new less intense phase of its war on the ground but that's not what we're seeing what's the latest yes F everybody was expecting a deescalation in the uh the air strikes campaign and the artillery Shilling but on the contrary what we're seeing is a more of a surge on Relentless air strike in the central area and the on the southern part of the G STP we mainly talking about ra City where more than 1.5 million displaced Palestinians are now staying and Sheltering and building tents across ra City just running from the horror of the war going on in in the northern part and the central part of the Gaza Strip but we're seeing an increasingly uh a large scale of intensity and magnitude of the air strikes and within just the past uh 24hour large number of people have been killed either in their cars or their residential homes or they were simply passing by the targeted areas overnight Heavy Artillery Shing at the Eastern uh side of Rafa city that is been going on for the past three weeks and very consistent with the is really plan of creating a buffer zone that which requires the the raising of much of the uh area of Agriculture and farmland in the eastern part and uh the uh many residential uh Homes at the eastern part of Rafa City uh they're very consistent with The Narrative of EST lishing this buffer zone along the borders from Bon all the way to ra City close to the Gaza Egyptian bordered and over an early hours of this morning particularly at dawn time an air strike targeted a residential homes so far what we are uh confirmed about the reports we're getting only injuries from that residential homes no reports about people got killed in that residential uh homes which is really strange and unusual for massive air strike to only leave injuries inside residential home but most of the killing uh the mass killing is taking place right now in the central part the refugee camps and kanun City yeah so intense bombing of Central and Southern Gaza honey and I understand you were supposed to be reporting from a field Hospital in Rafa today but it's becoming more difficult for people to move around and even medical staff in some of the hospitals are having to pull out yes this is exactly what happened it's becoming increasingly difficult to move around the Rafa City uh simply because it's becoming increasingly risky and dangerous and just the fact within less than 24 hours uh yesterday uh two cars were hit one that was uh our colleague Hamza and his his other journalist colleagues journalists were in the car were targeted and another car was targeted just on the main road leading to the Kuwaiti hospital just 700 meters away from here there is a a growing concern that this is part of the uh the third phase of the war which is the target killing of of people as they are moving on the roads or uh in their in their residential home so there is a risk involved in in in part of what what's going on and what's been done in in terms of going into Field Works we're trying to minimize that and assess the security in terms of the situation in terms of safety uh for us to continue uh working and and deliver a a quality work in in in and doing our job but the thing is it's also overcrowded ra is becoming overcrowded Beyond imagination there are so many people are now sleeping in the street it's hard for people to walk hard for people to drive their cars as well while roads are packed with people yeah very difficult to work in these conditions and and we appreciate your reporting honey thank you very much honey Mahmud live for us there in Rafa in southern Gaza
