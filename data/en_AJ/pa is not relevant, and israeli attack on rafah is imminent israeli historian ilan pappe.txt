or gaza's future is due to be discussed by the Palestinian Authority president here in Qatar Mahmud Abbas is flying to Doha to meet the Amir shik Taman bin hammad Alani well Elam Pape is an Israeli historian and author of the ethnic cleansing of Palestine he's joining us here in our Doha Studio very good to have you with us so I want to ask you first of all about this visit uh by Mahmud abas right from the start the Israeli government backed by the US has said that in order for the Palestinian authority to have to have any role in the future of Gaza then it has to be rejuvenated how difficult does that make it for Mahmud Abbas when he is making an attempt to be part of the negotiating process it would be very difficult for him to be relevant because in the eyes of the Israeli government for quite a while he's not relevant the only function that he seems to serve as far as the Israeli government is concerned is some sort of security coordination to keep the lid on the uh out potential Uprising in in the West Bank I don't think the Israelis are at all interested in Consulting him about the day after in Gaza I think there's more interest in the United States I think Washington is more keen to have the PA as part of the post-war if you want Arrangement uh but I if I may say so myself I think it would be a terrible mistake for the PA to be part of it uh as this is going to be seen by so many Palestinians as collaborating with the destruction of Gaza and the Israeli visions of the post-war Gaza which is definitely very very opposite for what most Palestinians would have liked I I want to ask you about the credibility element of it because one could perhaps understand that the the view of Palestinians in Gaza but would one would also Imagine That Palestinians in the West Bank who've been living under the Palestinian for a long time would have uh a particularly jaus view because the credibility of the Palestinian Authority has not been great over the last several years not not very much I would say even more the legitimacy not just the credibility and uh the longer the Israeli operations continue and they will continue unfortunately for quite a while the more difficult it would be for people in the West Bank to remain relatively I say relatively passive because quite a few young Palestinian factions have been trying to join the resistance in Gaza uh but of course it's very difficult because the Israelis are are using very oppressive Ive methods in Gaza so I think yes I think that if we already know that the credibility was undermined it's going to be further undermined if if the PA would be seen to be part of a coalition that gives a green light to Israel to implement its ideas for how to rule Gaza uh in the end of the war and the war is not very near ending we should take this into account so we really don't see any role for the PA in the next 15 months because this is more or less the period in which the fighting will continue uh and I don't think there will be any substantial negotiations anyway about the day after MH okay I want to I want to get your opinion with regard to that fighting that you're talking about as we know and Benjamin Netanyahu has instructed the Israeli military in order to carry out put plans together for an operation to to move into Rafa that has prompted a significant response very very critical response from the US the UK various supporters of isra including of course Aid agencies as well is there an indication do you think that this is the point at which the support that the Netanyahu government has been receiving up to now is starting to fracture it's starting to back away is this a sign that people are saying No this pushing everybody pushing 1.4 million million Palestinians into a corner of Gaza in Rafa is simply too far I I wish I would be a bearer of good news but I I'm afraid that history teaches us that strong American language of condemnation very rarely is supported by actions and the Israelis have a way of kind of taming or at least allegedly taming their actions uh creating the impression that this is not really a military operation it's a limited operation they will find a way that would satisfy an American Administration on election year uh in a way that unfortunately as far as the Palestinians in Rafa are concerned would be quite meaningless the same I think is true about the EU and the European governments I think that they are very easily uh induced by Israel to take a strong position in words but not to translate them into actions that could have bring an end to the fighting so I think that the Israeli Army will attack Rafa uh I don't think that the Israeli plans for how to deal with the refugees are going easily to materialize uh we hope and we need a strong International re action now because once the Israeli operation will begin it will be even more difficult to stop them mhm the fact that Benjamin Netanyahu went public and said that he had instructed the military to make this plan for a push on Rafa at this particular time when there are negotiations albeit fairly fragmented we don't have a lot of details um about working towards some sort of timeline towards the ceasefire is there a sense that there that the timing of this anoun an m is in some way connected to the negotiations and the to put perhaps pressure on the negotiators perhaps on Hamas itself to try to move along with some sort of solution I think netan is recently talking mainly to his electoral base more than to anyone else and his electoral base is made of people who care little about those who've been captured in Gaza they want to see the continuation of the military actions they want to see a stop for international Aid to Gaza so when he talks in Hebrew uh to the Israeli public he talks to his base when he talks to the American Media he tries to sound a bit more pragmatic a bit more inclusive but I don't think that we should take these uh uh kind of statements by nany as part of an indication of a policy this is an attempt to from the very beginning to use the military operation to save his skin because uh everything Netanyahu has done from the of October until today from his perspective is calculated to make sure that he's not going to lose his grip on the government because of all the other problems that he faces so his decision eventually to order the Army to go to Rafa is not out of a military consideration or even strategic one it is one that he thinks that his base would like to hear would it really how would this translate into orders practical orders to the Army it's difficult to to say but I wouldn't portray the Israeli Army as a doish institution that is hesitant to attack RAF so I think we still need the regional and International Community to take seriously the possibility that the catastrophe that we have seen in Gaza is going to be far worse when Israel uh Begins the attack on Rafa and they have the intention of doing it unless they will be stopped from the outside yeah I want to take this slightly wider because we we have about a minute left an Egyptian official has been quoted as saying that any attempt to relocate Palestinians into Egypt would simply collapse any sort of agreement between uh security agreement between Egypt and Israel is this a risk that actually Israel is in a position to take given the the level of control that it relies on from from Egypt over the border with the Sinai desert it's a risk Israelis will take I think they understand that the Egyptians are not going to open the border and let in the refugees they still hope they will under the pressure uh but I think there is a plan B for the Israelis that it doesn't happen and the fact that this would you know uh uh result in a huge human catastrophe is not something that inhibits the Israelis from implementing uh that program the mood in Israel and that's the mood Netanyahu is relating to is vindicative still very vindicative dehumanizes the Palestinians very little compassion for the Palestinian suffering and therefore the domestic scene in Israel has no problem with a wide operation in Rafa whatever the human consequences of that operation will be Ellen Poe we appreciate you giving us the benefit of your expertise in this thank you very much indeed for your time thank you very much for having me thank you
