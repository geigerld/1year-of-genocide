well we can now speak to khalad mahash he's a Palestinian lawyer who visited the Israeli Detention Facility s Taman where hundreds of Palestinians from Gaza are currently being held in terrible conditions he joins us now from um Alam in Israel khad I understand you finally managed to visit a detane there the Palestinian journalist Muhammad Arab he's been held without charge for a 100 days let's start with what you saw on your visit this visit took place after trying for several times to visit the detention centers is one of the secret prisons which is cidan which is a military detention center that is under the ministry of Defense of Israel this was the first visit Muhammad shared with us a lot of details and testimonies about what the det are being subjected to in this detention centers they are being subjected to brutal methods of torture Beyond imaginations no human being can live under those conditions Israel is making sure to keep them tortured and also beaten since the first day Muhammad shared with us many details for example he's being handcuffed and blindfolded 24/7 for over 100 years non-stop they only uh being able to have his hands free or the having the removed the shuckles for one minute when he's take taken a shower they are allowed to take a shower for one minute and everyone who exceeds this minute will be subjected to torture in a very brutal manner many other details very desperate details that Muhammad shared with me that are Beyond imaginations I've visited in fact in the past hundred of uh detainees and prisoners since October 7 but what I've witnessed and what I've heard from Muhammad during the uh visit in the visit room I was able to notice that he was sad and I felt helpless because I couldn't do anything for what Muhammad and his also other detainees are being subjected to Muhammad is a journalist as you know we used to see him as he used to report on the situation in Gaza he used to he did not change his clothes for over 50 days now he's wearing the same clothes including underwear he's not allowed to change his clothes along with the other detainees they are also kept in baracks which are big baracks Muhammad is being detained with aund other detainees they are also they sleep on the floor they don't have blankets they do not have pillows they are exposed to uh hard conditions and this situation has been on for over 100 days I have a question are there any people in this world any free people of this world who would accept such conditions who would accept that a human being who's just a human being that should be handcuffed and also blindfolded for months nonstop they are seated all the time they are not allowed to stand up they are not allowed to talk to the other prisoners they have to remain seated without talking without blindfolded this is very difficult and challenging indeed and could cause pain Muhammad came to the visit completely exhausted physically exhausted he lost weight also and because he cannot move his hands and his legs are not he's not able to move them because of this uh situation and this torture he forgot how he can move his hands and his ankles his legs this is part of the torture that Muhammad shared with me in addition to all the different torture methods that are being subjected to sir you you speak about different types of torture I understand that that recently there have been allegations of sexual abuse rapes taking place at this facility yes we have heard in the media before that there were rape cases but today I've also witnessed firsthand from Muhammad the details of those rape cases Muhammad shared with me that during the last month the IDF soldiers raped six prisoners in front of all the other detainees using the most brutal methods they have raped those detainees in front of the other detainees just to take revenge and also to give a lesson to the other detes in order to terrorize them this is one element that is the rape cases but we have not should not forget about the medical negligence that is there is one Health uh Point under this detention center but there is nothing in this uh Health Point they are lacking all means that could be used in order to treat those detainees there are some doctors and nurses that are also uh trying to undergo they are also conducting surgeries without using anesthesia they are also how can you how can someone undergo a surgery without anesthesia what Muhammad is suffering from in this Detention Center along with the other detainers is brutal and Beyond imagination that we cannot imagine it in any world no logic could allow us to have such a situation I do want to ask you because we've heard too from the the health Care staff at that facility about amputations that have been forced to take place because of of the use of of handcuffs for such a long period of time they've spoken about access the need for access to detainees I see Israel is now discussing a plan to replace even Red Cross visits to Palestinian prisoners which have been suspended since the start of the war is there any access or any plan for access to the detainees there this is the first visit that I was allowed to conduct in my capacity of Palestinian lawyer I've been allowed to uh conduct this visit after many efforts that we have exerted we have sent many messages and letters until we've been able to conduct this visit we hope that the uh all the authorities will allow all the law practitioners and uh human inter International organizations also to uh conduct visits in order to uh observe and witness the situations and conditions uh under which all the detainees are being held so that they can make their voice heard it is important to allow lawyers and international organization to visit the detention centers and we need also psych psychologists in order to uh treat those detainees they need they desperately need all this they are subjected to torture they are not even allowed to talk to each other can you imagine a detain that is detained for a 100 days that is not allowed to uh turn right or left or to talk to anyone they are just talking to themselves Muhammad is one of hundred of detainees was allowed to talk to a lawyer for 45 minutes after those H days in order to uh ask about his family and to send his message to the world let alone the other tens or hundreds of detention they desperately need the help of the whole world the whole world should rally around their case in order to impose on Israel and ask her to and urge her to stop those torture methods also we should ask them to the whole world is supporting Israel as it tries to release their hostages thank you very much for sharing with us what you've seen and heard at the S Taman facility we've obviously heard some terrible terrible stories from there great to get some firsthand testimony khed mahaj there a Palestinian lawyer who finally managed to visit one of his clients at that facility telling us about the terrible conditions being faced there thank you so much for joining us now a new wave of Israeli attacks meanwhile in Central and Southern Gaza has killed and injured several more Palestinians at least 10 people have been killed and 30 injured in an Israeli attack east of Rafa just in the past few hours Israeli forces are reported to have shelled a group of civilians the injured have been taken to the European Hospital which is already overcrowded with patients Israeli forces have also destroyed parts of the Rafa Crossing in southern Gaza as you can see more than a month after They seized it video shows the burnt out buildings including the main terminal now this was a vital route for Aid flowing into Gaza from the Egyptian side but Israel has since been blocking supplies from getting through since it took over that Crossing on May the 7th well let's get the latest now from our correspondent Tarak abazo he joins us from darl Bala in central part of the Gaza Strip tar we know that the air strikes the the attacks are ongoing bring us up to speed on on where they've been taking place well generally the security situation of course this trip is escalating in a very high speed now within the past hour the Israeli military has targeted a group of Palestinians in the Eastern portion of Rafa City where at least 12 Palestinians have been reported killed while 30 others being wounded but a surprisingly what we have been confirmed and even hearing from the uh Ministry of Health in alaka hospital that casualties and victims have been BR from RAF District to Al AA hospital where we are right now as civilians were forced to bring the casualties and driving uh for 25 km until they can find a proper medical facility that can provide them with medical treatment especially that the European hospital was unable to provide them with Essential Medical Care those people who have been critically injured right now are receiving a treatment right now inside the department of Al AA hospital but as I'm talking to you right now anasia we are surrounded by two Israeli military qu coped drones that are flying and hovering in a very low altitude in uh the vicinity of the AL AKA Hospital people here have got a sense of fear that they might be doing something or might attack Palestinians within the coming hours so there is a great sentiment of uh fear and even frustration among those Palestinians as they are no longer can feel secured and safe especially that we continue to hear loud Israeli bombardment and attacks and the northern portion of anarat refugee camp close to Narin Junction where the vast majority of Israel operations have been conducted from that area where according to gaza's health Ministry at least more than 24 Palestinians have been killed within the past 24 hours and this number is expected to rise within the coming hours inia T abaz they're reporting for us from the ground from Daryl Bal in the Gaza Strip thank you
