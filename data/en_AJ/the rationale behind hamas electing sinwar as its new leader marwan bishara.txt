Al jaaz senior political analyst joins us now VI sky from Paris it's a name that Palestinians know very well and a leader that they respect he's got a very tough job to do if he's going to be a negotiator while he's still in Gaza yes absolutely it's a huge Challenge and it's a huge responsibility especially at a time of War I should say at a time of genocide against his own people while he is resisting or hiding in the tunnels in Gaza but there's one thing about sinir that I'm not sure you missed in your in your list of uh things about him to really get to know him it's very important to recall the last six years from 2017 to 2023 until you know when the October 7 attack happened for six years he was the basically the the you know the ruler he he governed Gaza uh Gaza was uh a well-run machine uh some people argue it was better run than the West Bank under the peran authority in the sense of the everything from uh you know water and sewage and electricity to uh security and Order education uh medical and and and so on so forth so here you had a leader of a strip of more than two million people basically under Israeli Siege and yet it was B basically functioning so well that even prime minister Nano thought that uh you know this could be a good thing for Israel and and he actually spoke in his own cabinet in favor of supporting Hamas in Gaza against the Palestinian Authority in rala little he knew that senoir was not uh you know uh was not going to be satisfied with simply ruling over an open air prison and that his entire program was one of liberation freedom for Palestine a full sovereignty for Palestine and the return of the refugees which of course are you know most of the inhabitants in Gaza and of course it has to be said Marin that one man's terrorist is another man's Freedom Fighter it's something that the Israelis really can't get their heads around and nor can many you might say European capitals they never have really with Hass have they well you know if you remember well we don't remember necessarily but clearly you know much of the Jewish uh underground back in the 1940s was called terrorists by the British Mandate of course they called themselves uh Freedom Fighters while in fact they were colonizers but be that as it may this whole poisonous term terrorism doesn't really tell us much actually it it uh it uh it obscures more than it uh clarifies in so many ways but yes now he is sort of the the devil incarnate for Israel for the past 10 months the the the ano government has worked on the character assassination so brilliantly that now he's known in the world as you know some form of a new Hitler or some kind whereby never since the Holocaust have you know Israel been beaten the way it was in October 7 uh because of the kind of operation that uh that sunir led but once again uh you know uh as it's known again in in in in uh in in all spheres of Life there is action and reaction and what happens in Gaza is a total reaction to the Israeli occupation people in Gaza are are resistant they are steadfast they are defiant notably by the election of uh of senoir in in reaction to Israeli occupation gen side and the assassination of hania so you could say that the election of sunir has come as a reactions reactions in general are are are not strategies right I mean they are reactions and in so many ways so much that happens to the Palestinians comes in fact as a reaction to Israeli continuous repression oppression uh occupation illegal settlement colonization and as of late war crimes and genocide and the reactions by the Palestinians is electing a very defiant very you know steadfast leader who spent many years in Israeli jails and who today after 10 months of uh unraveling genocide remains or is even more popular among Palestinians uh than before well we'll leave it there for now it's been good to get your analysis on the current developing news story man Bashar there Al jazer senior political analyst
