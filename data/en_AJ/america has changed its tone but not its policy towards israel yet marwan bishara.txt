the United Nations Secretary General Antonio guz has renewed calls for a cation of hostilities in Gaza as Millions observe the holy month of Ramadan though Ramadan has begun The Killing bombing and bloodshed continue in Gaza we recently entered the six months since the amas terror attacks in Israel and the catastrophic Israel Onslaught in Gaza began my strongest appeal today is to honor the spirit of Ramadan by silencing the guns and removing all obstacles to ensure the delivery of life-saving Aid at the speed and massive scale required let's now speak to Marwan bishara he's Al jazer senior political analyst Marwan you're joining us from London this evening uh thanks for your time so Maran well there is no cessation of hostilities in Gaza the Secretary General is calling for one and and what we see in occupied East Jerusalem around the AKA mosque more restrictions heavy security presence are we looking at an explosive situation um across the territories this Ramadan it's very possible I think uh it's like a pressure cooker and not just in Palestine I think throughout the region anger is increasing in fact the mood is boiling throughout Palestine but also in the region although various Arab regimes have been able to contain the situation thus far but I think somewhere between faith and famine I think just things are deteriorating fast and uh in the meanwhile what is going on and I think we need to underline that because I've heard that several times the last few days in fact weeks and months is that we keep talking about as the Secretary General of the United Nation just did about cessation of hostilities and everyone around the world talks about a permanent ceasefire but really I think we should start talking about ending the aggression against Kaza this is no longer a question of two parties fighting whether symmetrically or asymmetrically or dis symmetrically this is an Israeli aggression on Palestine notably on Gaza but also on the West Bank and East Jerusalem as you just uh reported and I think that aggression goes on unabated Western supported and clearly uh there's no way out of it unless we start admitting that this is not about some dialogue going on in Cairo or Doha or Paris or elsewhere this is not just about another acrobatic uh diplomacy this is about International pressure to end the aggression if you don't end the aggression I think things are really going to get worse moving forward right and look Maran let's just listen to what the US President Joe Biden said uh earlier this week I mean he criticized the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for failing to prevent civilian deaths in Gaza making the comments while he was speaking to an American TV network but at the same time he reaffirmed his support for Israel let's listen I'm never going to leave Israel the defense of Israel is still critical so there's no red line I'm going to cut off all weapons so they don't have the Iron Dome to protect them they don't have but there's red lines that if he crosses in the he cannot have 30,000 more Palestinians dead how are we to understand these comments because they seem to be somewhat contradictory the red line is uh for Benjamin Netanyahu to go into but at the same time Biden says I will never leave Israel yes uh well there's a number of ways of trying to dissect this one there is definitely increasing heat between uh the Prime Minister and the president and there's clear differences about the way moving forward but I think uh Biden is uh underlining a change of tone not a change of policy and that explains a bit the way he sounds as if he's speaking from both sides of his mouth on the one hand he talks about red lines on the other hand he talks about continuing basically unconditional support from the outset he made the mistake of making America's support and conditional it should have been conditional if at all but for for more than five months now Israel has gotten the support the arms and the money but it has rejected the advice of the American president and that's why he's getting a bit frustrated with the Israeli Prime Minister because he does not want to see as he said another 30,000 casualties or dead people in Gaza the question is to the American president is 5,000 okay is another 2,000 children is another one child dying in Gaza out of starvation okay for him I mean why 30 why another 30,000 which really goes a long way to explain that while the Americans are changing their tone because the the Israelis are not listening to them they are yet to change policy and that sounds to me like they are and still complicit in the war in Gaza right so then these differences that you refer to between Biden and between Netanyahu do they really matter when it comes to the war and the trajectory of the war you're saying that it seems to be that they both have the same policy going forward I think it matters only in terms of uh Styles and in terms of strategy but not in terms of end goal the Americans also want to see Hamas defeated and uh they also do not want to repeat of another October 7 as they would have it but they don't want the war to continue as it has been wage the past five months they cannot um they cannot tolerate more of the same casualties more of the same humiliation by the Israelis and more of the same uh basically complicity in genocide if you will so they want to wind down the war they want to take it in a different course they want a ceasefire even if it's five weeks leading to another ceasefire even if it's another five weeks and they want to start winding the war that way and if Israel must continue its operations against Hamas it will be surgical according to the Americans the Israelis reject all of these Notions they want to wage the war they want to wage the war they don't care about the casualties in fact I'd rather think they prefer higher casualties among the Palestinians because they would like them to be ethnically cleansed meaning they would would like to push as many of them out as possible they certainly remain vengeful towards the people in Gaza that kind of vengefulness might have been also an American idea back in October 15 when Biden visited Israel and he told them go get justice but five months later I mean something got a give here Gaza is destroyed more than 100,000 casualties the world more or less remains silent the international public opinion is boiling and hence unless something really gives in the immediate future I would say we're going to see major famine in Gaza we're going to see major death in silence in Gaza and I think that genocide is going to continue to unravel I just think that that is going to Echo somewhere in the middle east in the rest of Palestine and God knows what could happen Okay Maran bashara thank you so much every
