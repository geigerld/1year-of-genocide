now Al jazer has obtained a draft document that says Hamas has proposed a three-stage ceasefire plan in response to mediation by Qatar in Egypt it involves the exchange of Israeli captives for Palestinian prisoners reconstruction of Gaza and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces we can now speak to Muhammad nazal who's a member of hamas's political Bureau about this thanks for your time with us on Al jazer um I'm looking at the draft agreement right here first of all can you explain why Hamas proposed this agreement in three stages what was the thinking behind that to begin with the uh proposal received by Hamas following the Paris conference speaks of three stages as a result Hamas in the response was committed to these three phase process however Hamas was more specific as they proposed certain deadlines the first one comes at 45 ceasefire the second also 4 45 days and so is the third the four these time limits were uh specified by Hamas themselves another issue the category of captives to be released were also specifi the first phase will see the release of children below 19 years of age as well as nonmilitary women civilian women and Elders the second phase will see the release of all the Israeli captives men and soldiers and the third one will be for the Rel relase of dead bodies kept with both sides this is the specifities or the specifics of Hamas response to Paris paper um Mr nazal Hamas has said that any hostage deal has to include a comprehensive ceasefire that would end the war in Gaza and lead to a reconstruction effort as well as the lifting of The Siege but we know that Israel in the past has said that it won't commit to ending the war as part of any deal now looking at this draft agreement there are many details here and it could be safe to assume that the Israelis won't accept some of the points in it what are hamas's red lines as you know there are very specific details and among these details cannot be compromised by Hamas the first demand is to put an end to the Israeli War to bring the Israeli killing machine to a halt do you think that we will accept the war to continue against our civilian population this is not acceptable another issue we wish to see the Israeli occupation forces withdrawing from Gaza Strip entire entirely uh we don't think that the Israelis are willing to remain in Gaza Strip that's why the demands raised by Hamas are lawful and reasonable the K prime minister described Hamas response as a whole as positive that's why our response we believe is realistic and our demands are reasonable but on this issue you just said that a full ceasefire is is one of your condition I on this issue in the past Hamas said that there must be a full ceasefire as part of any agreement but in this draft agreement that you put together we see that it's in the second stage of the agreement and not in the first 45 days is there a reason for that and is that a concession that's being made by Hamas we put it this way in order to test the waters in order to test there are we have certain concerns we have even fears that the Israelis will not be committed to the agreement we also believe that the entire agreement may be undermined that's why we put the total and permanent ceasefire in the second phase where more agreements will be reached throughout the three stages We No Doubt will raise our ultimate demand which is permanent ceasefire without the ceasefire no other agreements can be materialized on the ground have you gotten guarantees from the mediators that they will in fact be the guarantors of any agreement uh that's been agreed on we have proposed five parties to act as guarantors qar Egypt turkey Russia and the United Nations these five parties are concerned to ensure the permanent ceasefire and to act as guarantor but this will be taking place once both sides reach an agreement we are waiting for the response from the Israeli occupation government we are waiting to see the reply to the proposals made by Hamas in response therefore we expect a negotiation to start once negotiations start any obstacles can be ironed out on the way to reach a final agreement whereby we can dot the eyes and cross the tees okay and just let me ask you one final question your reaction to What the president of the US Joe Biden said to this draft agreement calling it a little over the [Music] top we do not expect uh the American president to come up with a better statement he is totally biased the American Administration is totally biased he was part of the war w on Gaza by providing the political and legal cover for the Israelis let alone the military and financial assistance provided to the Israeli occupation forces he was with Netanyahu hand in hand he was even supporting all the moves taken by Netanyahu that's why we did not expect a better response from the American administrations and regardless of the Biden statement we believe that this is a preliminary response and we expect the US Administration will come up with a final decision are they willing for the war to continue or they want to see a permanent ceas fire okay we'll leave it there thank you Muhammad nazal we thank you for joining us on Al jazer mammad nazal is from hamas's political Bureau
