we're joined Now by th kmu an assistant professor of public policy with the Doha Institute of Graduate Studies and also a specialist on conflict resolution and international Aid thank you very much for your time Mr kmu what do you make of the latest comments by Hamas that there will be no more release of captives until the end of the war just how damaging is it to the whole process to revive a ceasefire it's Elizabeth it's very damaging but it's not surprising I mean giving that the Americans have uh they have given the Israelis the green light to continue with this military operation the Israelis are emboldened they're encouraged to go all the way till the end and um it's not a secret that the goal they have stated from the beginning of this war is toppling down Hamas I think it's not a realistic goal and I'm not sure until now what's the end result for Israel how Israel is going to achieve this in the Gaza Strip because for me there is only one scenario uh that I can imagine or Envision if Israel wants to go all this way which is you mean all the way in destroying Hamas destroying Hamas it means that they have to reoccupy the entire Gaza Strip and I fear again that the transfer scenario is still there on the table I know everyone talks the talks the Americans say no for transfer the Europeans say so Arab governments but really what you see now is pushing all these people into the South into this small Corner small area ofas inun that's a recipe for a disaster this is a ticking bomb they're getting closer to the Egyptian border you'll have millions hundreds of thousands uh uh cornered there in this narrow corner of of Gaza Strip and if if the campaign stays uh on the same Pace it's going to explode I mean people will will cross to the other side of the borders I I can't see but this scenario happening given the very dire situ the Gaza but they can't go to the other side of the Border there is a Crossing they can't just get across it's but you never know what I mean so this is a war zone now I mean I mean tactically I mean Israel can I don't want to go into scenarios but historically uh gazans have fleed once in 2007 to Egypt they crossed to shop this was during another vicious uh Siege Israel imposed but most of them returned when they were done with their shopping basic Commodities but anything can happen I mean I mean you have so many militants inside the Gaza Strip resistance groups Israel there I mean bombing or opening a hole in the border crossing I mean why not I mean and and so and imagine this scenario even I mean the the official Gates of the borders if people start flocking in hundreds or thousands towards that gate you think the Egyptians will start shooting at them who who's going to stop these refugees these are refugees so it's so again I'm still feeling this scenario I know everyone is talking the tokens no for transfer but the reality is so dire there is there is a scenario let's talk about something that's happening now since the end of the ceasefire on Friday morning we have seen hundreds of civilians being killed we are once again seeing those horrific pictures of you know children with terrible injuries in hospitals who is going to stop that the US went to Great length to say we have told Israel to protect civilian lives clearly that's not happening no I mean of course I mean I mean yesterday when the when the the bombing campaigns resumed the first thing the Israelis did is they they targeted an horaa School in jabalia in the North in the northern part of the Gaza Strip and then basically what they're doing is ethnic cleansing math ethnic cleansing they want to empty the northern part of the Gaza Strip so Gaza and the north for the Israelis this has to be a a buffer zone the entire and they' said that Ro has reported yesterday that Israel has spoken to many Regional leaders about creating the so-called buffer zone on the Palestinian side of the Gaza Strip so the buffer zone yes but they're talking about a narrow Zone which is like you know a one kilo or two kilos inside Gaza but what I'm talking about now is they haven't they're not done yet with emptying the entire North Gaza and the north is it possible to do that there are still hundreds of thousands of people in the north are they by targeting honorous schools and residential places again they're asking people to leave South so as if they have a clear strategy of emptying the north of Gaza and the North and for me that's troubling because once you squeeze the entire population of the Gaza Strip in the South and you C to half you have full control of the the upper North I think at a later point this could be enough for Israel to stop the war if it really manages to have a full control of half of the Gaza Strip but is that possible 49 days of bombing the North and Hamas shows that it can still release captives from Gaza City in the center of Gaza well you know if if well if they continue on the same Pace I mean I'm I'm afraid it is possible because people have to flee eventually so what happened when the war stopped before the truth hundreds of thousands remain in Gaza and the north but also some uh Reports say that 400 or close to half a million already went South so and the numbers are debated but now as the way the way the systematic bombing going again after schools after uh Refugee centers after you know so it's as if they're still not done with this objective which is Gaza and the north to completely empty it from its own people and it's a horrifying scenario for me and then later on it's I don't know it's a stage based it seems to me it's a stage based War you know approach so basically they're creating all these horrifying conditions squeezing people in the South and eventually probably in their mind they want or they're thinking that Hamas then will have to engage with us on on an exit strategy for Hamas but realistically speaking again the the main goal of this war which is toppling down Hamas it will not happen unless Israel have has full control of the Gaza Strip and stays off in years in the G strip and again this this I'm really sorry I have to interrupt you because
