diplomats invoke a rarely used resolution at the UN General Assembly to try to stop Israel's war on Gaza after the United States vetoed a security Council attempt to call for a ceasefire is the veto power paralyzing the UN should it be permanently revoked this is Inside Story [Music] hello and welcome to the program I'm serl Vanier the emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly is bringing Israeli massacres in Gaza into sharp Global Focus after more than nine weeks of violence the UN Security Council has been unable to agree on a ceasefire warning of a global threat un Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez invoked a rarely used article last week to urge the security Council to act but despite an overwhelming majority voting in favor of a ceasefire the US blocked it using its veto power critics say this absolute power of the five permanent members of the security Council renders the world body helpless at a time when Global conflicts demand timely Solutions so is it time for The veto power to be removed will it help the UN become more effective we'll discuss these issues in detail with our guests shortly but first this report by Finton Monahan un diplomats get a closer look at the war in Gaza the Rafa Crossing is the only entry point for humanitarian Aid into the territory nowhere near enough is coming in and most Palestinians are prevented from leaving when they see it nice when you visit the hospital when you when you see how the humanitarian assistance is being is being uh basically basically prohibited to enter to enter Gaza despite despite the catastrophic situation Di situation this is uh really uh a tragedy and it has been too long we have uh suffered too much so for the security Council definitely to maintain peace and security is our primary responsibility and uh we have tried very hard and of course we we need to do more the visit was aimed at building International consensus on the need for a ceasefire last week resolution was tabled at the UN Security Council but was vetoed by the United States the UN Secretary General said he continue to press the issue regrettably the security Council failed to do it but that does not make it less necessary so I can promise I will not give up of civilians and upholding there's been more success at the general assembly where every state has a vote and no one has veto right on October the 27th it passed a resolution calling for a humanitarian pause but UN General Assembly resolutions aren't binding when the UN was founded in 1945 the charter gave special powers to five permanent Security Council Members the US the UK France Russia and China each has a veto and has used it extensively over the years the US has blocked more than 40 resolutions on Israel critics say the current setup isn't working as the International Community is unable to respond effectively to Global crises there's been many proposals for reform including limiting The veto and expanding the number of permanent members on the UN Security Council not one has been implemented concerned Israel's bombing campaign has killed or injured tens of thousands of Palestinians most of gaza's population has been forcibly displaced many families several times Israel has rejected calls for permanent ceasefire as pledged to continue its assault despite growing appeals for an end to the violence Finton Mahan Al jazer for Story let's bring in our guests in Northern Wales is Khan Ross the founder of Independent Diplomat and nonprofit Advisory Group he's also a former British Diplomat who served on the UN Security Council in Islamabad Mala Loi is a for former Pakistani ambassador to the United Nations and was closely involved in discussions about the reform of the security Council in Moscow now is vaslav matusa former Russian Diplomat chairman of the Russian friendship society with Arab countries welcome to you all Khan first question to you 18,000 Palestinians have been killed most of them women and children and the UN Security Council is not able to call for a ceasefire even though most of the world wants to see the fighting stop is the UN failing at its primary Mission yes undoubtedly I mean the UN Security Council is the world's primary body for peace and security for peace and security and the US has blocked any action as it has traditionally done on Israel Palestine issues and on this occasion it has clearly blocked Security Council action so now the action goes to the general assembly so by the way just to make this clear at the time of recording we haven't yet seen the vote of the UN General Assembly it'll happen in a few hours um there is likely to be overwhelming support for pausing the fighting um and it's probably going to be called a ceasefire in the language that they're looking at Mal Malo we have we have many viewers from what could be called the global South on Al jazer what are they supposed to think when they see major powers on the one hand promoting International rules and then blocking the only mul multilateral system that we have to uphold them when it suits their interests well I think most people in the global South would be extremely disappointed but not surprised by the way that the security Council the way it's structured uh is is not working uh I think at the heart of its dysfunction lies the fact that we have a structure of the primary body responsible for the maintenance of International Peace and security uh which reflects an arrangement of a bygone error uh I mean the five permanent members are there because of uh the second world war Arrangement and now the security Council needs to reflect current day Global realities which it doesn't so I think there's disappointment in the global South but there's also a sense that this body must be radically reformed if it is to live up to the responsibilities of the 21st century because it does not reflect 21st century realities and for that it is important that either the the Security Council is reformed in a manner that you increase uh the number of elected members who can then balance the power exercise by the P5 uh or you move to end the veto wielding uh pa uh even though I think that will be a very difficult difficult thing to do because any reform of the security Council with which you know I have been involved in the negotiation for almost 5 years uh any reform would involve an amendment to the Charter of the United Nations and that means that a two-thirds majority of the general assembly will be required and then ratification by all those who have voted for it including the five permanent members so here's the Dilemma or the problem the problem is that the five permanent members of the security Council do not wish to give up its veto and therefore we're looking at a situation where they have been recently moves by the general assembly to try to at least limit or to embarrass uh the permanent five when they use the veto and I think we should remember the countries that have used it most uh it is the United States and Russia uh the United Kingdom is the number three country that's used The veto uh many times but China and France have used it less so the two countries that have used it most uh you know that underlines the fact how they've either tried to Shield themselves or their allies from censure or from any kind of action which leaves the security Council dysfunctional ineffective and lacking legitimacy okay vaslav I want to bring you into this conversation but before I do that quick little explanation to make sure all our viewers are up to speed on just the very basics of how the UN Security Council works the UN Security Council or UNC is 15 members five of which are permanent and they are essentially the victors of World War II which is when all of this was designed and and built and they are the US the UK Russia China and France and those five only have the right and the ability to veto any resolution that comes to them okay and that's what we're talking about today so vaslav I I want your take on this as a former Russian Diplomat because on this particular conflict the war on Gaza countries have been critical of the US vetoing a ceasefire but there's another conflict going on still going on of course Russia and Ukraine and on that conflict it's been the other way around with Russia uh vetoing any attempts to impose a ceasefire in that war so we see that the major Powers use the veto when it suits their interests what is your take on this this issue of the veto power and whether it's blocking the UN of course uh if we'll have a look at the current International Affairs we'll found out that un organization was established after as a result of second world war there pragmatically speaking it was two powers that splited and support and there in in one against the Germany United States and Soviet Union it was 80 years ago and now we facing other things that to big Powers America and Russia who replac the Soviet Union split absolutely different positions and now if you have a look at their situation in Syria where uh uh uh Russian troops facing uh American troops in their Resort in uh on the borders of the jordania Jordan and uh also on Ukraine where they are fighting and the Russian view on what situation in Ukraine is Russia is fighting not Ukraine Ukrainian military forces that's right well but the for these forces are supported fully question is about the my question is about veto power in the UN V uh VTO power it is necessary thing what agreed on in the 80 years ago it was a a a a compromise to find a compromise to satisfy United States and Soviet Union now where the Russian Federation is in the state of war against the United States to find a compromise and a common solution it's not it's very difficult if you look at details on any conflict not only in Gaza why remind you 2006 the situation in Lebanon when Israeli Army two mons was bombarding their own alleys in Lebanon Christian Maronite uh militia uh who was destroyed by Israel strikes uh rocket stries bombing and why because calar that time said the in Lebanon we are creating a new big Middle East wa the question I really want to answer to is how the works works or doesn't work plan plan that is conflicted conflicted with the situation in United Nation in Security Council of course two different position they cannot two main powers didn't have opportunity to find a solution common solution because America consider Russia lost Russia Soviet Union lost Russia is weak country we can't take into consideration their uh desire their plans their position and only the United States can dominate well now we have a plan a plan on Gaza on Israel plan it is called deal of century it is signed by uh as we said all discussed by if you don't mind I'm going to have to jump in because I really want I'll have to jump in because I really want to keep it about about the UN mechanism right now for preventing conflict and keeping the peace that's really our Focus today KH we just heard two different positions one essentially saying we need to the UN needs to be more inclusive in its decision making and that means perhaps get rid of the veto or widen The veto power and another vaslav saying veto is necessary because it's a compromise between uh the major Powers now you were a British Diplomat and you resigned this is interesting from the foreign office after the Iraq War that's when you founded your advisory group independent Diplomat Diplomat because you figured that there was a democratic deficit your words tell us about that and how that applies today well it applies because um many many smaller countries and non-state groups many of whom are involved in conflicts or disputes around the world are not entitled to speak at the UN Security Council or indeed other un bodies when their issue is on the table so independent Diplomat was founded to address that problem by giving smaller groups Democratic groups only Democratic groups the tools The Diplomatic means to get at those Security Council Members or general assembly members in other ways for instance by organizing private inform meetings but the the the the the earlier speaker who talked about the Democratic legitimacy of the security Council was absolutely right it's not a legitimate body in that its membership is not representative but the Paradox is you make it larger and perhaps expand extend the use of the veto to other new permanent members and that will make it even harder for the security Council to reach agreement and one of the paradoxes of what your Russian contributor said is that the veto isn't indeed in some ways necessary because it forces the big powers to agree or not to agree to a particular resolution if they don't vote for a resolution and they can't veto it they may well say well why should we implement it or why should Israel implement it in the case of Gaza because we haven't voted for it and that's a paradox of the veto in in a sense that it forces the big countries to adere to the rules agreed by the security Council or not so in your view should veto power be retained and perhaps modified or should be scrapped I think it should be modified I think there should be consensus in the general assembly to limit the use of the veto so lonstein the little state lonstein has proposed a reform whereby The veto could not be used in the case of mass atrocity or war crimes and I think that's a very sensible reforms and reform and many other countries would support that and I think I think that's reasonable the other reform is that Security Council memb permanent members should be obliged to explain themselves to the general assembly when they use the veto when the general assembly might then take up the issue as they have done on Palestine today Mala do we still live in a rules-based order if the majority will of of the majority of countries in the world as it's been expressed by the general assembly is blocked by just a handful of countries can be blocked by a handful of countries well of course the answer is no we do not live in a rules based International order but I do want to address something that you talked about earlier which is uh the idea that expanding VTO wielding Powers will somehow help the security Council I didn't at all uh mean that I meant one way that the security Council can be reformed to be more representative more accountable and more current uh to reflect uh today's realities is for it to expand by adding elected members and the idea would be that that would help to balance the power of the P5 because the P5 are not going anywhere for now if they're not going anywhere for now then of course the answer also lies uh in initiatives that have been taken for example there's a French Mexican initiative to try to limit the use of the veto so that it is not uh used in cases of mass atrocities and then there's also a European uh ini initiative some years ago uh which aims to limit the use of the veto uh in cases where there is a humanitarian uh situation but these initiatives are there there's growing support for them uh amongst members of the general assembly uh but clearly they haven't been able to uh achieve their objective because they have not been implemented they've not been agreed to what's the what's the most realistic Plan B at this stage there have been many avenues for reform that have been proposed that have been considered in various forums what's the most realistic Plan B well I think it's hard for a realistic Plan B to come into play until the P5 themselves agree and I think that is what lies at the heart of the problem uh I mean the problem and the solution are the same uh the problem is the P5 with their vetos but the solution also lies in them voluntarily giving up uh or at least limiting the use of the veto but we don't see that happening so I think the general assembly membership has tried to counter that by initiatives like uh ensuring that the use of the veto is explained to the general assembly I mean this happened last year through a resolution that was adopted uh by the general assembly uh and of course uh this led to an open debate uh in April this year by the general assembly of the use of the veto uh which was the first time that a major debate took place plus don't forget that over two decades of negotiations in what is called the intergovernmental uh negotiating process at the United Nations in the general assembly has not produced any outcome but what it has done is to highlight the need for reform of the security Council and the need for accountability by the P5 to the general assembly which after all is the parliament of the world well speaking of parliament of the world it's interesting you say that um and I'll come to you with this next question I want to Pivot to resolution 377 because um in the absence of a resolution two days ago uh by the UN Security Council the general assembly said okay well we're going to invoke this this rule that we don't use very often which essentially gives us expanded Powers um the primary purpose of the United Nations is to keep the peace the UN Security Council is not calling for a ceasefire so we're going to try and do this it's our turn and by the way the general assembly represents the will of almost every country in the world right it's 193 countries if I'm not mistaken that the general assembly however however what they pass is nonbinding unlike the resolutions of the security Council so my question to you vaslav is this just a pressure tool then a pressure tool in this case aimed at applying pressure on the US well my private opinion that there is pressure on us of course it's very important because previous the voting for previous project of resolution in Security Council only the United States and Israel supported pragmatically uh opposed pragmatically uh ceas fire resolution I think that even the United Nation General Assembly adopt to 90 person of voices for to support Palestinian and demanding stop killing who is fulfill this decision General Assembly Security Council uh uh Israel only been today I believe that United States are embarrassed with the situation in Gaza is trying to prove to uh to influence on Ben mean nany and Israel to change their attitude and to stop uh bombing to stop killing people but who is taking decision real decision on the ground bamin nanyu if he refus to do what it will be uh measures against him if security ccil is ready to undertake any real steps to to impose their decision to those who doesn't fulfill it well America as it obviously today is choosing other way she is not opposing desire bamin nanyu why because there is a plan plan of deal of century that I mentioned that means that no Palestinian no Arab on Israeli territory all of them should be outside the territory why they blaming now Egypt why they blaming now Jordan who don't accept refugees because they're understanding very clearly examples from the previous decades when they Liv in their houses they Liv in their territory they live in their soil they became refugees outside the country and the plan of century deal of century is consist to to create a new situation inside Israel without any conflict confrontation with local people Palestinians I think that this plan of New Frontiers of uh uh uh in the Middle East it could also we can mention the situation in Syria in Turkey in if you allow me to jump in respectfully creation of you mentioned G state if I can if I can jump in you've mentioned the deal of the century multiple times so that was the nickname given to um what the Trump administration had proposed to the Israelis and the Palestinians it's not active in any way under the Biden Administration um however Biden has addressed this this is how Biden acknowledged the importance just recently uh of global public opinion this is what he had to say we continue to provide military assistance until they get rid of [Applause] Hamas but but we have to be careful they have to be careful the whole world's public opinion can shift overnight we can't let that happen we're working relentlessly for the safe return of the hostages soan you heard that the whole world's opinion can shift overnight until now the US has had seemed fairly impervious to uh to pressure from other countries this is one of those little data points if you're reading the situation carefully that suggests maybe maybe actually they they are taking this into account oh they certainly are and they always have been even if they may not acknowledge so in public of course countries even ones as powerful and as dominant as the United States care a great deal about the what what the rest of international what the rest of the International Community think about their actions and they will be feeling very exposed they don't like uh wielding The veto in the UN Security Council it makes them look very isolated the vote in the general assembly will demonstrate the same thing that there is a large majority of countries in the world who want to cease fire and only the US and Israel and a few allies oppose it and that's not a comfortable position for the us to be in and likewise Israel Israel says it doesn't care about International Comm International opinion or the views of the but it actually does and this will exert a certain kind of pressure on them on the US and Israel to ultimately stop military action in Gaza I don't think it will be a military imperative that stops the action in Gaza whatever the Israelis say about it I think it will be external diplomatic pressure Mala do you think then that there is a breaking point so to speak for the us where the international pressure becomes such that the US stops using for instance its veto power power and shielding Israel from a from a un Security Council call for a ceasefire well if it uh was there it should have happened by now uh look at the scale of the killings in Gaza look at the number of children uh who've been killed look at the terrible uh Calamity that has befallen uh Gaza uh Global opinion is very clear Global opinion has been expressed in the previous UN General Assembly resolution it has been expressed in demonstrations that are taking place across the world and yet the United States seems to not be responding to this there's a disconnect between what it says and what it does it's not new uh we've seen it happen before also but the tragedy is that by the time the United States realizes it what will be left in Gaza uh the death and destruction there uh and the fact that the United States continues uh to provide Israel with weapons and high-tech weapons at that while saying that it wants to protect civilians in Gaza I mean you cannot get a more bigger disconnect uh than that so unfortunately these double standards and the hypocrisy uh of the US position is something that is being noted across the world and there will be a diplomatic cost for the United States but for now it seems to be impervious uh to Global opinion and that's all the time we have for today but I'd like to thank all our guests con Ross malod and veslav matusof for taking the time to have this
