well as we've been mentioning hospitals across the Gaza Strip are at Breaking Point Israel has asked 21 Hospitals and Clinics including in Northern Gaza to evacuate these hospitals are not just treating thousands of injured Palestinians but also Sheltering hundreds of displaced families despite continued hisra air strikes doctors have refused to leave saying that would mean death for critically ill patients and children on ventilators at least 20 8 health workers and First Responders have been killed and 15 Health Centers including hospitals have been damaged hospitals across Gaza are now on the final hours of fuel reserves to run life-saving medical devices including ventilators and dialysis machines morgs are overflowing and the situation at gaza's largest hospital is so dire they're burying a 100 bodies in a mass grave as an emergency measure the World Health organiz ation says they're concerned about disease outbreaks in hospitals where there's little water or sanitation the agency says life-saving aid for 300,000 patients is waiting to enter through RAF but so far no truck has been allowed in Dr Margaret Harris is a spokesperson for the World Health Organization she joins us now from Geneva good to have you with us so the facts I just read out they point to a very alarming situ situation just take us through what Gaza is going to face in the next few hours if this total Siege is not lifted well time is running out the hospitals as you said are overwhelmed every moment they're getting more casualties I mean under circumstances like this any normal hospital would be struggling because you don't have the supplies to treat the normal things you treat but this is a situation where you're increasing what they have to do because every hour more people are injured and now you've got people also who need care because they may become ill because they don't have their usual medications life-threatening illnesses like diabetes like uh people with kidney failure who would normally get dialysis these things are not happening so you've got more and more people who are severely ill and you have also have the people who've been suffering enormous mental trauma days and days of no sleep Terror uncertainty they too will be becoming people who cannot cope with what's going on around but there's nothing for them we know that 21 Hospitals and Clinics have been ordered to evacuate by Israel just tell us what that would mean if they do if if doctors walk away from hospitals what will that mean for those those inside it who are sick what do that mean for those who wake up in the morning under rubble and need to be taken somewhere for treatment that it means death that um and that's why the doctors have not walked away even though they are losing colleagues they they they're running out of supplies they're running out of the means of doing what they're there to do but that's why they're not walking away because you know that if you leave those people that you're caring for will die and exactly those people who've managed to survive an air strike won't have anywhere won't have any help if you're not there it's an impossible thing to ask of healthcare workers how unprecedented a situation is it for a hospital not only to have to work amidst the war zone we we've seen sadly in many parts of the world that civilians fall victims to to air strikes but this situ situation in which they not only have to deal with that but they also have to deal with a Complete Siege if you look at Ukraine for example we see a lot of support going from the West to help civilian infrastructure that is not the case here is it indeed and I I have been in Ukraine in the last year and we're talking about a completely different situation because exactly at the very time when they need the most support I'm talking about the healthcare workers where they need more fuel where they need more medical supplies where they need more of everything they're running right out of all the trauma supplies running right out of blood supplies running right out of all the things that they need to keep people going producing the oxygen everything um at the very time those things have been cut off from them and the and the worst part well not the worst part it's all awful but help is on the border we've C supplies we've got the things they need but we're not being allowed to bring them to the healthcare workers who are working so hard to save lives thank you so much for sharing your perspective and insight into what's happening Dr Margaret Harris there thank you
