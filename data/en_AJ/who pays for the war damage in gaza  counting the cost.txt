hello I'm Adrian finigan and this is counting the cost on elzer your weekly look at the world of business and economics this week nothing to return to Israel's war on Gaza has wiped out entire neighborhoods and reduced businesses to Rubble so who compensates Palestinians for the destruction also this week enshrined in Germany's Constitution the so-called debt break has sparked a budget crisis calls are growing for borrowing limits to be relaxed plus China and Saudi Arabia agree on their first currency swap while many nations are increasingly moving away from the US dollar to settle [Music] trade Israel's relentless bombardment of Gaza has killed and injured thousands of Palestinians the human cost is innumerable the toll on infrastructure is massive put simply absolute destruction and a lack of basic requirements to sustain life entire neighborhoods homes schools hospitals churches and mosques have all been targeted whoever runs Gaza after the war ends will have to rebuild the strip and create a functioning economy while many Palestinians who've managed to see what remains of their homes during a brief Lain attacks was shocked at the scale of the damage as you can see thousands of residential units were destroyed the same with other residential complexes in the north where to go where to sleep this was my house and now my family and I are homeless many are still buried under the debris I cannot even pick some of my clothes from under the rubble to put on my back however we are not leaving we're holding our ground even if I live in a tent I will not abandon my homeland my memories my home is all my memories I would never let it go I lived for 23 years here I will stay in it even if only a small part of it remains it's a massive shock it took me a lifetime to build this house for me and my brothers and just like that I'm back to square one we are a family of four and our house is made up of four floors the ground floor is a commercial shop my brother lives with his family in the first floor while the other brother on the second my family and I live on the fourth floor we're now sitting in what was once the kitchen that was the fridge and that the oven this is the only area where we could sit the rest is a total wreck well the UN special rorer on the right to adequate housing balak Krishan Raja gopal has denounced Israel's widespread bombing of homes and infrastructure in Gaza in a recent report he said carrying out hostilities with the knowledge that they will systematically destroy and damage civilian housing and infrastructure rendering an entire city such as Gaza City uninhabitable for civilians is a war crime multiple sources have released figures on the extent of damage to infrastructure satellite analysis by two researchers at the CNY Graduate Center and Oregon State University shows that nearly half of all buildings across Northern Gaza have been damaged or destroyed the UN says that nearly 45,000 housing units have been demolished out of the strips 36 hospitals 28 are no longer of functioning 279 educational facilities have been affected depriving more than 625,000 students of the basic right to education bakeries and Mills in the northern part of the strip have been brought to a standstill due to structural damage and the lack of fuel and flour water facilities across Gaza have also been targeted well the latest conflict is estimated to have cost much more than any of the four previous Wars on Gaza the 3-we war that began in December 2008 and ended in January 2009 caused destruction amounting to $2 billion that's according to the World Bank Hamas says the eight days of Israeli attacks in 2012 cost Gaza 1.2 billion nearly $6 billion was estimated to be the cost of rebuilding Gaza after the 2014 War and the damage and economic losses from the Israeli attack in 2021 amounted to more than half a billion doar Western countries have considered using Frozen Russian assets to rebuild Ukraine last year Poland demanded more than $1 trillion in World War II reparations from Germany also in 2022 Iraq completed the payment of more than $52 billion in compensation for damage caused by its 1990 invasion of Kuwait so who pays for the destruction in Gaza at how much joining us now is tamama Kut is an assistant professor in public policy and administration at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies good to have you with us on on counting the cost um is Gaza even going to be habitable after all of this given the scale of the destruction that we've just outlined um yes there is a chance it would be habitable if an urgent early recovery and and uh reconstruction plan is initiated immediately after the end of this war so there there still there is a chance of course I mean I mean gazin have nowhere to go so there is no plan B for gazin so we have to believe that it has to be a habitable and and and a normal place like any other place in the world and this depends on the International Community as well to create normal conducive uh social economic conditions for gazans to stay in Gaza and this and this and and and by default this is related on to how will they uh plan and implement the the Reconstruction Plan of Gaza after this war ends who who makes those plans how much is it are those plans going to cost is the rebuilding going to cost and who pays so just to give uh the viewers a perspective like you know the the in 2009 the first reconstruction uh uh operation there were donors after the Shalit war in Gaza donors bedge uh nearly $5 billion in 2012 uh cast lead operation there was 3 two pledges as well so given the size the sheer size of construction now we literally talking about something similar to I I would call it a new martial plan for for Gaza this might exceed 30 billions plus you know so it's a huge amounts of money uh of course Palestinians will not pay if if we live in a fair and ethical world the Israelis have to pay because they caus this this destruction and I still they should not I I and I believe that there should be accountability when it comes to this because most of the destruction that happened in G this is private ownership and also uh Aid and donations that came to support the two- State Solutions since the beginning of also 1994 so we're talking about building hospitals government premises Ministries civil infrastructure name it mainly these are donors money when I say donors I say Western donors Arab donors and international donors but Western donors especially the Europeans the EU the EU is one of the largest donors to the Palestinian Authority uh followed by I mean the Americans Japan and then Arab donors you know the the gulf countries you know Islamic countries um so this is tax money when it comes to Western countries this is tax money this is tax money being wasted because of Israel's actions and Israel had has no limits when it comes to this because the the the the subject or the issue of protecting a dividends which is Aid you know that should contribute to peace should be brought into to be discussed on the table by the donors and Israelis I mean because there is donors fatigue now many donors now they're tired from seeing their money being wasted in every eruption of conflict or a circle of violence in the pal in in occupied Palestine so there has to be a discussion on this now I mean especially in the future of Gaza after this war ends Don should be very blunt about it and say we will invest we will of course support Palestinians to recover uh but there has to be conditions this time it's not going to be free Aid especially to the Israel is Israel going to be forced to pay though I mean who who's going to who's going to force Israel to pay if it's decided that isra Israel should should be paying well here we talk about the just the just World a just International System I mean if the if Iraq had to pay for Kuwait as you've mentioned exactly and if if if the idea of uh SE using seized Russian assets Frozen Russian assets to Al to to rebuild Ukraine then we have a president that it should continue this way you know correct but it needs International will are Western countries main Western countries ready to use this on Israel or not I I'm not sure to be honest but I I if if we live in a just World it should happen Israel should be accountable not only for the destruction also for human losses all these civilians who have lost their wives they they have to be compensated for the I was going to ask you about you talked about personal ownership as well a lot of a lot of the property that's been that's been destroyed was was personally owned privately owned this is not businesses or or organizations I mean even if they could have got insurance in in Gaza it wouldn't have paid out because this is an act of War so surely people need to be compensated for their individual loss it's not just of of of property but for for lives lost as well yes yes exactly exactly I mean there's for just I mean just for your viewers to know there's no insurance in Gaza I mean insurance is not a scheme implemented in Gaza or gazans know about so same like in other countries in the world so these are people I mean who psychologically they have to suffer for the the loss of their loved ones their houses their properties their means of income uh so so yes we so I mean I mean I mean it's hard to me even to talk about financially compensation people who have lost their loved ones I mean money will not bring the the The Lost Ones back to life correct I mean but at least that's the least donors should do at least to to to to to try to help them to get back to to their lives also and you talked about donors U footing the bill for some of the of of the Reconstruction costs but but donors are not really going to be willing to to to invest to put more money to in into Gaza if 's a danger of this happening again so that there has to be a political solution alongside a financial one yes Adrian and this is an excellent point I mean uh yes I mean it it would be another waste of resources and energy if if if money comes in a fragile context again now but doesn't mean that that donors should stop intervening now I'm all in I'm all in for humanitarian Aid to kick in now and to be even to be upscaled humanitarian Aid which is necessary to keep people alive it's water food food shelter clothes name it I mean so this is a must you cannot leave people alone in this situation once this war is over and it again and this is a big question because we don't know everyone is talking about a future arrangements to this to govern Gaza or Gaza after the war we don't know what's going to happen what's the political outcome of this war meaning if Hamas is still going to be in power or not it will step down and leave another entity beat a technocrat government or government run by the be by the palestin authority rule Gaza we don't know I mean there are so many scenarios that are being discussed but but but but we don't know which scenario will be the feasible one the most feasible one because the war is not over yet so however if we reach to a scenario where let's say Hamas is not involved in governing Gaza uh this will be a relief for many Western donors who have uh refused or who have been very shy of supporting Palestinians because of hamas's control of let's say governance governance institutions correct uh other donors like let's say Arab donors Muslim donors they don't have any conditions they support any projects so let's say if if if if if if a ministerial building is is damaged now or was was bombed during this war some Arab donors will say I can rebuild it I have no problems even if it's run by Hamas or will be run by Hamas but then European donors Western donors will say no no no this is a noo for me if I'm going to build this and it will be used by officially by Hamas authorities they will say no this is a nog go for me I'll just focus on humanitarian Aid then we'll end up with the situation of fragmenting Aid and this will not go well for the Palestinians because after this war and the large scale of Destruction we need a systematic comprehensive reconstruction plan that really tackles everything together and it's not about just reconstructing what have been uh bombed or damaged it's about creating a sustainable future for Gaza which means Israeli Israeli uh control measures you know blockades uh have to be also addressed I mean Israel cannot keep its control over the borders and also its control over let's say the Reconstruction process by delaying materials vetting materials vetting beneficiaries of of of Aid you know because Israel has a famous history of doing this delaying these construction materials so we need a sense of normality so it's about creating a sustainable future of Gaza not just addressing the immediate outcomes of for but also creating an environment for Gaza to be a normal country a normal strip like any other countries in the world that's that's the issue T great to talk to you on counting the cost my pleasure many thanks toed for being with us my pleasure my pleasure now in Germany rules limit how much debt the government can take on the Constitution camps budget deficits at 0.35% of GDP except in an extreme emergency the so-called debt break was enacted in 2009 and was meant to stabilize public finances after the global financial crisis but a strict interpretation of the rule by the nation's top Court struck down billions of dollars in planned spending sparking a budget crisis now calls are growing to abandon the borrowing limits as Dominic Kane reports from Berlin this is how Germany's finance ministry tries to explain its schen bmza or debt break governments can't borrow much more than a third of 1% of GDP each year except in extreme emergencies in theory the Manor ministers is pretty simple live within your means in practice it's proved anything but it was Angela Merle's government that enshrined the debt break into law during the credit crunch they felt it necessary to Anchor something in the Constitution that put a debt break on spending to show responsibility and of course uh Germany has always sort of wagged a finger at other countries in the EU that um overspent um you know and broke EU you debt rules but now the finger is being wagged at the government here in Berlin because when Finance Minister Christian lintner tried to use unspent money borrowed to fight covid to finance climate change policies the Supreme Court in khu ruled that to be unconstitutional leaving a multi-billion dollar hole in this year's budget and causing consternation in capital markets German budgetary policy is a bit like satirical reality it is important that we get back on reliable ground relatively quickly it is unacceptable that one of the largest industrialized Nation allows itself to pursue a budgetary policy that is constitutionally questionable the political effect of the khua ruling is also profound something Olaf Shotz himself acknowledged in Parliament this ruling creates a new reality for the federal government and for all current and future federal and state governments a reality however that makes it more difficult to achieve important and widely shared goals for our country having improvised a solution for 2023 ministers are now having to work out next year's budget and the remote possibility of a $220 billion shortfall which could mean the need to slash spending there might be some cuts for benefits for the Richer people in the society that could be one way out and that would um then they would also have some smaller budget cuts for the poorer households in Germany one analyst says behind closed doors political leaders here believe the law should be made more suitable to today's realities many politicians agree that we need a change of that clause or an integration of this investment Clause into the into the debt uh break or maybe even get rid of it and come up with something new which is more appropriate to solve uh the the challenges uh we are facing in Germany but to do that the coalition government will need the help of the main opposition party in both houses of Parliament and so far at least its leader seems to favor new elections over new laws Dominic Kain for counting the cost Berlin China is Saudi Arabia's top trading partner and the largest buyer of its oil trade between the two Nations amounted to more than $6 billion in 2022 their relationship broadened last year leaders of the Nations signed a comprehensive strategic partnership during a visit by the Chinese leader xiin ping to Riad the agreement worth billions of dollars included collaboration on infrastructure projects and technology and was hailed by Beijing as an Epoch making milestone in the development of Chinese Arab relations the two Nations have recently moved to strengthen Financial cooperation 2 they've signed a local currency swap agreement worth nearly $7 billion which will be valid for 3 years and could be extended several countries in the Middle East signed similar agreements with China over the past decade including Qatar the United Arab Emirates and Egypt Beijing is believed to have the largest network of currency swaps with at least 40 countries well currency swaps are agreements whereby central banks lend and borrow each other's currencies on a specified date they then exchange the money back at an agreed interest rate China's swaps are seen as part of of its push to internationalize the Yuan Global Central Banks tapped a record amount of the Chinese currency in foreign exchange swaps lines in the first quarter of the year the outstanding balance of all foreign currency swaps was more than $15 billion by the end of March that's according to the People's Bank of China the jump came after a growing number of countries moved to settle their trade with China in local currencies in a bid to reduce their Reliance on the US dollar the green Bank Remains the most traded currency by far but its share of foreign reserves the amount of dollars that countries put by for a rainy day has declined to a record low of 58% last year by comparison China's Yuan stands at less than 3% the Chinese currency is still behind the Euro the Japanese Yen and the British pound well joining us here in Doha is while mm who is the financial Market strategist lead at the global multi-asset brokerage group exes good to have you with us while $7 billion is a huge amount to the likes of you and I and anyone watching but in global economy terms it's a relatively small amount so how significant is this currency swap Arrangement between China and Saudi Arabia um thank you Adrien for the invite first uh actually it's uh quite good for a start since uh we know like China is looking forward to expand its presence in the in the region and uh of course Saudi and the uh the economy recently it's been performing well for the past few years since Co and there's a lot of plans for expansion and the vision for 2030 so definitely it's a good uh um it's a good arrangement uh going forward as as you mentioned it's a three years Arrangement and could be even but but who's it better for you say that saud's economy is is on the rise China's at the moment is in is in is in a spot of bother isn't it actually both of them would benefit and a certain uh certain thresholds so for example if we take into consideration for Saudi the the export of Saudi Arabia towards China they've been increasing at a pace of at least 133% for the past years every year and this is something very uh uh crucial to have such an arrangement on the other side China is looking to secure its energy uh uh supplies and and we know that China is a top importer for for Saudi energy uh so so this is definitely this definitely plays a vital role in order to expand this relation it started with it it it could expand to other sectors there's a lot of uh opportunities we know that Chinese economy is the second in the world they're trying to expand they're trying to recover as much from covid and of course Saudi Arabia could find a lot of opportunities in the Chinese economy while also through the vision of 2030 through the belt and uh uh the belt and Road initiatives also China is looking for more strong Partners like Saudi Arabia so what are the implications of this this this new found relationship between the two countries for the rest of us for the rest of actually like having more of these two relationships it's uh it's better for the global economy because this would facilitate trade and it also would make it easier to do more uh Investments and this would create opportunity so of course having uh such uh such Arrangements is good for the for the economy and if we see a lot of these Arrangements happening you mentioned that China has at least the network of 40 countries with these arrangements so this is also facilitating business more and more and this should play a good role in expanding the role of the Chinese economy and the global economy and uh this would in turn come back to good opportunities and what does this currency swap a arangement and others like it with China mean for the US dollar the green Bank actually a lot of uh a lot of parties are excited about what do we call dollarization what we heard about it recently a lot on the media however we're still a little bit far away from that if we just look at some figures still the US uh dollar reserves are around 59% of global reserves of central banks still the trade uh uh uh funded by the dollar were around 84% this year yes China's such Arrangement that China is doing with a lot of counterparties are increasing its role and the internal internationalization of the Yuan however was still very far away from just reaching where the dollar is at the moment okay so Saudi Arabia expected to join the the bricks nations in in in early in 2024 what what do you make of that is that a natural fit for Saudi Arabia actually it's uh it's a good uh it's a good step because bricks are looking to especially if you look at India and China they're looking to secure their energy supplies and this is one second there's a lot of uh chances for uh for for these parties to uh contribute to the perform to better performance of each other we know recently everyone is looking to expand their their economy especially postco and all these we're looking at China we're looking at India and even with the plans that Saudi Arabia has for a vision 2030 it needs such good uh strategic members that could help in the prosperity of the Kingdom's economy do you think we could ever see Saudi oil sold EX in Yuan uh it's um like like the Chinese were were asking for that and you mentioned the the Chinese president was in ch in Saudi Arabia last year and he also stressed on that however it's still not that easy this currency swap agreement is starting for non oil trades it could in the future turn into that but going into that way it needs a lot of geopolitical Assessments but could you ever see see the day in is it is it in the distant future will it ever happen or the the near future where by a currency like the Yuan would replace the dollar as the preferred International currency of of Last Resorts it could happen but not in the foreseeable future it could takes years and decades for for a currency to replace the dollar because of of many factors however yes after the the crisis that we've seen in Europe uh a lot of countries are looking to reduce the Reliance and dependency on the US dollar and and these initiatives they are part of this uh uh winding of the dependency and Reliance however just going into a a currency that would replace the dollar at the moment and the foreseeable future it's a bit hard well it's been really good to talk to you on counted the cost same year I I think I understood all that as well so thanks for explaining it so well to us many thanks indeed pleas pleasure thank you and that's our
