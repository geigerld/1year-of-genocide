Israel has not only violated the principles and the provisions of international law but has actually and literally bummed international law Israel over the last two months have done something much more damaging to our Humanity not just to our sanity taking Center Stage today is hosam zlut palestine's ambassador to the United Kingdom before his posting to the UK Ambassador zlet was head of the PLO mission to the United States in this episode he reflects on the war in Gaza the double standards it exposed the road to peace and responds to questions about Palestinian leadership thank you so much for joining me on stage Ambassador hosam zlet you've spoken a lot about how this war is exposed an alarming double standard when it comes to Western media coverage when it comes to the fairness and the application and the enforcement of international law and I wondered whether you could tell me perhaps share with us one moment during the last two months where you've seen that double standard reveal itself to you where it's really hit home there were many many moments but the one constant theme of all those is the double standards down the line it's a constant it's not just a oneoff double standard media ators politicians they would even fail to recognize that Israel is violating international law most of the questions are leading questions and the idea is practically speaking to box you uh uh in a defensive corner and to make you lose before you start the moment they tell you do you condemn then you are the accused and that question has many other presumptions one of which you the Palestinian people are the instigators of violence and what is much more dangerous than all that is the level of racism because most of these interviews that I have conducted as an example before me would be the Israeli Ambassador and given that Israel has committed way more atrocities and crimes failing to ask the same question means and that's why I referred to it as racism anti- Palestinian racism anti-muslim racism so not asking Israeli officials to condemn the much more documented crimes against humanity and asking us means that they would want us to acknowledge and accept that our lives matter less with all the history complications before October 7th have you seen it as an opportunity to Enlighten people to win people over because we have seen a shift I'm sure you degree on the Streets of London the us all over the world there are many reasons for it one of which is the atrocious murderous unhuman uh uh uh attacks by the Israeli air strikes and the images that have shocked shocked to the very core Humanity second reason in my opinion is you the youth and I see a room full of people and the activism that came from Palestine our youngsters and Arab Muslim International white black cross community activism I was reading some uh statistics on uh Tik Tok uh uh the one hashtag got uh uh something like 37 billion which is free Palestine 37 billion uh uh so there was a revolution using the new alternative platforms media social media media media has been responsible for defiling the Palestinian cause desecrating the Palestinian struggle and on the other hand legitimizing giving some sort of a cover moral legal political cover for Israeli crimes for the people of the world it is no longer just about Palestine and they have followed that Israel has not only violated the principles and the provisions of international law but has actually and literally bombed international law they have bombed the UN premises the UN buildings all these people see that Israel is also corrupting their own achievements and societies like liberal democracies that Israel is dragging the West into its immoral orbit of wars that their own rights the right to of expression the right to assemble the right to protest the right to speak have been threatened it's like in the UK you have the Home Secretary calling our marches marches of hate wanting to ban them so people of the world seeing the effect on them they are also seeing that Israel over the last two months have done something much more damaging to our Humanity not just to our sanity which is the normalization of the mass murder of children of families the mass destruction of homes the question a lot of people are asking is why isn't anything being done about this and you mentioned the United Nations there's a lot of criticism against the United Nations at the moment as a body and I wonder the PLO fought for so long to get a seat at the table the PLO believed in this institution that the Palestinians could have a voice there you were ambassador to the UN for a long time do you still believe that that that having a seat at the UN pays off for Palestinians oh yes absolutely the actual starting point of the Palestine cause issue question was in 1917 when Britain where I am serving now as an ambassador issued the Belford declaration that belfer declaration represented the the colonial arrogance at the time they have promised our land my land without any consultation to another society that were not even in the land to European Jews we the natives who have lived there for thousands of years the card of civilizations The Hub between Ean the birthplace of Christianity and at the time 1917 we were 98% of the population and owned 96% of the land and we were turned into non-jewish what does it mean non-jewish minorities it means that they denied us our people's hood that we are not a people we are just non-jewish minorities we are not Palestinians that time to the time when we force our Collective presence when we snatch our recognition from the jaws of colonialism and arrogance and racism and Hony is not a small achievement it took our people Decades of struggle and that's why it's it's brutal to start history from the seventh of October history began in 1917 and our people have been in a constant state of struggle and revolutions and intifadas so we have a seat in the UN the US blocked our ability to become a full member state but we are a state in the UN the US also last week voted against a resolution to implement humanitarian ceasefire what does that tell you about the ability of the UN to get anything done tells me bad news and good news the bad news is that the US remains to be uh uh completely off balance completely employing domestic Politics on global issues Israel in the US is not a foreign policy issue Israel in the US is a domestic issue and once the issue is domestic forget it your foreign policy would become extremely problematic it will be based on shortterm narrow political C calculations for politicians rather than for the state do do you think that's a major reason why there is so much inaction when it comes to this war because it is a domestic issue in the US yes it's a major part and in the US there is a disproportionate power for interest groups of course but it goes beyond that it is now proven Beyond doubt that the us alone cannot play the role of mediator it is an opportunity to bring an end to the US Monopoly over the peace process that has led us to where we are it is an opportunity to bring other major key international players on the table and turn peacemaking into a multilateral uh approach rather than the Monopoly uh and the Soul mediation that the US has been insisting over for 30 years and has failed to deliver let's talk about the world after the war so many Palestinians want to know Ambassador what is the plan for Gaza after the bombs fall silent and the rockets stop Flying there is no plan for Gaza there is a plan for Palestine Gaza is an integral beloved part of Palestine and uh uh any plan has to include Jerusalem the West Bank and Gaza in one integral Geographic and political and National Arena this two-state solution I don't like the term two-state solution because it assumes that there are no States and we have to create two states there is already one state and that state is occupying the other area uh I'd like to say we must end the occupation uh end Israel's occupation establish a state of Palestine on the 1967 borders with Jerusalem as our capital and implement the right of return for our refugees this is a sacred right because it is our homes I'm one of them that uh uh as much as there is collective claim to our homes there is a private claim this is private property uh so yeah these are our demands primarily the Palestinian people in Gaza in Jerusalem in the West Bank in the diaspora inside the green line need to see their rights fulfilled how do we get there though because right now as things stand no one sees the hope no one sees the feasibility of implementing a two-state solution no one sees the feasibility of Peace actually and when I speak to Palestinians with all due respect they don't see Vision they don't see leadership either from the Palestinian side and we can put to one side the role that Israel and the us has played in this because many people in this room can see that and can agree on that but what do you say to Young Palestinians who for instance say why not be bolder why not call for new elections now why not bring in as you would agree all the Bright Young Palestinian Minds that are fully capable of ushering us into peace recently I said maybe we are not the greatest nation on Earth but I don't think there is any nation that is greater than us and that has been proven by Deeds not words if the amount of pressure that has been put on us for the last 75 years non-stop from the nakba until the nakba has been exercised with any other people I don't know what would have happened to them but because we are rooted rooted in history and in identity such a nation would achieve peace such a nation would find a way to survive that's number one and we have survived and such a such a nation will in in the end enforce its will we are much closer to that than what our enemies want us to believe much closer one thing is saying it Mr Ambassador and the other thing is seeing the feasibility of it you know from the conversations I'm having people don't see it right now why not start now why not try something new make a collective effort to draw out a path forward we do the Palestinian people have their way to flip the table and they always have the way to take things in the Direction They believe it should be the Palestinian people have a way when they when they measure the temperature and know when things is R too so don't worry look at all other issues conflicts revolutions struggles look at South Africa it took more than 300 years it also took a Mandela yeah it but okay of but we we have yes but we have 300 we have 13 million mandelas and there is a we we we do we do every Palestinian mother that has been able to deal with this horrific unprecedented catastrophe in Gaza still caring for her mother is a Mandela every Palestinian teacher that's still able to bring in our kids the best is a Mandela how on Earth did we survive this that's a good question how did we survive this how did we survive the greatest power of the time Britain conspiring against us how did we survive France delivering uh uh the uh the nuclear weapon to Israel how did we survive since then America providing every single ability for Israel to commit its crimes and to Shield Israel from any political or legal how did we survive all this on our own that's the question that is the question and I tell you we survived it because we as a nation are united people talk about divisions divisions are between political parties but the people of Palestine are united and the people of Palestine have their legitimate political system that is the PLO the Palestine Liberation Organization which they have fought to achieve we have one flag one flag and that flag the the uh white red green and black these four colors have become the symbol of global anti-oppression have become the symbol of the fight for justice worldwide people do not wave the flag only because it's a Palestinian flag it has become their flag you know the Palestinian kfia has become the the symbol for the global youth for resilience huh for challenging the status quo for the change they seek so you tell me we are weak we are uh desperate no we are not weak we are being oppressed repressed killed our homes are being destroyed but we are not failing I want to wrap on a more personal note here um we're seeing Israeli forces close in on hunis moving into the southern part of Gaza tens of thousands of people are being packed into places like Rafa um where kids are grieving they're having to start their lives over they're starving and they're living in tents you yourself Mr Ambassador were born in a refugee camp in Rafa if you could speak to a Palestinian boy a young Palestinian boy who's there right now and he asked you Mr zlet what happens next what would you tell him I don't have a crystal ball but I'll tell him you belong to a very special and great nation I'll tell him that uh he must be part of that Journey I'll tell him he should be proud of his ancestors of his parents and grandparents uh I'll tell him that love is way more important than hate uh that he has to have or she has to have so much love for their people and their country you know the one thing that makes Palestinians Palestinians is that we really love our I love our people that's that's the key thing and I I think there will be a huge challenge after the latest aggression uh uh on Gaza to make sure that it's not hate that will take over its love and I'll tell him what what really makes us so resilient is not the investment in our in our physical capital but in our human capital yes I was born in a refugee camp uh in RAF I am the son of the so the people who raised me were the actual people who were forced out their homes in 1948 my grandparents and my parents and I remember very well living the most perfect life you can imagine for child why because we had such a strong sense of community togetherness why because we have Collective shared memory why because we know what connect us is one the what connect us and unite us is the fact of our oppression we are all oppressed wherever we are in Gaza in Jerusalem in Khal in Nablus in in in in the diaspora and the refugee camps and what connect us is our Collective goal you asked me about Nelson Mandela about every single Palestinian I answered you is a Nelson Mandela because the heroism I have been following only the stories of Palestinian doctors and nurses in Gaza you cannot imagine this has never they have given a new level of nobelity to the profession of medicine [Applause] [Music] they in other words you would tell that little boy it's all going to be okay okay I'll tell that boy uh it will it will be okay but it will take him and his generation to pick from where we ended and to keep the March the March might be slow the March might be full with feeling of betrayals sometimes I must admit we may feel alone but we are definitely definitely on our way Mr Ambassador thank you so much
