hi I'm Unice s I'm still in Gaza City with my family yesterday we got a lot of warning calls and a lot of Def Flats like these that were dropped on us in our neighborhood in our street here and they basically say that uh being in Gaza or remaining in Gaza City uh puts our lives in danger we're taking a tour in the streets of Gaza just very close to my street here in my neighborhood and everything looks so empty you could barely see people in the streets this area used to be a very densely populated area Okay Dr Mansour I believe this is your house just opposite to uh the bombardment that we can see in Al Abbas uh post off uh police office and the mosque why did you decide to come back after you went South everything is uh under the war under the Rockets so where we are going to decide to go north or th it doesn't matter where it is and now this is the bakery where you can see people are standing in a line to actually be able to buy some bread this has been the situation for so long in Gaza thousands of families have been instantly displaced it's just full of rubble and debris everywhere you can literally just see despair in Gaza City now and in Gaza streets all over the strip [Music] actually you could just hear the sound of drones and Israeli war jets in the skies of Gaza while everyone says everyone feels but there's no safe place in this trip to be in anymore
