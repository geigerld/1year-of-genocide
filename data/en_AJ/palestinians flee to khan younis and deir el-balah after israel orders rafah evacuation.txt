the announcement of the potential deal came just hours after Israel ordered at least 100,000 Palestinians to leave Rafa many of those who now find themselves displaced yet again are heading towards K Yunis and albala but those two cities have already been almost completely destroyed in alh reports from KH Yunis on what those people are now facing I'm currently standing on Ben sua's roundabout inun and as you see hundreds of Palestinians are currently evacuating from rafah after the Israeli forces ordered them to evacuate earlier today people were ordered by the Israeli forces to evacuate to kanun the masasi area and also to Der balah in central Gaza but as you see behind meun is completely destroyed Palestinians have been telling us that they have been displaced multiple times they are bored of being displaced from one place to another and they also do not trust the Israeli forces and the Israeli Army because they have been telling them since the first day that Rafa was a safe area but as you see behind me all of these people are evacuating from Rafa people are desperate there's a panic State anger Despair and frustration rage and and also fear that they there is no place safe in the gods of CH all of these people have no idea where they're going because it's bah and the central area is also packed we're talking about un hos un facilities hospitals schools even empty agricultural lands are now tents and hundreds of thousands of people settled there this placed multiple times from a place to another from Central to the South Palestinians are left in Despair and fear not knowing where to go where no place in the Gaza Strip is safe this is hind Al jaunes Gaza Palestine Alexandra say is the head of humanitarian policy and advocacy with save the children International she joins us now from Washington DC welcome to the program how alarmed are you by this escalating Israeli bombardment now well we're extremely alarmed by reports of intensify intensifying Israeli bombardment Ina particularly around the crossing point and we have been warning for months how catastrophic an expanded incursion into Raa will be not only do we now fear Mass civilian casualties but potentially the complete collapse of the humanitarian Aid response in Gaza which has already struggled to keep the population alive if uh the bombardment around Rafa continues and if we see a closure of the crossing point which has been the primary land route used by the a agencies to move uh assistance into Gaza um you know there will be almost no Aid uh coming into Gaza no other crossing point to date has managed to replace Rafa not K Shalom and not Aras which is still not fully operational and so if we continue seeing what we're seeing it'll lead to an even more catastrophic situation we will likely see um uh an acceleration in the rates of starvation even more people will die of malnutrition dehydration and disease and a lack of medical assistance Israel has talked about so-called safe zones but in reality is anywhere in Gaza safe nowhere in Gaza is safe and we're extremely alarmed by the new relocation orders that were issued by Israel to more than 100,000 people in in Raa earlier today there are hundreds of children who are maimed who have lost one or more of their limbs um many children who um are malnourished they're suffering from chronic uh illnesses uh diseases um illnesses like cancer uh elderly who are weak who are starved these people cannot flee by foot to another area the relocation orders that were issued um do not offer any safety and the humanit the so-called humanitarian Zone that they were uh told to go to is not humanitarian these areas do not offer the services that are needed to survive and again no area in Gaza so far has proven to be safe time and time again families have been told to flee and then they are attacked where they are told to flee to and not withstanding of course the design master that this is for civilians how difficult is it for Aid workers to operate now well we've seen time and time again Aid workers um being killed in Gaza more than 250 Aid workers so far the majority Palestinian have been killed over the last seven months we have not seen any guarantee of safety for Aid workers or civilians and again an is an Israeli expanded Israeli incursion into daa where the Hub of the humanitarian response sits right now is going to spell an even more catastrophic situation possibly the darkest and deadliest chapter of this crisis to date Alexandra say we'll leave it there from save the children International thank you very much indeed for joining us here on aler thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
