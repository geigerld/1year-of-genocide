the United Nations top court has ordered Israel to prevent destruction in Gaza yet its military is Raising entire neighborhoods to the ground large wavs of the strip have become uninhabitable so what would it take for Israel to stop its War this is Inside hello welcome to the program I Hashim Israel's war has laid waste to the Gaza Strip 85% of the population has been displaced much of the vital infrastructure is so badly damaged the experts say it will take decades to rebuild a ruling by the international court of justice States Israel must take action to prevent the destruction of evidence linked to possible acts of genocide but the military has largely ignored this and if anything has intensified its bombing campaign what can be done to force Israel to comply let's take a closer look at the extent of the damage in Gaza according to satellite images assessments by International Aid agencies and figures from the Gaza government office more than half of all homes in the strip have been damaged since October the 7th education facilities have also been targeted 346 schools have been partially or completely destroyed and every single university has been raised 269 places of worship churches and mosqu alike have been damaged 11 bakeries are destroyed and throughout the territory only five hospitals are still able to offer treatment and only basic first aid there's plenty to discuss with our guest but first this report Gaza has become unrecognizable homes businesses schools mosques churches all raised to the ground I'm standing on the rubble of a house that was destroyed by the Israelis the situation is very difficult we tried to construct a tent just so we had some shelter the international court of justice has ordered Israel to take steps to prevent the destruction of and preserve evidence related to any possible acts of genocide but its military campaign has only intensified since the ruling the war on Gaza has been described as one of the most destructive assaults in modern history virtually no corner of the strip is Untouched by Israeli bombs All That Remains is dust and Rubble we went to the school and set up a makeshift shelter but even the school isn't a school anymore how are we going to survive there are no hospitals no medicines we can't afford to take care of our children Al jazer has tracked the extent of the damage on buildings from October When The War Began until the end of January they show more than half of all buildings have been destroyed reports estimate that as much as 70% of gaza's homes are deemed to be unlivable of the strip's 35 hospitals five are only partly functioning just one specialist facility is still operating so now it's literally literally the only Hospital which can provide a neurosurgery to Gaz people the only H which can provide complex general surgery or ICU care in the whole of Gaza the UN warns it could take decades to rebuild Gaza and is calling for hostilities to end immediately Veronica Pedroza Al jazer for Inside Story let's bring in our guest in the he Ahmed Abu is a legal researcher and advocacy officer at alhak an independent Palestinian human rights organization based in raal in Amsterdam Kate McIntosh is the executive director of the University of California Los Angeles promise Institute Europe she was involved in the development of international criminal law in its early years and contributed to defining many of its elements here in DHA we have Muhammad abua professor at the School of International Service in International Peace and conflict resolution at American University in Washington DC welcome to the program Ahmed we've been over the last few days talking about the different aspects of the six orders that were uh issued by the international court of justice and weather Israel was in compliance with those orders today we would put more emphasis on the uh destruction of evidence and on this I would like to ask you a question what kind of evidence was the court having in mind um I think the court had in mind uh all kind of uh evidence U Hashim and allow me um just to clarify um uh in relation to our work as alhak we the oldest human rights organization in Palestine and in the region and this is the first time in our history since our establishment in 1979 that we had to announce to the public that we're unable to cover to cover the situation in the Gaza STP properly this gives you an indication of the gravity of the situation on the ground some of our staff had to evacuate the north uh lost their homes lost their loved ones and it's becoming extremely difficult to document what's going on uh on the ground if history teaches us something uh during every genocide that happened throughout history the perpetrators of international crimes in general always try to destroy evidence that will uh uh condemn them in the future Israel is also doing that um the very fact that Palestinian human rights organizations are unable to continue uh doing their work on the ground is a serious uh concern uh should be a serious concern to all International Justice mechanisms I think the court was absolutely right to indicate that and I think the uh concern is shared not only by South Africa but by a number of states uh just before uh starting the show it was announced by South Africa that yesterday South Africa has asked the court to consider um um as on on an urgent pis uh to uh make a ruling asking Israel to comply with the um uh with the provision measures uh ruling and the court can do that and accordance with article 75 paragraph one of the rules of procedure of the international court of justice in cases where the court ordered an order of provisional measures and fears that this order is not being complied with it can as we say in Latin propor Moto based on its own initiative the court can order uh the state to comply uh with this order and I think we're heading towards that uh the concerns are being shared by South Africa and other states and I think the court has a responsib ability to make sure that Israel respects the order of the Court Kate when you see that provisional measure by the icj which says that Israel has to take all necessary measures within its capacity to pre preserve evidence people would say what what is the icga trying to achieve here when normal people in Gaza would tell you look just by having a look at the Relentless bombardment the massive loss of life shouldn't that be enough for the icj yeah there's a certain Force to that Hashem for sure but we should remember remember first of all that genocide is a very difficult crime to prove and the scale of the destruction does not in itself uh establish genocide there's that critical element which we've all heard discussed of the special genocidal intent so when the court comes to decide to consider the full proceedings P these initial provisional measures they will be looking to see whether that special intent is present and that special intent can be inferred from but it's a very high threshold it actually has to be the only possible inference so there will be a lot of other evidence that will be very relevant to that we could think about um internal records of government or Army meetings and we could also think about the sthe of digital evidence which is becoming more and more relevant in proceedings whether from private uh Facebook social media accounts or otherwise so there's all sorts of evidence that um will be relevant to this request and in establishing whether or not this is a genocide the court will be looking beyond the physical destruction which as you say is so obvious to all of us Muhammad activists on the ground have been documenting cases of bombardment Destruction schools hospitals churches mosques 4,000 of history of Gaza couldn't this be couldn't this be a case to be prosecuted or be it at an individual base by the IC for example in the near future thank you I think in absolutely the the the scale of Destruction as you mentioned whether it is mosques hospitals the school on relief agencies and and the entire infrastructure there is no agency or organizations on theground that has not been affected and I think the scale of Destruction as mentioned by Kate and also by Ahmed before is different definitely um provide enough evidence and enough um things on the ground to be a base for for cases genocide definitely ethnic cleansing and we see that we see that not only prior to the ruling of 26 of January but also after the the numbers after are also staggering you have about 2,000 Palestinian killed since then and you have also 3,000 injured as well these are these are the minimal number that were referred another Statistics we have it is regarding the houses that were demolished and destroyed over 44 squares of houses which is you know amount to hundreds of houses have been deliberately demolished and destroyed and bombed since 20 since 26 but add to this the issue of starvation the issue of water clean water and something that not many people talking about it which is the pumping of water sea water in the in the tunnels that Israel been doing for for the past few months that have a major effect on the livelihood and also the capacity to inhabit Gaza afterward so you know it's it's really mind bugling when people talk about you know more evidence of intentionality but I guess as Kate said the threshold is very high and I think there have been enough reason for that at this point Ahmed we do understand this is an extremely delicate case and this explains why the the court has been trying to do its best to navigate through the entire procedure and look for the most practical measures to be implemented but the measures when you look at them and when you read them in detail do they really make any sort of sense for the people of Gaza who have to walk daily through the areas that now lie in ruin and whose basic instinct is just to survive for another extra day um you know the the way the uh provision measures are um uh drafted and and decided is not necessarily that it it doesn't live up to uh to the gravity of the situation in my view I think there have been um serious inding genous uh attempts by certain states to downplay the effect of these provision measures so we had the representative of the us at the security Council saying let's uh talk about what the or the court did not order ceas fire and this is quite a shameful and disingenuous attempt because the court in such situations does not order e se's fire um the similar situation to that is that of Myanmar where the court did not order Cession of hostilities but it it orders immediately uh uh stopping the genocidal act so if you look at the provision measures if Israel wants to implement them they effectively mean EC's fire now I totally understand that it's hard to sell that to people on the ground I'm originally from Gaza I lived through and survived three of those military aggressions on the Gaza STP and I know how people uh feel but it's important to clarify for the public that the fact that the provision measures did not order cessation of hostilities it does it doesn't mean that they were not uh good enough I think effectively this means cessation of hostilities my only reservation on the provision measures um I think would be uh twofold one the um uh giving Israel a whole month to comply with the order I think it was a long period considering the serious risk of genocide that we're facing and the fact that the court did not order Israel to allow fact finding missions in previous cases the court has relied on the reports of fact finding missions and commission of inquiries to establish genocide so the big question for the court is if the court saw a plausible cause for genocide why it gave a whole month for Israel to comply and why it didn't order Israel to allow fact finding missions to access to the territory and the big question now the most important question now is um with South Africa's refer to the court that Israel is not complying and the court need to intervene what will the court do the court has the authority to uh um Step In in such situations because Israel is ignoring its provision measures and making a mcy not only of the Court's ruling but of international L as a whole Kate if by the end of this month lawyers from South Africa go back to the icj and say listen we gave the Israelis you gave the Israelis a month and within that month the Relentless bombardment continued property was destroyed entire areas were raised people lost their lives this is a strong indication that uh Israel uh was in breach of that provisional measure would that resonate among the judges judges well the question for the judges will be what to do at that point um I mean I personally and I I get the sense listening to Ahmed that he would agree I felt that the the court uh you know retained its Integrity with this ruling I think they went about as far as they can go I would agree with Ahmed that to order a cessation of hostilities was not uh you know that would have been a stretch really under the genocide convention they did order what they could order which was don't commit genocide and let in humanitarian relief etc etc so I think it was a strong order um the court itself does not have any enforcement capability of course it's a consensus-based mechanism which was set up essentially after the second world war war to prevent further conflict so that courts would um resolve their disputes there rather than uh going to war so the only part the only body of the United Nations that has authority to carry out any enforcement action is the security Council and of course the Security Council is fairly unlikely to act in this matter due to the um the veto Powers as we know Muhammad you you've spent quite some time on the politics of reconstruction in different parts of the world I would like to ask you a question about Gaza once the war is over once this is all over experts are saying it will take Gaza decades to rebuild do you think it's going to be a purely technical issue or a p purely politically motivated issue the Reconstruction of Gaza I think that's a great point because I think it also connect to the previous point that Kate and Ahmed mentioned you know even if the best case scenario where the the court were reissued and ask for ceasefire cessation of hostility after you know after the uh month is over we have a problem in the implementation and in the execution um mechanism of such orders we basically come back to the political realm where the security Council and the the the US using the veto in order to prevent and the implementation and I think that is one of the core political issue that has been an obstacle an obstruction for many many resolutions in the United Nation over 70 of them that has been vetoed so the problem is always have been political rather than legal or rather than any other any other justification on the same issue on the on the Reconstruction and the rebuilding of Gaza Gaza has been destroyed different scales in 2014 you know in four other Wars in Gaza and it's always have been the the politics of it the military the military control of Israel on those borders the mechanism that they put in place for implementation and to what extent gazan themselves and Palestinian themselves have a decision in in the process of rebuilding we know from the theory and the practice the the more the more the rebuilding mechanisms are imposed by the the the the again in this case Israel or the United States or other countries the less likelihood that this rebuilding will take place in the benefit or for the benefit of the Palestinian national movement or for the people on the ground not only issues of accountability and Corruption and other but also you know we do rebuilding in order not to go back and Destroy them after five or 10 years and I think that's where the problem is you want to rebuild the life and the infrastructure but more important you want to rebuild on the basis of a political Vision a political agreement a political condition that will prevent a another war in five six years and another control of Israel Over the borders wouldn't be extremely delicate for all the parties Ahmed to move forward without a road map when it comes to the Reconstruction because for example the Americans the Israelis and the Europeans there's a general consensus in the Western Hemisphere that Hamas should have no say in the future and this explains why the they say that the palestin authority has to take over Gaza anytime soon how do you see reconstruction of Gaza when you don't settle who is going to take over and who should have a legitimate right over Gaza yeah first of all answering this question allow me to to to say that it's only for the Palestinians themselves to decide who govern which part of the occupied palan territory it's not for the Americans it's not for Western governments it's only for the Palestinians through a democratic process through elections notably Israel has been preventing the Palestinians from having elections in these Jerusalem and that's the only reason that we don't have a democratic uh process the big questions for W allies of Israel if they're so uh um supportive of democracies and want to see a de Democratic process why for the past years they didn't pressure their Ally in the Middle East to allow the Palestinians to have elections uh this is this I think need to be clarified at the outset and the second thing is you're absolutely right um several people still waiting to rebuild their homes that were destroyed in 2014 for example or even uh back in 2012 or 2008 2009 so this is a one of the most important issues that need to be discussed the Gaza that we know the Gaza that I grow up in no longer exists the North End of the Gaza Strip has been destroyed I was in California last month testifying in a case against President Biden Secretary of State blinkin and Secretary of Defense Austin where I testify to that effect that everything we know in Gaza has been destroyed from my kindergarten to my university and this is also if you allow me to touch on something um Kate said uh of course genocide is hard to prove of course the threshold is very high but the level of Destruction that we see in Gaza the intentional uh attacks against hospitals schools these are all serious uh signs of the intention to ethnically cleanse the Palestinians to destroy them in hall or in park because in every armed conflict um hospitals are the main point where uh it gives uh the civilian population the feeling that there's safety where they can receive Medical Aid and Medical Care Israel has been deliberately targeting hospitals from the north to the south in a in a clear plan to push the Palestinians to create conditions to induce them to leave uh uh to Sinai and this is not new plan zionists have uh often spoke about the Gaza Strip and the Gaza population as a demographic burden uh Kate never before had any War been so documented the way the war in Gaza has been documented by media and by activists on the ground to the to the point where people now are drawing parallels between what happened in Gaza and what happened long time ago in the German city of Dresden now from your own previous experiences postum rights field operations in Rwanda and and Bosnia what do you think will be the biggest challenge facing the people of Gaza once this this is all over oh my goodness what's this going to look like once it's all over um I think the Gaza is really a unique situation I mean every situation is unique but uh the situation in Yugoslavia and in Rwanda was quite different in terms of a certain Clarity emerged of who was going to be in charge and who would be organizing the Reconstruction and then there was of course massive support from the International Community in both of those two situations where here we have this very fundamental political issue which is unresolved um if I could go back to your earlier part about the volume of the evidence though as well um seeing as we're discussing that particular order of the court I think the volume of digital evidence is both um a great you know is a blessing to investigators and prosecutors but also you know a significant Challenge and this isn't the only conflict of course which has been faced with this I think the most anal situation might be Syria where there is an huge digital archive which is being managed at least the management is been coordinated by the independent investigative mechanism which was set up um for Syria um by the United Nations uh and you know they're making great steps in trying to understand how to search and to categorize uh this huge wealth of digital evidence uh in order to identify particular individuals and particular locations and and I think just from the technical perspective that's clearly going to be uh very relevant to how um judges prosecuted investigators are going to be able to deal with the wealth of digital evidence that we're all seeing coming from Gaza Muhammad as you know the politices of reconstruction is complex to the point where now the Americans behind closed doors are asking countries wealthy countries in the GCC for example to step in and provide financial assistance to the Reconstruction effort some of those countries are voicing concerns saying we have to wait and see who takes over Gaza to do that you have to ask the Palestinians what what what's the next what's the way forward but before that others are trying to bring the Hamas and the Palestinian Authority to negotiate a political settlement all this just with the hope to move forward and restart the Reconstruction how do you see that process unfold in the near future is it aible does it make perfect sense to the Palestinians themselves well I think that's you know that's like like Ahmed said this is the the the thinking today and also based on our knowledge of post reconstruction in a postconflict situation the more the more inclusion and the more the political agreement that will be reached or the outcome of the war the more it takes into consideration the needs and the aspiration of the people who were involved in the resistance whether it is in mindo Philippine whether it is Sri Lanka whether it is Bosnia the the more you do inclusive agreement and take into consideration the voices of Palestinian and even follow the the rash you know nothing nothing about us without us the more you can secure and prevent the next War so it all depends on what type of intention and the political willing willingness they will have for a palestin genuine Palestinian State genuine Authority in place that will give the Palestinian their National Liberation um aspiration and I think that's the core issue even if you decide on genocide or you don't decide and genocide at the end of the day you have a 100,000 people killed and injured and there need to be a political agreement that allow the Palestinian to have their self-determination and dignity Ahmed in less than 15 seconds will Gaza will Gaza ever be the same again Gaza will always Prevail Gaza will always Prevail despite the oppression despite the destruction and the people of Gaza are teaching all of us a lesson how to hold on to our humanity and Gaza is our window to the reality of this world that we don't live in a postcolonial world but unfortunately we live in a neocolonial and an imperial one and Gaza is spearheading uh resisting that uh uh domination formula lady and gentlemen I really appreciate in your Insight looking forward to see how this whole case at the icj will unfold in the near future Kate McIntosh Ahmed Abu and Muhammad Abu thank thank
