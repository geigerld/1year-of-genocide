renewed Israeli bombardment of Gaza after the ceasefire ended is worsening the humanitarian crisis the US wants Israel to do more to protect Palestinian civilians what's the military's strategy and can Israel learn from the intelligence failures that led to hamas's October attack this is Inside hello there and a warm welcome to the program I'm Jonah Hall Israel has one of the most advanced and well equipped militaries in the world and yet on October the 7th Hamas Fighters breached the Gaza border fence infiltrated Southern Israel and killed more than 1100 People Israel responded by declaring war on Hamas its bomb campaign has raised much of the Gaza Strip to the ground and killed more than 15,000 Palestinians many in the International Community have condemned the offensive as disproportionate after a brief ceasefire the bombardment has resumed and appears to be expanding into the densely populated southern part of the Gaza Strip what is the Israeli military's end game a year ago senior government officials reportedly dismissed intelligence pointing to an impending attack by Hamas so who will be held accountable for the unheeded warnings and what will it take for the Israeli government to call its operation in Gaza a success will'll delve into all this in a moment but first this report from Finton Monahan the attack by Hamas on Southern Israel in October the 7th killed more than 1100 people it's widely seen as a major failure of Israeli intelligence a report in the New York Times suggests senior military and intelligence officials were aware of what Hamas was planning more than a year ago but ignored the warning signs the Revelation is piling more pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he was widely criticized at home for not publicly apologizing for the security failure that led to the Hamas offensive something his security Chiefs did in the immediate aftermath of the October attack his ratings have plunged and he's faced repeated calls to step down Israel has lost faith in the Prime Minister we cannot allow ourselves to conduct an extended war with a prime minister that the public does not trust many analysts say netanyahu's political future depends on how he handles the war on Gaza so far Israeli forces have killed more than 15,000 Palestinians most of them women and children despite this Netanyahu has reiterated that the objective in Gaza is to wipe out Hamas we swore and I swore to eliminate Hamas nothing will stop us we will continue this war until we achieve the three goals to release all our abductees to eliminate Hamas completely and to ensure that Gaza will never again face such a threat but these goals seem incompatible with any kind of push for a permanent ceasefire the polls and hostilities in Gaza lasted just a week Israel and Ally the United States were quick to blame Hamas it's also important to understand why the pause came to an end um it came to an end because of Hamas Hamas renegon commitments had made while Hamas says Israel never intended to extend the ceasefire Beyond seven days the Zionist regime Was preparing to start its genocide and War again on Gaza and its people yesterday we were in meetings to extend the truth and we offered many proposals the Israelis didn't want any of it CER and and the USA negotiations are continuing for further humanitarian pauses and exchanges of captives Israel says Hamas is still holding 137 people in Gaza but with the Israeli government seemingly intent on making up for its own failures on October the 7th is there political will for anything more than a temporary truce Venton monan for Inside [Music] Story okay let's bring in our guests in Tel Aviv Orin ziv is a journalist and photographer at plus 972 magazine an independent Israeli online news platform in Sydney we've got Anthony Lowenstein author of The Palestine laboratory a book about Israel's arms and surveillance industry and here in the Qatari capital is Omar ashur a professor of security and Military studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies and a warm welcome to you all Anthony lonstein I'd like to start with you and this New York Times reporting that uh a year beforehand Israel acquired plans detailing an attack very similar to the one that actually took place in fact there were hints of just such an attack dating all the way back to 2016 but that a senior Military Intelligence officer rebuffed the plans because he believed Hamas simply didn't have the capacity so it wasn't that they didn't know know this was going to happen it was that they didn't believe it was possible I think that's correct I mean obviously like any report at the moment we have to take everything with a slight degree of Sal not that the New York Times report might be wrong but there's so much we still don't know one of the things that I discovered in my reporting over the years before October 7th from my book but certainly since is that Israel I think over the years like the us in many ways has believed that technology technology on its own surveillance Tech on its own will keep them safe this belief somehow the 2.3 Palestinians in Gaza would be docile would essentially accept their imprisonment and yes it does appear that Hamas was making plans in fact I've been reading reports that there were many Israelis on the Israeli side of the Gaza border who had seen Hamas militants rehearsing something and they were reporting back that to the Israeli officials and they essentially were ignored including many Israeli women and they were dismissed I think which sort of goes to the heart I think often of a very patriarchal society in many parts of the Israeli intellig in terms of the New York Times reporting the analyst who signaled the greatest sense of threat was also a woman yes and I think from what I understand this is based on my reporting before October 7 but in general Israel of course Prides itself on being gender balanced and very openly um to women and people of color and also for that matter of gay soldiers but the the truth is that when it comes to these kinds of issues it seems that the messages were being ignored because they believed wrongly and fatally that somehow sophisticated repressive Tech which they then export around the world would protect them which of course believes in the end that Israel had this belief and frankly many Israelis it wasn't just the intelligence it was Israeli public for years has believed that you could imprison people literally down the road from where they're living and somehow be safe which of course is not true so in the end this was less a failure of intelligence the intelligence in fact looks pretty good but more a failure of judgment a failure of judgment but also political hubris that Israel has believed for decades and me to longest occupation in modern times at the West Bank and Gaza of course is under siege for close to 20 years by Egypt and Israel that somehow people would accept that now none of that justifies what Hamas did on October 7 by any means but it certainly puts it in context that there was this deluded belief and also this idea somehow that you could have surveillance technology repressive Tech groans and also huge amounts of Palestinians who were um being who spying for Israel we don't know the exact number in G including Hamas members that somehow that would keep Israelis safe and it's a delusion to believe that orang Z let me bring you in on the way all of this is likely to be viewed in Israel uh because presumably this reporting will be repeated uh in Israeli outlets and what do you think the public will make of all this because of course they will know that something terrible went wrong they will know that they were failed by the supposedly impregnable Military Intelligence apparatus but this is incendiary just to remind you of what has been reported here the this 40-page document called Jericho wall including plans for a barrage of rockets at the outset of an attack drones to knock out the security cameras and Automated machine guns along the border and gunmen to pour into Israel on mass in paragliders on motorcycles and on foot all of which actually happened while the government was looking the other way yes I think inside israelit ongoing discussion we've seen a few reports in Israeli mainstream media of the intelligence as anthonyy mentioned brought from the border from the young female Soldier serving as observers on the border and we seeing a training of Hamas in the last months or year and they even mentioned that at some point H from what they saw they understood the training has ended because they saw senior commanders that they haven't seen before coming to kind of a ending ceremony or event and they were passing the signals uh to more senior officers that uh at some point even told them to stop harassing them and that this is imaginary so I think in general all the Israeli public across the political Spectrum Spectrum in Israel couldn't imagine such an attack because people thought the Army would have the intelligence and as we see it wasn't only a problem of intelligence but also of understanding when this might happen like having a specific Intelligence on the weeks or months this could take place now people across the isra Republic are now busy with u is it essentially the wrong moment for this sort of discourse to happen I mean people are Society is so focused now on the captives uh it appears to be very much behind the war in Gaza perhaps in in search of Retribution for what has happened or to make some sense of it is it is it perhaps not yet the time to be discussing who is to blame blame or will this reporting start that debate so this is debate debate is happening specifically in the the public that was protesting against Netanyahu and overall his government his extreme government was promoting before October 7 and it seems that a lot of the public is feeling that netan will delay the war and extend the war because he knows him and his government know that in the minute the war of officially ends of course on the Israeli side on the Gaza side it will take years or decades to to to repair the damage but on the Israeli side if Netanyahu officially ends the war protest will start in days immediately H and this is why many people fear here in Israel that netan will push on the war and would want an endless operation because he know as you said the chief of staff the head of of Chinet and other officials already took responsibility and kind of they didn't say it officially but it's quite clear they will resign When The War officially ends on the Israeli side at the heart of this failure of judgment this failure of intelligence or military interpretation if you like uh is a determination apparently on the part of the military and of ministers in the government that Hamas simply lacked the capacity it's been described as aspirational totally imaginative these plans that emerged and crucially that Hamas lacked the intention as well Gaza was quiet the problem seemed contained how on Earth was Hamas able so successfully to mask its ability and its intent and ensure that Israel continued to look the other way so first on the on the Israeli side I I have to say like I'm not defending unit 82 sou 8200 or or or anything like that but um this yeah intelligence unit did the assessment yeah so it happened like okay to Pearl Harbor the Americans fired the first shot you know they they sunk the the an assault Japanese submarine and they were still surprised how did Hamas manage to essentially pull the wall over Tel aviv's eyes you can design it but I can sit down here and design a perfect uh textbook breach operation and this is coming to to to your to your question so you can well the breaching fundamentals Hamas can you still hear me yes yes go on we can hear you fine yeah the uh the breaching fundamentals Hamas executed a textbook like and I'm not talking you know I'm talking NATO grade like SRA suppress obse secure secure reduce assault they executed it like the textbook multi-domain operation um um with an Airborne Dimension with a ground Dimension with a naval Dimension with a cyber Dimension which is not that much in the media but I I assume it will it will be it will appear with an electronic warfare Dimension and with an intelligence Dimension so it was it executed it as a perfect operation if you so you can do this on paper but then uh to actually do it in reality the amount of planning training Logistics uh men um mun weapon systems then this is the issue and I think this is this was the the the uh the main failure on the on the Israeli side is they they they they saw this as a plan on paper which is great you can get a textbook on how to create a perfect Ambush and um and or or in that case a large scale beaching operation um and then you know and and then leave it on the paper but then the what how Hamas did that I think that was a a very very long process of um preparation I think some of the documents that were captured goes go back to October uh 2022 um the the issuing of of orders u in terms of training so we were talking about a year but probably there was another year of reaching this level so we're talking probably about two years of preparation um we're we're talking about because the the the it was a Hamas Elite for example it was a regimen siiz formation so we're talking about in the range of 1,000 uh Fighters those were the almost tier one NATO grade um you know Fighters uh if you looked at the rest behind them every single mistake in the Infantry book was done was was committed in a way so the the level of training is very so I guess they focused all the resources on a particular they were doing all of that they were doing all of that essentially in plain sight under the glare of int Israeli intelligence and with politicians in Israel believing that Hamas wanted to get visas work visas to be able to work inside Israeli territory that Hamas did not want War uh all of which or and Z leaves as you were saying there prime minister Netanyahu looking intensely vulnerable when the dust of war settles uh here to what extent do you think and you were alluding to it there that pursuing this war is for Prim Minister Netanyahu individually an attempt at putting off the inevitable the inevitable moment uh when public opinion turns against him when he loses his job and possibly worse first of all it's important to mention that in netan and the more extreme parts of his government H until a week ago that the agreement uh was signed a hostages hostages prisoner deal was signed exactly eight days ago it seems that his government has gave up on the hostages and only the public pressure the protest of the hostages families and tens of thousands of Israelis going to the street despite the the sirens and the rockets that were fired from time to time into Center Israel the protest and the actions of the families and their supporters LED this government to agree to this deal because we heard netan saying a few times that eliminating Hamas and we can talk about this target later and returning the hostages is equally important and according to different reports we've seen that already in the first days of the war Hamas offered a deal of the Israeli and the Israeli children and women in exchange of the female Palestinian prisoner 30 something Palestinian prisoners and the Palestinian minors in Israeli prisons and the government rejected this deal open a war to satisfy the sense of Revenge in the Israeli public and to show they're doing something and after a month on the Israel media Israeli media figures and the government is claiming that the military efforts ER allow this deal to happen in better conditions to Israel which I disagree so I think already we seeing the the public pressure helping here to achieve this deal and the government to to agree to ceasefire under the condition to renew the war this is something SM and and Ben and other minister demanded that the ceasefire will not be too long in their opinion and I think now slowly we will see bigger parts of the public going to protest directly against n we already seen some of the people some of the families of the victims killed and murder on October seven protesting in front of the parliament we've seen a small protests in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem but I believe as as this go on and more people in the public will realize that the net is really not setting goals to this war you know talking generally about eliminating Hamas but not talking how to do it and more importantly not talking what will happen on the day after in Gaza we've seen y laid had of the opposition Israel publishing a document today talking about the day after in Gaza talking about International interference there and other points but more important he's saying netan is not offering anything and it's quite clear that under his extreme government no solution is acceptable than maybe just settling and staying Gaza as some of the ministers and and other right-wing Parliament members declared well well speaking of the day after and speaking of clear goals I mean one of them is to protect Israel from any future threat from Gaza Anthony lonstein bombing Gaza to to the ground doesn't achieve that does it uh there need to be other ways intelligence driven uh and led methods of protecting Israel from whatever threat it perceives to exist in Gaza Beyond this War I think that's right and it's interesting I note in the last 24 hours in har the Israeli newspaper there were comments that many of the Arab states who publicly have been very critical of Israel and of course many of them in the last years have signed So-Cal normalization deals with Israel are saying privately according to this report that in fact they'd be happy for Hamas to be militarily defeated assuming that's even possible because they regard Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood as a threat to themselves in their own countries wherever it may be in the Arab world look ultimately there is no military solution here Israel has currently destroyed the northern part of Gaza they seem to be moving into destroying the southern part and of course that can only lead to one conclusion which is that the idea ultimately is to make it uninhabitable for the vast majority of Palestinians there and I see in the last 24 hours more reports in the Israeli press talking about how elements within netanyahu's government their Vision if you can call it that is that is to have as few Palestinians as possible left at the end of this doesn't mean they're going to kill all of them it just means that to potentially find ways to remove them Egypt Jordan Lebanon now those Nations the moment have not accepted the idea of taking in Palestinians in sort of Quasi 10 cities that has not happened yet despite the fact that I know Israel has attempted to bribe is Egypt in huge amounts of money to take in lots of Palestinians in the SI in fact a report in the last 24 hours suggests Israel even imagined trying to get Palestinians out of Gaza via sea in the Mediterranean I mean kind of crazy ideas in a way but that's the vision here if you can call it that there is no vision or beyond what the US is pushing which is a Palestinian Authority which is deeply corrupt and unpopular in the West Bank I mean there is no solution here without actually engaging Palestinians and Israelis in dialogue which so far no one serious seems to want to do indeed outlandish ideas Omar asure what do you imagine represents victory for Israel in Gaza when will enough be enough well it's uh it's the objective uh for them that declared as well is to destroy the to destroy Hamas basically you know militarily and politically and if that objective is um there's a lot of civilians that are going to uh be killed um um to to get to that objective uh they will consider them collateral damage they will not really um stop at that point unless there's like significant uh political iCal pressure from the International Community from the US specifically and from others um but but the objective is degrade and Destroy Hamas uh probably also take over Gaza City I don't know what it's it's unclear to me the end game I don't I don't think it's clear for the for the isra government you know the the the end game is there a big question this notion of destroying Hamas and I'll throw this to you or if this notion of destroying Hamas uh I mean on the face of it looks fanciful in the sense that what struck me this week in the release of Palestinian prisoners on the occupied West Bank was the number of Hamas flags that were flying the number of prisoners and prisoners families who thanked quote the resistance meaning Hamas the idea that there are thousands of Orphans uh in Gaza now who will grow up with hatred resentment and revenge in their hearts the idea of getting rid of Hamas M seems outright fanciful does that idea penetrate at all in Israel I think this idea of eliminating Hamas at least in Gaza is something that a vast majority of the Israeli public agree on if and it's because it's something that is promoted by the media and politicians from all the political Spectrum Without Really explaining that ideology it's not something that is so easy to to eliminate and specifically not mentioning that Israeli government and specifically benam Nan was strengthening Hamas Through The Years by because it was as as they themselves said it was good for them that Hamas is ruling Gaza and gives them a reason not to to push further to and it was an excuse not to to promote any political or diplomatic solution and separate between the West Bank and Hamas as you said by releasing the prisoner I'm not sure this is done intentionally of course Kamas is gaining a lot of power in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem we're seeing people thanking them of course I saw it personally being in East Jerusalem last week with the prisoners released and as the civilian death toll escalates again I want to ask you each very briefly what you think will make this stop Anthony Lowenstein will it be when Israel feels it has reasserted itself as a power to be feared and that's what their intention is the only thing that can stop this is America it really is as simple as that and of course at the moment America has no intention of doing so but the only Power that can do so is Biden getting on the phone and stopping this no other international power can do that and I fear that that is not on the agenda at the moment despite the need for it to happen because America is still sending weapons to Israel as we speak including bunker busting bombs so this is America on the one hand talks about bringing some kind of reduction in civilian casualties that's the public message where privately they're sending many more weapons which is what really matters in the end tragically R and ziv will it be when Israeli public opinion decides that enough killing of civilians in Gaza is enough and that this is one man's war and needs to end he the Israeli public is not really looking on what's happening in Gaza there really mainstream media is not really bringing the images the interviews the the things we see on your Channel and other International channels so the public is not really aware to the amount of Destruction and Devastation in Gaza unfortunately not yet Perhaps and and and they're not aware of all the the international reactions to that and unfortunately I'm saying it very sadly I think for the Israeli public with the sense of re revenge and sadness and with the the statements for politician nothing will be enough so I I think as Anthony said this is about International pressure and not about the isra public no space then for for for the suffering of gazin I understand I'm sorry we've got to move on omaru finally last word to you will it be when Hamas gives up it could be if uh we don't know how much is left in hamas's arsenal of men weapons and Munitions uh and tunnels we but we know it's Gaza is under siege under double Siege one from around Gaza and one around the North and probably there will be a third one around Gaza City so we we it could be but it also could be if if as my colleagues said International pressures on one end uh change in the public opinion on the other that affects the decision makers uh determination but also the the the casualties you know Israel is very sensitive to casualties and we're talking now about a fig figures that exceed 15 years of war in South Lebanon 1985 to 2000 Israel lost about 300 soldiers and now we're north of uh 360 um also casualties the wounded the PS the the missing the the the deserters and so on so these all these all are out of uh the combat area okay we'll have to wrap it up there many thanks for your thoughts let me thank all of my guests for a spirited discussion or ziv in Tel Aviv Antony lene in Sydney and Omar
