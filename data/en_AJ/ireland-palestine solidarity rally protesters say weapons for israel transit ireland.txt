now a group of activists has been protesting near an international airport in Western Ireland which they say is being used to transport weapons to Israel Shannon Airport is regularly used by the US Air Force as a stopover for carrying military personnel and Equipment across the Atlantic the demonstrators say the planes need to be more thoroughly checked for Israel bound arms okay let's speak to Zoe laa who's the chairperson of the Ireland Palestine solidarity campaign she joins us now from Shannon in Ireland a very warm welcome to you so the Irish government has been very very vocal in its support for the Palestinians recently of course recognizing Palestinian statehood but when it comes to the use of shann and Airport though you believe there are serious shortfalls what are you particularly angry about well for years we've called for an end to the US military use of Shannon Airport um in any circumstance um we've also called for inspection of the planes that go through Shannon Airport because we don't know what's on them and the Irish government takes the US uh government say so that there are no there's no Weaponry on the planes um but especially since the Israel's genocide in Gaza um and the US is an active um participant in this genocide uh so we want primarily the US military out of Shannon H but at the very least the very minimum we want the Irish government government be inspecting the planes I'm just struggling to understand how we Square what's coming out of the mouths of the t-shock in Dublin speaking openly and solidarity the PO of the Palestinians and and what's happening at at Shannon Airport I mean does this amount to double standards oh absolutely and it's not just Shannon I mean the Irish government um talks a good game and they make strong statements and um Simon Harris or tiak has repeatedly said you know we must use every lever at our dis proposal to ensure ceasefire and uh to stop the genocide but in fact the Irish government is not taking um practical action uh to sanction Israel um it's blocking legislation that we have that would go some way to holding Israel accountable such as the um occupied territories Bill the illegal Israeli settlements divestment bill and the arms embargo Bill uh we continue to trade with Israel and the US military uses Shannon Airport and then recently we've had uh reports of multiple um planes flying um Weaponry through Irish airspace uh to Israel uh so yes it is a complete double standard and that's of the key demands of the Ireland Palestine solidarity campaign and also the huge uh mobilizations in Ireland is for Action from our government Zoe let's talk about practical steps what do you want to see happen specifically at Shannon Airport uh specifically we want the planes inspected as a very minimum um we want but we want the US military H not to be using the airport like it's a civilian airport um it's a small airport and it has been used by the US military for 20 plus years um and even Amnesty International has said there was probable rendition of people through Shannon Airport uh over the years so really uh Ireland is a supposedly neutral country um the majority of people in Ireland don't want Shannon Airport used uh by uh the US Military and especially now uh in this genocide uh you mentioned Ireland of course being a neutral country as it has been for many many years I mean what is it though however about Irish American relations that means Irish political parties of most colors have allowed this continue to continue over the years what's the political and the financial incentive well I guess on a political level I mean we certainly know that H it's very high priority um High cache I suppose for Irish um government um members uh to visit the White House on St Patrick's Day um despite our calls for years that they should never uh do that um I they talk about us Finance or investment in Ireland and that this is a barrier towards taking action but really I I think that's just an excuse um because I think industry does what's profitable regardless of the political uh context that they're operating in um and I think some of it is just just wanting to you know that kind of being a bit beholden to us interests and wanting to be seen the similar with how we behave in the EU H wanting to be seen as you know the Best in Class H and not really to rock the boat and we want the opposite we want the Irish government to you know put its money where its mouth is and like actually back up the words that they H are uttering all right zo laa really interesting hearing your thoughts on all that zo laa there chairperson of the Ireland Palestine solidarity campaign many thanks thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
