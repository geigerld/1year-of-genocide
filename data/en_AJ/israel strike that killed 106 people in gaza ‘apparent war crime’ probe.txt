now Human Rights Watch investigation has analyzed one of the single deadliest Israeli air strikes since the War Began it says 106 civilians were killed in October in what appears to be a war crime among the victims were at least 54 children Israel hit a residential building south of the noat refugee camp on October 31st but the report founds no evidence of a military Target in the vicinity it also concluded that governments should suspend arm sales and deliveries to Israel Let's uh speak to Tar Abu aam about this he's our correspondent in Rafa Southern Gaza remind us a tar of this uh attack in nerit in October and uh the circumstances around it which led to this conclusion by Human Rights Watch yes FY according to the uh investigation that has been carried out by the Human Rights Watch it has concluded that a six story apartment building has been completely destroyed and that deadly Israeli air strike had killed at least 106 Palestinians including 54 children as this building has been husting evacuees and also the uh owners of this uh house that had been completely targeted as the were children playing uh uh on on thegr there uh as also there are some residents are charging the phones in the house that belongs to one of the Palestinian Engineers that had been uh completely destroyed Roy and now that's absolutely terrifying as the Human Rights Watch had had carried out multiple interviews uh with uh eyewitnesses there on the ground who have been survived from the attack saying that the entire building has been destroyed and targeted without any prior warning and uh clearly the investigation has also finalized that there was no any military Target in the building in order to be destroyed as the Israeli military turn now did not provide any justification regarding this deadly attack and that's absolutely a part of the ongoing military attacks that had been carried out since October specifically that Israel has been attacking houses without warning its citizens to uh its residents to flee from in order to avoid casualties among civilians despite the Israeli repeated statements and claims that they are taking ultimate precautions in order to avoid uh casualties among civilians and as everyone knows that Israel has a long track records of crimes or in times of War specifically that we have been uh observing since the outbreak of this conflict multiple incidents in which Israel had targeted civilians with high rates among with high rates of casualties specifically that the latest was at the latest had been carried out on napuli and an Al Kuwait roundabout for eight Seekers one of the also deadli air strikes had been carried out earlier in the war in Arab hospitals and also we remember clearly the air strikes that had targeted jabalia refugee camp where the is the Israeli military has been widely uh increasing and surging their military bombardment across the Gaza Strip with no lit up till now fly and T the The Fallout continues from the attack on the world Central Kitchen AIDS workers how has it affected Aid delivery and Aid distribution in Gaza yes uh in fact the world Central Kitchen uh this charitable organization has been operating in Gaza since uh the outbreak of the of the fighting here in the territory as they have been responsible for Distributing aid for uh hundreds of thousands of Palestinian families as according to latest reports that they have managed to distribute around more than 40 million meals uh on people in the South and even in the northern part after making various coordination with the Israeli military but the latest attack in fact has been carried out as Israel has been justifying it to be a completely a grave mistake and that was was completely unacceptable from the uh uh from the side of this charitable organization and that intern had forced the this organization to completely suspend its operations in Gaza which negatively had impacted on the humanitarian situation which is already aggravating as it has been a wide uh class of the Palestinian Community till now did not receive the latest shipment that had been transferred throughout the recently established Maritime Corridor which means that more people won't be able to receive their aid and that happens in fact after the Israeli military had denied the deliveries of Aid to by the United Nations to people in the Norther part of the Gaza Strip which means that it's a systematic approach being adopted by the Israeli military in order to starving people in the northern part of Gaza to push them forward to the South where people here are not also receiving much needed humanitarian supplies and the high ratees of population being right now trapped in Rafa this city which is might be expected to be the next Target for the Israeli military incursion if the negotiations regarding a ceas fire collapsed thank you for the update that's Al jazer Sark Abu AUM reporting their life from Rafa in southern Gaza
