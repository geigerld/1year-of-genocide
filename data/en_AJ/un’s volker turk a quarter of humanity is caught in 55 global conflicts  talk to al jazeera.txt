world human rights the Cornerstone of equality and fairness are universally recognized principles to which every individual is entitled that's regardless of nationality gender ethnicity religion language or any other status the universal Declaration of Human Rights a landmark document adopted by the United Nations in 1948 said out a fundamental and Universal standard for these inalienable rights since its Inception the UN has been at the forfront of advocating for monitoring and enforcing these rights through an array of treaties International laws and humanitarian initiatives however a different story unfolds in some parts of our world despite the un's watch the Spectre of human rights violations hauns the most vulnerable in Conflict ridden areas like Ukraine Sudan and Gaza Tales of appalling suffering are emerging where the rights to life safety and basic needs are not just infringed but often defiled and shattered and the Advent of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and the escalating climate change crisis also present unprecedented challenges to Human Rights so is their need to re-evaluate the human rights framework to address the pressing concern the UN High Commissioner for human rights fulka Turk talks to Al jazer un High Commissioner for human rights fulka hook thank you for talking to aljazera to begin with a lot of conflict in the world at this time but let's start right away with what is happening in Gaza and the occupied West Bank and Israel's actions there which its critics contend is a massive abrogation of Human Rights well we are seeing an unmitigated tragedy um we see very grave violations of international humanitarian law um we also seeing the fact that humanitarian action in the way that it's normally supposed to be done is not possible in the way that people would respond to the suffering to the massive suffering of Palestinians especially in in Gaza we have now over 1.2 million people just in in Rafa uh so you it's getting winter it's getting cold so you can imagine what this means and we don't have enough food to to take to them we don't have the water that is necessary we don't have the medicine that is necessary and this well and the West Bank we we have seen a rapid deterioration we have over 7 271 Palestinians killed 69 children among them since the 7th of October and of course let's not forget we need also so we have seen the trauma in Israel we have seen what happened there and so I see in front of us a situation of of horror for all communities now some within the Israeli government contend that when Hamas launched that attack on October the 7th some of its targets including women and children it did not obey laws of war or laws of humanitarian uh action they argue that because of that it's okay for Israel not to obey such stringent restrictions either what's your view of that argument so what we saw happen on the seventh and the eth uh of October is absolutely horrific and it's unacceptable but I mean it doesn't absolve Israel of its responsibility to respect International humanitarian law and international human rights law you cannot otherwise it becomes revenge and Vengeance and and that never leads to a result that is good for for any community and I mean that's also the promise of of Human Rights the promise is to apply human rights equally to everyone and and that's what we have to ensure at this very very tragic moment in the history of the Middle East now some I argue that the situation is compounded by the US supply of weapons to Israel in carrying out these operations now the US for the record says that it only provides weapons to those countries that are in and I quote them full compliance with International Humanity Arian law and the laws of war but clearly on the face of it Israel is not in accordance with these principles look I mean it's clear that all parties who have any influence over in this case Israel Over Hamas need to exercise their influence to get them back to reason and to get them back to a situation where international law is respected and we are not at this space at this at this point point in time and we the US argument is that that's got to be done through interaction that it doesn't want to use sanction to force the parties together that it would rather use its relationship with Israel to bring about this end is that a workable well we see increasingly a narrative that points out the importance of respect for international humanitarian law and let's also not forget we have the whole International Community you saw what happened the general assembly passed the resolution calling for humanitarian ceasefire which by the way is what all of us have been doing for quite a long time and that really is the only solution we need to see an end to this violence and we need to see a humanitarian ceasefire human rights ceasefire because it's also ultimately about the human rights of of all of all of both Palestinians and Israelis and we need to see an end to this nothing good comes out of violence and but here you have the intractable problem us veto in in the security Council the US vote against a ceasefire in uh the general assembly this is a major stumbling block is it not it absolutely is and you saw what the Secretary General did um not long ago he actually used one paragraph one article of the UN Charter to put member states and in particular the security Council in front of its responsibilities by invoking article 99 now some have pointed out the language being used by some members of the Israeli government you've had reference to gaza's nakba which is in reference to the catastrophe of 1948 when millions of Palestinians were displaced or killed you had reference to Palestinians in the most derogatory of terms now some are arguing that this conveys an intent to displace or remove the Palestinian people which in turn is one of the qualifications for a genocide would you go so far as to see that happening I mean I'm very worried about dehumanizing language I'm very worried about the type of statements that we have seen both on the part of Hamas but also on the part of some political and military leaders in Israel and I have made these concerns extremely well known because they are I mean as we always see in so many situations around the world they give us great cause to worry and they could indicate a risk of atrocity CRI indeed now let's move to the other point of conflict uh the Russian invasion of Ukraine now President Biden is on the record as describing that as a genocide your view look I mean Ukraine is again we have seen an a war that has been going on for almost two years with a devastating toll on the civilian population with over we could verify at least over 10,000 people being killed civilian infrastructure structure massively damaged over almost a thousand education facilities destroyed 400 over 400 hospitals being uh damaged and of course massive human rights violations so as and with the onset of well we have already we are not even in the onset of winter we are in winter very very cve humanitarian situation so it's clear that the world needs to wake up and bring us back to we have over 55 conflict around the world one quarter of humanity lives in a situation of conflict of violence but the world also appears to exist on double standards in many cases the US uh would vote against the Russian invasion of Ukraine it will veto any resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza these situations are pretty similar does this type of dual action or duplicity as they may put it undermine your attempts as your body to be able to forge some form of lasting respect for humanitarian law look what member states are doing has always been in their own logic uh and has always been what what they do my mandate is an independent one and my mandate applies itself to each and every country and to each and every situation and we apply it in in the way that we that we see fit uh um what I think we need to also bear in mind that despite the negative news I I've just come out of a high level event in Geneva where we commemorated did not celebrate we commemorated the 75th anniversary of the United of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and I was encouraged by the fact that over 155 member states pledged very conrete measures to advance human rights we got five countries saying that they would abolish the death penalty we have 50 4 countries who who said that they would review their legislation to from a gender equality uh perspective to remove a discriminatory Provisions we have uh 14 that said they would establish a national human rights institution we have uh 10 that now want to strengthen accountability measure so we also see this and I think it's important despite the negativity and the somber moment that we are in that there there is also progress and there is there are countries there are leaders there are people especially young people who care about human rights and who want the right thing to happen every time one situation appears for a moment to be ameliorated another one breaks out you've got a war underway in Sudan for example for the last few months to what extent does this prevalence of action like the war in Sudan coming on top of everything else how difficult does that make your job in terms of getting that needed respect for human rights look Sudan I it was the first country I visited when I became High Commissioner and I visited it because I was so impressed by Young People by women who stood up in 2019 to overthrow 30 years of military dictatorship and I wanted to go there myself and see and speak to them and they just had a year earlier another coup so I had a chance to speak to them to speak to young people to speak to the the resistance committees and I was so I was so encouraged by their Spirit of of determination of perseverance and then a couple of months later when we all thought that there would be a civilian transition these two guys decided to wage war against each other and it's the worst situation since 56 for the people of Sudan and we don't see any sign of deescalation at the moment and I can only hope that both aloran and HTI see that a military solution is not in their own interest and I hope that accountability will be served because we have seen very grave violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law and it drags down the people of the whole country now you're talking about two leaders who fought a war against a dictator together who promised to return to civilian rule together now they are opposed to each other this is just another example of how easily good intentions can get totally disrupted one of the missing pieces was accountability in Sudan and so again if we don't see accountability if we see that impunity is just accepted we have a problem we see this in many conflict situations so another big lesson learned is first of all take human rights more seriously but not just within the national context were also within the international context heat the early warning signs but then also take accountability more seriously and and we have seen examples where it has worked you know we had the establishment of the international CRI criminal Tribunal for for oslavia international criminal Tribunal for Rwanda now the international criminal uh Court the IC but it's not enough we need much more of it especially in situations where you where you where people have have gone into conflict and transitional Justice truth find the truth telling and accountability are key let's take the issue of accountability shortly before you took over uh your predecessor issued a report condemning Chinese treatment of the Wagers in the western Province uh and that was a damming report and it stated very clearly that China is responsible for crimes against Humanity now what accountability has there been there for China's treatment of the Wagers I have been very clear about the human rights situation in China and I have because that's also part of my job I have engaged with them and I hope that this engagement will lead to changes and we have an upcoming Universal periodic review which is within the human rights system a peer review among member states and I hope that we can really build on that and that we can see changes that are necessary once again that that report said as I said uh crimes against humanity but genocide was not mentioned is this a conscious decision not to take that LE it didn't by the way it did not the report did not say that crimes against humanity were committed they said there is a risk maybe maybe correct it could amount too but it didn't uh it didn't specifically say that um look when we do our analysis we do it on the basis of the facts that we have assembled we have a very rigorous methodology and we do that wherever we work and so when we say something we we are yeah we use this on the basis of the analysis that my office has has has been able to conduct just a slight sideways movement one of the issues with human rights is new digital Technologies is now using the example of China once again there are reports that facial recognition uh software is being used which can identify the race of those being examined now this as well is reportedly being used in Israel against Palestinians the same technology how much of a human rights contravention is the use of Technology like this in for example identifying race look when it comes to generative artificial intelligence it's a big human rights concern but first of all let's also say the positive again artificial intell generative AI will help us a lot to overcome some of the problems science or more generally does and Technology but we need human rights guardrails and if there's one lesson to be learned from the social media platforms is that these guardrails had not been put into place early enough because what we see on social media platforms if it's not regulated if if if if the guarders are not there you see the spread of this harmful disinformation you see the spread of hate speech and and incitement to violence and we have many examples of that and so what we need is especially for the development of of generative so that it doesn't lead to facial recognition and racial profiling and and the marginalization of already uh groups at risk that these guardrails are built in and that's a very strong message that comes from the UN you saw the Secretary General has just uh established an ad an advisory repard on artificial intelligence and also our my own office wants to provide that knowledge to the tech companies and we have started and we have actually had for quite some time now a dialogue with with bch companies um precisely to ensure that they understand that human rights apply when they develop these things and there's again a question of accountability at some stage that needs to be asked tissue here is that the UN can say this is what needs to be done but it is a nation state like China that puts in those guard roles into the technology that it is using or Israel's case with using face recognition technology to what extent do you have the power to not only advise nation states but also ensure that they follow through on what the advice is well that's the problem of international law more generally because we don't have the enforcement power the only thing we can do is use the fact that we have the Human Rights Council the fact that we have treaty bodies we have binding legal obligations and that we can only continue to point out these obligations uh analyze it document it report it and well and then see which mechanisms picks it up so that it actually gets gets done and I have to say you know also looking ahead we have 70 elections coming up next year 4 billion people will will will will go into elections 4 billion people what I'm worried about is the potential of harmful disinformation on social media platforms and it's also a responsibility of the business companies because we also know that some of the business models are unfortunately built on negative news spread of hatred of harmful disinformation so there is also a responsibility for member states to regulate from a human rights perspective but also for businesses to to be aware of their own obligations under human rights for for for this type of services that they offer now sometimes you see Nations undercutting their own principles with something like human rights for example let me take the example of the United States where presidents of universities have been pillared for refusing to say that this is hate speech for example saying that her M's messages about Israel are hate speech and they are defending that by a First Amendment principle a freedom of speech principle which is underpinned by a Supreme Court decision in 1969 and yet the US itself even the White House waited in on that argument and pillared those who refused to discuss something without a context basing their position on a Supreme Court decision the country itself the White House is ignoring that decision it would appear well that's a national issue it's not an issue of freedom of speech and freedom of expression when it comes to international human rights law because internation human rights law has exceptions when it comes to incitement to violence and hate speech and we are very clear that that's not in line with human rights so when it comes to the international legal framework we actually have very clearly defined exceptions that you cannot incite to violence or hatred of of on the basis of race or if it's for we against women or or basis of sexual orientation and gender identity so human rights law is actually the answer to and the solution to this issue a recurring theme throughout the time that we've been talking you have used the word a number of times accountability how does one establish accountability you've got a security Council that is crippled by The veto effectively so no sanction can come from the security Council on most occasions you've got a general assembly in which the vote is not binding how do you given these circumstances start establishing accountability but also demanding accountability again it's good to go back to history because the security Council was paralyzed for pretty much most of the period of the Cold War it didn't stop accountability because you could especially when it comes to human rights violation Universal jurisdiction came up and was established for instance under the convention Against torture if you are a torturer you are and if you if a member state has signed the convention Against torture it is under the the obligation to to prosecute you so there there are ways and means to work on accountability beyond the security Council or even the general assembly by the way it is still a very strong signal if there is a general assembly resolution with a vast majority of member states calling for humanitarian ceas fire for example as we saw just now in Gaza um so one shouldn't underestimate that either politically but it is true at the legal at the legal level we need both the functioning of the international criminal court but also of course Universal jur jurisdiction to to be applied much more rigorously when it comes to violations of human rights would reform of the security Council make your job in terms of enforcing human rights Easier by perhaps giving a greater representation on the council or indeed removing the Vita which has been the stumbling block on so many occasions you know we have had an ongoing debate on the reform of the security counil for a very long time and indeed there is hopefully a chance that this will go ahead by it being much more representative I mean the details of course will have to be worked out by the member states it's quite a complex legal issue by the way but what I hope that the security Council will do in the future is actually look at human rights in a much more Central way and that means because from a prevention perspective if you see violations of human rights is an indication that things are going arai in a country and that analysis needs to feed into their deliberations whether or not it's going to resolve the paralysis that we see at the moment I don't know but it is important for the International Community to understand that human rights has actually something to say and more centrally to say about what's happening in different countries and what the responsibilities is especially of those countries who have influence over Waring parties for example you were talking about human rights it's like a canary in a gold mine it's when that they are contravene that you know that something is going wrong yes I think it's a very good image but it's also a solution it's not just the canary and the Goldman it's it's also it's also a solution um for instance economy human rights and economic economic systems were always something that one wouldn't talk about they wouldn't economists told me they never were taught about human rights actually if you are an economist or if you are responsible for macroeconomic policies in your country and if you don't know about human rights you will see a rise in inequalities you will see that marginalized and vulnerable groups are not going to be protected and you will not invest in Education Health and Social protection which is what we see was the big lesson from covid-19 that you actually that those countries who had invested in it did much better so my again my message is human rights is also a solution and I wish that each and every discipline around the world would take human rights much more seriously and even know more about human rights so that it can actually prevent the worst from happening could you extrapolate that theory about economics to climate change as well yes because climate change you know we already see what's happening in the Sahel for example we know that we know in Somalia I was just in Iraq in August I mean I went to Parts where I know that you know in Basra in the South where the where where the temperatures go up to 50 over 50 degrees centigrade and not just a couple of days for weeks on end Barren Landscapes around me at 30 years ago where you had still Lush uh rivers and and date bombs and and and and dates uh that were there and and where people could actually live I talk to those communities who said we can no longer live in these circumstances and they will be displaced eventually or already displaced and we see the same in the Sahel competition over scarce resources Means War and that's what we need to prevent so climate change is the biggest challenge that we face and unfortunately we don't talk enough about it anymore bman Turk
