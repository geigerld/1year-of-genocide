She eats and feeds her young children. My uncle comes to the border and to death in order to eat and feed her family. Women, man in this country. This is behind the Jews. I have done a job. Man, I swear to God, I will leave women alone. Come out. I mean, it's not forbidden. Why do you come here like this? What's wrong with the Jews? No, it's more dangerous or dangerous.  He's a fool, he ruined the world, you man. A piece of flour has become 800 shekels in this country. It's not old yet. Man, we're going north. You'll find Zakin before the Jakar line. We want to go get some vegetables so we can eat. Watch us and feed at school. What should we do? One with two people's thoughts as they are and the spirit of more than one.  I swear to God, you are going, God knows, you think you are coming back, and he is not coming back. I swear the day before yesterday, the young man and I stayed at the sea, a cruiser that hit the water and the snipers. I swear to God, I did not expect to come back. I swear to God, I did not expect to go to Tayyib, sitting with potatoes. We saw nothing but flying, knock, knock, knock, from the one who died.  And the one who is right and the one who is straying, by God Almighty, we did not expect to go well, and the second day we repeat the same thing again, we will go back to get food and drink, some potatoes, some onions, there is pepper, whatever is in it, so that the children can eat, we will bring it. The problem is with children and young women, and it is not a problem. They are patient, but women and children are patient.  He does not know patience, and God will help him with their situation. Everyone is suffocated and distressed, and the one who lost a loved one and the one who lost a brother, why have we started eating the food of animals, may God bless you? They have started mixing barley. Its age was barley flour, and its age was barley flour. By God, its age. In Arab history, we have not heard of barley and corn flour, man, we have started eating.  Barley flour and corn, and it makes their stomach ache, and we say, Oh God, because of the siege and because of the Jews and the Daesh, we must be patient, even if it is in some form. We remain patient. We are in this homeland, O great one. Subs lest
