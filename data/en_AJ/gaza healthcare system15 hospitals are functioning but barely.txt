the Health Care system in Gaza is collapsing another casualty of Israel's war on Hamas that is the assessment from Shan Casey this church has been turned into an impatient word the World Health organization's emergency medical team coordinator who just returned to un headquarters after spending 5 weeks in Gaza every time I went to the hospitals I saw evidence again and again of the simultaneous uh humanitarian catastrophe that's unfolding we see it every day in Gaza uh getting worse and worse and the collapse of the health system day by day Casey estimates that only 15 hospitals in Gaza are functioning but only partially he saw how bad the situation is firsthand these are a couple of his reports from last month I'm back in ALA the largest hospital in Gaza for the third time this week where it's still a case of absolute misery we're in Alexa hospital where I just left the resuscitation room where a 9-year-old boy named oet was being treated basically with sedation to ease his suffering as he dies when asked what was needed the most to help the Gaza Health System cope Casey was clear a ceasefire that he said would be the most effective and immediate way to end the suffering Gabriel oando Al jazer at the United Nations
