Dr Muhammad alar is a plastic and reconstructive surgeon he's part of the American medical team with rahma Worldwide it's an independent humanitarian organization joins us now from the European Hospital in Gaza good to have you with us so first of all tell us about reports of people dying because of a lack of of Basics medicine and Equipment that's absolutely true um just couple of nights ago we heard the ambulance coming in uh myself and a few of my colleagues from the team we ran down to the ER and uh we had a young guy that we tried to resuscitate but unfortunately there was nothing that that we could do to help him out uh there's no basic medications for resusitation uh there's no equipments there's no ultrasound there's no lines to resuscitate so we end up losing assault because of that and that shouldn't have happened to be honest with you uh not in the 21st century and and shouldn't happen anywhere in the world um assuming that we we apply the same standards everywhere in the world so the situation is really dire you're right now in a hospital in Gaza when's the last time supplies reached you um the last time we had supplies were when we came in this is when we brought some supplies with us medications and equipments but of course they we ran out quickly and right now um and as I mentioned before yesterday I had to do surgeries without having a gown on just just have gloves on and I can tell you this is definitely going to lead to an increase in the infection rate and probably you know mortality and morbidity among patients uh so we are in in a crisis situation we've been asking for more and more supplies um every day I get a whole list from a different department that I try to provide to uh uh the rahma organization in Chicago so they can at least give us more medications more equipments more supplies just to keep the basic service going you mentioned there you're asking for more supplies and allow me to ask what might appear to be a pretty obvious question but who you asking and what answer are you getting as to why if you are getting any who's stopping or preventing or why you're not getting the supplies you're requesting so the restrictions are there however um the the the way I look at it is the the request is way is way more than what we can provide on a short-term basis so um I have a list of about five six pages just for one Department and to bring this in it's going to take weeks and weeks of logistics and coordination and shipment etc etc why do just to explain to people who might not understand you have a list you need equipment you need medicine how do you request that who do you go to to say I need this so so basically I I um email this I'm sorry not email I text this to the uh to the rahma the organization that uh um that we're earn here um uh through and they buy donations and uh they start looking into providers for these equipments either from local um um agencies like in Egypt or in the United States and then by the time we put the order in and by time we ship things down and by time we uh have the next team coming in to bring the stuff with them we're looking at weeks so this is not practical at all why can't it come in through the channels where medicine used to come in explain that to viewers there's we've heard there's plenty of supplies at the border well I I don't think these channels are working efficiently I mean we were able to bring in medications and uh and and equipments after we had um you know going through the right checkpoints and the right uh agencies and approvals uh I don't think just bringing in supplies by itself or or uh equipments by themselves would be feasible just to ship him through there's a lot of no NOS there's a lot of restrictions and uh not everything is feasible to bring in what about the shelling that's going on how I mean you've come from the US I understand how do you deal with that possibility that when we're hearing medical staff in some cases are dying that you may be facing yourself a life and death situation we are trying to separate ourselves emotionally but I I I I personally and and I'm sure many of my colleagues get emotional at many points when we felt that we had a patient that we're treating and they should be cured and recover and when we come to R arm next day all of a sudden we that they just died because there was a missing equipment or a missing medication or a missing care let me give you a very simple example um none of the patients in the ICU that we operate on do have any kind of nutrition they don't have any kind of nutrition food is scarce um families are not able to provide any food to the to the patients and we're not able to give them any food so not to put any nutrition in a patient equals Death it doesn't matter how good your your skills are it doesn't matter what good your surgery is unless the patient is being fed with nutritions they will die and that's exactly what's happening we have several patients that just died because they're not right the UN Human Rights office is talking about a pattern of Israeli attacks striking life-saving infrastructure do you feel that your facility you your patients are being targeted um so let me let me just make it clear and I said this before um regardless the political stance regardless of the ethnic backgrounds ideological theological whatever um I'm here for a medical Mission take care of patients and it seems that we're not able to provide them with their care now why why this is happening it's simply because there's a lot of restriction now I leave it to the political uh you know um parties and and uh and and uh to to the uh to the United States and other and un and other agencies International and National so look into the reasons behind that uh if you want my my personal opinion I think it's very clear and it doesn't need to be even questioned or asked so in a nutshell um there's there's significant restriction on things to come in basic supplies and we're not talking about um you know sophisticated equipments or sophisticated uh supplies we're talking about basic food water um basic health care needs um diapers uh we're talking about nutrition for hospital patients um um anesthesia equipments um um Sur equipments supplies gauze gloves gowns I don't think there's any question about the legitimacy of these needs but I leave it up to the U to the polit to the to politicians to figure out why this is happening all right thank you very much for your time doctor I appreciate it
