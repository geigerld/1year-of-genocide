right let's bring in now Maran bishara who is alzer's senior political analyst and he joins us by Skype from Paris Maran what do you make of the developments at the G7 in terms of the discussions of the war on Gaza well meaningless is the word that comes to mind absolutely and utterly meaningless Once Upon a Time the G7 used to stand for the seven Great the seven giants they are the Democratic powers in the world the rich democracies now they stand for the seven goofy grave even grotesque Powers when it comes to the question of Gaza and even to the question of Ukraine at some point because now we have seven leaders who are facing huge domestic problems at home divided societies divided polities um terribly unpopular and at the same time they're basically for all practical matter pushing for a third world war with Russia by this heavy Armament that they continuously talk about this leaves very little room for Gaza and hence every time I hear any such communicate says something about concerned I know it's absolutely meaningless uh as James was saying if the displacement of 800,000 people within 48 hours is not grave I don't know what is grave if the killing of hundreds of people every day is not grave I don't know what is grave if that is limited I don't know what is unlimited so really uh the the other six soall democracies are following in the footsteps of the United States that's dictating to them and to the rest of the region their policies that have been for eight months blocking any attempt at the ceasefire and now have presented a non ceasefire ceasefire proposal that will probably and ultimately allow Israel to uh carry on with the war after the so-called phase one is over within few weeks so there's nothing uh insightful nothing of Interest nothing is actionable coming out from the G7 and P one we were just watching a press briefing by the US president on the sidelines of that G7 Summit and a reporter did put a question to the president about that ceasefire proposal and that reporter asked whether Hamas was working towards or indeed working against the deal and President Joe Biden appeared it appeared that he didn't want to answer the question that that press briefing was meant to be exclusively about Ukraine but he did say that this is is an approach that has been endorsed by the UN Security Council by the G7 by Israel and he described Hamas as being the biggest hang up to any sort of ceasefire what did you make of those comments well you know they're a repetition of more than the same you have to admire American officials for being on on point um they continuously repeat more of the same like a broken record but what they say is mostly half truths or falsehoods because we know for a fact uh for the past so many what not 3 four weeks since Biden first made his announcement or his proposal public Israel have never endorsed it in public we also know that the Israelis have continued with the war ever since um Biden made the announcements killing thousands of people displacing hundreds of thousands and we also know um that Hamas has given a positive resp response overall and they had to highlight or amend a couple of issues that is of uh terrible importance to them but that of course is dismissed by the United States because the United States is not a credible broker here the United States is party to the war it has been complicit in every possible way militarily financially diplomatically with Israel in the war it is not a third party per se it is part and parcel of the Israeli front against Gaza so what the Americans are saying today lacks credibility lacks any moral standing in the world but what they do have is a lot of power and a lot of money and I think power and money uh speak loudly more certainly more loudly than principle and international law especially when it comes to Palestine when it comes to Ukraine you know they keep talking about the principles of this and that and other thing the fact that Palestine has been occupied for almost six decades that doesn't even register on their screens that is our senior political analyst Maran bishara joining us live from Paris Maran thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaaz
