for millions of Palestinians in Gaza the primary UN agency anra is simply a Lifeline they depend on it for Health Care social services and jobs especially now after months of Israel's war on the territory but threats of funding Cuts could worsen an already dire humanitarian situation established in 1949 anor's mission was to provide relief to Palestinians lost their homes by the creation of the state of Israel nearly 6 million Palestinians in Gaza the occupied West Bank Syria and Jordan rely on the aid provided by the UN agency with approximately 30,000 staff un's reduced funding could impact food Aid health care and other critical Services across the Middle East Israel has called for the suspension of anras operations accusing it of supporting what it calls terrorist ISM our main goal in the war is to eliminate the threat not just neutralize it we know how to eliminate terrorists but it's harder with an idea onra represents that idea breeding more terrorists through various means we cannot win this war without dismantling unra the agency has previously faced similar threats in 2018 US president Donald Trump withw more than $300 million in funding raising concerns about political motives the US decision was not about un's performance it was about uh the pressure on the Palestinian leadership and that's a form of politicizing of humanitarian funding that should be absolutely avoided in our view anra has also been under pressure because of its role in the debate on the Palestinian right of return the agency recognizes all Palestinians displaced from 1947 and 1948 and their descendants as refugees who have demanded to return to their homes a stance Israel has opposed Israeli officials argue that dismantling anra would remove the refugee issue from discussions anra is an organization that perpetuates the Palestinian refugee problem it also perpetuates the right of return for Palestinian refugees narrative in order to eliminate the state of Israel therefore unrea must become a thing of the past the UN is investigating 12 unrest staff who have been accused of involvement in the October 7 attacks by Hamas in southern Israel nine of them have been fired and one is confirmed dead but the 12 staff only account for a fraction of anr's entire 30,000 Workforce the UN agency says it remains committed to transparency noting no prior concerns about its staff's conduct axel zovich aljer make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
