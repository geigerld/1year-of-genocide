Gaza rights back we're going to head to rala now where Imran Khan joins us uh pardon me Imran is in occupied East Jerusalem we're seeing pictures of protests in rala Imran can you talk us through what's happening there well there are a huge number of people out on the streets this is by far the biggest protest that uh we've seen in rala since October the 7th when all of this began now since October the 7th people have been out on the streets of rala showing their support for the Gaza Strip those protests were small but they were frequent they were happening three or four times a day but nowhere near this kind of number clearly something has sparked them to come out on the streets whether it's the hospital bombing the two incidents actually took place around the same time uh certainly that would have spurred the protesters to keep on the streets they've now moved from uh the main Square in rala and they're now uh walking around the streets of rala that's something that we do see them do a lot this is not about being in one place this is about showing the entire occupied West Bank that uh there is support there for uh the people of Gaza now whilst all of this was happening Emily we heard that President Mahmud Abbas is refusing to meet with Joe Biden Joe Biden US president is actually in uh Israel um on Wednesday he's going to go to Jordan he in Jordan he'll be meeting with the Egyptian leader CCE and with the King Abdullah of Jordan in that meeting was supposed to be president mahud abas of the Palestinian Authority he's now not in that meeting we're hearing that he's now actually on his way back from ramala why is that happening well we don't know there's been no official confirmation of this but clearly mudas is looking at the streets of Rola looking at the streets of the occupied West Bank where all these demonstrations are taking place he's reading the mood of Palestinian people on the streets and he's certainly uh looking at the level of support for the people of Gaza so any wrong step from him is going to cost him very dearly politically he's also been calling for a ceasefire for a very long time almost since uh this began on October 7th the US the UK Japan voted against and the French rather voted against a Russian uh backed a security Council resolution for a ceasefire in the humanitarian Corridor that might be the driving force he may well just be so frustrated with the Americans that he simply feels he's got nothing to talk to them about because his big push is for a ceasefire and if that's not happening then why is he in that room with President Joe Biden okay we have to leave it there Imran Khan in occupied East Jerusalem let's head to rala now where Charles Stratford is standing by for us in the occupied West Bank Charles we're seeing some tense scenes in rala at the moment talk us through what's happening yeah sorry it's it's even difficult for us to breathe here from the office as these clouds of tear gas rise but yeah I'm seeing basically Street battles between protesters and Palestinian Security Forces they're throwing rocks sound bombs the police has throwing sound bombs I just saw an ambulance was unsure as to whether anybody has been injured but scenes of utter chaos here you're probably hearing that the protest started in the Central Square a place called Manara and they were trying to head towards one of the main Palestinian Authority administrative buildings and then they were pushed back by Security Forces as we heard Imran say a lot of the focus of this protest excuse me the tigas is still coming up through the window here is anger with Muhammed abas the Palestinian president they want him back they say that he is completely ineffectual many of the these protesters in fact there were chance for him to step aside this is basically an indication just how tenuous the Palestinian president's position is here in in the West Bank the people here have obviously been these protests are getting larger and more frequent as the war in Gaza goes on but this is longstanding problems grievances that they have with the Palestinian president I'm seeing groups of men running back now um as I say some still throwing throwing rocks this is not a Hamas demonstration by any stretch this is just a a general group of people who have political affiliations or support various different political groups that are just basically sick and tired another sound bomb there that are sick and tired of what they say is the complete ineffectuality of the Palestinian leader and of course this has happened on the same night as we've seen that horrific attack on Gaza on that hospital with what we understand are hundreds of people killed but yeah this is by far the largest protest that we've seen in rala since the beginning of the war on Gaza we understand there were similar protests in in a number of other towns on the in the occupied West Bank notably Janine we heard also we can't confirm it yet that that protest was broken up by Palestinian Security Forces too so yeah as I say scenes of utter chaos here um and seemingly the police struggling to control the situation Charles you mentioned that you had been affected by te gas are you okay to keep going yeah we can keep going now it's cleared a little bit but as I say there's there's a lot more being thrown please continue yes so when I saw your last cross to our previous present Anastasia it looked like things had been relatively peaceful what's what's changed has there been something that's triggered it to to turn violent well it was a peaceful protest um uh I suppose it took about an hour or so for people to gather um but as I say as they tried to March up towards the makata which is the main Palestinian Authority building here in rala that's when they were blocked by Palestinian security forces the tear gas and the sound bombs started to be fired um they are now Gathering again seemingly in the Square um there's no sign of any Security Forces there at the moment but we I I think that they that they've pushed back up the roads but yeah this could get very ugly indeed and as I say it is a graphic example of of the level of anger that is now being focused upon the Palestinian leader they want him back they want him to cut this visit in Jordan short they do not want him Vis seeing Biden because they have completely given up with any kind of international diplomatic effort to stop the violence being exacted upon the people of Gaza and the Palestinians here in the occupied West Bank Charles so yeah you might not have been aware but or or can see from your point of view they've actually in the time that we've been speaking destroyed a sign that said rala what do you think what can we interpret from that very difficult to say I mean I I I can tell you that as you can imagine all the shops have closed in a situation like this I mean we see protests across the occupied West Bank regularly large scale like this local businesses and so on they close because things do get violence and as I say there is um there is Rock throwing there there is um there are running Street battles at the moment with the security services in terms of what's happened to a particular sign I I I couldn't tell you but uh yeah it's going to be very interesting and one can only think a great challenge for the security forces to to try and get back some sort of order because there's no sign at this stage at least that um that the crowds are being dispersed from what I can see a lot of them have actually pushed up into into the roads around the Central Square here can you describe that area for people that aren't familiar with it can you describe the Central Square and how or if the Israeli Security Forces will be able to get control let's just be clear here in our understand this is not the Israeli sec security forces that are involved in this this is the Palestinian author Palestinian Security Forces so you know an know the layer of the land here very well yeah a very important point this is not Israeli Security Forces at this stage this is the Palestinian Authority trying to deal with this crisis and that's why it's so and that's why it's so important that's why it's so Salient because as I say it shows the level of anger now being directed towards the Palestinian leader who we know over the last week or so has met with a number of different leaders spoken to a number of others on the telephone around the world so yeah this this Manara as it's called is the Central Square in raal rala it's symbolic of a place where many protests occur have occurred over the decades so um it's normally where people gather and yeah we've seen it here again this evening but as I say this is in relation to since the beginning of the war on Gaza the size and SC scale and level of violence we're witnessing here in rala is unprecedented this hasn't happened on this scale uh since the beginning of the war can you just clarify again what the Palestinians in in rala want what is it that they want from the Palestinian Authority from president abas well bear in mind that you know 700 arrests approximately 700 that sounds like gunfire that does sound like gunfire um and you've heard you probably hear the chanting as well yeah things things are deteriorating dramatically here at the moment trying to get a steer on what we can see I can see a fire burning I can see people on roofs that is that that is live gunfire okay do you need to take cover I'm going to get down because that's live gunfire yes I do there'll be firing in the air one would think so probably best that we uh okay we'll cross back to you when it's safe to do so thank you very much Charles Stratford in rala Let's cross to Stephanie DEA who is in ashod in southern Israel Steph what are you hearing about these most recent attacks in Gaza any further details from the Israeli military initially the Israeli spokesperson was asked in a press conference and he said he didn't have any information there were multiple strikes going on and they would be investigating we've now uh have a little bit more information that it it seems that preliminary investigations the Israelis are pointing to a potentially misfired or failed Hamas rocket launch um but I mean I have to say they have said this before when they have struck Targets in Gaza things like schools in you know in situations like this at the moment we're going have to wait and see they say that we're expecting an official statement at some point to come of course there's a lot of pressure now on the the Israelis having come from International from Canada from Q from Jordan from Egypt from Turkey um because the images are so shocking at least 500 people at the moment We Believe killed in that strike on the hospital a hospital that was supposed to have been safe uh you're seeing the potential uh of this to ignite not just what you're seeing happening in the West Bank but regionally um you have hasbalah who's always warned um warned the is radies if they go into Gaza if they go go harsh on Gaza that they will retaliate well the images that we've seen today are extraordinary you've seen how it's ignited the West Bank Raa usually pretty pacifist when it comes to any reaction when it comes to Gaza Wars there are smaller protests nothing like we're seeing now and interestingly as you heard Charles saying there the fact that the Palestinian Authority CR clamping down on those protests when they're actually revolting against what happened in Gaza there's also a lot of inter fighting when it comes to the Palestinian factions they cannot be unified together against Israel as one um which is why also it is so complex when you look at the ground so you have this strike uh horrifying uh strike in Gaza killing at least 500 people and you're now seeing just how the potential of that has to ignite beyond the borders of Gaza if you will just want to remind our audience while we're speaking to you that we're what we're seeing in rala to the left of their screen it's the latest pictures of residents in rala coming out against Security Forces they're angry about President Mahmud abas and his his he's he's no longer going to be meeting with US President Joe Biden so there's it's a it's certainly a fluid situation here tonight uh and it's hard to stay across all the the developments but Stephanie if I may just to recap what you've said is that there's there's been an attack on a hospital in Gaza where 500 people have been killed there's also been an attack at a un school where people were Sheltering we now are hearing tonight that Israel's National Security Council said they will bring all the captives back alive do we know what Avenues Israel might be exploring in relation to that yeah let me just correct you there they haven't struck a un School in the past there have been times so they've struck schools during conflicts and they've said that also they would blame it on misfiring or Hamas U you know launching a rocket at their own or having ammunition underneath these kinds of areas so this time no no un school but yes a hospital a hospital in an area that was supposed to be deemed to be safe in an area where people had been told to evacuate too when you look at what's happening in rala people initially came out to protest uh the horrific images coming out of Gaza um what exactly ensued on the ground in terms of confrontations with the Palestinian Security Forces I can't tell you but you're now seeing the Palestinian Authority Security Forces clamping down on Palestinians in theala it is no secret that there is a lot of disillusionment with the Palestinian Authority there haven't been elections for years uh president Mahmud Abbas is not popular they do clamp down on any descent also in ramala I covered the death the killing of a prominent um critic against the Palestinian Authority n Berard um and when protesters came out on the streets there chanting for the downfall of the regime the Palestinian Authority um pushed their thugs onto the streets they beat people up they closed our satellite truck we had to return to the office in theala to be able to keep broadcasting from so this just shows you the complexities of the Palestinian story and the complexities of what the Palestinian people uh are having to endure I remember one man telling me at the funeral of nzar banat we are under a double OCC occupation um so it is so complex when it comes to this story but I think just bringing it back now to what happened uh in Gaza this is also going to it's really already changed the international condemnation which initially was very much sympathetic with Israel following the attack by Hamas which killed almost 1,400 just over Israelis um but this specific um targeting of this Hospital killing so many people is changing the of condemnation on Israel and we have the US President Joe Biden coming here tomorrow I think it's going to be very very interesting as to how the US president is going to react because he simply cannot ignore the pictures that have been coming out of Gaza okay thank you very much for that update Stephanie Decker for us in southern Israel before we head to Washington DC we're just going to show some live pictures now coming out of Tunis in Tunisia in response to this evening's strikes on on a Gaza Hospital in which we know more than 500 people have been killed and there were also reports that a school where people were Sheltering were also targeted so these are live pictures coming out of Tunis let's head to Washington DC now where Mike Hanner is standing by for us Mike we know that US President Joe Biden was due to take off in less than an hour what impact were these most recent attacks at a hospital and a School shelter in Gaza have on Biden's expected visit to Israel on Wednesday tomorrow
