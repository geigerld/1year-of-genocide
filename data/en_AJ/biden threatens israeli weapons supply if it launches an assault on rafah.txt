that's just wrong the US president said for the first time in an interview with us media on Wednesday that US military aid to Israel will be conditioned on the Israeli military's actions and acknowledged that Us weapons are being used to kill civilians in Gaza civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs they go into Rafa I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafa I've made it clear to BB in the war cabinet they're not going to get our support if in fact they go on these population centers the major shift in position from Joe Biden who has previously pledged unconditional support for Israel was foreshadowed by a recent delay in providing us bombs to Israel the US defense secretary told a senate panel the delivery was paused due to concerns about Israel's plans to invade Rafa Israel shouldn't launch a a major attack in arafa without accounting for uh and protecting the civilians that are in that battle space uh and and again as we have uh assessed the situation uh we paused one shipment of high high uh uh payload uh Munitions Biden has faced increasing pressure from protesters who have demonstrated in solidarity with Palestinians across American college campuses and in Chicago where he made a campaign stop on Wednesday Biden has also faced calls from Progressive members of his own party to end Israel's unconditional military aid Congressional leaders offered a muted response to the delayed arms shipment I uh believe that Israel and America have an ironclad relationship and I uh have faith in what the Biden Administration is doing I continue to express my concern to the administration that the delay of shipment of weapons to Israel is just another way of trying to tell an ally how to conduct to war Biden says the US will still provide Israel with defensive weapons and the US defense secretary says the US Israeli Alliance remains Ironclad but a major ground invasion of Rafa would be seen by the us as a red line and Biden says Israel Crossing it would be quote just wrong Heidi Joe Castro Al jazer Washington make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
