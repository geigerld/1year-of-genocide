there's growing pressure to hold Israel to account for its war on Gaza more countries are referring it to the un's top court and its president is facing a criminal complaint Switzerland so can International Justice stop Israel this is Inside hello and welcome to the program I'm Elizabeth panum it's been more than three months since Israel launched its devastating war on Gaza in the wake of the 7th October attacks nearly 25,000 Palestinians have now been killed and tens of thousands more injured but Israel doesn't seem any closer to its stated goal of eliminating Hamas and freeing the captives while the humanitarian catastrophe gets worse by the day many countries have rejected Israel's actions and South Africa has taken it to the international court of justice accusing it of committing genocide Israel now appears more isolated than ever its president Isaac Herzog even became the subject of a criminal complaint in Switzerland while Mexico and Chile have referred Israel to the international criminal court but will any of this make a difference and what can be done to end the Palestinians suffering in Gaza we'll get to our guests in a moment but first this report from Paul Ging Israel's war drags on in Gaza with food and medical supplies nearly exhausted the humanitarian condition has become dire doctors are carrying out amputations without any anesthetic with growing outrage and perhaps crucially legal proceedings ramping up the Israeli president Isaac Herzog is facing a criminal complaint in Switzerland it happened during his recent trip to the world economic Forum in Davos a statement from Swiss prosecutors said the plaintiffs are seeking a criminal prosecution in parallel to a case brought by South Africa at the international court of justice accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza as the destruction escalates on the ground Mexico and Chile have now referred both Israel and Hamas to the international criminal court citing concerns about war crimes while the un's icj concentrates on disputes between countries the ICC is a criminal tribunal which can prosecute the individuals during herzog's appearance in Davos he put forward Israel's position on the war in Gaza while rejecting charges of genocide I'm not shying away from the human tragedy in Gaza and you want to know something we care we care we B it it it it it is pain for us that our neighbors are suffering so much but how else can we defend ourselves in an infrastructure of Terror of unbelievable size and I call upon the entire International Community to stand with Israel and reject this claim many countries around the world have expressed concerns about the disproportionality of Israel's war on Gaza and the human cost there are legal proceedings on more than one front yet it's not clear what effect this could have on Israel's actions and what consequences there could be especially with allies like the United States publicly stating their unwavering support Paul ging Al jazer for Inside [Music] Story let's bring in our guests in Paris Lara alono an international lawyer and human rights Advocate who co-host the weekly podcast the Palestine pod in Toronto William shabus professor of international law at middlex University in the UK he previously served as the chairperson of the commission of inquiry on the 2014 Gaza conflict and in Dublin Jennifer Cassidy lecturer in diplomacy and international law at the University of Oxford and a former un and EU Diplomat a very warm welcome to each of you Mr shavis I'll start with you in Toronto and start with that criminal complaint against Israeli president pres Isaac Herzog in Switzerland now I'm in theory I know that third countries don't have criminal jurisdiction over heads of state government and the foreign Ministers of any other countries but can that immunity be lifted in certain circumstances such as cases of alleged crimes against humanity not as international law stands today there's quite a a a clear Judgment of the international court of justice from about 20 years ago that says that the the national courts simply cannot exercise jurisdiction uh in criminal matters over a foreign head of state or foreign minister so I think it's pretty clear there and I think that's probably the the uh the Fatal uh fact uh of the complaint that was made against the president of Israel in Switzerland a few days ago okay Miss Cassidy there has been a lot of activity in Western countries recently using Universal jurisdiction targeting people in Sudan and Syria are these countries such as Germany which found a Syrian konel guilty of crimes against humanity in 20122 are they now Under Pressure to treat Israeli officials in the same way certainly there is as you rightly noted a growing pressure um in quote unquote Western countries um to to not only respect international law but to adhere to it and upholders and although as was rightly mentioned by by the previous panelists this is quite difficult to do regarding the universal jurisdiction specifically in this case we must note that this is a serving uh head of stage who has diplomatic immunity it is not a post um you know retired head of state it is a serving member state so it's an extremely difficult thing to Pro uh prosecute it's difficult thing to to file however pre as you rightly noted pressure is being exerted H not by governments and not by yes by some extent governments but the political um Power is not backing a lot of Western States it's the people um around the world who are really actually growing this movement and pressurizing their states um and their legislators to do this yeah absolutely from what we know about this criminal complaint against the Israeli president president it has been brought by a number of individuals uh Miss alboro do you think that we will see Universal jurisdiction being used against Israeli officials who let's say unlike president Isaac Herzog who don't have that immunity because they're a head of state or head of government or a foreign minister could it make it difficult for them to move around is that something that you see happening well I absolutely agree that we're going to continue to see more legal action brought worldwide whether it be in National courts um or continued pressure on the international institutions like the ICC and the icj um to achieve some sort of accountability um and I just want to say that whether or not those cases are ultimately successful whether or not they're dismissed for jurisdictional or procedural reasons or whether they actually reach um a ruling on the merits is almost not really the point every new case which is brought in an effort to hold Israel accountable um for their genocidal Onslaught in Gaza is going to add more pressure to changing the Status Quo and this of course is not to be viewed in isolation from all the forms of resistance that we're seeing um In This Moment worldwide including BDS Grassroots efforts like direct action and other efforts to hold elected officials accountable um amongst others so really I just want to emphasize that the law is merely a tool um it's not sufficient but it's also not meaningless as some might think after Decades of um understandable frustration with it as a means for achieving Justice and accountability yes and we've certainly seen protests around the world we have seen growing support for the boycott divestment and sanctions or BDS movement um if we can continue to talk about what's happening legally Mr shabus Mexico and Chile have referred what's happening in Israel and Gaza to the international criminal court and Mexico has said that the ICC is the proper Forum to establish criminal potential criminal responsibility why do you think that these countries think that the ICC is a better Court to investigate what's happening well the ICC is a of course a criminal court and it's going to focus on individuals we were talking about the the situation of the president of Israel visiting Switzerland um according to the case law of the international criminal court he has no immunity there and so he could be prosecuted and Switzerland would be under an obligation to to bring him to Justice to see that he would be transferred to the ha arrested and so on so there are some real advantages to the criminal law route uh it's also something that can operate more speedily uh than for example the international court of justice which is going to probably in the next few days in the next week or two deliver an order against Israel but on the merits of the case we're not going to have a ruling for probably three four five years it's another way of putting pressure and it's very important what those states have done because they are putting pressure on the prosecutor of the Court the prosecutor of the international criminal court has been reluctant I think to proceed uh with Israel and Palestine and this is going to tighten the screws on him and and and hopefully compel more uh action on his part yeah Miss Cassie that certainly been one accusation against the ICC prosecutor kharim Khan isn't it is that he favors is charges over longstanding uh Palestinian charges do you how much pressure do you think um Karim Khan is under as the chief court a huge amount of pressure and rightly so and I think your observations regarding um the uh well also the global observations that he's favoring the is is Israeli side over the Palestinian side because this we need to bear in mind this is uh these advisory motions also by the icj and other countries regarding the illegal annexation of territories what's happening in the West Bank the changing status of Jerusalem all these charges had been brought well before you know October 7th and this has never been looked into by the court but he is and he should be experiencing a lot of pressure and I think key point to note that was noted Again by by the previous panelist which we must pick up on is the speediness at which the IC can act because with the icj for example we know that a genocidal ruling is going to take years I myself worked on the Karu tribunals in Cambodia and these took um you know over decades for convictions of genocide and crimes against humanity but with the ICC we see a much speedier and it's also not going to be brought to the UN Security Council for a binding resolution so that's the other key distinction between the ICC and the icj and Miss alboro why do you think that the ICC has been slow as the criticism goes to look at um the Grievances of Palestinians and do you think that the amount of pressure that is on the story now because of Israel's war on Gaza that that will that that will change the way the ICC looks at this case well I think part of the answer is at least uh the political pressure that the court has been under so remember when the court announced uh the prosecutor's office announced that they would be investigating uh violations of the Rome statute um that occurred in Afghanistan and in Palestine uh around 2020 the US actually imposed sanctions on the uh ICC the then prosecutor Fatu B suda um and revoked her US Visa and so there's at least that political IAL element that's at play here um but I think that really Kareem Khan needs to act he could have issued a rest forence months ago and we're seeing greater criticism of how he's handling this situation hundreds of Scholars and practitioners of international law submitted an open letter to the assembly of State parties um regarding the office of the prosecutor's engagement with this case and this letter I encourage everyone to read it raises questions surrounding his impartiality and his entire handling of this matter so he really needs to move much quicker than he has there hasn't even been an update in terms of news on the IC website with respect to the case in Palestine since November and this is really just unacceptable all right and if we look now at what's happening at the international court of justice as we wait to hear if it's going to order those provisional measures that South Africa is asking for for the protection of civilians in Gaza in Gaza Mr shabas do you think that even before we have any rulings do the does what's happening in the court have the power to shape events even separate from any rulings you know we had the Israeli attorney general said that she was going to investigate statements that might qualify as incitement to harm uninvolved civilians a few days before the hearings yes uh absolutely and I think that the the the hearing that took place a week ago in the ha had had great Influence People heard the very very compelling and Powerful uh argument set out by South Africa this was of course viewed around the world and I think the rather pathetic efforts really by Israel to respond to them so this is already influential in putting that argument out we've been certainly living in Western countries as I do we've been bombarded by media and so on there which are all presenting which are which are tilting very much to the Israeli side uh in the debates and it was so important to to have that access and to see that very transparent and public debate where we saw both arguments set out people can judge based on it and and and so this is very very influential already uh but of course we need the order from the court and and that's going to be a very important development yeah Miss Cassidy Mr shabus is saying that you know what is happening in the court is really influential it's exposed the deepening Global divide though hasn't it we have dozens of countries supporting South Africa's case at the international court of justice but they all happen to be from the global South while many Western countries are standing standing by Israel do you think that the number of countries that are supporting South Africa's case does that put pressure on Israel or does it not care as long as the US and a number of you know a small number of Western countries stand by it well the personal part part of me would like to say yes it puts pressure on Israel but from all the the you know from from the academic uh side of me all the evidence and the statements points towards um you your your latter response that Israel simply does not care we know the direct statement from um Netanyahu who came out and said that if there was a ruining of genocide or or of the provisional measures um I believe the qu was and may not be for basan but um we do not care what he said that no one he said that no one can stop them that the no will stop yet not the Access of Evil no one so yeah he Israel and once they have the backing of the US um and also the UK they have the the the funding now they have the backing of Germany I don't think any from from the barbaric actions we've seen Israel commit in Gaza I do not think um pressure by Western governments that they're not even regarding is going to have any play out uh with them where we're going to see the difference here uh is whether when there's an icj ruling and it goes to the UN Security Council will the US abide by the legal arm of the UN or will they still continue to um abstain on the resolution or vote against it yeah and and and Miss alboro what do you think you know if the icj does order the provisional measures that South Africa is asking for how much pressure does that put on the United States on Israel's biggest Ally to abide by what the un's top court is saying well I think it will put the US in a difficult place because if they ignore the ruling and uh you know that there's a plausible case for for genocide which is what the court is being asked um right now that there's a plausible case that Israel has violated the genocide convention um then it'll put the US in a really difficult position because do they really want to continue to provide um unlimited and unconditional financial and military aid to Israel and thereby actually violate in a sense um that order um because that will only undermine the court itself and does the does the US really want to undermine the highest you know judicial organ in the world I think it will um put the US in a difficult position obviously it will make it much more difficult for the US to lecture anybody worldwide about human rights and their own behavior and it will just expose even further that the US operates according to double standards and hypocrisy and not in accordance with the legal framework um established after World War II to prevent and sanction Mass atrocities uh Mr shabus a lot is of course known and made of the US support for Israel but I want to talk about Germany's intervention at the international court of justice Germany has a very interesting history doesn't it it committed the first genocide of the 20th century against Namibia it of course committed genocide against the Jews and the Holocaust and yet it supported the gambia's case against Myanmar it supports Ukraine's case against Russia and this time it is intervening on behalf of Israel what do you make of this and do you think that it could Germany's history could it help or hinder Israel's case I don't know I really appreciated the statement from the president of Namibia who who basically said to the Germans you know you should keep your mouth shut when you start getting involved in denying genocide it's not a good look for that country but you know the the this is the the beauty of these remedies before the international court of justice and the international criminal court I'm I'm I'm not sure that they really uh have much influence on the United States that was your previous question but I think that they do put a lot of pressure on some of many of the middle Powers who are very close to Israel and very supportive Germany among them perhaps first and foremost but other countries uh the Netherlands Belgium France Canada where I am coming from today um and these countries are all very loyal to Israel but they're also very loyal to the international court of justice and to the international criminal court so taking a a battle there so to speak puts them in a very very difficult and uncomfortable place especially when you have someone like the prime minister of Israel uh basically being totally dismissive of the international uh court of justice and of course they'll say the same about the international the international criminal court just to give you an example uh a few months ago Canada the Netherlands Germany France made a submission to the international uh court of justice in the case that's been filed against Myanmar and they proposed a very expansive understanding of the crime of genocide um this of course is going to be very helpful in terms of fighting against Myanmar in the case but it's also going to be very helpful to South Africa I think that probably the lawyers in those countries those European countries in Canada who prepared that are now regretting that they took that initiative but it it brings up the double standards this is the beauty of the court is that it's a place where you can to some extent I don't want to say there are no double standards there either but you can cut through them and you can expose them and and that's the interest in these remedies absolutely and Miss Cassidy how much do you think I mean we have been talking about it already but just how much has Israel's war on Gaza have the divides expose the double standards of the US of Europe when they openly and time and time again condemn say Russia's actions in Ukraine and stand by Israel how much longer do you think they can do that without realizing how it looks yes well it has uh there has been many moments uh in the past decades that have exposed the double standards um of the West when it comes to war crimes and when it comes to their um quote unquote attempt to spread democracy um around the world I think we are I The Optimist in me thinks we are at somewhat of a BRI Breaking Point um on this issue because we have my area of expertise is social media and realtime governance we've never had a war which we have as you know a global Society been able to see these atrocities before our eyes so I think the people and we've seen the reaction of the world you know we've seen uh people marching in their Millions if not billions of countries of you know every nationality in every region so I think we are are at at as a breaking point but you know turning directly back to back to your question hypocrisy is so strong and and as was noted earlier if the US rejects the icj's even provisional measures you know they've already lost credibility in my opinion to lecture along with the UK to lecture people on upholding international human rights but this will really this the lus test yeah Miss alboro let me come to you with a people who didn't have the benefit of social media the people who survived the Bosnian War 1,000 survivors of the war have written a letter to the international court of justice saying that you know if the court had acted um earlier then it would have prevented a genocide and war crimes there do you think that what happened in Bosnia what happened in Rwanda that these things that the international court of justice that these are things that they will be thinking about I would certainly hope so in fact even South Africa's Advocate uh during the oral argument said very clearly to the court that the court actually failed those people um who had uh experienced genocide um and failed to deliver them Justice and so called on the court to act before it's too late in this instance and not to fail the Palestinian people and some might say that actually that's already taken place and that there's really in a sense no justice you know that can be attained from this point on because where do you go um after already 30,000 people have been killed in three months and you know Gaza is creating you know and breaking new records every day in terms of Destruction and human suffering it seems like every time I check my phone I'm seeing some sort of a new superlative being used to describe the situation in Gaza so I would hope that the court will take that into account um and and recognize that they have a tremendous responsibility here not to fail another people South which is what South Africa underlined many times to the court Mr shabus despite the international court of justice in 1993 ordering provisional measures um in the Bosnian War we know what happened in 1995 that Bosnian serbs systematically murdered 8,000 Bosnian Muslims that's despite that provisional order that was in place so will anything short of a complete ceasefire now help the people of Gaza well anything is going to help them but I totally agree we need a complete ceasefire and I I hope that the international court of justice has the wisdom to do that everything points to the fact that um regardless of how strong the claim is about genocide Israel has shown itself to be incapable of distinguishing between civilians and Military objectives and so is itable of is it incapable of distinguishing or does it make the distinction and go ahead anyway well perhaps I mean there are two ways to look at this one is that it's incapable of distinguishing or the other is that it's essentially directing a war against the civilians of Gaza uh that's becoming also increasingly apparent that it's it's actually trying to drive the people of Gaza either out of the country entirely out of their their home uh I mean their new home because they are refugees in Gaza to begin with but but that that this is the real objective not to destroy Hamas as they say not to rescue the hostage which they're incapable of doing but rather to attack the the people of Gaza so hopefully the international court of justice will appreciate that and will make an order against Israel now you raised the question will Israel follow that that's the other problem and there's no meaningful way of enforcing this uh except that if there is such an order it is going to really turn the screws on some of Israel's allies although as I say I don't think that the United States is going to be uh persuaded at all you have to remember that the first the decision by the international court of justice on The Binding nature of provisional measures was directed against the United States because they refused to themselves uh respect provisional measures of the court in in a case more than 20 years ago all right I'm afraid that we have run out of time but I want to thank all of our guests for
