we begin with breaking news there's just been an Israeli air strike on one of the main roads leading towards Southern Gaza several people have been rushed to hospital alaz Han Mahmud joins us from Han Yunis inside the Gaza Strip we're just receiving uh these pictures Hani what more can you tell us about what happened yes well this is exactly what was happening in the past half an hour or so as Palestinians from Gaza and the northern part taking salahadin road all the way to the central part of Gaza and the southern part of the Gaza Strip and we're targeted by Israeli tank shell the the brutality of what we just saw on live pictures on TV is unmat these are the people the very people who were told to evacuate and to take salahadin road because it's a safe corridor found them themselves under heavy artillery shelling and tanks shells several of these people were seriously injured with multiple number of people were killed were rushed to sh Hospital in the city of Dar the closest hospital to salahadin Road and one of the first areas uh in the central part of Gaza Strip This is what we have been concerned about all day long and all the past days and this is what people inside Gaza and the noran have been worried about and afraid of that there are no terms to what Israelis are telling them what the military what the IDF is telling it's all lies the IDF is lying to people the Israeli military is lying to people when they tell them that there is a safe Corridor when it forced them under heavy bombardment to go to salahadin road because they want them to evacuate because it's safe when it's not safe at all that's exactly what's going on these are the 4-Hour h that we that they talked about that people could between in those hours could take these roads and run to safety but they're not safe this is exactly the feeling of everyone everyone is frustrated angry at what happened uh and it just there's no trust whatsoever people are killed indiscriminately they're killed intentionally uh it just it's beyond imagination what happens to people it will definitely H this Carriage the many thousand who are stilling Gaza and the northern part to leave because this is what will happen to them on the road a road that was designated as safe for them and before they get to the the the beginning of the Central Area before they get to the safe area they are targeted by those tanks shell it's like what in the words of of a a Jewish political science scientist who said Israel is at war with Palestinian civilian children and women not with anyone else and that's exactly a proof of what happened honey uh I want to go through again what we know again this has just happened it's 14 GMT it's that means it's 4 p.m. where you are in Gaza we've just got these pictures that our viewers are seeing in the center of their screen that is um what we're seeing are Gins who were hit as they were trying to leave the north try and put the geography in place for us where were they what route did they take and where were they trying to go just the basics and if you've already said it just that's fine you can repeat it this is all just happening right okay okay well these were people mainly concentrated in Gaza City and the northern part and what basic if we look at just technicality of what happened these people had to walk about combine about 25 to 30 kilm coming from Deep Center of Gaza and the northern part all the way to Salah Road and walk all the way to the uh the military checkpoint that been set up by the Israeli military uh with no belongings whatsoever people had to drop everything on the road and just walk with their hands above their head and with their ID so people as window was open this morning from 10: to 2: or 3:00 p.m. I believe uh we're told leave the area because it's safe to go to the South they lived under heavy bombardment we' seen people in the in rantis hospital shifa hospital were targeted repeatedly as of this morning and and and and late hour of last night uh they had to leave run for their life as they were either way they were going to get killed But the irony of this just they found themselves Target on the road that would supposedly be safe for them and that's what makes this whole thing more tragic and more frustrating it's it's definitely frustrating to me but I I can imagine what feeling these people had they had to run for their life and let me tell you this and our viewers you can see in the group who are evacuating fleeing Gaza and the north part on zah road some of the most vulnerable people are walking walking this long distance because no cars is allowed uh we're talking about elderly people with a chronic disease people on wheelchairs uh children and and those with lifethreatening conditions had to walk all this long distance and on top of that on top of the exhaustion that they experienced they were scared to hell because of the continuous bombardment and the shelves that fell on them unpredictably but we all knew that these people had feeling that it's not safe we knew it was it was not safe at all because we heard the stories from yesterdays when we talked to people who came they saw bodies lying on the side of the road they saw burned cars and ambulance few weeks ago two weeks ago the coastal Road had the same experience people were told leave and then because it's it's safe on the road it's safe in the southern part but they were killed killed right on a Rashid Road and their bodies were left for 2 3 days this the lies continue about this whatever fire paw they talk about a humanitarian seiz fire it's nothing it's just a trap Han Mahmud uh your reporting from hanun at this hour is just after 4M where you are and for viewers who are just joining us thank you very much uh honey I I'll let you go I'll turn
