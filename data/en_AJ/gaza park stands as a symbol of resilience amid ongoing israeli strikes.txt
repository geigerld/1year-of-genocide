I'm here standing at the front door of Gaza municipality park it has been a part of our community for almost 100 years providing a place of peace and joy for Generations it also has been been a safe place for many families a place where children play and memories are made but today it's one's vibrant atmosphere tells a different story The ongoing War has left its Mark here as you can see parts of the bark have been damaged partially by the occupation yet amidst the destruction life goes on families still come here to blow up steam despite the ongoing war in Gaza for many this park is more than just a recreational area it's a Lifeline a place where they can memary forget War atmosphere and let children experience a bit of joy and freedom we're here in the park for some relief trying to forget what's happened to us but it's in vain because we can't forget everything we've seen with our own eyes despite the park being completely destroyed and despite all the devastation in The Siege we cannot forget I come here every day to escape the War I come here for an hour or two to enjoy the views of the trees recently they were shelling near the park and refugees from Al Ral and alabra have arrived we come here often to escape the shelling we don't stay long because it's not safe we have noticed children come to this Park which is partially destroyed to escape the trauma of the wall and its impact on their well-being we have formed a team gathered the children organized some games and dedicated this place to focusing on children's psychological needs we concentrate on what they need and what makes them happy a powerful Testament to the spirit of of the people here continuing to live laugh and find Joy even in the hardest times Gaza municipality Park stands as a symbol of resilence this park may be partially destroyed but the spirit of the community remains unbroken make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
