H Mahmud is in KH yunes in the southern Gaza Strip Han we can share with our viewers latest pictures that are coming into us which are once again because this is not the first time this is happening and that we're seeing this people fleeing along Salah alen road which as a reminder is one of the two main roads north to south axis that runs through Gaza Palestinians fleeing through that road and being targeted what do you know about this particular incident what kind of context can you provide around this yes yes well within the past 45 minutes a sharp warning a threatening tone on Israeli radio the Israeli military radio ordering people of residents of Eastern Han unun and the resident of d That's the central part of the Gaza Strip to evacuate immediately leaving that particular area both areas Eastern kanun and as they become a military zone war zone according to the announcement on the Israeli radio people started to move out of these two areas now the residents of Dar were ordered to take a Rashid Road the coastal Road that's the western side of the Gaza Strip as a a a safe Corridor for them to head further south to Rafa City people at the Eastern side of hanun are ordered to take Salah road now here's the the problem people who did not get the massage or were not sure where to go took Salah road while at the same time Israeli tanks have been stationing there for quite a while and shooting at every moving object they we know they have effectively separated the central part from the southern part from the city of kanun particular those were coming from Tak Salah Road were shot at and and as far as we know from the reports we got there were car carrying civilians moving from on Salah Road was targeted and we we need to confirm how many people were in the car and if they were killed or they were only injured but tanks are positioned on that road targeting at every moving object here the the story is a little bit different the remaining part of Salah Road has been damaged severely damaged so people coming from a resident coming from Eastern side of Kan taking Salah road to RAF City find it very challenging as they cannot drive their cars the roads are severely damaged the the end up walking and not not not not light walking they they walk with their families and and children and and women and it take without carrying any of their belongings because they want to get there as soon as they as they can before the bombardment start and this is the difficulty of the situation now on both Road the coastal road now and Salah Road from kanun side reports talk about tens of Palestinians are taking the roads within the pass 4 5 minutes heading to uh uh to ra further southern part of the Gaza is strip so far a a it it has been very very tough for for people since early mornings of uh since early hours of this morning and as all of this is happening while air strikes Relentless air strikes targeting more residential homes and and splitting the Gaza Strip particularly the southern part into two parts making it difficult not only for movement but for also for for people who are who feel stranded they they are caught off from the rest of the of the Gaza Strip Han Mahmud reporting there from Kan Yunis in the southern part of the Gaza Strip Han thank you very much for the latest reporting now alzer's Imran Khan is in Tel Aviv Imran what is Israel saying about how it is conducting its current operations in Gaza and specifically is there any mention of limiting civilian casualties in this days of the war well I'll ask that question in just a moment but in the last few moments we've just heard a very loud explosion in the east of Tel Aviv where I'm where I am the indone rocket defense system is actually gone into action we can just see the smoke uh just behind me um might not be able to see it right now because it's actually disappearing um we'll get you more details on that as soon as we get them but sirens were also heard now limiting civilian casualties that's always been something the Americans have been pushing very clearly but Israel has also been incredibly clear as well it will conduct this war in the way it sees fit now there have been uh what the most analysts are calling lip service being paid to civilian casualties there is this map that the Israelis have issued which divides Gaza the entire strip into blocks uh and those blocks are said to uh contain um houses where people or places where people can actually move to if their block gets attacked but most analysts say that is something aimed at the Americans not at the Palestinians living in Gaza they've also been talking about the south of the country now this is a very key element because uh the Israeli Army Chief actually turned around on yesterday and said we will go into the South with the same kind of intensity as we did in the north that's something the Americans simply didn't want us Secretary of State Anthony blinkin was also clear when he was here he said you cannot go into the South with that kind of intensity now there is another delegation that's in town at the moment it's a White House delegation um it's coming from kamla Harris's office her security advisor Phil Gordon H is in town he wants to discuss the day after he's echoing words that we heard the vice president Cala Harris talk about in Dubai there's tremendous amount of pressure now from the Americans not just to think about the military oper ation that's going on right now but they want the Israelis to think about the day after and they're very clear as well no reoccupation of Gaza no displacement of Gaza and limiting civilian casualties but we don't know how much influence they're going to have on the Israelis the Israelis have been very clear and just very quickly before I wrap up on this particular Point there's some very interesting analysis going on in Israeli media that prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is readying himself uh to blame the Americans in case this all fails for not letting him fight the war in the way he saw fit he's already uh leaking to uh various trusted journalists he has within the Israeli media saying that the Americans are limiting him oh that is really interesting you'll continue to follow that anything new in in that space you'll you'll let us know Imran where is public opinion in Israel right now on continuing the war what we're seeing now on the ground versus a new ceasefire to release hostages well the bring them back Campaign which is the umbrella organization that represents the captives families has got a lot of influence in this country he's got a lot of influence amongst public opinion it's a lot of sympathy for those families of the captives uh but they've been very clear they're pushing for a ceasefire now for days they've been asking for a meeting with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the war cabinet that hasn't happened but a breakthrough just a few hours ago they you to meet with the war cabinet and that'll include the defense minister as well you have glant um at around about 8:00 local time and that's where they're going to push their case this is now direct pressure that the families are going to put on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu but Netanyahu and the war cabinet are in a difficult position Hamas now say that they have Israeli military soldiers in captivity uh and those they going to negotiate a lot harder than they did for example over the Israeli civilians that they held in captivity so whether we can see a truce like we did before a ceasefire like we did before um is unclear because Hamas are very clear in what they want they want a almost they want a permanent uh ceasefire in return for those particular hostages Imran Khan reporting from Tel Aviv thank you very much Imran
