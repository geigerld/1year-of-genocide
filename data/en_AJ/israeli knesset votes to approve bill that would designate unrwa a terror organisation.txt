well Israel's parliament has voted to approve a bill that would designate the un's agency for Palestinian refugees as a terrorist organization the bill also calls for a complete severing of ties from unra Israel previously said unrb employees took part in the October 7th attacks but an independent review concluded there's no evidence to back that claim the bill still needs to clear several more steps before being implemented well Chris uh gunnis is a former unra spokesman and he joins us now live from London sir a good day uh want to get your reaction first and foremost to the Israeli knesset approving this draft bill on declaring UNR a terrorist organization well there is absolutely no evidence as provided by the independent Colona report which investigated these allegations it was very clear that Israel has produced abs absolutely no evidence for these allegations so the Israeli parliamentary knesset moves are based on the mother of all lies as far as I'm concerned there is no evidence against unra and let me be clear it is the UN General Assembly the community of civilized Nations that gives anra its mandate and only the UN General Assembly can change that mandate so it is not a question of one UN member State that's gone Rogue that decides that it's going to end the Mandate of unra that's not how it works so I'm afraid to say that unr's life-saving work given what we saw yesterday must and will continue and that is a determination which ultimately rests with the general assembly of the United Nations where there are nearly 200 member states and I I want to talk to you about those overnight horrific scenes that we simply you know cannot be unseen uh the attack on the makeshift ATT tank Camp housing internally displaced persons that was recently established I understand near an UNR Warehouse because it was designated as a safe area I mean at this stage does the responsibility to protect the responsibility to prevent atrocities even apply anymore to Gaza well let's talk about the responsibilities of the 153 State parties to the genocide convention let's talk about the 124 signatories to the Rome statute which sets out the rules of War according to to the international criminal court now the icj just a few days ago made it very clear through its provisional instructions that Israel has to call off its Rafa offensive just three days later what do we have we have this outrageous attack it was clearly disproportionate it was clearly indiscriminate and it took place in an area designated as a safe Zone by the Israeli Army I hope and I'm sure that the United Nations agencies and other intern AAL workers working with Palestinian partners are gathering evidence and I would urge that evidence to be sent immediately to the ha to the international court of justice which has made it clear that people need to be prot be protected from these genocidal attacks and I would hope that the 153 State parties to the genocide convention who have an obligation to make sure that that convention is implemented in full I hope it is urging robust action from that court and as far as the ICC is concerned Kareem Khan the prosecutor at the ICC has made it clear that he would like to see arrest warrants for yoav gallant and Benjamin Netanyahu they would have been completely briefed on this attack they will know that there were hundreds and hundreds of people innocent civilians in makeshift tented uh areas near to a un facility when this attack took place they would know that the military Advantage killing two Hamas operatives which apparently is what they say they have done does not justify an attack there has to be um a distinguishing between combatants and non-combatants the Weaponry used has to be proportionate to the military Advantage none of that in this case was followed and I hope that the ICC and the icj will act immediately and robustly because this is a blatant violation of their own rules rules of War what is become now painfully clear is that anra uh uh places are also no longer safe havens I mean the the organization is in the crosshairs but also the schools and all the uh other establishments that were previously run by unra are now a fair game it seems well this is the tragedy that hundreds of thousands of people thought that they could take refuge under the light blue un flag they thought that if they came to International facilities that they would be safe and what has Israel done it is said no nowhere is safe in Gaza and that's why it's so important that the offensive must be called off immediately and that International Justice must run its course I'm sure that the three judges at the pre-trial chamber in um in the ICC that kareim Khan is asking um for these arrest warrants against Gant and Netanyahu I'm sure those three judges are as horrified as the rest of the world um about these attacks and let us pray that in the most appalling circumstances what we're now seeing is pressure building up for these arrest warrants to go out and let us pray that those countries those members of the Civilized nations in the world will realize that they have responsibilities to implement these conventions which they have signed up to so let us pray that we're now going to move forward with arrest warrants against golant and Netanyahu they need now to become wanted war criminals and let us pray that the international court of justice will realize that we're now seeing blatant disregard for the genocide convention there is no exception to the genocide convention you can't say well Hamas was sending Rockets from this area no there are no excuses this is the crime of crimes it Brooks no exception and we have to be very clear about this it's not good enough for the Israelis to turn around and say well we killed two Hamas people they fired Rockets into Tel Aviv no the genocide convention is absolute and these provisional measures Brook no exception Chris GIS former anrat
