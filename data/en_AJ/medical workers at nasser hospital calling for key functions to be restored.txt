the World Health Organization says staff and patients still inide the besieged NASA Hospital in hunas need to be transferred elsewhere after being denied entry for days wh staff evacuated 32 critically ill patients earlier this week Israeli troops stormed the hospital last week forcing Palestinians there to flee some 130 severely injured patients remain there though alongside at least 15 doctors and nurses situation is very bad and difficult and O uh patients are without electricity without oxygen the entire neighborhood around here is damaged and destroyed the hospital itself has no electricity has no food has no water there's very few doctors and nurses they're living here in the premises working around the clock you can think about the worst situation ever you you multiply by 10 and this is the the worst situation I have in in my life is the debris the light working in the darkness PA is everywhere okay let's speak now to Dr T Ahmed he's an emergency room physician who spent three weeks volunteering at Nasa Hospital in kanun back in January of this year he joins us now live from Chicago thank you for your time now since you've been at the hospital the Israeli Army has raided al- nassa after a week-long Siege the UN described it as a place of death I believe you been in touch with people colleagues there what have they been telling you I mean they said the last week has been miserable it's been a nightmare the scenes that they're seeing are traumatizing and they're asking for some sort of help they're asking actually not to be evacuated from the hospital but for the hospital to function for the lights to be turned back on for them to get the medicines that they need to treat the 150 patients that remain I spoke to one of the uh general surgeons there the last surgeon remaining in an Nas Hospital Dr khid he sent a message to a group of um of Physicians here in the states and he just asked for us to be able to advocate for the patients that are there he says I'm staring at patients and they need my help they need my care and there's nothing that I can do and he's in this impossible position and this is something that was predicted by the staff when I was there in January as the tanks began getting closer to the hospital complex they told me exactly what would happen they predicted the events as they unfolded they said at first they'll demand an evacuation then you'll see drones asking people to leave then there will be snipers and it will culminate in the a raid of the hospital people being arrested and essentially the hospital rendered dysfunctional or inoperable tell us a bit about your experience at Nasa Hospital in January I mean what were your what were the biggest challenges you were facing then it was it was incredibly overwhelming I mean NASA hospital after shifa was rendered inoperable and raided and Under Siege nasid was the last remaining big hospital in the Gaza Strip it was one of two referral hospitals so the entire Gaza Strip was depending on NASA to receive patients but also to be able to run multiple operating rooms at the same time I remember my first day there just walking through the emergency department and being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of people that were there keep in mind P yunus at the time in January was the center of all military operations for the Israelis and so we were getting every single day multiple waves of trauma patients coming through the emergency department and going into the operating room it was also people who were Sheltering in and around the hospital I mean tens 10,000 people were Sheltering in and around the hospital you saw tents everywhere and we had supplies that we were using and we were very short on very necessary things but it was still operating and functioning it was this Beacon of of of Health for the entire Gaza STP and to watch it over the course of several weeks slowly but surely be you know have the same fate as many of the hospitals in the Gaza Strip it's it's heartbreaking but it's also devastating I mean the Health Care system has collapsed but Nas Hospital shutting down it's a catastrophe people will die because they're not going to get the treatment that they need nasd was so overwhelmed and so packed with people while I was there we were treating patients on the floor um we were looking for mattresses to use for patients because there were no more hospital beds and so it's it was already a tragic scenario but the hosp the Physicians and the nurses at NAS were doing an incredibly heroic job trying to manage now this has become a Horror Story it's become a nightmare I mean it's just it's really depressing to think about and now I'm concerned about IFA hospitals will be next when you were there at this hospital did you ever worry about your safety I mean I think we started really realizing the seriousness of the situation once we started hearing that the bombing from the f-35s was a couple of blocks away when we saw the tank reach the perimeter of the hospital and uh desecrate the cemetery that was across from my window in the hospital every single bomb the hospital would shake and in fact while I was there one of the windows in the emergency department was shelled and broken there were bullets that were sprayed on the wall of the hospital I mean it was it did not feel like a safe place and I remember one of the evenings while I was there that we decided to put the mattresses on the window because we were convinced that a bomb would would go off and the shrapnel would fly through the window killing us or injuring us and many of the Physicians there had been at previous hospitals they had fled from shifa or they had come froma hospital and they told us I mean they said that this is this is kind of the script that plays out is the military starts to get closer and closer to the hospital and then the hospital gets attacked and I remember naively thinking no I mean I don't think the hospital there's no way that the hospital will be attacked I mean I think shifa was such a a colossal mistake it was so sad to see what happened at shifa it's not going to happen to NAS but they but the doctors there were right and I was wrong um it was it was definitely a concerning situation while I was there and after I left it only got worse Israel uh repeatedly making the point that they target hospitals in Gaza because Hamas operate from them did you see any evidence of that I I saw quite the opposite I saw many many kids in these hospitals I saw many injured and wounded children pregnant women I saw people that were Sheltering and were really scared of the consequences of War I didn't see anything like that and I want to just point out that these hospitals are so important for the livelihood of the people in the Gaza Strip it's not just about treating the really injured people or the sick people it's about having a place where people can shelter people can have some some access to some water and having uh every now and then some distribution of food so I think that's the I think that's the way to frame what these hospitals are actually doing they're they're providing a refuge for people who are scared who have lost their homes who have lost family members who are looking for food and water because that's exactly what I saw in Nas Dr th Ahmed thank you for sharing your experience an emergency room physician Nasa Hospital back in January thank thank you for having me
