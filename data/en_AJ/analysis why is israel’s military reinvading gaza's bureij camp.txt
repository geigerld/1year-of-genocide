okay let's bring in Omar ASA he's a professor of security and Military studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies Omar thanks for joining us so of course Israel has launched these two major assaults on the Alm magazi Alber refugee camps knowing full well how densely packed these area areas are with civilians and we all know the consequences of what happens when these areas are targeted nevertheless Israel's pushing ahead with its operation whatever it means so you're absolutely right it's they are very dense area we're talking now about areas that they're not as dense as Rafa where but they are still very dense over 10,000 uh person in per square kilometer uh uh these are the estimates now because of the they're changing because of the movement uh but also they are operating there with the seven armored Brigade so we're talking here not about fighting with light weapons and light infantry but with tanks uh so the seventh armored entered uh the B uh camp and this is a reinforced Brigade so it's not a three Battalion Brigade it's now about five battalions are involved in it uh two of them are special for are paratroopers and the rest are are armored and mechanized so we're seeing heavy metal rolling in in these very dense densely populated areas uh but at the same time these areas were cleared multiple times before and the Israeli Army multiple times said that they cleared uh the the B uh Apparently one of two things either the the strategy is not functioning so it is not working they did not um cut the lines of communications between the Hamas and other military formations and therefore these areas after they leave they come back or um they uh they have bad Intelligence on what's going on there uh or they are attempting to create some uh like we saw in narim and in RAF um strong points sort of a reoccupation of particular parts and staying there to create uh strong points and do these raids every now and then was going to be my next question it's one thing to launch full assaults on these refugee camps it is another thing to hold these positions so they are holding now at least uh along the Gaza strips at least three or or four actually areas so they are holding the buffer zone uh they're holding the narim corridor which divides Gaza into North and and South this is the the carali the second uh bade um The Reserve brigades basically holding this line and then they're holding what I'm seeing from Rafa along the Philadelphia Corridor between Rafa and Sinai uh they are creating new strong points so from based on the the images they are creating at least two of them uh and they are manned by uh some of the uh brigades available they have about six brigades now in Rafa so that's that's a when you say a brigade Brigade how many troops are we talking about that that's an issue now because a NATO Brigade would be between 3,000 to 5,000 men uh but because they have a crisis in Manpower and and in terms of uh Mob izing of the reserves and and and so on uh their brigades seem to be sometimes less than that because they're not full strength brigades so not the all the battalions there so we're talking anywhere between a thousand to 3,000 sometimes more sometimes less the seventh armored now it's a reinforced Brigade so they have like five battalions with within it so the the the range very simply we can put it between roughly 1500 to all the way to 5,000 depends on are they at full strength all the battalions are there uh fully men or not let me ask you about the timing of all of this because the backdrop of course is all of this ambiguity about whether there is a proposal that will be signed up to or whether it will be rejected is the Israeli Army right now using this ambiguity to complete some sort of strategic uh option here or proposal on the ground I don't think there's a strategic option the Prime Minister Netanyahu made it very clear that he's not interested in a permanent ceasefire and therefore the you know why why would they give the captives the the in terms of Hamas uh but what we're seeing is holding specific territory U like the narim corridor uh like the the the strong points they're doing along the salahadin road which divides uh the Gaza Strip into East and West as well so holding these strong points to disrupt the mobility in Gaza including the mobility of the civilians and from there they create like a sort of bases or camps uh or staging areas to attack based on intelligence so if they see a movement or a unit is getting reconstituted from the Hamas side they would launch a air strikes artillery strikes and sometimes raid with with Brigade level uh operations so that that this is not a strategy this is just an operational plan regardless of the humanitarian costs because now we're seeing actually the the the humanitarian uh costs the civilian losses in Rafa since the ra operation has doubled has doubled compared to previous months uh so which tells you that all all these operations in this very dense areas just kill a lot of civilians without achieving the objectives even that of the uh current government and of course in the meantime it's civilians that are hemmed in bearing the consequences of this continued violence Omar asaw many thanks make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
