Palestinians want to see much more of this we're happy with my son's release even though I have another son Muhammad who's still in prison I hope he and my nephews will be released from prison God willing and Israelis want to see much more of this I have to start learning how to breathe again because I really don't remember how to do it I called a friend the moment G was released and I told her I don't remember how to breathe the longer the ceasefire lasts the more captives Hamas says it will release the Israeli military says 145 people taken on October the 7th are still being held in return Israel will continue releasing some of the thousands of Palestinians many held without charge in its jails nowhere does the ceasefire matter more than in Gaza Israel's bombing campaign has turned much of the strip into Wasteland we don't need a truce for one or two days we need a ceasefire because we're very tired and our children are tired we keep searching under the rubble for some clothes for our children the priority is humanitarian Aid under the terms of the agreement more will be allowed into Gaza via the Raffa Crossing with Egypt although the UN has said it's not nearly enough the Cal has allowed some Palestinian farmers in Gaza to gather what olives are left but Israel says it will resume its operation to destroy Hamas this may be the last olive Harvest here Bernard Smith Al jazer
