yet again Israel is accused of committing war crimes against Palestinians This Time by a unbacked commission of inquiry it says hass's October attacks didn't happen in a vacuum Palestinian armed groups also received a share of the blame but who will enforce accountability this is Inside Story welcome to the program I'm NE Barker a report by a un back Commission of inquiry finds Israel has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity during the more than 8 months of war in Gaza It also says Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups violated International humanitarian law during their attack on Southern Israel in October the conclusions follow thousands of interviews with victims and advanc forens analysis of medical reports and satellite images but both a un Security Council resolution and a binding ruling by the un's top Court have failed to Halt Israel's offensive will this damning evidence further isolate Benjamin netanyahu's right-wing government and could it make international support for Israel led by its strongest Ally the US increasingly untenable we'll put these questions to our guests in just a moment but first this report by Michael Apple war crimes and breaches of international humanitarian law just some of the damning findings against Israel in a new UN report report focused it was compiled by an independent Commission of inquiry tasked with investigating events in Palestinian territories and Israel it was no easy task Israel has obstructed the commission's investigations and prevented its access not only to Israel and Gaza but to the occupied Palestinian territory some of the conclusions include Israel used starvation as a method of warfare its troops intentionally attacked civilians and carried out acts of sexual violence amounting to torture it also found the total Siege imposed on Gaza was Collective punishment and that in the occupied West Bank the government was stoking settler violence against Palestinian communities and the only conclusion you can draw is that the Israeli Army is one of the most criminal armies in the world but I'll leave morality to Netanyahu to determin the Israeli Army the IDF is one of the most moral militaries in the world the commission also condemns Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups saying the attacks in southern Israel on October the 7th amount to war crimes but the group argues comparisons shouldn't be drawn with Israel because Hamas Fighters are fighting a genocide carried out by occupying forces the report does however acknowledge that hamas's attack didn't occur in a vacuum that it was preceded by Decades of violence illegal occupation and Israel's denial of Palestinian right to self-determination its recommendations call on the Israeli government to implement a ceasefire in Gaza and comply with the orders of the un's Top Court Israel must immediately hold its military offense reports documenting crimes on both sides are piling up begging the question will accountability become another victim of this war Mike lepple Al jazer for Inside Story okay let's bring in our panel of guests now for more perspective on the report Bill van esfeld is join us from Toronto he's the acting Israel and Palestine associate director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Human Rights Watch in Tel Aviv URI dry is a former Israeli government spokesman and founding president of the Jerusalem Press Club and in London William law is the editor of Arab digest an online current affairs newsletter and a veteran Middle East correspondent welcome all three of you to Inside Story Bill if I can start with you 7,000 pieces of evidence paint an image of these alleged atrocities carried out by both Palestinian fighters on October the 7th and the Israeli military since then over the past many months now the Catalyst of course being the decades long occupation it appears that we cannot when it comes to these findings underestimate what light they shine on the basis of the conflict and how the conflict has uh developed in the very months that it's been underway yeah that's right I think these uh reports from the UN Commission of inquiry on uh International Crimes by Israeli forces as well as by the Palestinian armed groups are important for their conclusion that again as you're as you said this didn't happen in a vacuum that the kinds of atrocity crimes we've been seeing since October 7th um really come out of a context of Decades of impunity for this kind of abuse I mean you uh we've been talking about war crimes in the Israeli Palestinian context crimes against humanity for many many years and victims have never really had any access to Justice there has also been outright denial uh of crimes occurring and blockages of access to Justice by Israel's main Ally the United States over many years at the security Council and in other forums um so you know this these reports are I think adding to the mountain of evidence um that uh you know grave crimes have been committed and they're raising the stakes for the internation community and again to point the finger at the United States which claims to want a rules-based international order when you've got this amount of evidence piling up of the most egregious abuses of that of those International rules you know what are you going to do about it are you going to allow impunity to persist for more decades and see another round of incredible violence like this are you going to finally put some political muscle um and and pressure Israel and pressure the International Community to demand accountability uh at long last well hopefully get stuck into whether or not there is uh political muscle a little bit later on in the program but just to be clear to our viewers this report I have an advanced copy of it here consists of two parallel investigations one focused on the October the 7th attack uh on Israel led by armed Palestinian groups and the other of course on Israel's military response let's get to Israel in a minute but first let's focus on on Hamas because according to the report 800 civilians were among the more than 1200 killed by Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups it includes what the report calls quote sexual and gender based violence against a number of civilians something that has Hamas has always denied also we need to get into specifics here the case of a 79-year-old woman and her 12-year-old autistic granddaughter shot dead apparently because they were slowing down the retreat of the captors the examples go on and on and on orri how do these findings do you think shape our understanding of October the 7th and what will Israel make make of these allegations against Hamas well uh as you mentioned the the uh the report really uh focuses on on both sides but there's there's cause and effect here which is a sometime people tend to to forget because uh the whole event didn't just happen by itself it happened when Hamas launched this terrorist attack this heinous terrorist attack in October 7th and then what followed was the Israeli response uh which I think any democracy trying to defend the Civ population uh would do so there's a cause and effect here uh and once you put them uh on the on the on the same uh uh scales uh you're missing the point I think there's you mentioned accountability at the beginning uh I think there's one uh word missing in the uh radical Islam vocabulary and that is accountability they launched the 7th October attack and then they cry wol they say oh my God see what happened because of this um don't don't do it don't launch this October 7th and you don't get the the rest of it okay I'm going to put the next question to to William because Hamas has accused the inquiry of equating the victim with the Executioner of parting unsubstantiated claims about what Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups may have done on October the 7th what does that response from Hamas say to you about how it regards this investigation and indeed others William well it says to me that Hamas like Israel is prepared to attempt at least to walk away from uh the implications of this I think very well balanced report and uh and I disagree that uh this event 7th of October simply occurred there was a context it came out of a long long history of uh suppression of Palestinian rights and Palestinian aspirations and and I think that Hamas needs to take more responsibility we we know that Hamas uses civilians as Shields they've done it that does not in any way make acceptable what the Israelis the IDF has done in response the diaa doctrine so-called the disproportionate use of force the targeting of civilian uh infrastructure of uh of residences of so-called safe areas uh clearly this has gone Way Beyond anything that is acceptable uh both sides are guilty of war crimes both sides need to accept responsibility I doubt that either side will and you know we we we will I think discuss accountability but it's going to be very difficult to achieve accountability in in this sort of a landscape let's gentlemen move on to what the report says about Israel by far the Lion Share the report details a catalog of unbridled violence starvation as a weapon of war the collective punishment and displacement of civilians and intentional violence against civilians not to mention torture abuse sexual humiliation of detainees at the hands of of course the decades long occupa occu occupation um the commission basically said they are so overwhelmed with the amount of evidence that they have to to Wade through it's difficult to know where to start Bill are we scratching the surface here given that uh this investigation only deals with the first three months of the conflict yeah the number of reports coming out are growing and weighty and yet the scale of the abuses uh that have happened since October 7th are are so massive that I think I think you're right um we are just sort of at the tip of the iceberg in terms of what's known so many families have been destroyed so many people have been killed so many children have lost one or both parents um you know the number of kids who have lost their legs who have been uh amputated by the war is is an estimate we don't even know how many people are buried under the rubble um you know or who may people may have died of starvation or or preventable disease um you know as you say the list really goes on and so does the conflict and so do the war crimes so you know there's I think unfortunately no um alternative but to continue documenting uh to continue trying to apply pressure on the parties to finally begin to uphold their U minimum obligations under the under international law and just one one response um the idea that this is cause and effect that you know what is that everything that has flowed since October 7th was the result sadly or tragically of of what happened on October 7th well you know absolutely not um the the the international law is based on the very basic idea that war crimes and criminal activity atrocities by one side do not ever justify atrocities war crimes by the other side so imposing a total Siege and Collective punishment on more than two million people is absolutely unnecessary and unjustified in uh in in Pursuit Of War goals um that's the sort of thing these reports keep telling us uh but unfortunately the parties are not listening um Ori Israel says in response to the release of this report that it is quote reflect of systematic anti-israel discrimination that seems to almost mirror what um Hamas said in response Israel complains about a quot quote false equivalence between Hamas and the Israeli military is that defensiveness you think shared by the Israeli people at large well first of all I I just want to remind us that I'm not in any of official capacity now so I speak only for myself but I know that others in Israel uh don't pull this uh automatic uh card of everybody's anti Israel um yes I I think by the way Israel would be smart to launch its own investigation uh which we talk about but unfortunately it doesn't happen now because then it at least uh the world or the the the global Community would have seen that Israel is really checking itself but I think majority of Israeli believe that uh when judging Israel people take put Israel on a higher uh standard High higher pedestal than than other democracies uh fighting terrorism and by the way people most people here don't believe I person don't believe and I know it's not the case with Israel to Target civilians intentionally we go out of our way not to uh to do that but as was mentioned already Hamas is uh known for uh surrounding itself with the human shields uh so it's very difficult for the Democracy like Israel uh to uh defend itself and to uh achieve its War goals uh legally uh if you if you wish uh in fighting such conditions okay so I would say no I don't think all the world is against Israel I think Israel should have uh checked itself first but uh at the same time certain things are expected from Israel that are not expected from other democracies talking talking about Israel needing to to check it self William Israel has long claimed to be amongst the most moral armies in the world I mean those claims appear to be withering in the daylight when we look at the details of this report yes and not not just in the details of this report but what goes on day in day out um the argument of self-defense yes but that's been stretched the furthest possible limits of of cruel absurdity this is not not self-defense this is uh carrying out an attack ruthlessly on civilian targets and you know you've got to say and I and I really am often when I hear it astonished at at Israelis either whether they're speaking on behalf of themselves or government officials saying that the IDF applies more stringent rules in in its use of of of weapons than any other Army in the world we are held to a higher standard than any other democracy the numbers speak for themselves the numbers are awful they're simply awful I mean we're approaching 40,000 killed close to 100,000 wounded two-thirds of them women and children this is not acceptable it's not acceptable for Israel which says it is a democracy to be justifying this Slaughter of civilians okay Gentlemen let's uh move on and talk about the expectations and the limitations of uh this report because one of the interesting aspects that it reveals uh are the lengths that Israel appears to have gone to to obstruct the investigation process itself and a little bit earlier on I spoke to Franchesca albanesi the UN special rapor on the occupied Palestinian territories who uh weighed in on that here's what she had to say Israel obstructed the commission of inquiry an international Commission of inquiries access to victims hostages survivors Witnesses why why what is uh what what does Israel fear of being exposed well I wonder if you can answer Franchesca Alban's question there what is Israel afraid of why does it feel that it needs to put stumbling blocks in the road for these investigators trying to shed light to the world about what's been happening in this conflict well Israel's refusal to cooperate in obstruction of um the work of the commission of inquiry is really a part of a pattern um Israel has not cooperated with u most United Nations um investigations we have the international court of justice itself having issued a provision measure a binding order on Israel to allow genocide investigators into the Gaza Strip uh that has not happened um indeed I believe the Rafa border crossing uh was was pretty much burned down and has been has been shut um you know uh Human Rights Watch is not allowed into uh the Gaza Strip through Israel other independent investigators are not allowed in um you know foreign journalists have been have have not been allowed in so yes this raises this rhetorical question from the special reporter from franches Alban what is what is being hidden you know it's not really being hidden that well because look at the commission of inquiries Reports look at a lot of other independent and very credible um uh sources of information about all the war crimes that have been going on um crimes against humanity in Gaza also against Palestinian detainees also in the West Bank which is more accessible um you know but trying to uh hide the evidence and trying to attack the investigator or attack the messenger of of of the news about these crimes um it's a tried and true method uh this is not the first time and again we need political pressure on Israel um to stop that and as your other guest said you know we would also very much like to see um uh Hamas and the Palestinian armed groups uh fully participating taking this very seriously taking these um you know well documented um uh crimes uh committed on October 7th seriously uh to prevent their repetition but it has to happen um you know at a at a large scale it's got to it's it's got to involve uh the participation and pressure um on on Israel as well let's drill down into the whole issue of accountability because specifically the report accuses Israel of quote undermining the possibility of future judicial proceedings accountability and Justice I mean gentlemen given the failure of multiple un resolutions in the past given the complete disregard for the provisional measures issued by the international court of justice and the Hague over concerns that a genocide is underway in Gaza given the fact that there's been this application for arrest warrants for Netanyahu and the defense minister by the international criminal court I mean what difference at all will this report make to anything yeah what what impact will it have well as as you say it's a long long and pretty dismal record of uh un resolutions of Investigations of condemnations that Israel has chose to ignore chose to avoid and by and has done very very successfully um I do think however that this report because it is so forensic and really shocking in its detail and you mentioned this NE that the reading of it is is is very Grim uh for both what Hamas did but what the IDF uh has done and continues to do and I think that's the point for me uh Israel says it is a democracy Hamas describes as as as a terrorist entity Hamas is behaving in a way that many find reprehensible but Israel is a democracy here and Israel is behaving in a reprehensible way so I do think that it's this report will make it more difficult for Israel's friends and allies to sustain their support to sustain the Nar that Israel is the only victim here and that any criticism uh of how the Israelis are conducting this war is ipof facto uh anti-Semitism and I think that that narrative is faltering and I think it's faltering it's certainly faltering here in the UK I think that Joe Biden is finding it increasingly difficult to hold that line particularly when Netanyahu as he did on Tuesday says you're not giving us bombs you're the reason why we haven't won this war which you know again is it's a statement but it also shows the contempt that netan has for Biden and you know if he's doing that with his great great friends think about the impact it's having in other parts in Europe for example and the global south of course is completely lost to Israel now uh or is it possible to fairly describe this as contempt for Net who's closest high the United States and indeed others well United States is still Israel's closest Ally but uh I I I was dismayed to see my prime minister uh talking like this about the greatest friend of Israel Joe Biden and and and therefore me like many others in Israel would uh uh not shed tears if netan would leave us alone and and we'll will will form a another government which will act more sanely especially Visa V our greatest friend but I just want to say that Israel would be smart uh to hold its own investigation uh because that would EX at least show that as a democracy uh it is looking into seriously into what it's do also I should mention this suspicion that many Israelis have towards these kind of Investigation especially from the UN when when Israel has been picked uh uh is the is is the parah state I I understand that that it is of course in Israel's interest to want to potentially discredit how rigorous this investigation is but do you think anybody will credibly take a investigation by Israel into potential war crimes carried out by Israel seriously I think so yes but at the same time I listen to whates Al said and I think Israel should have uh done better and coordinated with the with this I remember the Goldstone report uh the government here refused to cover it and only later much later when it did collaborate uh Goldstone himself changed his his tone and report so uh I think the idea of not cooperating is not a good idea okay uh but at the same time I I mentioned the suspicion that many of us have against these kinds of reports um very lastly I want to turn to you Bill if I may because I wonder to what extent findings like this lead us closer to Prosecuting perhaps the the bigger most overarching key allegation leveled at Israel which is of course the decades long occupation of Palestinian land yeah the um the issue of occupation and let me just turn for a second to the issues of apartheid and the settlements because there's a whole lot of international crimes that are relevant here and you know the I C uh prosecutor as you mentioned has applied for arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders as well as two Israeli uh leaders but all the arrest warrants so far are just for events since October 7th but the ICC has jurisdiction going back many years before that and a lot of people in the human rights movement um have been pushing the prosecutor to seriously consider investigating and and and Prosecuting people for the settlements regime as well as for the crime against ity of apartheid so it's you know the context here is one of as as has been said many decades of crimes but some of those are among the most serious crimes uh on the books what we need now just to end with in terms of what we really need uh for accountability look International Justice is a long game uh prosecutions may not happen very soon what we could use right now is a suspension of arms transfers okay Bill I'm gonna have to wrap up the conversation there we've reached the end of the program Bill van esfeld URI dromy and William law pleasure to have all three of you on Inside Story and thanks to Franchesca albanesi for her input and thank you too for watching you can see the
