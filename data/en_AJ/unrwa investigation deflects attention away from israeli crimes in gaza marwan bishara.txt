stay with our top story for a moment and the findings of the unwa report we'll bring in Marwan bishara he's Al jazer senior political analyst joining us from London mwan um good to have you with us again for you what was the takeaway message from the report and the findings that onor is an excellent UN agency the very few things mentioned in the report that are worthy of recommendations must be made to any agency or in fact any Ministry or any government in the world it is uh the nature of Institutions anywhere uh to be evaluated to be reviewed to be audited and recommendations to be made I think honor has gained excellent uh credit out of this despite the intentions of those who wanted to audit it in order to get bad reviews for the organization there's some reaction coming through one notable one is from the Secretary General Anton teris and he's put out a relatively short statement mwan saying that the Secretary General accepts the recommendations contained in Miss kona's report to what extent do you think that the Secretary General here is walking a sort of diplomatic tight rope because on one hand he wants the the unat to support Palestinians but on the other hand he wants to restore some of the funding cuts that have uh taken place recently that's a very good point and I agree 100% I think he he is walking at I Trope but he's also would like to put the whole issue behind him because if you see the whole point of raising uh the the the problem with onor credibility on the part of Israel and some of its backers is is a is an exercise of deflection just when Israel uh became Infamous uh for its uh Slaughter in Gaza including the killing of some 15 the own was staff by the beginning of January that's when Israel uh started surfacing these rumors about some handful if you will of Honor was staff maybe 12 among 13,000 being imp being implicated somehow we don't know there's no evidence in October 7 so the idea of deflection I think now has basically failed you could say although the media Contin to be consumed by accusations against hwa I think the report could put an end at least uh the beginning of an end we will wait for the second report to come out whereby uh the Western backers of Ona have no excuse uh to unfreeze uh the funds and to continue to support this indispensable un organization when it comes to these claims that Israel had put forward that there were Hamas members involved in the October 7th attack this report spec this report was not looking into these claims but what it did reveal is that Israel has yet to provide supporting evidence of its claims that there were members of Hamas involved in the October 7th attacks why do you think that Israel has still not provided such evidence well most probably because it doesn't have it uh and because as I said the whole issue from its start was an issue of deflection uh basically for focusing on H instead of focusing on Israel's unraveling genocide in plain sight it's worth remembering that probably the most important IE eyewitness aside from some of our other independent journalists is honor there is no better eyewitness than a UN agency with thousands upon thousands of employees being there in the midst of War I think they were uh the primary eyewitness against what was happening to their schools their students their uh educational and other institutions and so it was the intent of Israel to uh basically uh plant the seed of doubt about Ona so that Ona couldn't be a credible witness to what is happening the second important thing about this is that none of it started even on October 7 if you remember the r it was Israel and the infamous Jared Kushner in the Trump Administration that tried to bury onad freeing its funds and basically uh insulting or or doing everything possible to end its services because ending Ona is meant to end the Palestinian refugee question and this remains to be the case today an attempt at undermining hona undermine the refugees and their rights including their inable rights for return because after all they were dis place in our time of War will this report modan make a difference in terms of restoring that funding we know that in the US Congress has passed a bill meaning there is no funding for unur until 2025 and then the UK the ruling conservatives obviously they have a uh somewhat significant pro-israeli Lobby so will this report change their minds but this is the thing right I mean it is the reality of life that some of the main backers of Honor are the backers of Israel and to cleanse some of their sins and their support of Israel it's aparted and its occupation oppression is by the crumbs of the table that are set to the Palestinians I think the answer here should be that they should be ashamed of the themselves and they should restore one one way or another Biden maybe I don't know exactly he could have executive authority to do something about that same thing in here in Europe but I think more importantly the the I think those who have been outspoken at the United Nations uh in favor of Palestinian rights like Russia like China like other countries who have been quite bombastic in their support they should step up why should it be Germany and the United States and not other countries we know for example that Saudi Arabia is probably the third or the fourth largest contributor I think some other countries like China needs to step up and take up their International responsibilities they need to walk their talk if Western countries don't then they should step in and be the champions of human rights in the Middle East okay Maran bashara thank you so much for joining us from London make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from
