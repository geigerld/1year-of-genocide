the night in Gaza brings no resite for Palestinians only more death and destruction the Israeli Army says it hit 320 targets during the night children are among the victims about 2,000 killed so far throughout the attacks medical and rescue crews worked in the dark to pull people out from under the rubble the only lights torches and car headlamps electricity is scarce in the strip that's under a complete blockade by Israel rescue workers and volunteers are sent scrambling when another Israeli bomb Falls nearby those rescued are taken to the few remaining hospitals still functioning but even there they face constant threat another bomb exploded near the alud hospital creating Panic for those inside we were told that KH Unice is considered to be a safe place and everyone came here from the North or from Gaza City but unfortunately last night was the hardest night so far we saw in Khan Unice but in this war there is nowhere safe in this 45 km long strip of land when we moved to Kan Yunis with my family there were 17 of us then after the Israelis hit us and betrayed us there's only four of us left I can understand how the four of us will live and how we will return to our home in gazi after 17 of us used to live together this is a real nightmare one I will never forget for the rest of my life but not everyone can be rescued treated or helped the number of dead keeps mounting four children from the same family were killed in a strike in ruer in Gaza they wait for the morning to assess the damage but the dust never settles here it covers the dead and injured asag Al jazer
