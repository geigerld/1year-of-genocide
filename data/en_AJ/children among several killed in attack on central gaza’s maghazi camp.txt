we begin in Gaza where Israel is continuing its attacks across the strip at least 20 Palestinians including children have been killed in Israeli strikes on the al- magazi and nus camps in central Gaza eyewitnesses say a group of children were playing near a camp for displaced families let's bring in our correspondent hanim makm he's joining us live from Rafa in southern Gaza and the latest Israeli strike killing children in a playground hny what are you hearing about the terrible attack on magazi refugee camp which has been the sight of so many attacks yes well this particular attack is one of so many attacks happen across the Gaza Strip deliberate attacks taking place all over the Gaza Strip just feeding into one conclusion Gaza has evolved into a Killing Zone as the Israeli military deliberately targeting everyone right now including children and what we're seeing is a playground that happened to be located in a busy Marketplace area in Al magazi a refugee camp this place has been repeatedly attacked in the past and since the beginning of this genocidal War but what we're seeing right now is uh no no terms in the attacks on the children and the fact we're seeing here those children of displaced families and as a father of children who understand these difficult times it's hard to keep the children inside inside tents or or other people's residential home just given the fact that there are no schools no no sport clubs nothing to keep them entertained and while at the same time they want to stay safe keep them safe and protected it is always good to give them a little bit of a freedom just to release some of the negative energy that they have been piling up since the beginning of the world only to be targeted and killed at this playground and one wonder what have these kids done to be killed in this way and it's just so horrific the scenes that we we looked at and the footage emerging from the the playground in Al Camp close to 20 people as I said it's a busy Marketplace area where the playground is located and at the attack happened at a very at a rush hour where everybody's trying to get what they are able to get from whether Food Supplies or water supplies and get back to their homes and of course Hy they join the 14,000 other children who have been killed in Gaza since October 7th gaza's Health Ministry saying that 46 people have been killed 110 injured in attacks over the past day yes absolutely and it it fits consistent with the narrative made by UNICEF who describ Gaza Strip largely as a graveyard full of children given the zero and shattered sense of safety not only for adults and and other people but also also for it children and we seen this pattern happening the fact that there are 14,000 children have been killed since the beginning of this genocidal war and thousand other are missing with other family members and it trapped under the rebels and indic is an indication that there are no limits and no terms of this war and as I stated earlier the Israeli military is pushing Gaza to evolve into a Killing Zone because everywhere you go you will see Road fill rubbles you see destroyed buildings damaged healthc care facilities and destroyed the schools and infrastructure that turn into pile of rebels the entire Gaza STP turned into uh pretty much a wasteland that is not suitable for living that is soon enough will become uninhabitable just given the patterns of of bombings and attacks across the trip honey thank you very much for that that's honey mm joining us live from Rafa and Southern Gaza let's get more on the humanitarian Ian situation in Gaza joining us now from Rafa is akmed halabi he's executive director of the aid organization rakma worldwide thank you for your time can you tell us about the work that your organization is doing in Gaza in terms of who you're helping and how um hello uh so arriving here to Gaza uh last night with a convoy of the medical Mission a medical Miss rahma Medical mission number eight uh coming here to as part of what we're doing in alleviating the pain and helping Humanity uh we have 26 doctors from all different Specialties uh and critically uh uh individuals who will uh operate and uh help the people and the wounded uh in addition to that uh it we will we will send 13 doctors uh of very highly specialized uh persons and medical professionals to North Gaza so this is going to be our first uh attempt and in coordination with the local authorities to be in North Gaza starting tomorrow and operating on individuals there in addition to that uh we have so far provided over 130 containers full of medical supplies food baskets and uh shelter items so far into Gaza and uh starting tomorrow we will also provide uh the convoys going into North Gaza for the very first time okay Mr halabi the doctors that have come into Gaza are they working in in the hospitals in Gaza and if so what are the conditions that they finding in the hospitals yes so they will be joining in the European hospitals and Sh ala Hospital in addition to the other hospitals that uh the 13 medical doctors going into the north Gaza uh one of the hospitals that will be operating is Kamal adwan of course as we know Kamal adwan has been hit uh but it's operating about 30% at this point and the doctors that are going are from Orthopedics and cardiovascular and uh other Specialties who is needed in that area um and and uh yeah okay your organization I understand Works to help some of the most vulnerable in Gaza including women and children tell us about some of the the conditions that these groups are dealing with on the ground that you can see well as we can see um hundreds and thousands of people are U Ling all over the place uh inside the hospitals the conditions are extremely dire uh people are taking shelter inside the hospitals uh just to stay safe and to stay close to the medical facilities uh many of those individuals have families are being treated or they're just staying because they are displaced from the north and from different areas uh so the displacement is a huge problem uh We've as we know in in Al in Rafa City only uh about 1.5 million people have been displaced and uh hundreds of thousands of other people have been displaced from different cities into the Rafa area so this is creating a strain on the limit on the resources which is are extremely limited and uh the authorities here are uh you know trying to deal with the masses and helping what they can but of course the resources are extremely uh thin and uh we need all of the assistance and the help uh that uh we can be provided yeah and given you know 1.5 million people that's nearly 34s of gaza's population crammed into Rafa on the border with Egypt just how concerned are you about Israel's you know stated plan for an attack on Rafa well this is extremely concerning especially from the medical point of view um having already as strained medical facilities uh many of those have been decommissioned and they're out of service and to add uh more uh injuries and wounded uh that will require more medical need uh is is extremely difficult for all the doctors that are treating we know that many people are waiting in line for some surgeries that will take many weeks uh or waiting for a doctor that will come from outside to operate on that uh uh on those cases so um you know any any further escalation of the situation will only uh exacerbate current resources and make it difficult for the uh convoys to uh conduct its humanitarian work Ahmed halabi of
