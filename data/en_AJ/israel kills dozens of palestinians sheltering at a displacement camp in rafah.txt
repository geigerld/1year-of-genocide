[Music] we're breaking into programming now to take you to Rafa where at least 28 people have been killed in an Israeli strike in Northwestern Rafa the tents of displaced people Sheltering in the city near United Nations relief agency warehouses were hit the injured have been taken to the city's Kuwait Hospital eyewitnesses reported that the tents of the displaced people caught fire after the shelling hind Al is on the phone for us now from De alala H can you just bring us up today with the latest uh from this air strike there in Northwestern Rafa okay so the Israeli forces targeted a makeshift tent with eight Israeli air strikes this is a place where what classified by the Israeli forces as a humanitarian area and it was safe as they claimed um at least 27 Palestinians have been killed we have been seeing footage emerging online we we see how the bodies of people of have have being burned um we're talking about uh 28 Palestinians and the number is likely to increase because the ambulances and the civil defense teams are still uh transferring um those Palestinians into uh the hospitals there's only one Hospital currently facilitating in ra which is the Kuwaiti hospital that only has eight beds but we ALS also knew that some of the injuries are also being transferred to the IMC field medical Point um again this was a Target uh for a makeshift tent near the hona logistic space in t suan uh it's located in the western part of raah uh these uh the the targets were T makeshift tent where thousands of Palestinians remained in that area because they thought that if was a safe area uh mainly people in tents were targeted um there are more people injured and the the footage that is emerging online is very terrifying we're seeing um people that are not being able to be recognized because their bodies were completely uh damaged and it's not only that the Israeli forces carried a couple of air strikes also in West parts of Rafa after this target it's intensifying and it's also escalating and we've been watching these pictures come into The Newsroom and uh we're seeing people trying to put out these uh fires that are spreading from one t to the next these makeshift shelters that people have been having to live in for months now can you just give us an idea of what if any sort of Emergency Response there will be to help uh these displaced people put out these fires immediately well actually we're talking about civil defense teams with zero capabilities uh trucks uh and uh ambulances and like uh firefighters do not even have fuel to transfer and to help cope this fire because there has been no fuel entering the goles strip for more than two weeks now after the Israeli forces started their military operation in dra it as you know tents are very fragile and and and Flames are are are are firing up all of the makeshift tent um it's it's it's very horrifying what we're seeing but we are expecting more displacement tomorrow as there are still thousands of Palestinians still in the western part of RAF C can you just uh give us a bit more detail about the hospital capability uh there in Rafa obviously we know that uh they've been shelled and and attacked multiple times but so just the lack of supplies that they have to keep operating and how that is going to affect the dozens of people um that no doubt will be being tried to be rushed to hospital as quickly as possible to to treat no doubt what are going to be severe burns from this fire well the only Hospital still operating in uh is the Kuwaiti hospital and it's not really a hospital because it doesn't have that ICU unit so it's only a medical point with only eight B we're talking about at least 27 Palestinians that were killed and dozens of people injured so the hospital does not really have the capability to treat and to give medication to all of these injured people also there is a couple of medical hospitals field hospitals in RAF but unfortunately there's no fuel for ambulances to go back and forth and to transfer all of these injuries again for more than two weeks now Z fuel have entered two hospitals or two uh ambulances so it's very hard and challenging to operate but the civil defense teams and the emergency people are trying their best to rescue as much people children and women as possible and and earlier uh alasan Brigade said that it had fired a large barrage of rockets uh towards Tel Aviv uh the armed wing of AAR said it launched that attack from in southern Gaza is this the area in Northwest Gaza where we're seeing these pictures coming in where this latest Israeli strike has happened is this the area where Hamas fired these Rockets from well actually no because a very viral image that was taken by an Israeli soldier today was from uh was taken from the RAF Crossing which is the in the eastern part of Rafa and not the western part of Raa what has been targeted with eight air strikes today is the Northern Western part of RA which is also classified by the Israeli forces as a safe humanitarian area and ask people from Eastern ra to evacuate to this area so no it was not the same area and again this area is full of displaced people it's a makeshift tent it's a huge makeshift tent so there has been no way that the Palestinian Fighters fired Rockets from that area particularly yeah and just for for viewers uh who who are tuning in we have uh received pictures into The Newsroom that we aren't going to show you because they are just so gruesome of many children extremely badly burnt just to point out uh and reiterate hen's point there that these are displaced people women and children uh who have been living in these makeshift tents uh for months now um obviously and uh this comes uh on top of everything that has happened today and because on such a large scale attack like this news spreads fast throughout the strip can you just give us an idea of what the reaction has been there in der Al Bala where you are in other parts of the strip to to this attack that's happened in the last hour or so well actually people are terrified because some of their families made it to to the central part but some of their families are still in that makeshift tent people are horrified and and are feeling very worried they want to make sure that their families are okay but unfortunately there has been no internet connectivity there has been no electricity and Telecommunications are very very hard to reach right now so people are are are are are terrified they're they're in raged because again they thought that this area was a SI sorry I'm just going to have to interrupt you there because a media conference has started with the spokesperson of the health Ministry in Gaza we're going to listening that now and summary executions against displaced people leading to the death of over 190 M murderers inat jabalia and Gaza as well as recently in the governorate of Rafa in southern Gaza moments ago the Israeli occupation committed a horrifying Massacre via targeted shelling and bombardment of the uh bat shelter in Northwest Gaza Israeli war planes targeted the center with over seven missiles and bombs weighing over 2,000 each leading to the death of 30 people as well as dozens of injuries including extremely serious injuries and this means that the over overall number of people who are killed as a result of this massacre is likely to increase these continuing massacres against civilians and displaced people confirm without a shred of doubt that we are witnessing a genocide crime a premeditated crime of genocide it also shows that the Israeli occupation Army is deliberately killing the largest possible number of people particularly civilians and displaced people who tried to escape the fires of War however they were chased by the missiles of the occupation which killed them in Cold Blood this horrifying Massacre sends a clear message from the Israeli occupation and the US Administration to the international criminal court and to all other International courts as well as the International Community and the entire humanity and this message says that the Holocaust of Palestinian civilians continues and that massacres against displaced people and children will continue and that violations of international law will not stop before these horrifying massacres and before this catastrophe of historical proportions and this genocidal War being waged by the Israeli occupation Army the US Administration and their allies who are involved in this war of genocide we would like to hearby reaffirm the following first we continue to condemn the continuation of this war of genocide and these horrifying massacres that continue against displaced people Shel as well as shelters these massacr that over the past 24 hours left over 190 murders as well as dozens of wounded people in jabalia nsat Gaza and moments ago in the RAF governorate we call upon all the nations of the Free World to condemn this brutal crime this heinous crime that is being committed by the Israeli occupation and the Americans second we hold the Israeli occupation the US Administration as well as all countries involved in this genocidal crime such as Germany and other European countries we hold them fully responsible for this genocidal war that continues against our great people of Palestine this war that has left so far over 120,000 people dead including approximately that left 120,000 victims including 36,000 um dead people and over 880,000 wounded people third we call upon

International Court as war criminals who are practicing death using all lethal Weaponry without any limits and without any respect to international law fourth we call upon all the nations of the Free World all International organizations all un institutions to put pressure on the criminal Israeli occupation in order to put an end to this war of genocide that continues to reap additional lives amongst displaced people and civilians and continues to leave more people dead every hour and with every new Massacre we also call for the reopening of the rafah crossing immediately in order to allow thousands of wounded people and patients to travel in order to receive treatments in hospitals outside of the Gaza Strip especially after the Israeli occupation deliberately destroyed the health system completely in the Gaza STP and following the crimes committed by the occupation that resorted to burning hospitals and destroying them completely we also call for the immediate delivery of dozens of field hospitals and medical Crews and delegations to the Gaza Strip in order for them to contribute to saving us from this dire humanitarian and health situation in the Gaza Strip which has headed towards a humanitarian catastrophe that will leave tens of thousands of innocent people dead amongst Palestinians particularly women and children we also call for the delivery of fuel to what remains of our hospitals Health Centers and ambulances which are headed for a disaster save Gaza before it is too late save Gaza before it is too late save Gaza before it is too late glory and immortality to our murderers a speedy recovery to our wounded freedom to our prisoners languishing in occupation prisons and a salute to our great Palestinian people the government media office okay you were listening to the Gaza Health Ministry spokesperson in De alala he called this latest strike a horrific Massacre he said that war planes targeted the center of the tent seven missiles in total were dropped and he said that they chase people as they tried to escape for their lives he said at least 30 people are dead dozens more injured and expects the death toll to rise significantly in the coming hours he said without a shred of doubt this is a premeditated crime of genocide deliberately killing the largest numbers of innocent civilians make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the
