well alerz hany Mahmud joins us now from KH Unis inside the Gaza Strip so hany we're hearing of more strikes ongoing on the jabalia refugee camp there today yeah well that's right Lura So within the past few hours another strike on Gaza largest and biggest and most densely populated refugee camp a residential home was targeted and three people were reported killed right away and more than tens of injuries seriously injured uh Palestinians of residents of that area but stories horror stories uh keep coming from uh the refugee from jabali refugee camp as a direct results of the two massive attacks uh on the refugee of yesterday and the day before uh yesterday with more uh people are still under the rubble and the lack of equipment and Machinery to pull these people out uh there is a fear that the number of people who have been killed in these two strikes is going to uh increase and we know the Indonesian Hospital in the northern part is the only remaining function hospital that received a tsunami of casualties as a result of these uh two attacks forcing the hospitals to operate in under extremely unusual uh conditions the air strikes continue to pound the Gaza Strip everywhere but mainly concentrated right now in center of Gaza City ner Road ner neighborhood it's a road that connecting the northern part the edge of the northern part of of Gaza Strip to Gaza City and also from the East aatini Road the 30th uh Road connecting a densely populated neighborhood the zun neighborhood to the center of Gaza and it's also it's important to mention that a zun neighborhood has been uh the a major Target uh for Israeli air strikes uh people are still trapped and caught in this war zone they could not leave uh their their homes uh because there is no safe passage uh for them to uh to H to the southern part uh as well as major areas in the southern part of gazb are not also safe for evacuees and we've seen in the past few uh uh days how many people were uh were a were a target of Israeli air strikes in zaa area in the central of Gaza uh in kanun city and in Rafa City mainly people who evacuated from Gaza City and the northern part uh to the southern part to find themsel uh getting killed uh by those Relentless air strikes and Har you mentioned the hospitals healthc care facilities across the Gaza Strip collapsing even as we are seeing these images of them being overrun with new waves of casualties yes well unfortunately uh before these two major uh attacks on jabalia refugee camp the the hospital was already uh working under extreme unusual conditions there's shortage extreme shortage of medical supplies and Necessities for the hospital extreme shortage of a fuel uh made the hospital uh to uh and shut down major parts of its Department to concentrate all the resources to the ICU units and the ventilation uh system but as the uh we heard earlier today the major power generators has been completely shut down it's out of service and the hospital uh is running on subordinate small power uh generators but uh these power generators are not enough they're only going to work for just a limited period of time and as soon as they are they're off because of of of lack of a fuel uh the the hospital will just turn into a standing facility with no medical services whatsoever this is the fear that uh thousand of people have inside the hospital whether their patients injured Palestinians or those who are killed inside the the refrigerators the they being stored there uh the fear that is going to create a a healthy crisis as a result of this okay hany Mahmud brings the very latest there on the situation inside Gaza from khus in southern Gaza thanks very much hany
