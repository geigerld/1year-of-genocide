we have a team of correspondents deployed across the region Stephanie DEA is in Israel very close to the Border fence with Gaza Muhammad Jam Jun is in occupied East Jerusalem but we start inside Gaza with TK Abu AUM and TK we understand Israel has agreed to a US request to turn the water back on to parts of Southern Gaza as far as you know has that happened yet well it has not yet been confirmed that the Israeli occupation authorities have provided a Gaza strap with water sources uh no official uh Source had claimed that or even state that to Palestinian people uh the Palestinian inside the Gaza Strip are still suffering from a a sharp shortage of water sources they are struggling to find water access on daily basis they every day get up early walk to uh residential uh residential buildings or try to ask people to uh to give each other water they go to United Nations affiliation Affiliated schools they also are are trying to afford for them a proper for supplies despite the great shortage that the Palestinian Market is really witnessing due to the massive consumption of Food Supplies inside Gaza stro also the blackout of electricity inside Gaza is a main factor that uh even providing water to the Gaza Strip won't be enough simply because without electricity gazans won't be able to fill the the water tanks so uh with the black with the ongoing black out of electricity inside Gaza uh the humanitarian crisis inside the Gaza Strip will continue and will deteriorate more and throughout all of this uh TK the Israeli bombardment has continued today again well yes uh the is the Israeli occupation air forces are resuming their attacks on the Gaza Strip different areas in the Gaza Strip were hit by the Israeli air strikes our Medical Teams here inside the human the Naser hospital as we are right now standing are trying to do their best in order to provide different kinds of treatment to Palestinian injured people we're talking about one of the areas that had been recommended to evacuate to by the Israeli occupation authorities meanwhile this time medical team's family members become the target of the Israeli air strikes in this hospital here right now in khuna city today a very shocking event took place one of the doctors who is working inside the hospital as he was doing his job and providing a treatment to different injured people due to the Israeli strikes he found out that one of the victims was his uh son and different members of his family were critically wounded due to the Israeli ongoing strike so what we can witness right now inside the Gaza Strip is considered to be a collective punishment for more than 2.3 million Palestinians okay thank you so much TK we really do appreciate uh you bringing us continued coverage from with inside Gaza that is TK Abu AO we're joining us by phone from Southern Gaza is Muhammad Abu mhib Deputy medical coordinator with Doctors Without Borders thank you very much uh for for taking time to talk to us here on elazer now from what I understand you've been displaced uh to the South where you are now but you're not able to work for Doctors Without Borders anymore uh to be I mean clear no one we are not able to function anymore I mean really we are let's say we are not able to provide any support any medical services to the patients that we are following so more than 1,000 patients with burn we are not able to reach them they are not able to reach us the the medical staff are not able to access our uh facilities our our facilities are closed I mean the only thing that we managed today is to uh donate the rest of the medical uh disposable drugs that we have in our uh stores to to the hospital mainly to sh hospital and is it duud to safety concerns that you're not able to operate anymore sorry is it because of safety concerns that you're not able to operate anymore I mean there's no movement I mean people are displaced I mean me personally I was theed I was asked to the place to to leave Gaza City and to find uh according to the Israeli like to go to the south of the city so it's it's all the medical most of the medical stuff that we have they took their families to find shelters in the south I mean people are Sheltering even in the hospitals I mean I mean the hospitals are no more hospitals they are shelters and full of dead body you can feel the smell of the body in all the hospitals of Gaza I'm not speaking about cha in the middle Area Hospital in South N Hospital you can smell the the the smell of bodies you can smell I mean the the sewage system is not functioning anymore uh people are uh standing in cues to use the uh the tolet of the hospitals I mean it's it's chaotic a lot of medical stuff are not able to come to the hospital to support I mean sometimes the a the surgical operations are only done by the surgeon himself and anesthesia doctor so there's no more nurses in the in the in the operating room it's a matter of access people are not feeling safe I mean at all to go to the hospital they are trying to find place to shelter and stay alive to find food to find drinkable water which is a a big a big issue now in in all Gaza STP no drinkable water I did just want to ask you about the water because we've just heard that uh Israel has agreed to a US request to turn the water back on in parts of Southern Gaza but to your knowledge that hasn't happened yet not yet I mean until until today at morning me personally I was searching for drinkable water to to have to have drinkable water there's no drinkable water I mean I heard this the news that they will open the water supply again isra will open the uh but nothing on the ground yet we didn't feel it okay the main constraint for the population now what I see and not a witness is the drinkable water food and finding shelters there is no shelter they are asking the people to leave Gaza City and the North to the South but there is no space in the sou people are sleeping in the streets now yeah as as a doctor who I imagine has worked in uh some horrendous situations how does this compare especially when you're not seemingly able to do anything when clearly there are so many people in need I mean uh I mean people are calling me for help medical so the only thing I give them medical advice on phones uh I mean that's what I could do or address them to the office still we have one of our uh security staff member who's still in the office in Gaza City I'm I'm addressing people to go there to pick sometime medical supplies dressing kits uh for for their wounds I mean there's no one I mean no medical stuff are able to to go to the facilities we are not able to function at all this is what I can say I mean doors Z borders we are not able to function at all our activities in Gaza in this kind of situation is there any hope left in Gaza at this point in time I mean there is a I mean people are shocked people are shocked with this uh aggressive uh retaliation I mean uh bombing everywhere uh collateral damage is all of the all all of the victims now what you see in the hospitals more than 60% are children and women I mean people are are shocked just to say shocked and they have no hope they don't know what is the next scenario is today they are asked to move from the north of Gaza and Gaza City to the South tomorrow they're expecting that they will move okay thank you um for that that is Muhammad Abu mugas Deputy medical coordinator with Doctors Without Borders speaking to us from inside Gaza
