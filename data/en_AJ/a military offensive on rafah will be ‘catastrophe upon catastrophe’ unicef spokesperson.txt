I'm joined Now by James Elder from UNICEF he is in Geneva what do you fear will happen if there is an allout assault on ruer where do people go we're just going to see catastrophe upon catastrophe I think your your your last viewer and your correspondent captured it perfectly there's nowhere to go now this this idea of safe zones that was first moted in in November completely ignored the fact that a safe Zone can't it's not about just not bombing it although safe zones have been bombed it's about making sure people have access to water and sanitation and food and by virtue of in Rafa recently until this morning the average person had about one liter of water per day per person one liter way underneath any sense of emergency humanitarian guidelines now they're being forced to move again to carun I was in car unus last month carus is Rubble as as your correspondent said Derry berler is under under immense attack so we have language is very important here the idea that people can go somewhere safe after they've moved four or five times or the children I've met who are intense in Raa having been in a hospital with amputations and they should still be in a hospital but such as the crazy number of children with wounds of War there's a turnover rate European Hospital of course the biggest functioning Hospital still in Gaza my understanding is in that evacuation Zone that's 20,000 people taking shelter much less than the many hundreds and brave health staff so but as mindboggling as this is it seems to be happening and it will be horrific so just to be clear about this if people do have the option of being able to leave if if they are able bodied enough to be able to move there's nowhere to go but as you were saying you spent some time in Khan yunes you say it's rubble and inside the European Hospital which I think is you know one of the last functioning hospitals in Gaza it's also very important because it supplies some of the the smaller facilities that might still be functioning you say that it's crammed with severely injured and dying children so you know those people who have had amputations or are suffering from injuries are not able to move so there is nothing left for them to do but to to sit there and wait well I think people you've seen some people again those some people are seeking to move who can remembering that it's also a little bit about Finance this as finances at this point not everyone has the funds to move across Gaza again having had their coping capacity smashed but yes there are a large number of people there are children there are wounded children there are sick people we know that the sheer lack of Aid that's been able to get in the way people have been deprived of nutrition and water we have a lot of malnourished children and there are the elderly you know UNICEF an agency like us yes we work for children but I'm well aware of the elderly whove moved four or five times and do not have the ability to move again to a tent on a very very crowded overcrowded Beach um where there's no sanitation so this is the reality that people have now been faced with and we are told of course that this will be I think the word is a limited offensive okay but I was in the the south of of the Gaza Strip on my first mission in November and we were told that there's no way the South would endure the same ferocity of the north and now we have carun which is Devastation like no one has ever seen before so we going to see that again in Rafa a we will see a lot of people killed in bombardment B disease which is already taking root will spread like wildfire FL fire and then when this is done then there is nowhere in Gaza then you are talking about Rubble so it's a ceas fire it's hostages home relief to those starving these fighting parties have to for one focus on the civilians and the children of Rafa James on that point on October 31st you UNICEF said that Gaza is a graveyard for children uh I think you have spent some 20 years with the United Nations just tell me briefly what have you seen in Gaza City and inhan unes the devastation I saw there is like nothing I've seen as you said my two decades but I also reached out to colleagues and Friends who'd work through other crises big crises of this of this Century who' also had not seen the sheer scope of that everywhere you would turn 360° was rubble and this speaks again to what we've been saying for months is the indiscriminate nature of this you don't destroy hundreds and hundreds of housing blocks not a single standing University or functioning University in Gaza that only happens with a particular intent and that's same military intent which has led to now more than 14,000 children killed 14,000 girls and boys that same intent is now just moving hundreds of thousands of people from A to B not caring that they don't have the ability to move or the safety or the sanitation or the toilets I know this has been such a grave intense ferocious war that sometimes we forget when you deny a family an old person a teenage girl water and sanitation denying them that dignity and that's been going for six or seven months denying children the psychological support Gaza right now as UNICEF have said has said it's not a place for children this is an active war zone where they have seen and heard unspeakable Horrors but it's their home this gazer is their home but you have every single child there under some type of trauma and most of them the majority of those children are now in Rafa the place they were told to go even though there are bombardments every night even though as your correspondent said many children died overnight this has been the home that they've held on to and now they have to go again this horror show apparently stunningly is about to get worse thank you very much from UNICEF James Elder make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
