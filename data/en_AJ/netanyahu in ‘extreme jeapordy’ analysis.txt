we're going to bring in Amed Halal he's the director of mina region at the global Council it's a strategic advisory firm thanks very much indeed for being with us there was always a lot of speculation that if the Netanyahu Coalition felt that it wasn't achieving the goals that it had originally set out that it could push the military to intensify the action we're certainly reporting on a lot of what's been happening over the last few hours or so that seems to be an intensification what's your assessment of what's going on in Gaza and the West Bank well partly the Israelis don't have a finite objective for the war in Israel and in in Hamas against Hamas in Gaza um you can't extinguish all Hamas operatives and Fighters they are in the in the tens of thousands they are entrenched with the civilian population and when you when you fail to articulate your goals in combat you can fail in everything so what Israel is doing intensifying its bombing campaigns in the North in the south in the center is sending a message to domestic audience that we are big we are strong we will not be defeated by a small non-state actor and you have to go back to why this is an existential War for Israel um the attacks of October 7 threw into question the very idea that an independent Homeland for Jews is the safest place for Jews to live so Israel from its point of view has to attack in this way they have to achieve what they view as decisive military Victory their security Doctrine since the days of Dorian rests on three pillars one is deterrence two is early warning and three is decisive military Victory when the first two faltered they fell back to their third pillar of the traditional security Doctrine which is to um uh completely neutralize the military capability of the enemy and destroy the enemy's resolve to continue fighting and so that is the current track they are taking so to to expand on that because we heard from y of galand who talked to the keset yesterday and he was making the point that uh Israel is coming under attack on several fronts now we know that Israel is is dealing with uh what it perceives is a threat from Hezbollah but it is also dealing with a a longer term threat as it perceives it from Iran as well and of course we had the killing of um a senior Iranian military figure uh by Israeli forces in Syria just the last 24 hours that in and of itself seems like an a somewhat to somebody who's looking at it from the outside a somewhat provocative thing to do given the circumstances talk to us about how all of that is tying into this this what you're telling us about this do this appeal to a domestic audience they're trying to message to the Israeli public that this Menace Iran that is ultimately behind all these non-state actors that encircle Israel today that we're taking the fight to them and of course it's a significant escalation taking out the top Iranian military adviser uh the irgc um in in Syria um this person was an ally of kasum sumani who is the venerated leader of the rgsc that America took out in in 2020 in uh in Iraq but we have to take a take a step back a little bit and think about Iran's expansion in the region Iran has been the single greatest beneficiary of all the regional Wars that have happened since America invaded Iraq they have been able to build up the capabilities of its Shia proxies in Iraq um an example being kab and in in in in Lebanon creating a front there in Northern uh Israel and the hthis in in Yemen and the Assad regime in Syria so they've created what they''re calling an axis of resistance and this is how they project their power and this is how they ensure the continuity of the Islamic Republic for them it's an ideology that their claim to leadership in the Islamic world is through these uh uh proxies and appearing to the Arab Street to the Muslim street that they are the only state that's actually doing anything in a concrete way to help Hamas through rhetoric through the support financial support training Hamas operatives and Hamas leaders um and it's for them strategically a welcome distraction from the instability that they the regime has been facing domestically they have been rocked by one protest movement after after another recently over the treatment of of of women and uh freedoms and uh the killing in police custody of of a woman who wasn't wearing the hijab um so this for them is is projecting power and it's ensuring regime continuity and stability um of course it's a provocation and Iran will find a way to respond to Israel um and it already is already partially blockading Israel uh through the hois who are um harassing vessels in the South Red Sea and uh preventing manufactured goods fuel chemicals from reaching Israel uh through the Red Sea given the balance of power that you're describing there who do you think is the greater threat to each other Israel to Iran or Iran to Israel well I think the statements of the defense minister um tells you a lot I me they are fighting a multi- Arena war in in in seven jurisdictions and um Iran can can have plausible deniability that it isn't necessarily um in a war against another state they are um supporting proxies that is well known and so they have leverage they have greater leverage than the Israelis the Israelis are engaged in a full out war in in Gaza they have hundreds of thousands of Israelis who have been displaced from the north of the country they are not able to go back because Hezbollah is um engaged in a low intensity war with them through missiles and Rockets and of course so so the short answer is that Iran simply has more leverage um uh and more more attack points against Israel than than vice versa they let's I want to bring you back to the focus on Israel because there's a lot of speculation that Benjamin netanyahu's own political future is tied in with the the duration of the war how much do you think that is going to influ influence what we see and the over the the coming weeks possibly months according to to the netan Yoo Coalition and also how that will play into the the nature of the conflict as it progresses over that time yeah um Netanyahu is held responsible by the Israeli public for the greatest National trauma since the founding of the Jewish State uh this conflict is often compared to Yum kipor in 1973 but it's much worse in actual fact um that war was waged by two State actors Egypt and Syria with two organized armies this is a non-state actor Hamas ostensibly much weaker without an organized Army it is a militia it is a militant group um this is humiliating for Netanyahu it destroys his legacy as Mr security the strong man that he has branded himself as and the Israeli public are are Furious and they are frustrated that uh their security appus apparatus let them down and that they are unable to kill the upper echelons of Hamas leadership in the form of U Yar and Muhammad so there are no clear winds yet in this in this um uh military campaign for Israel if Devastation and the images of Devastation and and and atrocity is um is how they quantify military Victory then then they have that but in actual fact strategically they haven't moved the dial yet so um in terms of Israel and netanyahu's political future it was already in jeopardy before this war he was undergoing um a Judicial overhaul that would curtail the powers of the Supreme Court which launched the biggest protest movement in in Israel's um history and of course the failure of intelligence the failure of preparedness um in October 7th would um seal his political future um and open him up to investigations or already corruption investigations before October 7 but open up open him up to an accounting for these Dreadful failures of of Israeli intelligence and security uh and so he's he's extremely in Jeopardy and the continuity of this war serves him well am H we appreciate it thank you very much indeed for being with us thank you
