now it's been nearly 48 hours since an Israeli strike hid the alahi hospital in Gaza killing hundreds of people and triggering Global outrage many of the victims were taking shelter at the hospital from Israel's Relentless bombardment of The besieged Enclave the Episcopal Church in romala in the occupied West Bank is holding a service for the victims of the war on Gaza including the people massacred at the alahi hospital H abdulhamid is in rala in the occupied West Bank Hoda tell us more about this church service well the Episcopal Church is actually overseas uh the AL Hospital in uh Gaza uh they had it issued a statement earlier in the day uh denouncing what had happened in Gaza calling it a crime against humanity targeting hospitals and the church that was were on that ground at the Episcopal Church saying that that count amounts to a a crimes against humanity now this service is just under way it's basically to pray for all those who have fallen but it's also a show of defiance saying the statement clearly said and the people coming in here clearly said yes they can hurt us yes they can try to crush it but we will all always stand up again it we should be hearing a later from the priest I think in his serman there'll be some uh quite uh harsh words towards what is happening in Israel and in in Gaza rather and a lot of a lot of support to Gaza rather and harsh words towards uh the military operation that Israel is undertaking at the moment HUD on Thursday we saw another Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank the arrests and the killings by Israeli forces uh have just increased so sharply since the beginning of the war on Gaza can you give us the context around that well that is something that is on going every day all day I'm really sorry for this um every day you wake up in the West Bank and you ask what happened overnight how many uh how many people were detained how many people were killed in overnight traes um there is one a situation a standoff that has been going on actually since uh for more than 12 hours now that is in the North in taram so far six people have died there and the standoff is still ongoing the area is completely shut down it's a refugee camp next to tul car completely sealed off at the moment people can come can't come in and out and the last we heard is that electricity and water was also cut off from the area and then there were three others that were killed in also in overnight raids but the tragic story about this is that these numbers keep on increasing on a daily basis every day you have to update your tally uh there were more than 800 people who had been detained since October 7th when this crisis started and one person I was talking to earlier in the day he said you know we keep on praying on The Souls of those who have died but then next morning we have to start all over again because next morning there are new victims uh new fallen new people who have been killed so it is just this continuous uh cycle of death and violence that is in the West Bank and that has been going on since before this crisis and it's just ever since October 7th a big Turning Point things have become much worse uh for anyone living in the occupied West Bank the number of settler attacks which used to be on average three per day according to the UN humanitarian agency here well now they're at least on average eight a day so as you can see these numbers are incre increasing disproportionately and one of the reasons Hamas uh said that it had carry out this operation that it wanted to put pressure on Israel is also because of what the Palestinians and the occupied West Bank go through on a daily basis it's a different kind of of of of occupation and Gaza is under siege whole year long but here in this part of the occupied territories the friction with the occupation is constant day and night and you never know if you're a Palestinian from it's coming to you Huda thank you very much that's alaz ABD Hamid you're in rala you're reporting from the church service that was being held for the victims of the Israeli attack on the uh Hospital in Gaza
