so you've been listening to proceedings at the international court of justice this is day two of South Africa's petition against Israel South Africa as a reminder accusing Israel of genocide and asking the court to order for provisional measures to stop uh the way Israel is conducting this war now that was South Africa made its case yesterday what we've been hearing over the last hour and a half or so and we'll continue to hear after this coffee break is Israel's defense against this allegation of uh genocide alzer's senior political analyst Marwan bishara is with me you've been listening along with me to this for the last hour and a half I suppose we we'll get into more detail on this especially afterwards when we've heard the whole thing but what's your initial reaction to what you've been hearing well look I think the uh the team the legal team started very weak in fact uh some bits of it was almost illogical the idea about to start a defense uh of Israel in the case of genocide by saying about what about Hamas I think that was quite weak uh talking about Hamas uh that was the legal adviser to Israel's foreign Ministry who was making that point most yes absolutely that's how it all started and and the idea of comparing hamas's damage to Gaza with Israel's damage to Gaza I thought that was just almost illogical saying that Hamas also would be trapped buildings when we know and we've heard yesterday how tens of thousands of bombs were dropped on Gaza by Israel so making those comparisons seemed very strange to me very weak and the idea of trying and compare images Israeli babies really Israelis want to compare the few babies there with 7even 8,000 babies killed I thought also that was not a good line of defense the second point that I thought was quite weak was the context the idea that there is no context other than October 7 and we cannot go back to 75 years of dispossession and occupation I thought that was totally meritless and third the idea of the the benevolence how Israel does not aim to destroy civilians but to protect civilians I thought that was way beyond the logic of what we've seen unravel in plain sight over the past three months now you get to the strong points the strong points were two One Technical and one profound the technical one was dispute that South Africa did not make enough effort to go and exchange views with Israel about the issue and I think he could almost get Israel off technicality that wait a minute these are two states are supposed to have a dispute not a Unis it's an interesting one there there needs to be a dispute for the court to actually hear this case is there a dispute he's saying no there isn't well yesterday dugar the uh the South African judge did claim that there was and and and the and the appeals by South Africa were basically dismissed now we're saying from We're hearing from the Israelis that no they were not exactly dismissed it was very short time and it was Jewish holiday and how we could we get those notes from them we will probably the judges will have to make decisions on that again it's technicality more than anything else because there's a certain urgency here and the South Africans were not going to wait to the for the procrastination of Israel to take its course until everyone in Gaza is destroyed and whatever anyway the other strong point you think they made I think the most the strongest point was the framework and the intent so you could claim that Israel carried heus crimes terrible crimes and you can make all the claims want but is it genocide because if it's not genocide or under the genocide convention framed that way then this court has no jurisdiction to discuss any of it it doesn't matter how bad the situation the case disappears yeah and his and his case for the intent was as such Israelis might be saying a lot of terrible things they might be angry they might be infuriated by the October 7 account but does that add up to intent carried out by the war cabinet or the security cabinet trickled down to the command of the military in order to carry a genocide against the Palestinian destroying them in whole or in part does the anger and the statements or Israel speaking from out of both sides of its mouth like Netanyahu like Galant does that add up to genocidal intent or that just a bunch of Israelis being very angry and infuriated at Hamas let's take this to our Le
