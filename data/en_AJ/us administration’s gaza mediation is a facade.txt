this we are joined by Thad kou associate professor of public policy at Doha Institute for Graduate Studies always good to speak with you thed so does the issue of a resolution for Gaza whether it's a ceasefire need to come back to the UN Security Council or do the US representatives comments that we just heard in that report give us an idea of any prospects for Progress even if this comes back to the security Council so Elizabeth if it comes back to the security Council and there is an overwhelming majority vote that calls for ceasefire saw exactly earlier in previous attempts just a couple of months ago and then the US again V it I mean it's a symbolic victory for the Palestinians more or less I mean that yes there is an overwhelming majority International majority that is behind ending this war and it will make the US look isolated but the question is does the US Administration really cares at this stage I mean to be embarrassed or not embarrassed obviously not I mean uh sadly I mean from the onset of this war till now The Diplomatic behavior of the Americans uh was not uh what would you expect from a mediator or a broker of peace I mean the US is sadly has chosen to be partner to Israel in this war absolutely the criticism is that it's acting like Israel's lawyer instead of an honest broker in in these negotiations which are set to continue and we're hearing that even the CIA director is going to come back to the region if you're saying that the us doesn't care about how it looks on the world stage at the moment so why keep up these negotiations which aren't going anywhere so I I think that's a very good question I mean yes why I mean um let's look at this last visit of blinking to the region I mean just a week before it the US has agreed or supplied Israel with a major also uh uh major weapons to enable it continue its War so in one hand they continue delivering weapons to Israel and then they pretend that there are some diplomatic efforts to get to to a solution I think the US Administration now the Biden administration at this stage I think more or less it has what is doing is just the act of pretending that they are engaged in some sort of diplomacy to have a ready answer for all these angry and committed voters in the US who keep asking why can't we stop the war and the answer is we're trying but in fact the reality they're not they're just siding by Israel I think the behavior of the US Administration is uh from my own view is so far is that they're committed to help nanyo to achieve the victory he's looking for and so far he has not but that Victory is not possible is it and I mean officials from across the board including American officials have said it's not possible to defeat Hamas they have been saying this from the on onset of this word but now we we have reached to we're getting into the 11th month uh I mean I mean soon of this War and what the Americans have been saying actually their actions are totally in the opposite direction they're doing the opposite Gaza as it stand today it's a tragedy it's a it's a living tragedy this unicid the war has totally changed the face of Gaza forever uh Hamas also is not in a good position because Hamas is under huge pressure because it is a resistance movement and and a governing party as well so none of the declared goals that Hamas has also declared on the onet of this War has been achieved and now they're faced with this the Hungary the massacring these these all civilians that are suffering so they see Hamas and Israel at the same time they see Hamas as their government government that is unable to stop this war at the same time Israel is left alone to do whatever it wants in Gaza so when it comes to this I think the Israelis and Americans are betting that they're almost there they want to see an end of Hamas they're they have assassinated their top leaders now it's about hearing Hamas accepting to say yes we're defeated but ham not going to do this because it's it's it's a it's suicidal for Hamas but the thing is who's going to stop this war again the Americans they have the leverage they have not been using it and they're still coordinating and helping the Israelis to to to to find this Victory to appease n Mr kmu we've run out of time but thank you very much for your analysis we really appreciate it thank you
