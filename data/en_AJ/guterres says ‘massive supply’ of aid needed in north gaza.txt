we're taking you live back now to Aman Jordan where the Jordanian foreign minister is speaking he's holding a press conference also with the United Nation Secretary General Antonio guer let's listen in to both of them Palestinians now are at ICP level five that means over 1 million Palestinians are facing famine uh supplies have not been allowed into major parts of GAD including the north so basically what we have is that Palestinians are killed by Israeli bullets and we having Palestinians dying from starvation from dehydration uh this has gone on for way too far Israel has violated every humanitarian law every moral principle every humanitarian value and unfortunately the world is still unable to say enough and say stop today the security Council will be voting on a resolution uh demanding uh uh ceasefire demanding the entry of supplies we urge all members of the security Council to support that resolution if only to send a message that what's happening is unacceptable and what's happening has to stop obviously Israel has ignored un Security Council resolutions before there are no indications that it will honor this one but I think what adopting the resolution would do today is just to send a message that Israel cannot continue to uh with its aggression with impunity uh in complete disregard to international law in complete disregard to human values and in complete disregard to life um sir you said it aply uh not too long ago Gaza has become an open graveyard not just for children but for international law and the consequences for that are extremely devastating not just to the region but to the whole uh principles of peace and Order uh that uh your organization stands for uh we thank you for uh your strong voice we thank you for for the positions that you've taken uh demanding respect for international law demanding respect for the UN Charter and urging an immediate end uh to war crimes and to the uh killing and starving of uh of the innocent uh and we uh will continue to work with you sir to make sure that we end this madness and uh we're going to continue to work with our International Partners to make sure that uh the world stands United in saying enough is enough enough killing enough war crimes enough massacring of of uh of innocent and enough impunity uh for violating international law and uh humanitarian uh law as well uh the UN and Jordan have been solid partners for decades not only do we work together on uh the Palestinian issue uh but we also work together on addressing the needs of refugees obviously on is here and I recogn iiz the commissioner General who him him and his organization have doing a tremendous job in trying to ease the suffering of the Palestinian people at those times uh that are again trying our our whole Humanity so just want to say that Ona is indispensable it is irr it is irreplaceable and uh we're happy to see that many countries are coming back now to helping Ona save lives because every dollar that is given to Ona is saving a human life and every dollar taken away from AR carries the risk of having a child suffer and die from from the lack of food and medicine so uh we stand together in supporting the agency and in urging all our our partners to continue to provide on the support that it's so deserve so that it can again do the basic job of just simply saving lives also we've been working together on many other facets of of cooperation particularly in relation to the Syrian refugees and uh while we great gr f for the support the UN and the International Community has been given to uh help us in our effort to provide Syrian refugees with a dignified lives and meet their needs and make sure that they're not victimized again they've been victims of conflict we cannot victimize them by having them ignored by the International Community but I have to say that we must Ring the Alarm and ring it loud about the dwindling support that's coming to refugees uh many un agencies are cutting down their services in Jordan simply because not enough it is coming that means the burden will Shi uh to us and we simply cannot carry that burden alone so again uh we urge that our partners continue to show the the responsibility towards uh Syrian refugees who do deserve uh a life of dignity and fulfillment until conditions are conducive for them to voluntarily go back to their country which is the only realistic answer to their flight so on all those issues sir we're going to continue to work as partners uh we have immediate priorities right now in which we are aligned uh in the aggression allow sufficient humanitarian supplies in and obviously prevent what would be another massacre in Rafa uh the whole world is saying going into rafah will lead to a humanitarian Massacre uh the Israeli government is not listening uh they're still reaffirming that they will go into Rafa and uh uh I would just conclude by saying that we cannot allow uh a group of radicals uh racist extremist ministers uh to Doom the future uh of of the region to more conflict and more war and more immediately we cannot allow them to continue to kill with impunity thank you sir I willcome you in Jordan and I look forward to further engagement assalamu alaykum dear foreign minister saf dear friend thank you for your warm welcome and it's good to be back in Jordan especially at such a critical time for the region and for the world when I see Jordan I see solidarity in action and I see in the words and deeds of his majesty King Abdullah a global Champion for peace and I see it in the spirit of the people of Jordan and your enormous compassion towards those fleeing AO Jordan is to the largest number of Palestine refugees I visited the camp earlier today and commend Jordan for your pivotal advocacy for the vital work of un you have also opened your hearts and doors to many others including refugees from Syria and I urge the International Community to support Jordan as it supports millions of people in needs it is very worrying the reduction of funding in relation to Refugee programs in Jordan and in other parts of the world Jordan's Spirit of solidarity is precisely what brings me here once again I am on my annual solidarity Mission during the holy months of Ramadan where I visit and fast with Muslim communities in distress Ramadan is meant to be a period of Celebration but not this year hearts are heavy in the region and indeed around the world from the unprecedented and ongoing Devastation in Gaza as well as rising violence in the occupied West Bank I commend Jordan for your support for deescalation including particularly your very important role in East Jerusalem and I salute Jordan for your Relentless effort to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza including through the personal efforts and wisdom of his majesty for my part I will keep pushing for the removal of all obstacles to life saving guge for more acccess and for more entry points but we must face facts there will be no sustainable humanitarian solution with an ongoing War as bloody as this let me repeat nothing justifies the abor October 7 attacks and O taking by amas and nothing justifies the collective punishment of the Palestinian people the effective delivery of humanitarian Aid requires the immediate delivery of a humanitarian ceasefire the need is urgent I was at the rough border crossing this weekend and I met with injured Palestinian civilians and they're directly from our Frontline humanitarian colleagues they are veterans of some of the worst humanitarian crisis in recent decades they have seen it all and yet without exception they told me they had never seen anything as horrible as what is happening in Gaza today the scale and speed of the deaths and destruction are on an entirely different level and now starvation is bearing down on Palestinians in Gaza there is a growing Consciousness around the world that all of these must stop the fighting must end now the hostages must be released now and we must not lose sight of the big picture A Lasting end to the Israeli Palestinian conflict can only come through a toot State solution Israelis must see their legitimate needs for security materialized and Palestinians must see their legitimate aspirations for a fully independent viable and sovereign state realized in line with United Nations resolutions international law and previous agreements we know where the alternative would lead to indefinitely prolonging a conflict that has become a major threat to Global Peace and security to exacerbating polarization to emboldening extremists everywhere those standing in the way of a two-state solution have an obligation to State clearly what is the alternative they want how would the future look with such a large number of Palestinians inside without any real sense of freedom of rights and of dignity this would be unconceivable the two-state solution is the only way to address the legitimate aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians I know it is easy to be cynical in today's world but that's a luxury we cannot afford cynicism is a form of surrender to the prevailing assumptions of the moment it is a refuge for those too weak too narrow too timid to imagine a better future when things are difficult we must try even harder and I will keep pushing for peace inspired by your example and once again dear foreign minister dear friends thank you and thank the government and people of Jordan for leading the way to solidarity and peace thank you sir take some questions with respect to what is currently taking place in the north of Gaza Strip the volume it's not enough no it's the volume that's it's my it's my come on I have to take this out to be able to listening to you yes I can hear you now what is currently taking place in the north of Gaza Strip totally denied of relief Aid uh simultaneously with Israel's uh statement that they will uh attack Rafa how you together with the international Partners working towards lessening the of the Palestinians who are teetering on the verge of [Music] famine first of all in relation to the northern part of Gaza it is absolutely essential to have a massive supply of humanitarian a now and this means opening more entry points this means uh a concentration of efforts of all entities without obstacles without limitations from the Israeli side in order to be able to rescue the people of Northern Gaza of an imminent risk of familyin many children are already today dying of hunger finally in relation to the sace to Rafa our position has been very clear we consider that a ground offensive against Rafa could lead to a catastrophic humanitarian situation Gaza is already reeling under famine the north part of Gaza is in a dire situation as the Israeli occupation forces are using delivery Aid as weapon all this can come to an end if the Israeli blance comes to an end and delivery of Aid can be allowed through more border crossing famine is a direct cause of Israeli policy of denial of relief Aid into Gaza Strip we are prepared to provide all what is needed by the Gaz and population the relief Aid is already present the mechanism are in are in place what is missing is to uh eliminate is is's policy of total denial of delivery of relief Aid into Gaza a question to the Secretary General is prevented hona from delivering relief Aid into the north of Gaza Strip they are also accusing honor to be uh collaborating with the Palestinian resistance is there a clear position by the International Community to respond to Israel's claims and also to put an end to the situation in the north the second question to the Jordanian uh foreign minister it is clear that Israel is simply buying time refusing a ceasefire on the other hand you are still calling for a ceasefire how do your calls resonate where is the response to the entire Arab diplomacy and how can we make these calls effective and taking place in reality decision not to allow the decision not to allow un convoys to go to Northern Gaza where we have a dramatic starvation situation is totally unacceptable and those that took that decision must assume the responsibility fa ing history of the consequences of the decision in relation to the dramatic situation of the people in Northern Gaza where as I mentioned we have already children dying of hunger the position of Jordan is not only to outcry calls but they we are doing our best since day one to bring this war to an end and our efforts have not come to a halt let's be realistic Jordan Alone cannot bring this war to an end at a time where Israel is defying the international in entire world violating the international law continuing with their pleasur however we started to see more outcries from the International Community the inter interal community's position has been shifting towards Israel uh killing uh policy of starvation we are dealing with reality where Israel is defying and violating international law they are even going against their uh historical Ally the United States today as I iterated earlier there is a draft resolution before the security Council calling for a ceasefire and Swift Delivery of relief Aid we are urging all the member states to adopt this draft resolution even to take a moral and legal and ethical stand stating that what the policy of killing starvation is unacceptable and undermine the International Community the international law and the international organization at the end of the day Israel is doing what they are doing perpetrating their crimes simply because they are not deterred there is nothing to to deter Israel we have gone beyond that the Israeli government is led by radical racist ministers we cannot allow them to continue to drown the entire region into further chaos rather than sending arms to Israel diplomacy must work delegations must visit Israel to direct the current Israeli government and the current government must be held liable for their crimes the crisis and the tragedy of Gaza and gazans are exacerbating the inter the entire International Community is losing credibility for the Dual standards and Israel's continued violations of the International System God not that since day one Jordan has been doing all they can the Palestinian c will remain our focal issue the Palestinian people the safeguarding of their rights their interest and their right to life uh will be our Paramount priority we including the International Community are faced with Israeli government the most radical in its history turning a blind eye not only to the international law but all the human and ethical values continuing to kill starve Gaza and gazin and we are doing all what we can with our regional and international Partners including the United Nations and all those willing to take a clear stand against the Israeli occupation for the uh sake of humanity dignity and the right of the Palestinian people and even further uh the position of Jordan has been clear doing all what we can to bring this conflict to an end and the only means is by ending the occupation and enabling the Palestinian to have their independent sovereign state established on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem at its capital let this war come to an end and even if it ends more Wars would be waged simply because this position this situation cannot continue where the horizons of Hope Freedom before five Palestinian and more are undermined Maria will the Jordan times after more than five months brutal violence and Collective punishments uh that inflicted uh upon Palestinians by Israeli occupation forces today the Security Council is held hostage by a couple of members who stand behind uh empty arguments at the expense of Palestinian lives thereby the council failing to assume its responsibilities and maintain International Peace and security the question is how will the UN remedy the diminished credibility of its own promises and what are the new challenges to uh to to conflict resolution that is uh that this war presented finally uh what are the mechanisms to pressure Israel at this point to allow full AIDS into Gaza taking into consideration that denying AIDS contradicts icj's ruling which ordered immediate measures to protect Palestinians in Gaza from the risk of genocide by ensuring sufficient humanitarian assistance thank you I think it's necessary to recognize that the United Nations is a complex organization in the United Nations you have humanitarian agencies that are today working in Gaza with an extreme courage we have already 171 workers staff members of HRA that were killed in Gaza and they are United Nations so we have in the United Nations extraordinary examples of courage and generosity and solidarity with people suffering the United Nations is also the general assembly that has assumed clear positions in relation to this conflict United Nations is the Secretary General that has been assuming on behalf of the Secretariat clear positions in relation to this conflict and the secret and the United Nations is also the security Council and indeed the security Council today is victim of the enormous geopolitical divides in the world with the superpowers at Thoughts with each other and creating a situation in which it's very difficult to find consensus in relation to any of the difficult crisis we are facing in the world not only in relation to Gaza and that is why it is so important that finally the security Council became able to approve a resolution asking for a ceasefire in Gaza but uh at the same time it is our duty to do everything to mobilize the whole of the International Community and I see a consensus emerging in the International Community even in countries that are friends and allies of Israel I see a consensus emerging that this war must stop I see a consensus emerging that any ground offensive against Rafa would lead to a catastrophic humanitarian situation I see a consensus emerging in the International Community to tell Israel that fully recognizing the Grievances caused by the horrific attacks of amas uh in the 7th of October fully recognizing the drama of the hostages that need to be immediately and then conditionally released fully recognizing those aspects nothing can justify this Collective punishment of the Palestinian people that is causing such an immense tragedy in Gaza sir thank you very [Applause] much you've just been listening to a joint press conference by the Jordanian foreign minister Iman Safar and the Secretary General of the United Nations Antonio Gutierrez a few of the headlines uh from that conference and both the minister and the Secretary General uh were taking questions at the end so some of the headlines here first from the Jordanian foreign minister he said Israel has violated every moral principle um that Gaza is now an open graveyard that Israel's government is led by radical and racist ministers who are dragging the region into chaos and he called on the UN Security Council to adopt the draft that is going to be put before the the council uh later today if only he said if only to a signal to the world um that enough is enough so that's on the part of the Jordanian foreign minister now the un uh Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez uh has says has said that speaking with his teams in Gaza they've never seen anything as bad as Gaza and he was pointing out this is coming from seasoned humanitarian uh veterans uh he also said the scale and the speed of the death and destruction in Gaza is on an entirely different level let's uh bring in Adel Abdul he's a fellow and director for the foreign policy and security program at the Middle East Council on global Affairs you were listening to the whole thing with us what stood out to you well uh I'm struck by the secretary General's comments I have to say they're very courageous uh open uh and critical of Israel but in the same time he highlighted uh in his comments the limitations of the UN as an organization and the inability of the UN Security Council to find a binding resolution uh against Israel so you find that him really showing the highlighting the work of un but in the same time highlighting its limitations oh so that's really interesting that's that's what he ended with and that's also what stood out to me he was asked a question about how um International condemnation of Israel's war can actually be implemented into facts and into a ceasefire and he gave this rather long answer but I think we should get into it because it's interesting he said look the UN is a complex place it's a vast place and though if I par paraphrase he was is essentially saying the one thing that's not working the one thing where we're stuck is the security Council but everything else there is Clarity whether it's the general assembly which has passed a a resolution back in uh it was a few months ago now passed a resolution calling for a ceasefire whether it's the general assembly whether it's the Secretary General himself whether it's the people the UN staff working on the ground many of whom have been killed he says all of that's working the one thing that's not working where we're not finding consensus consensus on Major World issues including Israel is the security Council that's correct and this is a reflection of course of the geopolitical issues uh ramifications of the Russia uh Ukraine war the fragmentation of Global Order Rising us China uh competition by which the UN SEC secretary un Security Council now is an arena of all of these issues so it becomes less about uh Gaza and Palestine and more about the geopolitical context but actually if you look at the resolution from uh last week and you look at the resolution that they are voting on today if the US actually joins in unanimously voting for this actual ceasefire uh then this will actually become further pressure on Israel to act but I don't see that happening yeah you told us earlier they won't I don't think so because uh since the UN was established uh the US has voted vetoed more than 40 resolutions that have condemned Israel actually 46 and what we see today is probably the 47th of them as the US provides the the Fig Leaf uh for Israel to cover its crimes and if this fig Leaf is removed then really Israel will be exposed for the genocide of is actually uh doing for the Palestinian people this is an interesting and useful reminder you're saying this would be if the UN um gives diplomatic cover to Israel this evening later today at the security Council it would be the 47th veto that they have used you said since the creation of the UN that means in more than that means in 75 years almost that's correct and this included the invasion of Southern Lebanon uh the occupation of the Golan Heights and all other resolutions according to national law where Israel has broken International but I mean this really is the question what is international law what is this International liberal order that us perceives to uphold there's a big double standard here when it comes to Russia and Ukraine International communities mobilized quickly there are atrocities perpet perpetrated and condemned by the International Community that Russia has has done in Ukraine but when we focus the shift on Israel Israel has given a bit of a c blanch but I would say that this is really changing put aside the US for now and let's focus on other countries like for example in Europe we have the Spaniards uh the belgians uh and other European countries who are saying now we are ready to recognize a Palestinian State we look at the solidarity the South South solidarity with South Africa Brazil and other countries in the global South highlighting the solidarity with Palestine it really shows how the international uh Community has really moved uh for the Palestinian uh issue to be resolved once and for all the the Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez seemed to be um alluding to what you're saying at the end of his his last remark his his last answer he seemed to be suggesting the answer may not be coming from the security Council the answer may be coming from this pervasive feeling among the International Community he said including um friends of Israel this emerging consensus as he put it that the war must stop that the operation in Rafa would be catastrophic and that nothing can justify the collective punishment of Palestinian people he seemed to be saying these values they exist they are widely shared not acted upon by the security Council but he sees something Rising as I listen to him yeah exactly and if you look at historical parallels you know with apartheid South Africa what really uh put pressure on a partide regime in South Africa is this International condemnation and isolation of the South African uh regime and a sanctions uh and a boycott movement globally you know so I think this is really what's going to put pressure on the Israelis International isolation a concerted campaign uh at uh sanctions potential sanctions and trade impacting trade and weapons transfers to Israel and finally the need for unified Palestinian movement if you remember of course the Palestinians are divided amongst themselves so the big hus comes to them as well to have a unified movement that can Advocate collectively for their demands one last thing um the Jordanian foreign minister was asked you know how how this can be brought to an end this war the the humanitarian catastrophe in uh in Gaza he was very honest he said look let's be honest Jordan can't stop this war this speaks to something that we've heard so many times viewers that what what can be done and what can be done specifically in the region and by Arab countries and his answer by the Jordanian foreign mys we can't end this unfortunately he's speaking truth because the D the Dynamics in the region highlight that also a number of states have uh peace treaties and long-term interest with with Israel while they can collectively uh work together at the Arab League level or the GCC level or at the international level with the UN there are limitations of of this approach and it really comes down to how much pressure that the US can exert directly on Israel in terms of stopping weapons supplies stopping funding and removing the Fig Leaf we discussed earlier yeah Adel ABD thank you very much for following that live with us in the studio thank you
