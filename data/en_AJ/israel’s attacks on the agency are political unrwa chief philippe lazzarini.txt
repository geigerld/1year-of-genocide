a head of the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees says Israel's recent attacks in the agency are part of a push to remove it from the Gaza Strip Israel accused some onra staff of involvement in the October 7th attacks but a review of the agency's operations released on Monday stated that Israel has not provided supporting evidence for its claim while Johnny manow is the United Nation from the United Nations is the commissioner of on Philip larini thank you very much indeed uh for being with us the report that we were talking about was the one put together by the French former French foreign minister Katherine Kad there were a list of recommendations that it made to ensure accountability so that Ona could uh demonstrate its neutrality do you think that will go a significant way to stopping the kind of allegations being made against the organization or do you think you are going to this is something that you're simply going to face for a long time so first of all thank you for having me I really hope uh that the report will help us to restore the confidence of our partners and the donors uh the Secretary General and myself have welcomed the report we have welcomed also the recommendation and you might have noticed that the report clearly indicated that the agency already have number of robust mechanism to deal with neutrality issue and that this mechanis are above I would say the standard of many other agencies or International ngos but because of the nature of the conflict we are dealing with and the complexity of our environment it is needed to do even better and this is the reason why uh we Embrace and I embrace the recommendation made by Kine Cola and our team and we are now preparing a response plan to follow up on this recommendation mhm uh during your press conference you gave a long list of uh the level of of damage to onward property and of course the the effect that this has had on on staff the arrests that have been carried out and so on what is the morale of staff at onra at the moment of course not just in Gaza but in all the areas that it operates when it must I would imagine feel that is under constant pressure yeah un on the constant attack constant pressure constant call of dismantling a constant administrative harassment and also constant I would say sometimes social media uh assassination and this has definitely an impact on our staff you might also have seen over the last few days there have been an opinion poll and also within the population in the West Bank and in Gaza there is a deeper anxi iy that if the the agency is dismantled that this would also put an end to the two-state solution I was at the security Council uh last week and basically I told the member that the attack on un have nothing to do with neutrality issues but in reality they are motivated by the objective to strip the Palestinian uh from their Refugee statuses you also mentioned in your press conference that within 24 hours of the allegations originally being made by Me by Israel about members of Ona allegedly taking part in the hamus L October 7th attacks in southern Israel 16 to 18 countries who pulled their funding How concerned and how worried are you that countries are prepared to pull funding so quickly before allegations are actually determined to be founded that that shows also the unprecedented crisis uh and chency agency is currently uh facing and dealing with uh it is true that 16 country within 48 Hours announce their PS but the good news is that since most of the countries have reviewed the decision and have reinstated the contribution to the agency at the time they took the decision uh it had the the agency basically had no visibility anymore about its Financial contribution today thanks to the fact that most of the donors have come back a new donor have also joined uh the agencies we have slightly more visibilities and I can say with some comfort that we have enough resources to keep our activities running at least till the end of June uh and go into the month of July but it's very prec curious and we continue to function uh Mouse to hand to Mouse given the allegations that were made about onra by Israel you were talking in your press conference about the fact that you have to have um constant contact with the with all parties who are involved in in the crisis how difficult does that situation become when those allegations have been made well you you you you you know the once the allegation have been made they had a considerable negative impact on the agencies some confidence have been temporarily broke with the member states so we had to redouble our effort to restore this confidence now the cine Colona report supported by the free Institute is an key element to restore the confidence with with our member states how confident are you now that onra is in a position to be able to deliver the age that people in Gaza and elsewhere so badly need listen again everything is extremely precarious as you know the United State has also decided to suspend all its contribution to the agency the United State won't be coming back before March next week this leaves behind a huge shortfall that we will have to breach uh I am cautiously uh optimistic that we might succeed with the support of the existing Don ways but also with the support of new donors given the fact that you were you as you've referred to that onra is constantly facing pressure and allegations from um from all sides at times throughout the course of its history has there ever been particularly in this circumstance has there ever been a discussion about onr ch changing its role or changing the way that it works in order to try if nothing else to take the pressure of its staff who are on the ground we have tried to initiate a number of discussion related to a partnership as you know this year is a 75 marks 75 years of uh of un before October 7 7 I wanted in fact to initiate a discussion about can un alone continue to be uh the uh the full inclusive service provider for the Palestinian refugees especially in the absence of a political uh Horizon um because we have seen that the interest of the donor to support the agencies has also decreased over the years and before the conflict in in Gaza so this type of conversation definitely needs to take place while at the same time we have to make sure that this conversation do not weaken the future right of the palestin refugees and this conversation takes place under I would say the principle of resolution 302 you said that your staff on the ground had um been telling you that there have had been some improvement in the number of Aid trucks that were getting into Gaza I believe that you quoted a figure of the average was about 200 a day there had at Peak there had been over 300 uh talk to us briefly sir about the the priorities that an has in terms of the kind of Aid that it is trying to supply in Gaza I mean this development shows also that if there is a political will we can increase the number of trucks we can increase the volume of the supply which enter into Gaza so it is true that over the last few days there have been uh some uh uh there have been some improvement my colleagues on the ground for example indicated that the last convoys entering into the north have not been assaulted by desperate uh people who would have struggled to get a part of the assistance of a truck so all these are sign that there are some slight Improvement but to reverse the looming uh I would say hunger and starvation uh taking place in the Gaza STP we need this Supply to be uninterrupted and at the same scale in the forceable future I just want to ask you sir before we let you go just very briefly um in terms of On's experience on the ground particularly in Gaza how if at all is that going to affect how onra deals with situations similar to this in the future will you be reassessing the way that you approach your services uh in situations like this but first we have also to look uh into the recommendation of uh the Colona report because maybe some of them might also impact the way we might deliver services in in the future uh we have uh an action review uh taking place in real time right now regarding our operation in Gaza and we will certainly also learn some lesson to be applied in future context if and God forbid there is again a conflict Philip lini we appreciate you being with us on Al jazer thank you very much indeed for your time thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest
