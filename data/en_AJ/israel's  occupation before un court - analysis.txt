our panel of guests now to take us through all of this joining me on said is tamama kamut assistant professor of public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies uh Muhammad stal a Palestinian lawyer based and occupied East Jerusalem is with us as well as AA Elder a political analyst and contributor to the haritz newspaper thank you all very much for joining us AKA if I can uh begin with you please I mean you're in Tel Aviv can you just explain how all of this is being viewed there is it being ignored or dismissed completely well I can tell you that uh in my newspaper in her uh today you can find it here on page four uh and here you can see the report about the cabinets meeting yesterday about the American outline uh so you see it's uh just minimized and uh the Israeli public is is busy with uh two different issues first of all the uh captives what is uh the future of uh the uh negotiations with Hamas and the other thing that uh uh how long will it take until we bring down the Netanyahu radical right government um and uh the uh discussion in the international court of justice and uh what was just reported about the situation in Gaza uh is if I may it's a collateral damage of netanyahu's regime and um the uh Israelis are more concerned about uh the uh next steps that President Biden may take or may not take which means if he will decide that he cannot AFF for to supply more weapons and shells to Israel because he's got his own political problems to uh be concerned about uh in the upcoming elections so um I want to you touched on this a little bit but I want to talk through a little bit more of the responsibilities that Netanyahu and the Israeli government has because under International humanitarian law Israel as an occupying power does have certain responsibilities the occupied territory must be administered for the benefit of the local population in this case Palestinians but Israel enforces discriminatory laws and policies subjecting Palestinians even children to military rather than civilian courts now the laws state public order and safety must be ensured however armed settler attacks are at record levels as we've been reporting and Israel must not displace the local population or move its own civilians into the territory but an estimated 750,000 Israeli settlers inhabit about 300 settlements in the occupied West Bank as well as East Jerusalem the occupying power Israel is also forbidden from enforcing Collective punishment on the local population but Israel routinely destroys infrastructure demolishes homes and digs up roads as we have seen time and time again so a I want to go back to you on this because why do you think Israel has failed to fulfill its responsibilities as an occupying Force the answer Tom is uh very short because they can because uh the price tag uh for doing it for uh 57 years was close to zero um as long as you can have it both ways you can occupy the territories uh you can get the American Support um the International Community in the best case uh will publish uh some soft statement against uh the the occupation and violation of human rights in the occupied territories and business as usual so um if you are an Israeli politician even not from the liud look at what uh guns Benny guns the leader of the so-called Center party said yesterday yes that um um Palestinian state is not on the table now yeah and um and now Israel is playing the victim and this is the Paradox that on one hand Israel is uh the last uh colonial state in the in the western Society on the other hand if you ask the Israeli in the street he will tell you that we are the victims of Terror okay Muhammad I want to bring you in now uh in regards to the icj hearing that is going to begin in the next hour or so what are the potential legal consequences for Israel here and this is a big day this is a big day because the Palestinians have been waiting this for decades uh the Palestinians have been trying to use international law and to use international diplomacy and to use the mechanisms within the United Nations but so far all these uh mechanisms did not really help them in changing the reality on the ground uh today with the hearing and I J and hopefully the advisory opinion that will come at the end of those hearings uh there might be a change there might be a change because the Palestinians are not able so far to get rid of the Israeli occupation and to get rid of the Israeli apar High especially in the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank and Gaza through diplomatic or political or even uh local resistance on the ground this addition now of an advisory opinion by the international Court might mean actually that many countries in the world will have on a legal basis to deal with the Israeli occupation and maybe even the Israeli State and the Israeli government on a different way one example for that was the decision that was issued by a court in the Netherlands just 10 days ago preventing military companies from the ne Netherlands to to export parts of the F35 airplanes to Israel such decisions actually might make a big difference and if the advisory opinion at the end of the day says that one that the settlements are illegal which is obvious under international law and many other policies that Israel is actually conducting in the occupied territories are in contrary with international law and it goes beyond that because that's what the general assembly has asked the court to decide on yes the responsibilities the responsibilities and the duties of other state parties of all the countries in the world so if the advisory opinion says that those countries should refrain from certain polies policies in dealing with the Israeli government or in dealing with Israel that that might actually bring about a huge change and might influence even the isra public opinion yeah potentially a huge change but uh it seems like any sort of solution to this is is a long way off because despite international calls for a two-state solution Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin NYU keeps on sticking to his position he has posted on X saying Israel rejects international calls for a permanent settlement with the Palestinians and Israel will continue to oppose the unilateral recognition of a Palestinian State okay uh T just in regards to this I mean will these statements that we've heard time and time again from Netanyahu rejecting any sort of uh two-state solution from Netanyahu as well as everyone else seemingly in his cabinet is that going to affect do you think how the icj deals with and sees this hearing um of course it has to I mean this is U the Israeli leader uh going against everyone even International Community even his closest allies even in the West in the US I mean uh it's good that we have been hearing many Western leaders including Joseph borell even president presid Biden they're all now talking the talk when it comes to the need for a two-state solution and end of this conflict and and Nat is rejecting all these uh uh these calls and and and I think it's a Moment of Truth for Israel's key allies in the west especially the US to to take a position enough with the talk now what are the tools how you going to pressure Nan and the Israeli government to go for peace I mean even many Israelis and many uh uh uh including the Jewish Li in the US they're all now saying that netan is a risk for Israel itself its own existence because if if occupation doesn't end then the next scenario is a one state or a one state solution I mean many analysts are starting to talk about this yes if Palestinians have no Prospect whatsoever to have their own State then it's one state solution a by national state I mean name it there are so many discussions so so the Israelis will have to face this reality as well it's not leading them anywhere so what are they going to do with the five to 7 million Palestinians inside the occupied land they're there they're not going to go anywhere well I guess many uh are hoping that the icj's hearings will actually Force Israel to take a look at what it is doing as we mentioned before there's an unprecedented number of countries that are involved over the next week at the icj I think 52 as well as three other groups I mean that's a very very strong significant uh number isn't it is there strengthen numbers and will that help put extra pressure on Israel yes I mean I mean your guest from Tel Aviv he referred to the International Community the international Comm is a very fuzzy vague T term politically I mean when we we ask what's International Community what is it is it like the West is it Russia is it China is it the globe you know but but now for the first time we see I would emphasize on on the willingness and the pressure coming from the global South countries and that's very important most of these countries the 52 countries would submitted uh their cases to the icj on on palestin on the legal consequences of the occupation uh they come from the global South and we see this thift now this this momentum where I mean many countries have more or less less Hope on on the UN with with official forign mechanisms to apply international law and they're acting now from their conscious from their moral positions they have taken and I think this is important so the question to the other countries in the world do we want a unified the globe under one un under one uh uh under one under international law or we want to be more fragment mented the war in Ukraine has caused fragmentation Gaza now is causing more fragmentation and I think the International Globe has to stand to this and say well enough is enough we need to be united we need to apply international law uh without any complicity without any double standards Muhammad I want to go uh back to you now the Palestinians are presenting at the icj today I believe they've got about three or four hours to do so what are you expecting what are you hoping uh to hear from them as they uh outline uh the issues they face on a daily basis I mean it's the first thing that they they have to tackle is that you know occupation under international law is a temporary measure occupation happens when there is a war but this has to end and the Israeli occupation is not ending it's the longest occupation in modern time and it doesn't seem that there is a date for for it to end the second thing would be that it's a different kind of occupation because it's a city Colonial occupation it's an occupation that its main aim is actually to try and ethnically cleanse the indigenous population and andn certain parts of the occupied territory and bring citizens of of the occupying power of the state of Israel to live in the occupied territories which is as we know is contrary to international law and is even a war crime under the Rome convention uh the third thing would be of course the status of Jerusalem and the separation of East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank this is a very important issue and it's becoming more and more important those days when we are coming you know when when Ramadan is is coming soon and the inability of Palestinians to worship and exercise their freedom of religion in praying at the Alamos during this holy month and we just heard about the new policies that that uh the Israeli National Security Minister Bing wants to enforce so all these actions this is on the micro level on the micro level there are so many instances that your reporters have just explained in the reports that we we heard previously but it's it's that you know the daily life of a Palestinian from the from the minute that he wakes up until he goes to sleep is filled with injustices with suppression with oppression with human rights violations whether it's the freedom of movement whether it's the ability to work whether it's the ability to build a house for themselves whether it's their ability to leave the country or come back to the country or their ability to protest or their freedom of speech or to say anything on social media or in the newspapers they are at risk at all times and as human rights organizations internationally and locally including Israeli human rights organiz ations have characterized the situation here in the occupied territories as apar I think the time has come that this apar regime gets actually an international legal sta by the highest court in the world the icj saying that it is so and it should be dismantled well we'll be keeping a very close eye on how that all unfolds at the icj and about an hour and a half or so thank you so much uh T Muhammad and AKA we really do appreciate your time here on El jazer
