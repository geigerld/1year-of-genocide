let's turn now to Northern Israel where the military says it has killed fighters who have infiltrated from Lebanon the Iran backed Hezbollah movement is denying any involvement in that Let's cross to Zena Hoda she joins us live from the village of hamam in southern Lebanon at that border Zena tell us what you know to be happening there at the border well it is now an active border line active front line because I can hear the sound of shelling as we speak you mentioned an infiltration attempt now this is according to the Israeli army they said that there was an attempt by a number of suspects into Israel there was a clash and that they killed two of them so this is according to the Israeli Army and there was an ensuing clash and uh bombardment in the area now Hezbollah the Lebanese armed group has said that they were not involved in this operation they were not involved in any operation inside Israel this was a statement that was um that was made by the group now we're also getting reports that shells are being launched from Southern Lebanon into Northern Israel Israel responding so undoubtedly an escalation along one of the most volatile borders in the region yesterday yes there was an exchange of fire between Hezbollah and Israel Hezbollah did claim responsibility for targeting an Israeli Army position but it uh it shows its Target well it made sure that it was uh the whole operation was within the Rules of Engagement which have been in place since 2006 uh today it's different the attack now on the international border Israel responding and you can still hear hear the shelling um so it is is a very very tense situation hasbalah denying responsibility but at the end of the day this whole region is hezbollah's strong hold um the Lebanese Army is here you have uh troops belonging to a number of countries operating under the United Nations peacekeeping Force but it is Hezbollah who knows um who is at the border who reaches the border and so these are yet more messages more pressure on the Israeli Army telling them that if you continue your campaign against Gaza then expect to face pressure from other fronts Anda what what's the feeling within Lebanon at the prospect of being drawn into another conflict yes people are worried people are worried that this country will be dragged into war this is a very deeply polarized Society yes most people here will say that we support the Palestinian people we support we support their right to self-determination to have their own state but we cannot be dragged into this conflict because Lebanon is facing multiple crises uh this is what you know some people say it really depends who you talk to um those who support Hezbollah mainly uh the Muslim Shia Community they believe that Hezbollah is defending Lebanon it is defending their Community but others are saying that Hezbollah is implementing Iran's agenda and that Hezbollah is not working in the interests of Lebanon that the decision to go to war should be taken by the Lebanese State the country's economy has all but collapsed there's a political crisis there's no president there's no functioning government then the state is nearly bankrupt so people are worried yes Hezbollah has grown in strength it has sophisticated Arsenal it has Precision guided missiles that can hit Israeli cities but Israel too has an advanced Army it has air superiority and it can destroy neighborhoods so people are worried people are worried that the Gaza Israel war will lead to wider confrontation in the region and it's not just a just look behind me that's Israel that's a northern Israeli settlement look how easy it is to launch an attack and it's not just that Israel has enemies Hezbollah Iran they have positions along its border with Syria so really Israel facing a lot of pressure from different fronts groups Allied to Iran at the moment flexing their muscles putting pressure on the Israeli government aena Hoda thanks very much it's very it's great to be able to see so visually that border amid all the skirmishes that are happening there across it thanks for bringing us the latest there from this the Lebanon Israel or border
