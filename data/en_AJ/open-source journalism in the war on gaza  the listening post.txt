a major development and breaking right now in Gaza the Palestinian Health Ministry 700 p.m. in Gaza City October 17th 2023 reports surface of a devastating explosion at one of gaza's oldest [Music] hospitals it was not the first time a hospital was attacked but this was different the worst single Mass killing of Palestinians in the Israel Gaza War so far chaos and horror at the scene much of the building has been destroyed the Israeli military had been conducting bombing raids on Gaza City that night early news reports pointed the blame at Israel but within hours a counternarrative emerged who hit the hospital is in dispute the Israel Defense Forces say it was an errant missile fired by the militant group Islamic Jihad in Gaza immediately it was contested whether Israel had been the source of the particular munition that had created a crater right outside the hospital also disputed was how many were dead or injured so immediately you have this tension around whether a hospital which is supposed to be protected under International humanitarian law had in fact become a target of Israel Israel pushed back against that and said it was a failed rocket it was at night so there wasn't a lot of video and as these claims kind of circulated the headlines kind of adjusted and became more vague to accommodate the uncertainty the stories that came out subsequently were looking at ways to figure out okay how can we get close to knowing who was responsible for this what really happened at why did media Outlets come to such different conclusions to answer those questions you have to understand the strengths and the shortcomings of what is known as ENT open-source intelligence in a moment of conflict or catastrophe the video and photos captured by eyewitnesses often contain valuable clues or indicators these publicly available or open sources of information can then be used by investigators to make sense of what can otherwise seem chaotic when you take that material and compare it with satellite imagery the geographical landmarks can help you figure out where a place is a practice known as geolocation these methods have made it much easier for journalists and citizens to assess whether something is true or not to see things from a different vantage point but while osen appears scientific and fact-based it is just as open to the same biases and assumptions that any reporting is trust CNN a few years back because of the rock war and the financial crisis you had a lot of distrust of the media smartphones created this whole opportunity that everybody was a potential witness what it needed was somebody to process it somebody to analyze it and turn it into some kind of a coherent narrative or a story open source investigators started filling that Gap you suddenly have people able to challenge mainstream media by having access to a global audience on their own the original idea of Open Source investigation is that it would be a very democratizing force that people who were closest to sites of conflict moments of Crisis could get their perspectives out to the public in ways that could be quite powerful for journalism for war crimes investigation I think we're kind of entering into a sort of golden age because we're seeing newsrooms across the world Embrace open source analysis Belling cat did the mh17 investigation which revealed that you know it was Russian back separatists that shot down the ainer above Ukraine we've seen these kinds of really powerful reports that have held powerful actors to account like BBC Africa I when they did their anatomy of a killing investigation putting all this evidence together we can say with certainty that the killings took place here or the New York Times with their radio intercepts on Russian air strikes in Syria these coordinates aren't for a military Target they pointed this underground Hospital one of the things that happened with ENT was that it became a threat to States it's a form of counter forensics in a sense because forensic capabilities in the past they used to be in the hands of States now states which in the past used to protect their misdeed through secrecy and through officiation or just denying access so they themselves became the targets of analysis and one of the ways that they are trying to counter that is they have hijacked its aesthetic to sow their own disinformation and to sow their own counternarratives the trajectory analysis from the barriage of rockets confirms that the Rockets were fired close proximity to the hospital the idea that Israel was not responsible for Al Ali first emerged online from an IST osen accounts the claim rested on one video an Al jazer live stream which showed a midair explosion the morning after Israeli military spokesperson Peter Lerner went on the BBC with his own open- source presentation referencing the video El jazer broadcasted it last night they were broadcasting it live and this is the rocket that that you see actually impacts falls out of the sky and impacts into Gaza that was a line that the idea F pushed during interviews with various media Outlets they said look you can see the failed rocket here in the sky and then it crashes and hits the hospital it turns out New York Times was able to do an investigation and they figured out that this supposed errant rocket was actually originated within Israel it came from an Iron Dome Interceptor site using these three cameras some of them from Israel that were live streams or CCTV footage we can see that this rocket originated in Israel by this time the theory had had spread major organizations including Wall Street Journal CNN and others published analysis of what happened they said very definitively that that rocket is the cause of this attack tonight a new scene and forensic analysis confirms that the deadly blast at the hospital complex in Gaza did not come from Israel so many people had put their reputations into supporting a certain assumption that it became harder for them to climb down so that assumption since then has remained even though every aspect of the factual basis of it was was completely undermined by the New York Times by Al jazer and by forensic architecture the trajectory shows the missile was launched from outside Gaza near to a known Israeli Iron Dome site and the result of that was that since then the media coverage has skirted around the issue of assigning responsibility anytime some major atrocity occurs was an examp example of the power and limitations of open- source investigations it showed how events surrounding an atrocity are so often open to subjective interpretation how ENT can be used for all sorts of ends including by States pushing their own narratives and it showed that open-source reporting cannot replace the fundamentals of Journalism being on the ground talking to people and collecting evidence the reality of course though is that the open- source investigation has also been weapon ized by a number of organizations and individuals who really want to push a particular narrative this is the shifa hospital at a first glance it looks like a regular Hospital right but inside and beneath it lurks a much darker secret we've seen Israel put out its own digital open- Source investigations using very similar visual signatures to push their own interpretation of things that have happened what we're seeing now with newsrooms adopting open Source tools and combining that with the shoe leather journalism the interviews with people on the ground I think it's creating more powerful stories than what we would just get with a simple open source analysis I think that's still important but I think when you combine it with these interviews and on the ground stories of people that are actually victims or actually affected by these incidents you're going to get a more powerful story that is more impactful for people open source investigators I do think have grown increasingly confident about what they're able to determine based on finding information online but where I do think we're Landing today is an understanding that it's allsource investigations that are the most powerful so I do think the future is really going to be about bringing together people with those traditional fact finding skills with people who have a deep understanding of how information flows on the internet where the opportunities are where the challenges lie and how to counteract those challenges so that together we can tell a more complete story
