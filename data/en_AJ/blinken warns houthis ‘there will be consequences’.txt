US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is speaking live now from Bahrain let's listen in that's makes it particularly important that we respond when we see something like the aggression coming from the houthis that continues to be uh repeated directed at shipping in the uh Red Sea uh there have been uh th hundreds of attacks now since uh November uh on shipping in the Red Sea affecting um more than 40 countries tied to to ships with uh from 40 different countries uh and uh we had the biggest attack uavs missiles just yesterday um these attacks have been aided and embedded by Iran with technology equipment uh intelligence information and they are having a real life impact on people you know we talk about Concepts like freedom of navigation and the importance of holding it and I know that can sound a little bit abstract but it means something very real in the lives of people what's happened because of these houthi attacks against commercial shipping is that thousands of ships have had to divert uh take longer routes pay more for insurance and that gets translated into higher prices for people for everything from uh fuel to medicine to food it's disrupting Supply chains and so it's having a real impact on people around the world um in uh their daily lives we know all about the hostages in Gaza well the houthis have taken more than 25 hostages from the ships that they've seized since um uh since this fall so all of this has required us this this challenge this threat to the interest of countries around the world has required us to respond we put together operation Prosperity Guardian uh with um more than 20 countries including uh Bahrain uh to do everything we can to preserve freedom of navigation freedom of shipping in the Red Sea and in fact the United States and the United Kingdom two participants in operation Prosperity Guardian responded effectively to the attacks just yesterday uh we also had um some 20 countries come together to make clear that uh if these attacks continue as they did yesterday there will be consequences uh again this represents a clear threat to the interests of countries around the world and it's important that the International Community come together and respond to them uh we also talked here in brain of course about uh the the conflict in Gaza and we uh discussed uh the efforts that are underway uh to try to make sure that civilians are better protected that we get humanitarian assistance to people who need it um and at the same time uh make sure that Israel can succeed in uh ensuring to the best of its ability that October 7th never happened uh again but we also focused on the day after uh this conflict in Gaza and the important work that needs to be done to help Gaza get back on its feet uh as well as efforts that countries around the region are clearly prepared to make based on the trip this week to bring countries together to integrate the region and to do so in a way that provides for the security uh of Israel and also provides a pathway for Palestinians to a state of their own uh earlier today I had an opportunity to meet with president abas and rala uh and we talked about those efforts uh we talked as well about uh the importance of uh reforming uh the Palestinian Authority Palestinian governance so that it can effectively take responsibility for Gaza that so that uh Gaza and the West Bank can be uh reunited uh under Palestinian leadership um it's very clear to me for president abas that he's prepared to um move forward and engage in all of these efforts uh indeed uh as we speak I think president abas is with President CCE of Egypt uh with King Abdullah of Jordan talking about these Ray issues and I can say that um after this U this week in the region it's clear that countries around the region are seized with the need first of all to prevent the conflict from spreading but also to design a better path forward for the region as a whole uh and particularly for Israelis and Palestinians alike all of this work is going to continue in the days and weeks ahead uh there's a real sense of urgency I'm feeling that from countries around the region uh and we the United States will continue to be very actively engaged and trying to move things forward with that happy to take some questions yes Mr secretary you talk about responding you talk about consequences given that the houthis have claimed credit for this attack they said it was targeted towards an American warship have we reached the point where talk of consequences have to turn into action look I'm not going to uh Telegraph or preview anything that uh that might happen all I can tell you is again we've made clear we've been clear with uh more than 20 other countries that if this continues as it did yesterday there will be consequences and I'm going to leave it at that and you also talked about the Iranians being behind this that they've been supporting the houis uh do the consequences extend to the Iranians as well again all I can tell you is that as we made clear and many other countries made clear there'll be consequences for the hou's actions uh We've also uh repeatedly tried to make clear to Iran uh as other countries have as well that the support that they're providing to the houthis uh including for these actions needs to stop um it's not in their interest to see the conflict escalated uh and we're not the only ones who sent that message to Iran uh Mr secretary it's quite the trip again um I wanted to come back with your to your meeting with h president abas you said that he he engaged himself to to to Palestinian reform could you did he really commit to reforming the Palestinian Authority uh did you give us some specifics on that and more generally speaking um uh given if you called for today a tangible steps on both sides and specifically Israel also uh looking forward to the creation of a Palestinian State given that Israel is opposed to the very idea of a palestinia state how is that going to play out so uh Leon in terms of uh reform palan Authority look I don't want to speak for president abas but I think what I take away from this meeting is that he is committed to that and uh is uh very much prepared to move forward and he's going to I know having conversations with other leaders in the region um and it's I think very important for the uh Palestinian people uh that they have uh governance that can be effective that can help deliver results for them and I believe that president abas is committed to doing that when it comes to the broader path forward as I said even in this incredibly dark time what's so powerful in all our conversations throughout the uh throughout this trip is that countries do see a away forward a way forward through greater integration that actually provides real security for Israel and guarantees for that security and a pathway to a Palestinian State now to get there leaders have to make hard decisions hard choices we can't do that for them but I think the more we can show what the future could look like and how it would clearly benefit people throughout the region but notably Israelis and Palestinians I think as that picture becomes sharper and it's and and as it's clearer that countries throughout the region are prepared to themselves make commitments give guarantees give assurances in ways that they weren't in the past then I think that uh the choice becomes sharper and hard decisions may be a little bit easier to make but a lot of hard work remains No One Believes any of this will be easy and No One Believes any of this can happen overnight but there is a clear and better vision for what the future can bring there are countries that are committed to try to help deliver it the United States is one of them thank you all right guys clear back clear back back
