now the UN senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza says moving Aid by land Remains the most effective way to get supplies into the strip Juliet Tuma is head of communications from unra joins us now from man Julet first of all let's this phrase of the day a lot of heads scratching about this uh Port plan and the maritime route from Cyprus what's your take on it look at any increas the flow of humanitarian Aid into the Gaza Strip is a very welcome all we're saying is that there is a more efficient and easier and cheaper way to bring in much needed supplies into the Gaza Strip and that is via the road including sending more trucks from Israel to the Gaza Strip can you spell out for us why it is so difficult to get Aid in Via Ro the most simple routin well it shouldn't be you see that's the whole point is that it's so easy there are several Crossing points that connect the state of Israel with the Gaza Strip this is uh what we used before the war started on the 7th of October uh when there was a regular flow of about 500 trucks every day including Commercial Supplies so it shouldn't be uh complicated at all when there is a political will there is a way right well is is there a political will there has been very very little Aid coming into Gaza over the past five months uh The Siege on the Gaza Strip has been extremely TI authorizations to anra and other United Nations agencies to travel North and bring in much needed Food Supplies as one examples have not been given sufficiently so there needs to be much more the political will does seem to now be focused at the moment with a sudden flurry uh of interest on these alternative Roots including the maritime uh plan through Cyprus are you concerned that there's an effort here to sideline un and Aid operations to potentially car and out our top concern is for people in Gaza who have been through so so much over the past five months to get the very minimum we are on the verge of famine in some parts of the north of the Gaza Strip so any uh help any humanitarian assistance is uh very welcome it has to be efficient it has to be smooth and there has to be much more but are you sensing that unra is being sidelined here it is what Israel wants isn't it look we are on the ground and we will continue to work and we will continue to deliver we also need more there's work plenty of work for for everyone out there in in Gaza the situation is very very bad and all efforts needs to be need to be concerted so that more Aid get to people in need that's what's key we've been seeing Aid air drops coming in Aid coming in via air and unfortunately there's been tragic news of fatalities from those air drops and the aird drops are are very very ineffective anyway is that right exactly why I said in the beginning there is a much more efficient and easier way to send uh supplies and humanitarian Aid into Gaza and that's through the road um using the crossings there are plenty of them that connect Israel with the gaza's trp how urgently do we need a ceasefire in Gaza long overdue we needed it on day two of the war we are now five months on and and and Counting it's absolutely absolutely urgent too many lives have been lost totally unnecessarily it is time it is it is overdue in fact jul Tuma we appreciate your time thanks for joining us here on
