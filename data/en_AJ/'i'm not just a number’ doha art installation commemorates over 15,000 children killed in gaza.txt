I am not just a number that's written on the t-shirts of over 15,000 teddy bears these teddy bears representing over 15,000 Palestinian children killed in Gaza now the aim of this art installation is to give people a sense of scale because often the stories the individual stories of tragedy get lost in numbers now we've been speaking to the artist bashid Muhammad who tells us that these teddy bears all very individual and standing on these concrete blocks the gray personifying showing the rubble that Gaza has become and the red representing blood these kids who are not lost but killed actually due to the Israeli occupation over Palestine uh have names have identities have uh have a Homeland called Palestine for you you think about numbers numbers are nothing you would say oh wow it's a big number but you will never see it uh unless you create it somehow and you show it actually for the society now the artist hopes that when people come here they'll take their time to look at the faces of these teddy bears each of them very individual some of them are looking up at the sky and the effect he hopes that this has is to humanize the children of Gaza Stephanie Decker alazo Doha make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
