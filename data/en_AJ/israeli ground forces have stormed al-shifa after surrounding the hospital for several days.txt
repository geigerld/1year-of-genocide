well Israel's military began its raid on the hospital in the early hours of Wednesday morning let's take a Clos look at what we know about the timeline of events around 20222 GMT that was just past midnight local time the spokesman for the Gaza Health Ministry told Al jazer that Israeli military vehicles were at the gates of the alifa medical complex by then the hospital had already been surrounded by Israeli forces for six days then at around 23 GMT Palestinian Health officials say that the Israeli military told them that a raid would be carried out in the coming minutes and then at 5ast midnight GMT Israeli forces tweeted that they were quote carrying out a precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area in the hospital based on intelligence information and operational necessity now in the hours that followed as Israeli forces detained at least 200 people in the courtyard of the complex they went to the basement of all the buildings they ransacked the hospital and destroyed equipment according to al- shifa's director speaking to Al jazer that doctors couldn't go to the pharmacy because anyone who Moved throughout the complex risk getting shot let's go to hany Mahmud who is now life Us in kanun inside the Gaza Strip so hany once again it's very difficult to find out exactly what is happening at alifa and the very latest what are you hearing yes well that is true it is very difficult to get the latest from inside the hospital but what we know as a fact that a little over 24 hours after the raid just started uh there are no substantiated evidence whatsoever of the Israeli claims that a hospital as a health facility is used as a command center by Hamas elements or it's a command center for Hamas leadership all of that came to uh basically baseless uh claims uh but what what also we know as a fact that as a result of that failure intelligence failure what the Israeli military is doing is destroying the hospital damaging all of its facilities going in building by building destroying all of its properties inside for example the specialized surgeries building have been completely destroyed from inside all of its basement where it it the basement that houses a a a medical uh we house where they have all the medicine and all the medical equipment all the upper floors of that building been destroyed including the including patient rooms including beds including all equipment x-ray department been completely destroyed 200 people been uh rounded up interrogated uh stripped off their clothes at the courtyard of the hospital and taken to unknown areas the fate of those 200 people from evacuees and the medical team there is unknown to us and to anyone else in in the hospital what seemed to be is a a a reaction of the Israeli military inside the hospital as they could not provide the world was watching for a piece of evidence but that did did not happen at all so as a result a retaliation or reaction to that they went on damaging and severely destroying uh the properties of of the hospital uh right right now what happened as of the early hours of this morning there was a redeployment of the Israeli military along with their tanks and armored vehicles around the main gate of the hospital and uh hany we are also hearing reports that Gaza is on the brink of a power blackout because of fuel shortages uh what are you hearing about that yes well this is what has hospitals been a a warning of for the past week since the first week of the war that the lifeline of the Gaza Strip is a fuel now food is important medical supplies are important but if fuel is the major Lifeline of those hospitals and every other service companies or service facilities running in the Gaza Strip now hospitals here in the southern part are warning of shutting down Services uh by the end of the day maximum by early tomorrow's morning there won't be any Services as they run out of their fuel reservation that they had kept here in the hospital and kept it running for the past uh for the past months or or or so also a other than hospitals we have telecommunication company pal group announced by the end of the day Thursday Gaza will go compl in a complet blackout it will be taken off the grid of communication as well as Internet as a result of La of a fuel to run its power generators to uh generate power to its the batteries that are keeping those major uh uh major communic telecommunication divisions across the Gaza Strip without those batter uh as they deplete uh we will go off uh the line in the coming hours that's what what is going on and all of this happening uh under renewed air strikes here in the southern part of the Gaza Strip uh place that reminder to our viewers what people were asked to move to because it is safe but it not it's not safe it's equally dangerous equally risky uh to everyone not only the people who live here but for for evacuees who came from the North and the go and the Gaza City okay thank you for that update honey mahm there for us in Han Unice
