well the committee to protect journalists has released a statement following the incident saying that this is another example of the high price journalists in Gaza are paying to cover the war so that the world can witness what is happening it's calling for an independent investigation to determine if a war crime has been committed we can now speak to Sharif mansur who's the Mina Program Coordinator at the committee to protect journalists he's joining us from Washington DC Sharif mansur thanks for your time with us first what is your reaction to the way these journalists were targeted using a drone strike and also I mean they were clearly wearing their Flack jackets their marked press and they were in an area that was reportedly not a combat area well it's a horrific incident and it shows the personal price those journalists continue to pay every day in order to do journalism their work gather news about what's happening for the world to see and it's not the first or the second and it's the third time Al jazer journalists specifically have been targeted with this precise drone attacks in December against Sam abua last month in January against Hamza Al and today this thankfully did not lead to any of those journalists being killed but we're hoping and praying for the recovery so they can um receive the critical and immediate help they need uh we are of course Very alarmed and we are calling for an independent rapid and transparent investigation uh because if these are targeted attacks they are constituting C war crimes I hear what you're saying about calling for an independent investigation but um you know How likely is that to happen because we've seen this happen before and there's been no independent investigation into the killing of journalists fortunately before this war we at the committee have documented at least 20 journalists killed including Al jazer journalist Sharina bakla which we classified as murdered uh two years ago and in all of the cases the 20 cases no journalist have been charged or held no uh killer of journalist have been charged or held accountable and this is why we called before this war for the record of impunity in the Israeli Army killing of journalists the standing and the longstanding record to face public scrutiny and we called on International investigation and international media to be allowed immediately into Gaza uh these are the things that I think will help uh uncover the truth and ensure Israel cannot hide any evidence of its violations as the international court of justice order and when you make such calls what is the response that you get well we make those calls for all International and also us allies including the US government including European allies we have called on them to ask for Rapid investigation and they have done so in the case of Isam Abdullah uh secretary blinkin have called for the results of the investigation in his case to come as soon as possible but we've also asked for review of arms exports to Israel to ensure that the use of these arms are happening according to international law and US law including Ley law that makes sure that those arms are not used in human rights atrocities including attacks against journalists we've also called for them to pressure and call out Israeli Army on the Rules of Engagement to reform them so that they can stop disregarding things like press Insignia and make sure that the investigation that they have done are transparent and Rapid but also if they are not done properly internationally prosecuted including in the international criminal court right let me just uh finally ask you um are uh about another call that you've made now cpg called for an independent investigation into the killing of another Al jazer journalist you mentioned him a moment too Hamza D and cameraman mustafaa can you let us know what the latest is on that well we we have included them as part of at least a z case among the 80 five journalists that we have counted and confirmed that been killed uh on or doing journalism some of them we have strong evidence that there is an Israeli Army culpability and that includes the three drone attacks that happen against al jazer but also precise un targeted attacks including Shilling to journalist cars their homes uh even their families after receiving threats and that has happened with another Al jazer journalist and others who have also lost families in is bombardment we're calling for all of these to be investigated but prioritizing the ones that we see this cability to make sure that the perpetrators are held accountable okay we'll leave it there Sharif mansur thank you for speaking to us from DC
