the White House says the US doesn't believe a genocide is taking place in Gaza our White House correspondent kimy halard is following the story and ask National Security adviser Jake Sullivan why more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israel's war on Gaza still National Security adviser Jake Sullivan says the Biden Administration does not see the killing of Palestinians by Israel as genocide even as a un report presented back in March says there are reasonable grounds to believe that Israel is committing genocide as defined under international law how can you say genocide is not being committed as I just told you I think the best way for me to answer that question is actually to ask you to look at the lay down that we gave which are you saying this isn't happening are you saying that she's a liar the United States is laid down at the international court of justice in writing in detail its position on this issue and I'd ask you to read it the National Security adviser also said there could be a ceasefire in Israel's war on Gaza if Hamas releases the hostages he's calling on the International Community to pressure Hamas to return to the negotiating table and accept a deal Kimberly H at alaz the White House a US Army Officer has resigned from the military in protest of us support for Israel's war on Gaza the US supports Israel with nearly $4 billion worth of military aid every year Major Harrison man who was working at the defense intelligence agency posted an open letter on the social media site LinkedIn that accuses the US of nearly unqualified support for the government of Israel which has enabled and empowered The Killing and starvation of tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians he continues to State this unconditional Support also encourages Reckless escalation that risks wider War let's go to Patty ghain who's following this from Washington DC and Patty what more can you tell us well Major Harrison man had been with the Army for about 13 years with the specialization in Middle East policy worked at an embassy now he was currently he had been working at the defense intelligence agency focusing on the Middle East that's a fairly powerful agency within the Pentagon but now he has released as you mentioned this open letter and he basically said my work however administrative or marginal it may seem has uh has continued to unquestionably unquestionably continue to that support he gave a little bit of his history saying as a descendant of European Jews he was raised in a particularly uh moral environment when it came to bearing responsibility for ethnic cleansing so really very strong words from the major and uh then he said at some point whatever justification you're either advancing a policy that enables the mass starvation of children or you're not now he resigned November 1st early from uh the DIA and said at the time people asked him why did you quit early and you don't have a job lined up and he didn't really go public until now possibly because of what's happening in Rafa and he sent this a note to uh other team members saying you know I thought you I didn't have any support perhaps you're struggling with this as well and not every can quit I don't expect you to do that but just know you're not alone now we've reached out to the Army for any sort of comment we haven't heard back yet don't know if he's the first one uh person from the Armed Forces to quit because of this we do know that there have been a few resignations within the state department a man who worked in the weapons transfer department a woman who worked with human rights and another who was the Arabic spokesman for the state department and they've all been very public about why they've left at the same time we are seeing report after report that within the internal Communications they've a descent Channel at the state department lots of cables saying that the US needs to change policy same with us Aid uh but as far as publicly quitting the Pentagon because of this this seems to be the first now again a major is very much a mid-level manager but uh it is again notable because he's making his descent public many thanks paty gohain there for his life in Washington DC okay let's unpack some of the day's developments now with Al jazer senior political analyst Maron bashara who's here with me in the studio I want to focus Maran if we may on these lines that have been coming out of Washington from the US National Security advisor Jake Sullivan but before we do I want to flag something that Benjamin Netanyahu said on a podcast earlier on in the day he said tensions with the US are making it harder for Israel to get the captives out and now we've had the US coming out affirming its support for Israel and its plans in Gaza it's it's incredulous what's going on between uh natano and Biden Nano and the United States of course natano is famous for blaming everyone else for his own failure and betraying everyone he almost everyone in Israel who who works with Netanyahu or is no longer working with Netanyahu has already accused Netanyahu of either backstabbing or lying right I think Biden is discovering that himself there's certainly a Netanyahu fatigue at the White House there's an Israel fatigue in the United States and in the rest of the world there's a Netanyahu fatigue and an Israel fatigue because of the unraveling genocide on our TV screens I think people are just getting fed up with more of the same with not anything changing right and using the same excuses and this is the thing with we've heard from Washington as well of course as from Israel because Washington seems to be parting uh the lines coming out of natano and his government about this and that happening in Gaza but it was really just so nonsensical hearing Jack Jake Sullivan repeating more of the same mantras that already been debunked over the past seven months about why there are such huge loss of life in Gaza uh clearly the bombing of hospitals schools universities and so on cannot all be you know reduced to oh Hamas Heights between civilian population there's a chorus of uh Nations around the world that believe what's happening in Gaza is very much a genocide but um one of the things that Jake Sullivan said categorically is that right now Washington doesn't believe it is a genocide at all it also said it supports Israel in the destruction of Hamas uh and also believes Israel's operation in Rafa is quote targeted what do words like this indicate at this current time what sort of message does it send Israel in terms of its ongoing plans and strategy for Gaza impunity Israel could act with impunity thanks to the United States because somehow the Biden Administration especially Sullivan and blinkin tend to always find a way to justify Y what Israel is doing defend what Israel is doing or reinterpret what Israel is doing or saying better than the Israelis are doing it themselves it's really amazing to find these sort of defense lawyers or national security advisor and secretary of state of Israel rather than the United States but be that as it may um I think the the main problem in all of this is that the United States continues to be complicit and the Biden admin ation is not able to escape being uh sort of backed into a corner if you will in this election year it's already lost uh big time in the five or seven uh swing States today's poll in the published in the New York Times shows that Biden is really losing big time in important states that will really render him the loser of this coming election but the same time the Republicans are even going Beyond him talking about flattening Israel nuking uh sorry flattening Palestine Gaza even nuking suggesting nuking Gaza and so on so forth the best way for him to have kind of got out of this mess is to insist on a ceasefire but Netanyahu does not want a ceasefire the generals in Israel do not want a ceasefire the the security cabinet of fascists and Fanatics do not want a cease fire so here we are we find ourselves on the logic of uh full-blown eventually invasion of Rafa whether the United States likes it or not but the United States continues to be lost in its own logic as always my many thanks my bash there make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest
