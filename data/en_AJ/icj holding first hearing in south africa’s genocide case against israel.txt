we begin in the ha where the international court of justice is preparing to hear arguments that Israel is committing genocide in its war on Gaza the case is being brought by South Africa and accuses Israel of violating the 1948 un genocide convention by carrying out mass killings expulsions and making statements describing Palestinians as subhuman more than 23,000 Palestinians have been killed so far nearly half of them children the UN says Gaza has become uninhabitable in a moment we'll speak to Farmer the Miller in Petoria hanni Mahmud is in Gaza and Stephanie deer in occupied East Jerusalem but first to Osama bin Javid at the Hagen Osama talk us through what we're expecting in court today as you can see behind me the sun is beginning to rise over the peace palace here in the he where this Landmark case is shortly going to commence where South Africa is going to convince the international court of justice that what it deems Israel is doing in Gaza amounts to genocide and it is not at this moment wanting or looking to for the international Court to declare it as genocide but immediately act to stop what it deems as acts of genocide so there is a long laid out 84 page document with hundreds of footnotes uh where it has collected uh evidence from uh international news organizations NOS un reput tours on various issues regarding this conflict on indiscriminate bombing of civilians on mass displacements on targeting of facilities such as cultural centers and health facilities on all the acts that Israel has not just carried out but also declared intent there's a four-page section which looks at uh the statements that have been made all the way from the president to the prime minister to various ministers in the Israeli government where South Africa says is not just intent but actions on the ground on uh today's hearing it is going to present its case and there's going to be a rebuttal on Friday from Israel so there is going to be uh arguments that are going to be presented and uh it is expected uh that this is going to not just uh it is it has commenced but it is not going to be concluded before years to come Osama what's happening outside Court we can see people rallying behind you carrying Palestinian Flags it looks like well hundreds of people have been Gathering here at the peace Palace even a day before this hearing was going to commence uh protesters we've met and pro Palestine activists who've come from all over Europe we met people from Germany from Spain from here in Netherlands and other places as well they say that they're here to show solidarity and support to what the South Africans are saying say that they don't see this as a a they see this as an open and shut case where the actions on the ground for 96 days are ample evidence that there has been an indiscriminate bombardment of atrocity crimes which have been carried out by Israel they say they don't want to just show support for South Africa but also to say to the world which the leaders who are supporting Israel that this has to stop now and they are going to continue to put pressure on everyone so that the genocide according to them in Gaza can stop Osama thank you very much for that Osama bin Javid live at the hag let's go down to Fara Miller she's joining us from South Africa's administrative Capital Petoria and Fara how is this case being watched there especially given South Africa's historic support for the Palestinian cause well if we look at what South Africa the government has said uh in the last three months they've made a number of strong statements against what is happening in Gaza against the Israeli government and of course leading to this point where uh they have taken that Court bir to the icj accusing Israel of genocide that move has been welcomed by many South Africans and is well supported uh in recent weeks uh South Africa and recent months the government has uh recalled his diplomatic staff from Israel and prior to that had also uh recalled its Ambassador and uh and had also put forward a vote in South Africa's Parliament uh to end relations with Israel uh at least for the time being until there is a ceasefire so these are all the actions that have led up to this point and so many South Africans are not necessarily surprised we've heard from the South African government including the international relations Minister n p who has said that Israel has an added obligation as the occupier of an occupied territory and people uh to abide by the uh genocide conventions or prevent uh genocide including um what South Africa is calling Collective punishment while there are many South Africans like the many behind us who have have come to the Palestinian Embassy where we are to watch proceedings uh at the court there is also the uh Jewish Board of deputies which says uh represents uh the Jewish community in South Africa and it's condemned the South African government saying that rather than approaching the court this is time that could be spent in a positive way what it says a more positive way and speaking to both sides uh in this conflict uh it has been critical of the South African government uh throughout the war on Gaza their position hasn't changed but given South Africa's history of apartate colonialism and and racism uh this is something that many South Africans identify with very strongly in terms of the subjugation of a specific ethnic group The targeted killings subjugation racism uh as well as the difficulties the many difficulties that Palestinian people are are going through in those territories far thank you very much for that farm of the Miller with a view from Petoria let's go now to hanni Mahmud he is joining us live from Rafa in southern Gaza and hany how do people there feel about the case at the hag do they have any hope that it can stop the violence against them yes well so far just just from talking to people briefly uh here just a great deal of of of hope that is still a bit of suspicious optimism of what's going on they are happy and and hopeful that finally a country like South Africa is hearing uh their misery and suffering and taking the perpetrators to the international Court uh of justice and a great deal of Hope but at the same time it's coming coming with suspicious optimism because they know that part of this actions will be taken to the UN Security Council where there's a high possibility a country like the United States will vet to any actions in favor of the Palestinian just citing a past experiences and examples of how the US V resolution calling for a permanent ceasefire and into the war on the Gaza Strip so far we have a group right group Advocates across the Palestinian territory seeing these hearing sessions as a as a a measures provisional measures that that are intended to stop the situations from getting worse across the Gaza Strip as the war continues to pound every means of Life across the territory and the one priority that they have right now is that Israel to seize the killing of civilians and put an end to all the atrocities committ committed by the Israeli military and they also are hopeful that the the topic of occupation that Israel is still effectively occupying a and controlling uh the the borders and all the access point to the G strip will be addressed in the international uh court of justice so far everything on the ground suggest and fit within the allegations of war crimes submitted by South Africa to the international court of justice and what we're talking about is the ongoing constant killings and the Ming of civilians and the the forc displacement and the failure of the Israeli military and its government to provide safe place for displace for the 1.5 Millions displac Palestinian addition the intentional and attacks on hona United Nations for p facilities including evacuation centers and schools and the obliteration of Civic life all fits the characterization and the definition of war crimes committed so far in the Gaza Strip Hy thank you very much for that hany mm joining us live from Rafa in southern Gaza and Let's cross live now to Stephanie DEA she is an occupied East Jerusalem and Stephanie Israel denying the allegations as we expect but it is taking them very seriously very seriously um Israeli media had quoted last week that uh cables were sent to All embassies uh urging their diplomats to Lobby governments uh to get their support in rejecting uh this case and also saying that they need to be more vocal in terms of uh showing the world that they're trying to get humanitarian Aid in um Israel is going to be very keen to remind the world of the atrocities that Hamas carried out on October the 7th Israel saying that it's the victim that it is in self-defense of and that it's doing its utmost to try and prevent civilian casualties you even had the Israeli Prime Minister come out late last night in an English statement um posted online uh very much a message to the International Community saying that it had no intention of reoccupying Gaza it had no intention of forcibly displacing civilians and it did everything to prevent um to prevent that of course we're talking over 23,000 casualties most of those civilians now South Africa's case which is just about to be heard in the next hour or so does take all of that in consideration in the sense that it doesn't just start on October the 7th it goes back decades It quotes multiple reports un reports um going back that shows that what is simp what is happening has been a pattern of occupation a pattern of Oppression a pattern of dehumanization that has culminated and escalated to some of its worst um after October the 7th so that's going to take around 3 hours we from South Africa tomorrow we'll be hearing from Israel also we understand some of the families of some of the hostages have arrived at the he to be there as well again Israel very keen to remind the world um of the events of October the 7th and it of course says it is uh carrying all of this out in self-defense Stephanie thank you very much for that that is Stephanie deer live in occupied East Jerusalem
