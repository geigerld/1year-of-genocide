well we can talk now to basam Naim who is a member of hamas's political Bureau sir I I want to start by asking you about the six Israeli captives whose bodies were found in a tunnel in southern Gaza the Israeli authorities and Hamas are blaming each other for killing them how did they die thank you very much uh we also in the leadership of Hamas here outside of the country we are waiting for the final uh story or narrative from the resistance on the ground because we have it is very complicated their underground we can remember recently when the Israelis have tried to rescue some of their captured Israelis inat two months ago they have rescued three uh uh living captured Israelis but they have at the same time killed three others and killed uh at the same time two 50 Palestinians and wed hundreds in each time in another case in Shia the Israelis have killed also by I'm I'm talking killed not only by this by missiles attacks where they have killed at least 70 to 80 of their on uh people but I'm talking about cases where they have killed by snipers or by direct shooting therefore uh no until now we cannot confirm any of these uh allegations of the side they haven't specifically if if I can jump in specifically Israel says that the autopsy shows that the bodies carry signs of bullet wounds and the autopsy suggests that they were shot at close range a short while before the Israeli troops got there are those things that first of all first of all we have he a lot of Israeli stories like beheading of baby of mass ring or gang gings and a lot of other lies which has unfortunately adopted by the Western media in particular in the United States uh which has been shown later to or have been proven later to be uh fabricated stories second uh they might be uh killed by uh cross shooting or cross-firing between the fighters and the Israeli soldiers but we are not sure how they have been killed they have the Israelis themselves they haven't shown any evidence we are we are ready to send and Hamas says that they were killed by bombing and equally Hamas is not shown evidence of that sorry we we are okay if they can allow us to send a neutral investigation committee with forensic medicine to proof their allegations but uh they they say this in the media without any serious uh scientific evidence of what they have said okay the the head of the I would point out that the head of the um UN Human rights office vulka Turk has called for such an independent investigation so the spokesman of hamas's armed Wing says that the guards who are holding the Israeli captives in Gaza have been under new instructions since June instructions on what to do if Israeli troops approach what are those instructions again unfortunately I cannot satisfy you by very detailed answer but again based on because I haven't the information the detailed information but what I this is a statement by abua the spokesperson of the kassan Brigade continue because you know that three weeks or four weeks ago there was an incident that one of the guards of those captured Israelis for for uh unknown reason he shot uh one of the captured Israelis and wounded other TOs and there was an investigation committee and uh I haven't the I I don't have the details but after these incidences there was new instructions uh more details I cannot now talk about it I haven't in confirmed but what I am sure of that any Israeli attempt to rescue their own captured Israelis by force by uh missiles attacks by direct shootings it will endanger uh the pal senior citizen the uh the people who are guarding them those captured Israelis and the Israelis themselves and we haven't seen we have seen it in in many cases along the last 10 months yeah the the same statement by Abu aedas yesterday uh says something a little similar to what you're saying now uh that Mr netanyahu's insistence on freeing the captives through military pressure instead of reaching a deal means the captives will go back to their families and coffins do you understand that that could be read that can be construed as meaning that Hamas is willing to kill the captives if Israeli troops get close to them that's the whole point that I'm trying to put to you are you today tell are you saying I cannot understand are you saying that Hamas categorically would not do that I cannot say I cannot understand in this way but what I can understand based on the experience of the last 10 months that instead of having these people uh uh fre um enjoying their presence between their in their families through a negotiated deal for months ago in Netanyahu insisting in continuing this aggression against our people continuing on retrieving the solders by force and the result in a lot of cases that uh these captured Series has been killed directly by the Israeli soldiers or by missile strikes or maybe by cross-firing between the fighters and the Israeli soldiers and therefore in most of the cases they have tried to retrieve the soldiers they have failed again they have they have succeeded only in one case but in this case in no they have retrieved four living captured Israelis killed another three and killed 250 other Palestinian citizen innocent citizen this is what I can understand from his uh tweet yesterday that the attempt to retrieve them forcefully it means most probably they will they will be killed let me ask you this then is Hamas currently able to keep the captives in Gaza safe as the war continues No One Is Safe in Gaza neither the captives nor our own people or our Fighters 50 40 more than 40,000 Palestinians most of them children and women killed in Gaza in most of them in safe zone or safe areas announced by the Israelis No One Is Safe in Gaza where are we on uh ceasefire negotiations right now has any progress been made over the last 3 weeks unfortunately uh the uh deal which has been uh brokered uh on at the beginning of July by the mediators has been been undermined and sabotaged by Netanyahu face of all by committing two big massacres in Gaza Strip one in in in in in Gaza City and the other one in kanun and and finally assassinating the head of the movement second by adding uh a new conditions which was uh uh not negotiated before even in the Israeli paper which is considering the core of the negotiated deal it was not part of this negotiated deal the new Israeli condition B by Netanyahu for example the the physical presence of the Israeli Army in Philadelphia Corridor the physical the presence of the Army in the ra Crossing inat or in Nim Corridor the investigation and searching of the people while they are returning back home and they have changed even the terms or the terminology of the ex of the uh prisoner uh deal uh we have said it clearly we are committed we are still committed to go immediately for implementation of what we have agreed upon by the mediators including the America The Americans on July second but we are not ready to go for New negotiations because each time in different in in in a lot of stations we have we were near to reach an deal he committed either new crimes or he sabotaged the uh deal by adding new conditions even which which was not part of his own proposal uh Mr Naim I want to put something to you which you may or may not be aware of because we ourselves just got the information uh the US justice department has just announced that it is charging Hamas leader Yahya senoir as well as other uh top Hamas uh commanders for crimes committed during the October 7th attack your reaction your comments on that first of all um it was not it is not surprising for me to hear such uh news uh but I think the one who H who has to be tried and uh accused for war crimes is Mr Joe Biden himself and his administration who is directly participating for the last 11 months in killing of our people and destroying of our uh country the United States has sent along the last 11 months more than 500,000 tons of explosive materials and weapons to Israel they have supported and backed them up for politically in the by blocking the international will in the UN General Assembly and un Security Council by using the veto they have supported them in the media by adopting all their lies and fabricated stories therefore the one who is committing the genocide is not only Netanyahu but also Mr Joe Biden and his administration they have to be uh tried in front of international uh courts as genocidal uh leaders well as a reminder to our viewers uh the chief prosecutor of the IC the international criminal court has sought arrest warrants against Yahya senoir and against the Israeli Prime Minister and his defense minister those arrest warrants have not uh yet been uh granted they haven't been issued but he has asked for them b m yeah sorry go ahead at the end of for us Palestinians and all people here in the region we believe that we are Freedom Fighters and mrir is leading a national Palestinian National Liberation movement understood basm Naim member of hamas's political Bureau thank you very much please make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
