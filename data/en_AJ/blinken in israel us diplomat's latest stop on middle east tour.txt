US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has arrived in Israel after a stop in Saudi Arabia he is on a regional diplomatic tour that began on Thursday and included visits to Qatar Jordan and the United Arab Emirates blinkin will meet with a member of Israel's war cabinet on Tuesday to discuss the war on Gaza his visit comes as Israeli forces continue near nightly raids in the occupied West Bank three Palestinians were killed and one wounded man was detained by Israeli forces in the city of Tulare Palestinian factions have declared a general strike in THM on Tuesday in morning Israeli forces have also raided the city of cilia there have been near daily incursions across the occupied West Bank by the Israeli military 340 Palestinians have been killed since October 7th ham salut is joining us live from occupied East Jerusalem and disturbing footage from the latest raid in tar hamda is it continuing that raid that started nearly five hours ago inim continuing in the city's refugee camp now it started when Israeli Special Forces undercover went into tarim to say they said to arrest a wanted Palestinian fighter but there is quite disturbing video that emerged from that raid three Palestinian men shot at a very close range their bodies laying bleeding in the streets and then in the video you can see an Israeli military vehicle run over one of those dead bodies in the streets it stops for a mere moment and then continues to run him over we do know that a fourth man was shot in the leg and subsequently arrested by the Israeli military all of this comes as there was a drone strike in tarim this evening several Palestinians reportedly injured several ambulances rushing to the scene there and in fact the Israeli milit AR had stopped one of the ambulances and detained a Palestinian that was injured inside he has since been released and is being treated at one of the local hospitals again just a continuation of these nightly incursions into the occupied West Bank the population in tarim is now used to these types of military raids every single night in fact we have seen just in the last few days a raid on the new toems refugee camp that lasted around 2 days military in equipment and vehicles tearing up streets destroying infrastructure destroying water lines leading up to the refugee camp and in the refugee camp itself since October 7th 340 Palestinians have been killed and 60 of them in tarim alone all right H the meanwhile Anthony blinkin has arrived in Israel as Israeli air strikes kill more than 249 palestin Ians in Gaza just in the past 24 hours despite Israel saying it's shifting to what it calls a lower intensity phase of the war so do we know what's on the US agenda with this [Music] visit there's going to be a lot on the agenda for the US Secretary of State the Americans remember have been pressuring the Israelis for quite some time to transition into a lower intensity type of fighting because of the high civilian casualties we have been seeing you're talking about an overall death toll of more than 23,000 Palestinians who have been killed in the last three months almost 60,000 people injured 8,000 missing not to mention the nearly 2 million who have been displaced and forced to flee all of that is going to be on the agenda as well as the humanitarian situation the Americans have also said that not enough humanitarian Aid is going into Gaza but blinkin also wants to talk about prospects for peace in the in the future what could lasting peace for Israel look like all while helping the Palestinian people and their plight and that perhaps that could be a pathway to a Palestinian State all of this comes though as he does still want answers about what the Israelis are hoping to do what they call the day after Hamas the day after the war ends but again the Israelis themselves do not have a consensus on what that looks like Israel's defense minister released an initial framework but it's no an indication that that's actually going to be what happens since it hasn't even been discussed within the security and War cabinets the Israelis have said that they've transitioned to this lesser intensity type of fighting now focusing on Central and Southern Gaza saying that they have reached full operational control in Northern Gaza but again what they're saying and the reality on the ground time and time again have proven to be two completely different things ham thank you very much for that that's hamda salud live and occupied East Jerusalem
