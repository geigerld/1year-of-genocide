the first shipment of US military aid has arrived in Israel this comes after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to escalate the bombardment of Gaza President Joe Biden has expressed his full support for Israel let's go live now to Kimberly Halid our White House correspondent in Washington DC and Kimberly as the hours pass in in Gaza it's clear that a very dire humanitarian situation is transpiring our correspondent they're talking about entire neighborhoods being wiped out as the US is sending weapons I'm wondering is there any discussion going on about ensuring that these weapons are not being used to Target civilians and the operations of wiping out neighborhoods that reporters are talking about well what I can tell you is that the Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is headed to meet with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and he will be traveling on Wednesday what we know is that part of those conversations will include the discussion of safe passage for the residents of Gaza folded into that conversation will also be officials from Egypt because of course the question becomes although the residents of Gaza are purportedly being warned about the bombings that may be taking place of apartment blocks and so on the question becomes where are they supposed to go there is no place for safe refuge and so as a result uh many humanitarian groups and international groups have flagged the fact that there is nowhere to go and so this discussion of safe passage is being discussed the National Security advisor Jake Sullivan spoke to White House reporters on Tuesday did not elaborate a lot about what discussions are underway way but certainly has uh said that those are discussions that the secretary of state has uh embarked upon and so just to put it in context then is the thinking that uh the idea is that an evacuation will be arranged of Palestinians in Gaza to move them towards Egypt he did not elaborate at all on any of the details he simply said that there was a discussion underway all right we'll leave it there thanks so much kimbery halin the UK foreign secretary James cleverly has arrived in Israel to show unwavering support for more on this let's speak to Al jazer NE barco's live for us in London so Neeve what's the message from the UK well the message is very clearly more unequivocal support for Israel from the outset that has been the standpoint of uh the British government and now of course we're seeing it played out on the ground with this visit by Britain's foreign secretary James cleverly he will be meeting with Israeli politicians and lawmakers as well as we believe some of the victims of the weekend's attack it follows warm words coming from Rishi sunak towards Benjamin Netanyahu earlier on in the week in which the British prime minister said that if I asked Britain would be prepared to provide intelligence and diplomatic support to the Israeli government in the wake of uh these attacks uh the problem is here in the UK that there is a tremendous amount of concern about the black and white nature in which this entire conflict is being seen without any wider context being referred to by the British government or indeed any opposition parties I mean Hamas back in 2021 was design ated as a terrorist organization uh and as such the British Home Secretary soel braan has uh told British policemen that um if any uh Palestinian flags are flown any unsavory chance chanted at Pro Palestinian rallies then people could well potentially be arrested those moves could be seen as illegal and that's very much likely to deepen the rift that is already pretty big between opposing versions opposing interpretations of what we're seeing play out in uh Israel and Gaza very very little reference if any to the plight of Palestinians we have had few comments probably the most vocal and we had it on Al jaaz earlier on the day from Hamza Yusef the first minister of Scotland whose relatives are in Gaza he is probably one of very very few prominent politicians who are doing everything possible to try and shine a light on what's going on in Gaza and call for humanitarian Corridor all right thanks so much NE marker there from London
