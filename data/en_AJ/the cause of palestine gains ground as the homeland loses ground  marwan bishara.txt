Al senior political Alice Maran bashara joins us here in the studio and Marwan it seems as though there is perhaps some confusion over what might happen next in Rafa because uh the aerial bombardment the attacks on the territory have continued and actually they've been intensifying really worrying reports about more than 100,000 people fleeing people who've already been displaced from other parts of Gaza and now it seems maybe a little uh confusion or contentiousness over where Washington stand on this and uh whether or not they have done anything to restrain Israel's actions in Rafa but you know it's sort of symptomatic of what what we've seen the past seven months the United States expresses uh its hesitation its reluctance its cautiousness say about a land Invasion nanyo says we will do it after several weeks they they do it and the Americans following Israel's footsteps over the last few weeks the United States been saying no invasion of Rafa now they're saying no full invasion of Rafa complete invasion of Rafa so Nan says well we'll do a limited invasion of Rafa which probably will take us to a full invasion of Rafa because to my mind whether there are talks in in in Cairo Doha or elsewhere to my mind netan and his generals and his Fanatics of our ministers are determined to go into Rafa or much of Rafa or to attack Hamas and hamas's tunnels and hamas's Fighters and activists in Rafa even if that means heavy human cost I think they expect the United States eventually to follow on their footsteps and this idea that uh Washington has pressured Israel in some way to hold off on uh a sort of ground Invasion I mean does that does that make sense to you when really in explicit terms Washington has sort of said well even they didn't like the options that were presented to them by Israel and then they sort of seem to say that uh even if an invasion were to go ahead they need to come up with a plan for civilians so in that sense it's just it seems Israel may not have been given the green light but we know that they will be supported with everything they need certainly militarily for if this is to go ahead so this is a thing it's a bit uh you know clever clever as it were on the part of the United States um saying that well we are withholding some of the ammunitions that they were supposed to send to Israel but since the aid was approved by Congress multiple shipments have already left to Israel so in fact Nano says we will fight with our I don't know what nails and so on so forth It's all such hug because we all know that the American weapons have already left to Israel and Israel will have all the weapon it needs until the end of times from the United States and from US Stock piles in Israel and so on so forth so I think there's no worry about that but but the but the Biden Administration continuously gives the impression that it's reluctant and that it is not 100% on board because I think it's also careful that one day it will bear the brunt of the Judgment both of history and perhaps the international court of justice or the international criminal court I should say because they are complicit in the war and Gaza so if they can take a bit of a distance while at the same time ensuring that Israel does what Israel wants you know why not just a brief one more one there is a very important vote today at the UN General Assembly tell us about that well we already have some 40 countries recognize uh the state of Palestine it's good that there's some mention that it is going to be on the basis of 1967 borders meaning that territory I think clearly just on the basis of what you were saying earlier on Rafa and we what we're saying later on about Palestine something incredibly important is happening in the world today Israel is getting a beating around the world while Palestine is getting a beating in the Middle East so why while Israel is really cracking down hard War crime Slaughter and so on so forth in Palestine while Palestine is losing as the Homeland but Palestine the cause whether it's at the United Nations or Western capitals or university campuses is certainly getting ground we'll certainly have coverage of that significant vote the UN General Assembly a bit later on Maran for now thank you and actually make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaaz zero
