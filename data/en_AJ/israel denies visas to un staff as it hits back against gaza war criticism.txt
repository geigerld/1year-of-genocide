jesa albanesi is the UN special reporter on the occupied Palestinian territory and joins me now from Milan miss albanesi good to have you with us on alaz thank you very much for your time we know how valuable it is uh during this period of the Year some pretty Stark and dire accusations being made by that Israeli Israeli spokesperson that the UN is complicit partners of Hamas are you complicit partners of Hamas of course not of course I'm not of course the secret General is not of course Ocha anra and all un agencies are not but again these are the usual accusations by Israel to the United Nations and to whomever denounces the Absurd and criminal practices of Israel this is not new Israel targets the messenger this is what it has been doing for decades now but now you see it's paradoxical Israel has killed 20,000 people 70% of whom are women and children Israel has devastated Gaza Israel has destroyed Gaza and we are still blaming the UN I still wonder how the International Community gives credit to Israel and how International media still give credit to what Israeli leaders political and military leaders say Israel should be held accountable for what it does so let's unpick this now very slowly let's start with the no visas for un staff can Israel do this legally no this is something that me my predecessor my predecessor's predecessor and his predecessors have gone through for 17 years now Israel abuses of its powers as an occupying power in Gaza in the West Bank and East Jerusalem because Israel doesn't have sovereignity over these territories so as long as it Remains the de facto occupying power it should abide by international law and its un obligations it cannot retaliate against anyone according to its own interpretation of un rules which is what he does so we have now let's move on to the indiscriminate bombing of medical facilities is that in compliance with international law adding to this arresting and detaining medical workers laying Siege to medical facilities cutting off power and refusing Medical Aid to reach Hospitals and Clinics these are the facts as we've seen during this so-called self-proclaimed Israeli War on Gaza so I ask you has Israel done enough to keep Palestinian civilians safe no no and no Israel has not done anything to keep civilians safe let me give you three examples first of all Israel has used uh ammunitions that are meant to create huge destruction even the Washington Post and in the New York Times have given a sense have produced investigative reports uh saying that Israel has used over 80 Days the uh uh level of ammunitions that are equal to two and more than two nuclear bombs in the Gaza Strip which let's remind is 360 square meters inhabited by two over two million people second Israel has been targeting hospitals which are ster ster under International humanitarian law and again the the health system is devastated which is not just critical in itself it's critical in order to provide support to people who are injured at the time of war and and third Israel has arrested and detained um medical personnel doctors nurses abusing them and even torturing them how can these be explained this is why special repors have denounced through and through the risk of genocide and the health system speaks clearly to the intent to destroy the pal inian people in Gaza you mentioned the word genocide it's a word that's been used um quite a lot these past eight weeks can I just bring uh you to focus on the images also that we've been seeing in the past 24 hours the dehumanization as they've been described of Palestinian people in the occupied territories the images uh of firstly partially clothed detainees uh one assumes at the moment as far as the Israelis are concerned as as well that they are civilians but they are being paraded around like prisoners of war and I dare say it's frighteningly reminiscent to anybody watching these images of historical images that we've seen in the past of Abu grave in Iraq shre bran and there I also say images from World War II no totally the horror that we are seeing in Gaza is unmatched because as you say it it reminds of several cont text of several words of several horror and everything is packed in one and being televised this is what I find shocking is being televised where the people in Gaza not only they're bombed they're killed they're blamed they are smeared they're also uh in know in a way displayed in this pornography of War I I frankly I'm at loss I have no wor because even even if even if these people who have been captured by Israel where Hamas Fighters they should be treated humanely there are children there are bodies who clearly are children in uh in those footages that have been captured and shown to the world how can this be legal this is utterly legal this is Criminal because even even even combatants are uh allowed to benefit from the guarantees of international law meaning being treated humanely which is not what they are offered the Israeli Prime Minister in his um Wall Street Journal article also talks about der radicalizing the Palestinian population in Gaza again giving the impression that everybody is inverted commas and I quite a terror IST and that they need to be deradicalized these people have been living in what is nothing more than an open air prison for the last what 15 years if not longer uh and so der rical and why is why does he think it's his job to deradicalize a community that might not even be radicalized to start with no first of all let's be clear I I need to correct myself and to correct including the United Nations for having CL for having called Gaza an open air prison it's not an open air prison it's a ghetto this is what Gaza is and uh frankly how can we deradicalize people we don't even know if they're radical these people I mean half of the population in Gaza is under 18 they have not elected they have never voted for anyone so how do we know that they are radicalized in the first place but plus I don't I don't think that the point of Benjamin nany's uh open head should be the D der radicalization the point is that they want to empty Gaza of Palestinians they are calling for a forc displacement of Gaza of Palestinians from Gaza and I've said from the very first week from the very fifth day of this military operation I've said this is ethnic cleansing this is what Israel has in mind to empty Gaza of the Palestinians and this is happening as we speak and this needs to stop there is only one way to stop it and it's at CIS fire there is no other way a sisire a return of the Gaza population to the houses that are still holding there and then reconstruction but also holding Israel accountable Israel is to pay for what it has done to Gaza in as much as Hamas is to pay for what it has done to the Israeli civilians on the 7th of October in indeed the contradiction here is and you sort of slly mentioned at the beginning of this interview is about the International Community why haven't they been louder why hasn't the media itself uh been voicing its outrage at what it sees here when uh it's been very vocal about issues historically let's just say the Balkans and now about Ukraine Joe Biden has said no ceas fire on one side and yet he's also said absolutely no movement uh of pal inian outside of Gaza he does not want to see Mass migration he does not want to see another NABA basically so there is now going to be some sort of there I said head-to-head surely between Washington and Tel Aviv about the way forward there has to be yeah but I don't see that because okay two things here first of all Sita happened happened and the world let it happen r Randa the genocide in Rwanda happened and the world let it happen and at the same and this is the same way the world is letting a genocide unfolding in Gaza so to put to put things in context the world the International Community is proving once again unable to prevent atrocity crimes so this is the first factor that we need to bring in the second element is that I don't see a head tohe head between the US and Israel at all because the US keeps on pushing Switzerland not to have an International Conference on the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory keeps on pushing to delay the requests for aist fire a resolution on the ceas fire the US keeps on sending weapons to to Israel so there is no head-to-head there is an enabling of atrocity crimes being committed by Israel this is what the US is doing and we cannot we cannot be uh confused about that so where's the solution then miss Albania who is if it's not going to be the US who pushes either Israel or the us into a position where they have to move they have to change their their policy and their direction are we looking at Russia are we looking at China are we looking at the other big players on the security Council I mean where do you look for hope I I still think that I there is hope that the International Community other than the US Israel Germany nauru and Marshall Island will wake up but there might there must be a solution possible including outside of the security Council if the security Council continues to be paralyzed there are measures that must be taken by other countries economic diplomatic and political me measures that each country can take suspending economic and trade agreements with Israel stopping arm um transfer uh declaring an arms embargo and sanctions there is no other way than sanctioning Israel the same way the world had in the western world has sanctioned uh Russia when it declared when it started an unlawful war against UK why there is an exception for Israel now we should see what happens it's always good uh to get your input really appreciate this extended interview with you Franchesca albanesi the UN special rapporter on the occupied palestin Palestinian territory thanks for joining us from Milan ma'am thank you
