the UN Human Rights office says it's received allegations of what could be a war crime by Israeli forces in Gaza says it's received information alleging Israeli forces executed at least 11 unarmed Palestinians in front of their families in Northern Gaza Israeli forces allegedly stormed the Residential Building then separated the men from the women and children the incident happened at the Anan building where civilians were Sheltering the UN is calling for an investigation into the allegations Val Jer spoke to several eyewitnesses they stormed the building they forced their entry into residential Flats they dedicated bombs in the lower levels I live on the sixth floor I opened my door and switched the lights on they sto my house I told them we were a family a household of civilians they saw us men and their wives and children my brother-in-law tried to speak and explain all in the house are civilians but they shot him dead after that they rounded the men up and the women in the opposite house then the Israeli soldiers opened fire on all the men they told the women to stay in the other side then they were sh by a tank from outside the Israeli soldiers stormed our block of flights they forced their way into every home killed the men and detained the women and children we do not know their whereabouts they did the same on every floor all women were rounded up in one room by the time they reached us on the sixth floor they started shooting all the men my father-in-law and his son were shot they died instantly the Israelis killed them we kept the door open and did not show any resistance we kept the lights on as soon as the Israeli soldiers stormed our house they started shooting men then firing at the walls women were grabbed by the hair rounded up other young children were stripped of their clothes and forced to their knees all women were kept on the fourth floor and ordered to remove their hair coverings after that they took all of the men downstairs still naked then they opened fire killed them all executed them in Cold Blood after that an order was given for the tanks a mortar shell was fired on all the women on the fourth floor a young girl was killed my two daughters and female neighbors were injured the Israeli soldiers rounded up all the women in one room then fired three mortar shells at us then kept shooting their machine guns at us before that they stormed our house and opened fire I was hit with a bullet in my hand my daughter in her head my younger daughter was killed and my son is blind my husband was executed in Cold Blood all my other daughters suffered severe injuries broken bones and flesh torn open we were all hit by bullets and shrapnel I have been bleeding all over since 5:00 on Tuesday well joining us here in the studio now is Tamar Kut he's an assistant professor of public policy at The daha Institute for Graduate Studies good to have you with us so listening to those statements by eyewitnesses very disturbing stories and eyewitness account counts hmer right uh horrifying Sammy horrifying to watch this and um at the same time so astonishing and frustrating for us not to see the IC acting when it comes to this crime and the hundreds of other crimes that are being committed on daily basis in Gaza and they go undocumented as well because of limited access or for press and media as well and some of them actually have been documented though right because this is not the first time if we think back to December the 13th and discovery of 15 Bodies In shadia Abu gazala school not the first time there are allegations and eyewitness testimony talking about summary execution of civilians exactly Samy so in reality we have amble or enough evidence for any any objective neutral IC to immediately carry start an independent investigation on these crimes but we still don't see this happening and this question questions the entire neutrality of the organization and and it's now it's I mean obviously it's it's accused of being complicit in this situation because when we see the conduct of IC why is the ICC not moving is that to do with political pressure and the balance of power in the world I think it has to do with political pressure and and its legitimacy is being eroded now drastically because it is uh complying to political pressure and and and the the one way to look at it is it's the conduct of ICC in Ukraine I mean ICC had no access to occupied parts of Ukraine uh and had no access to Russia as well and and they managed to open an investigation and issue an an arrest warrant against Putin for what for the unlawful deportation transfer of children from occupied Parts in Ukraine to Russia and this this children are safe and they remain safe and many of them have returned to their families after Qatar has intervened and the Saudi Arabia has intervened in ranging that deal for the return but he was still indicted exactly and with all what's happening in Gaza you have you have Al jaer is there so many new agencies are there you have testimonies from citizens of Gaza you have like mountains of evidence in the Gaza to your point Tam let's think back a year ago when there were allegations of uh massacres war crimes in Ukraine this is what we heard from some of the world leaders like the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin Russian forces also open fire on 10 civilians uh who were waiting in line uh for bread these incidents uh joined a long list of attacks on civilian not military locations across Ukraine including apartment buildings public squares and last week a maternity hospital in marapole uh I doubt that any of us who saw those images will ever forget them yesterday President Biden said that in his opinion war crimes have been committed in Ukraine personally I agree Mr President after everything we've seen are you ready to call pu a war criminal no a war criminal sir oh I I think he is a war criminal you beting with so very clear statements from the US president to the US Secretary of State even calling Putin a war criminal and you've got to ask the question is there some connection there between what the US says and does and what the ICC prosecutor Karim Khan feels he's able to do of course of course I mean this is what we see here is um uh politicizing International laws and uh and and and the IC now has so many questions to answer to the larger Globe you know so many countries who have become signator of the ICC now and then they see this mis unethical conduct and politicizing the work of the the court itself and and and and and there are so many questions to be asked to the IC now I mean it's it's uh its position it's neutrality it's it it's it's it's it has been damaged demolished totally on the global stage because what we see in Gaza now it's it's uh it's I mean I mean Karim Khan went on his last visit to the Egyptian borders and he claimed that he has no access Israel denied him access to the Gaza Strip but still it does not they should not stop the IC from starting collecting evidence he even urged Palestinians and I called him he said I urge everyone to collect and provide us with any evidence you have on on such crimes and I mean I mean I mean the these crimes are being Ed they're being AED on TV now you can watch them by alaz and many entities what else does he want what is that didn't stop your argument is that didn't stop the ICC in Ukraine from filing without having to the actual location of exactly the crime scene all right thank you so much Tamm
