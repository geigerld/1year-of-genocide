store viers Antonio Gutierrez un Secretary General is speaking live from Aman and the nature that is absolutely fundamental to preserve the life of the people in Gaza so we have been insisting on the need of this is fire in the beginning our voice was relatively alone but now we are seeing more and more the ational Community recognizing the same recently the European Union for the first time was claimed the need of a pause leading to a sustainable Seas fire and uh we have today in the security Council a resolution in which as his fire is uh required together but not in a linkage with the release the unconditional release of all hostages and we have also always claimed for the need for that release so I see a growing consensus emerging International Community to tell the Israelis that the ceasefire is needed and I also see a growing consensus I heard it in the US I heard heard it from the European Union not to mention of course the Muslim World a growing consensus to tell clearly to the Israelis that any ground invasion of Rafa could mean a catastrophic humanitarian disaster and I strongly hope that this consensus that is emerging in the whole of the International Community will make Israel reflect and avoid what could be a dramatic tredy sorry crisis the crisis over the crisis receding of Honor H crisis is it re there is a very strong effort that we are making in order to address the natural problems and difficulties that unra had unra has been systematically underfunded so we need to strengthen it in different aspects and I think we are moving in the right direction with the the investigation with the inspection with the measures that are already being taken by the commissioner General but on top of that I see more and more countries recognizing the essential role of unra and even several of the countries that have suspended the funding have already restarted that funding and others are telling us that they hope that the result of the uh investigation and the result of the review will lead to the reestablishment of the funding to un it is with hope and with deep conviction that I see the future of the organization thank you so much do you have any time for more questions or the last last question that was not foreseen please go ahead we have another press conference with the well I didn't understand but it is the biggest question I've ever heard in a in a press conference well in in light of the United Nations principles that were established to guide the United Nations in its work we have seen the the abolishment of these United Nations values due to the war so it is related to the the question is related if like Israel has you know cemented that there is only double standards in the International Community there is dehumanization there is also the the what is being practiced on the ground is not a war but also a genocide so all of these are leading to double standards in the International Community Arena and the question is related how many children and wom and women should be killed in order for the United Nations to intervene there might be double standards in many places around the world there is a place where there are no double standards in the Secretariat of the UN under the authority of the Secretary General for us what matters are the principles and the principles are un Charter the principles are international law territorial Integrity of countries but also International humanitarian law the right of self-determination of peoples including the people of Palestine and in relation to those principles we have maintain our clear positions in all circumstances we were very loud and clear when he denounced the Russian invasion of the Ukraine and we are very loud and clear when we denounce the violations of international humanitarian law that are taking place in Gaza as we denounce the attack of Hamas in the 7th of October our principles are the same and we have no double standards unfortunately in the world not everybody can say the same so much thank you so much we you can ask in the foreign Ministry thank you you've just been listening to the UN Secretary General Antonio Guera is speaking live from Aman he's currently touring the region uh he was in Egypt yesterday we also saw him inspect the Rafa border crossing this is of course one of the main border crossing through which Aid goes into Gaza the context of this as will be known to many of our viewers is that uh very little Aid has been going into the Gaza Strip over the last five months really since the war has begun uh such that uh the IPC the body tasked with looking at Food insecurity warned just last month that famine was imminent in Northern Gaza and that the entire population of Gaza was at risk of famine so that is the context uh Antonio guer saying yesterday the International Community needs to be on the right side of history and it is time to flood Gaza with International Aid
