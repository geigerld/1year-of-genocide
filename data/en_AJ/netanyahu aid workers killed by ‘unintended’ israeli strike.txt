Israel's facing International condemnation after killing six foreign aid workers and their Palestinian driver in central Gaza the United States Israel's main Ally says it's heartbroken and deeply troubled by the strike in der Bala the aid workers were all from World Central Kitchen which says they were killed in a targeted Israeli strike their Convoy was hit shortly after leaving a warehous despite making the Israeli military aware of their movement Australian British polish and us Canadian citizens are among the dead several reporters covering the story for us now in a moment we're going to hear from our White House correspondent Kimberly Haw in Washington DC and Hut standing by in occupied East Jerusalem first we're going to go live to taloom who's in Rafa in southern Gaza tanic talk to us about the reaction there to the killing of the staff from World Central Kitchen yes uh absolutely Palestinians here in the Gaza Strip can clearly see this attack considered to be extremely unjustifiable by the Israeli military as there is a great sentiment of sadness and grief among Palestinians regarding the loss of uh the victims who have been killed in one of the latest trikes that targeted two uh vehicles for the world Central Kitchen as this attack considered to be a serious escalation against humanitarian organizations that are operating inside the territory and systematically Palestinians see that uh the Israeli forces have been attacking uh the humanitarian convoys eight Seekers and right now the humanitarian organizations that are responsible for Distributing aid for majority of gazans who are in a very desperate need for and earlier we have seen that the Israeli military have denied the uh um the uh Ona uh with the Ona flow of humanitarian Aid to the northern part of the Gaza Strip and today they have been attacking the world Central Kitchen as a part of the ongoing genocidal military campaign we in fact have been seeing that the Israeli that the World Central Kitchen had been the main uh food provider for the uh for the Gaza Strip as they have been Distributing more than 42 million meals till now since October uh and their ongoing efforts to alleviate the humanitarian situation and that's completely contradictory to the Israeli ongoing claims that they are facilitating Aid deliveries to the areas of the territory as they have been upscaling their attacks against eight Seekers and everyone also who is responsible for delivering Aid right now which had been one condemned not only Palestinian but also by the International Community T thank you very much indeed T zoom in Rafa in southern Gaza we're going to bring in ham salut who's in occupied East Jerusalem how has Israel been responding to all of this well initially the Israeli Army spokesperson Daniel hagat had given a press conference saying quote that an incident took place talking about the death of these Aid workers following his statement by saying there will be an Israeli military investigation and probe into all of this so the military did not at first acknowledge responsibility but later in the day the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did acknowledge that this was in fact an Israeli air strike on these vehicles for the world Central Kitchen and he also said quote it things like this happen in a war let's take a listen to some of those remarks unfortunately in the last day there was a tragic inent of an unintended strike of our forces on innocent people in the Gaza Strip this happens in war we are checking this thoroughly we are in touch with the governments and we will do everything for this not to happen again the Israeli Army has said that the military chief of staff hery halevi is personally involved in this investigation and that an initial probe will be released to the public within a couple of days but there are a lot of questions the Israeli Army will need to answer to and remember this is the first time they've really acknowledged any sort of unlawful killing but it has never happened in the case of Palestinians throughout the nearly 6 months of this war H thank you very much indeed I want to go to our White House correspondent Kimberly Hawker she's live for us now from Washington DC as we were mentioning before one of the victims I understand holds a joint US Canadian nationality is there anything from the US so far yeah National Security Council spokesperson Adrian Watson reacting on X former norly known as Twitter saying we are heartbroken and deeply troubled that the strike that killed the world Central Kitchen Aid workers in Gaza humanitarian Aid workers must be protected as they deliver Aid that is desperately needed and we urge Israel to swiftly investigate what happened and we should point out that this now that they have suspended their operations there are going to be ramifications that will have devastating impacts for the Palestinians that need their help because not only is the world Central Kitchen suspending their operations but also another us-based charity known as the American near East Refugee Aid they are also freezing their operations so combined they were delivering approximately 2 million meals a week so uh the concern is about the impact of this and not only that uh what this means moving forward you have to remember that it's not just relief workers that are being targeted but also journalists so we're watching very carefully to see what more the administration might have to say there is a press briefing that will be happening at 17:30 GMT and we of course will be there to follow up kimbery thank you very much indeed we're going to be checking in with you when that happens of course kimy Hulett thank you
