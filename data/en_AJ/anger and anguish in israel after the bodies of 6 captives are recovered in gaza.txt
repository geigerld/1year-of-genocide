turning to Gaza now where the Israeli military says it's recovered the bodies of six captives from a tunnel under Rafa in southern Gaza one of the bodies has been identified as HH Goldberg Poland an Israeli American his family confirmed the 23-year-old's death in a statement his relatives have been among the most high-profile Israelis lobbying the government to bring home the captives Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is blaming Hamas for what he calls the coldblooded murder of the Israeli captives he says securing deal to bring the remaining captives home as a priority we for our part will not give up the Israeli government is committed and I am personally committed to continue striving for a deal that will return all of our hostages and guarantee our security and existence I say to the Hamas terrorists who murdered our captives and I say to their leaders your blood is on your own heads we will not rest we will not be silent we will hunt you down we will find you and we will settle the score with you but Hamas says the captives were all killed in an Israeli Army strike in a statement it said the one who kills our people daily is the occupation with American weapons and the bodies of prisoners found in Gaza were only killed by Zionist bombing President Joe Biden must stop supporting this enemy with money and weapons and pressure the occupation to end its aggression immediately well pressure is rising on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire deal that includes the release of the remaining captives around 97 Israelis are believed to be held in Gaza about a third of them are now presumed dead a group representing the six captives killed blames their deaths on the government's failure to reach an agreement with Hamas thousands of people rallied across Israel on Saturday as they have done most weeks since October the 7th demanded the captives be brought home AKA Elder is a political analyst and contribut to the Israeli newspaper hirat he says it's unlikely the deaths of the captives would lead to a ceasefire I don't believe that uh it will uh change his mind because nany's main objective main target is survival and um he uh convinced not only uh the ministers the and most of them are mediocre if not midgets um that uh it is necessary to stay in Philadelphia access it's a matter of life and death um that it's even worse sacrificing the life of Israeli captives in order to stay there and this is in complete contradiction to what uh the uh military Security Experts and uh even in the administration in the Army in the shinb in the musl they say that uh Israel can deal with uh a withdrawal from the this exis it is not sacred we can come back if something goes wrong um and uh netan was even confronting in during the cabinets meeting the Minister of Defense who said to him clearly and it was it was leaked to the press that what you actually are doing is murdering at least 30 people that are waiting there in the tunnels to be released Al jaz's hand of Salud supported from Israel al jazer though has now been banned by the Israeli government from working there so Ham's here in studio with me here in Doha so hamda Netanyahu has clearly said it remains his priority to see the captives uh release while at the same time showing an absolute commitment to a military solution to Gaza and now of course six captives are now dead well when you hear what Anonymous Israeli officials are saying who say they're close to Netanyahu that they're close within the Coalition they say that Netanyahu has maintained military pressure is the only way to bring about the release of the captives and let's dissect netanyahu's statement just a little he says that Hamas killed these captives and that Hamas is not interested in a deal he who kills the captives is not interested in ceasefires or negotiations but netan who for so long for all of these months has had these incredibly hard lines hard lines that have caused a lot of tension within his own government within his own former War cabinet the defense minister who's called on Netanyahu to essentially kind of let go of these red lines and these non-negotiables so that there can be a deal but there's pressure now from families of captives but it's nothing new we've been seeing it since the beginning of the war where they have said he's neither cap nor willing to make a deal and that is still their belief that Netanyahu is prolonging the war for personal and political gain he maintains that military Solutions are the only way to continue on in this conflict and to bring about the release and it's something the family members are not taking well so fault lines as you say within the Israeli government you have Galant coming out the defense minister coming out and criticizing Benjamin Netanyahu also Fierce um opposition to Benjamin Netanyahu stands from the political opposition in the country talking about toppling him that's right yir Leed who is the leader of Israel's opposition and perhaps the fiercest critic of Netanyahu one of netanyahu's political Rivals who has said that it's netanyahu's fault that so many of these captives have died because according to Israeli military intelligence of course that we cannot verify ourselves they said that these six captives had Signs of Life just a few days ago that all of them were in fact alive and they were killed killed in some we don't know how Hamas is saying an Israeli air strike the Israelis are saying they were executed and killed by Hamas but nonetheless it's causing a lot of commotion within Israel because now you have municipalities in Israel that are going to go on strike you have Tel Aviv for example and several others businesses that want to close to show that they are so fed up with the government they're so fed up with its leadership and the opposition is backing all of these moves saying that anything that can put pressure on the Israeli government to get them to fold and accept a deal needs to be done all right as always H many thanks make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
