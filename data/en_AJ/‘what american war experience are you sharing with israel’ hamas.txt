these are the women and killers of women and children destroying hospitals churches and schools these people who whom the Sands of Gaza would swallow as it has swallowed um all Invaders so greetings and salute to Gaza and its people and salute to our Brave resistance onto the entire Gaza Strip especially Mr Yahya war and salute to the leadership of the resistance especially Mr Muhammad Al and to all the leadership of resistance and fighters in Gaza as the Nazi occupation continues its aggression against our people for the 73rd day is they have intensified committing massacr against unarmed civilians displaced people hospitals and the injured with an American Support weapon and coverage as the scale of horrendous massacres committed by the um occupations military in and in the vicinity of Kamal adwan hospital and their crime of killing and bulldozing um uh bu bulldozing injured people while they are still alive and the new Nazis have committed another massacre in jabalia against unarmed civilians and a massacre against the family of Alor and alwan in jabalia downtown 110 people were killed including 50 Children and dozens of misplaced people and this people have barbar have attacked in a barbaric fashion the entrance of alifa Hospital killing and attacking children and women uninjured as 26 people have been killed from displaced people in the hospital this occupation continues to bombard besiege and destroys the schools that hosts um hundreds of thousands of displaced people and revealing its lies talking about safe zones in Gaza in 73 days in 73 days this occupation has destroyed all the hospitals in the Gaza Strip which are supposed to be the source of survival for more than 2 million Palestinians rendering them out of service they continue to bombard and besiege and Destroy its infrastructure arresting the medical staff interrogating them under torture and starvation as as 38 as 38 medical staff including Muhammad Abu s the director of Al shifa Hospital who are still under arrest during 73 days of this aggression approximately 19,000 people have been killed and more than 52,000 injured including women and children destroying all all all amenities and infrastructure and this Nazi occupation still arrests hundreds of our people including women subjecting them to barbaric uh torture and many others are still under arrest near the shba and near Jerusalem the occupation through all this wants to make Gaza an uh unlivable Place Paving the way for displacement and emptying and evacuating the Gaza STP and but we say to Israel and its supporters their recent visitor the US Secretary of Defense this will not happen as the prime minister of the enemy is seeking advice based on the um War experience of the US Secretary of Defense we are asking what kind of experience The American Secretary of Defense are we talking about the victories in Vietnam or their victory in Afghanistan after 20 years the only experience shared by the US to this Nazi army is killing women and children and this destroying houses hospitals and schools our people will remain on their land because simply they are the owners of the land and they are the rightful people of the land and and the displacement of people is a culture is a culture of this entity of this entity that was formed by importing people from all around the world making them and planting them in a land that doesn't belong to them and now there is a reverse migration as these people have started to return to their original homes as hundreds of thousands of zionists have started after Al AA flood and imposing such an experience on our Palestinian people is a Folly and a stupid inference they haven't considered any difference between us and them we are the owners of this land for thousands of years they are the incoming people they are being imposed on on our land we are monitoring their reverse migration through elat and akaba Port returning to the various cities of the world where they came from this Nazi aggression wasn't limited to the Gaza STP however they have extended such aggression to all the cities and towns of the West Bank and Jerusalem through incursions invasions and dding lands and targeting the occcupation of the resistance as the number of those people arrest since the 7th of October amounts to to 4,575 Citizens as 300 were killed at the same time this is a clear message to those who waged on settlement those who waged on peace to be made by this criminal enemy unfortunately I and it's unfortunate that some still bet on this before this magnitude and scale of massacres and destruction in Gaza with starvation and genocide being perpetrated before the eyes of the entire world we would like to confirm the following that these crimes and horrendous massacres are committed by the Nazi occupation forces with full American Support making the American Administration and its president by a primary partner in uh shedding our Palestinian blood killing our children and women and destroying all pillars of livelihood in Gaza and this partnership have consequences in accountability this Nazi military is targeting only unarmed civilians systematically and deliberately without any dis discrimination indiscriminately uh 75% of the people killed or injured or injured are women children this occupation has killed over the past two days two Christian ladies in the monastery in Gaza and have killed a French Palestinian Diplomat by targeting his house in Gaza City may Allah bless their souls second we call upon the United Nations and Mr gues the Secretary General to shoulder their responsibility and continue to exercise all pressure to stop this aggression and the Nazi crimes committed against our people and to work with the countries rejecting this agression to exercise pressure against the US preventing the US from using their veto in the security Council third the United Nations and all the humanitarian organizations around the world they need to move rather quickly to pressure to pressure the occupation to reveal the fate of the people who have been kidnapped from Gaza and to release them immediately and we on our part we hold the occupation responsible for their safety and their lives fourth we reiterate our call to the leaders of Arab and Muslim Muslim countries to break the US Israeli veto and head towards the Gaza Strip with delegations for official delegations carrying with them all the aid needed and saving the lives of more than 2 million Palestinian people who are being killed by starvation and now they are without any shelter without medication without medicines forth the occupation has failed has failed to accomplish any of its objectives in Gaza and Publishing images of discovering a very long tunnel of alasam Brigade after 72 days of aggression is quiet too late as the mission has been performed which we which we intended from this tunnel and Publishing such images only an attempt to cover their failure on the 7th of October and their big losses among their troops and military equipment which will continue to increase as long as they continue their aggression in this context we would like to confirm the following that the Palestinian resistance especially alasam brigades still manage this battle with responsibility and with a capability encountering and engaging With the Enemy from close range and our missiles are reaching the depth of the Israeli um State we also confirm that that our people steadfastness on their land and the continued strikes against the occupations occupations troops and their equipment will lead to the failure of their attempts and plans to displace people also we would like to confirm that the US continued continued accusation against alasam that we have been the reason for foiling the truth is only adopting the lies of the occupation that no San individual would believe and here we say clearly that the occupation presence and their open war against our people our land and our sacri size for more than seven decades is the only reason for what's happening our struggle of our people shall continue as long as this occupation is on our land and no aggression will break us and we shall not be defeated by the already defeated will of the occupation we would like to confirm that no negotiations will be led for a prisoner swab unless or until the the Zionist aggression completely stops we are open to any initiative to seize and stop this aggression which we might receive from our brothers in Egypt or in C and we will deal with it in line with the steadfastness and the sacrifices of our people and our vision for our Palestinian national Vision the occupation has failed completely to Market their lies and propaganda in the international media as majority of their majority Publications on the that is Usama hamdan he's a senior Hamas official giving a press briefing from uh Beirut this is a regular press briefing that Asama hamdan uh gives from Lebanon what he said this time around is uh that he's called on Arab leaders to help deliver humanitarian Aid into Gaza much needed humanitarian Aid as we know uh as of today the death to in Gaza stands at 19,43 Palestinians more than 7,700 of those have been children usam hamdan also giving an update on uh the alasam fighters on the ground uh saying that uh they are determined and uh also that the fighters on the ground are he's praising the fighters on the ground rather uh who are battling the Israeli forces Let's uh bring in Sultan Barakat once again he's a professor public polic at Hamed bin Khalifa University joining us here on set so um Sultan just to uh pick up on what usam hamdan was saying I mean he's praising the alasam fighters on the ground today we understand that the Israeli military has uh announced the killing of two more soldiers obviously we don't know the exact number of soldiers that have been killed uh from Israel because they they don't announce the exact numbers but they announced about 128 so far many people in Gaza okay many say that could in fact be an underestimate well obviously I mean the system in Israel is slightly different from the one in Hamas I mean they have uh mechanism where they need to announce the dead almost immediately and there's pressure from their communities and question be slightly more accurate right but I what I did want to ask you is that um the more Israeli soldiers get killed and injured in Gaza the more pressure there's going to be on the Netanyahu government let's not underestimate 128 is very high for Israel Israel invaded Lebanon for years and back with about 88 casualties so 20 128 in 73 days in fact in less than 30 days since they started their land aggression it's a very high Coast for Israel and many of those are senior off uh officers because the way the Israeli Army operates they have their officers right at the front so it's it's a very uh difficult situation for Israel yeah okay uh let's talk about what we heard earlier on uh in the show uh and that is the uh us defense secretary who is who was in Tel Aviv what was the takeaway message from that do you think well as as we were saying earlier clearly the US is Keen uh on Israel to become more precise and uh cause less uh civilian casualties uh they're very they're probably also keen on as is to have a plan for the day after the way they talk about removing Hamas from governing Gaza without coming up with the alternative must be very worrying for the Americans because it doesn't really resolve solve the problem the Israelis are under the illusion that what is problematic in uh in Gaza is that the people don't love the Israelis and they're taught to hate the Israelis which is totally you know uh unrealistic they they don't admit to the uh fault of the occupation what that does to the young people coming up uh and as as such they they continue to convince themselves that uh somehow if they're able to win the hearts and minds of the Palestinians at a later stage by creating these safe zones right by moving them from one area to the other by allowing humanitarian assistance that they can secure the the area and I think that is something that is unacceptable okay I'll just have to jump in there because we're coming to the end of the program thank you so much little Tom
