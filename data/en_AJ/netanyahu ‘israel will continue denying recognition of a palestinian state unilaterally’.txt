to West Jerusalem where Israel's prime minister is speaking fighting them and to and to restore peace in the south in the north and all over the country such a victory citizens of Israel and this bravery I would like to talk about such a heroism this evening one of them looked me in the eyes and he said Mr prime minister we must we must continue Until the End these are the same words and with these words I've heard it from all the families of the victims people with amputated legs without exception all of them said we must continue until the end until we eliminate Hamas we will requal F and we will continue to fight our enemies in defending our country citizens of Israel as you know we have an excellent generation and we have a debt and with such an effort we will continue our fighting until we achieve all the war objectives this week in um an amazing uh Special Forces operation we have brought back two captives to their families and I have met with these Warriors there were other Heroes as well I was in the command post it was it was the decisive moment a moment where it was teetering between failure and success and within seconds I've heard someone say say that we got the captives and everyone was happy to receive such news the risk was high I have ordered such operation because I believe in our Warriors I believe in their bravery and professionalism when I met with them I hugged them I embraced them I told them you are the best fighters in the world the people of Israel are proud of you our policy to liberate and bring back the captives is military pressure and until now this what we have done and we have brought back 120 of them we shall continue until we bring back all the captives negotiations require steadfastness and I have to say to the people of Israel up to this moment Hamas demands are ridiculous and silly and they mean only one thing they mean that they mean defeat to Israel once Hamas compromises and give concessions on such demands we can make progress and I would like to say to the families of the captives we shall not forget our commitment to bringing back the captives and I would like to say one word for those people who have been evacuated from the south the government of Israel is committing is committed to bringing you back to your homes we will achieve this either politically or militarily we have only one message to our enemies near and far and the path for gaining our rights we are paying high price with the heroes who have fallen in the B the field battle the people of Israel need you this is not a moto we must be able to fight our enemy and to protect the state of Israel I say and to Albert and to you citizens of Israel we will not stop until we eliminate our enemy those people who who gave the ultimate sacrifice as continue their operations over the past uh days uh we have been able to reach to sites and locations of Hamas we will not stop until we eliminate the entire organization of Hamas until we achieve decisive Victory we must eliminate the chiefs of Hamas who are running from one place to another we will close our decisive Victory with them this is only a matter of time I spoke with President Biden every day we communicate with the heads of states around the world and we continue to stress the fact that we shall continue fighting until theis of History this will include also the Rafa operation only after we enable the residents to be removed for to Safe areas I will not the political process we are leading the political process this enables us to grant us freedom of movement five months this has never happened in the history of Israeli Wars and I would like to say this is not a done deal we are achieving such accomplishments with your strength you the people of Israel we will not compromise under any pressure because we are people of Heroes we will shall not compromise because we we love life we are committed to eliminating evil and we shall not step down to International dictates with regards to Future deal with the Palestinian I would like to reiterate and emphasize this this evening such a compromise should be through direct unconditional negotiations Israel will continue denying the recognition of a Palestinian State unilaterally how can we give recognition to such a state after the massacre of October the 7th this would be a reward to terrorism citizens of Israel we are on the path towards history our Fighters demand this the families of The Lost Ones demand this the entire people of Israel are demanding this until we achieve victory we must we must be United not a temporary or interim Unity but a real Unity when I met with the hero Fighters those injured in in hospitals I saw such aity amongst them and I understood such high morale that is very hard to describe I have met such Heroes I spoke to battle and how did you meet with the Prime Minister yes he stood on his legs and he shouted he said who are you you are talking about the Vision you are you are causing Division I embrace him and I embrace and salute Our Heroes and I would like to say to all of you don't heed those who call for division Unity should embrace all the people of Israel and majority of people they want Unity for victory such Unity such a Unity is in the tank in the fight in Rafa and and across all areas of the nation we shall fight and together we shall Prevail questions
