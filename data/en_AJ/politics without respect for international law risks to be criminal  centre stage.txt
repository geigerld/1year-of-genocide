I keep on saying it's true that international law without politics is ineffective but politics without respect of international law risk to be criminal and this is the reality we face today our guest today on Center Stage is Franchesca Alban the United Nations special reporter in the occupied Palestinian territories she's an international lawyer with a focus on human rights migration and the displacement of refugees Alban has been vocal and critical of Israel and its Partners her assessments are blunt and when describing Israel's actions in war she does not hold back franccesca Alan special reporter to the UN on the situation of human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories welcome to center stage thank you from a human rights perspective and from your position how is this war in Gaza any different from the previous Wars it is different in the sense that it looks uh more severe more cruel this is the sixth war that the people in Gaza experien since 2008 and uh it has been different since the very beginning because it's different the context because it it was triggered by an attack and an attack that inflicted serious pain uh upon Israel and Israelis I mean it has affected thousands directly or indirectly but the reaction Israel's reaction is absolutely unprecedented in the sense this is not the first time that Israel invokes the right of self-defense but it's like if this time it had um lost all s all sense of limits all sense of restraint and so the pr basic principles of humanitarian law like the principle of Distinction proportionality precaution in military action they've all been forfeited ever since I started reporting on the wars on Gaza uh we always say this is a disproportionate uh retaliation from Israel to whatever attack it is uh coming from uh from Gaza proportionality is something that usually is mentioned in international humanitarian law in any war and uh in this case how would it be proportional no but it's not it's not first of all uh we shouldn't forget Gaza was already under an unlawful blockade which is a collective punishment so in in a in a way um I I've challenged since the very beginning the logic that it was uh an unprovoked attack which doesn't mean that what Hamas and other military groups Palestinian armed groups did uh uh was was all lawful it was not because it killed the moment you kill or Target civilians then you you violate international law but um there was no justification to unleash a war against the entire population and also the logic the vocabulary the language that has been used has escalated the dehumanization of the Palestinians in the sense the concept of Palestinians as human Shields is not new but it's it's been used on steroids as of the 7th of October so all Palestinians are respon in Gaza are responsible uh the language that has been used uh has been extremely offensive and derogatory and it has resulted in a military in a series of military operations that are totally disproportionate I mean Gaza after four months is destroyed when you took your role in 2022 uh you immediately lifted the the bar High in your first report as special reporter when you recommended that UN member states should develop and I quote a plan to end the Israeli settler Colonial occupation and upper tide regime I guess you didn't make a lot of friends with that report uh I'm not sure because in fact it's a report that uh attracted a lot of attention what I did was to bring the discussion back on the critical right that cannot be realized until Israel maintain a system of Oppression through apartheid or an illegal occupation which is the right to self-determination the right to be free as to exist as a people but I think that it it was important to to to to rock the boat and to also remind member states who have used the issue of the two State solution discourse as an empty Mantra hey guys there is some content here and you cannot miss it why do they keep missing it I think there is a and now it's exposed I'm not saying anything that is really um uh unknown there's a lot of hypocrisy in International Community this what's going on now it's the uh the the the epitome of double standards it's UNC questionable the silence I would say Western countries but not only Arab countries are not necessarily better I mean apart from a few Exceptions there is a um a disconnect between decision makers and reality and reality both reality on the ground because there is a genocide unfolding either even the icj has recognized the plausibility of genocide in a very short time which is which is very significant and no action taken but it is also a disconnect between um civil society and and common Ordinary People globally who are taking the street in solidarity with Palestinians wherever you turn your gaze you see people expressing solidarity with the Palestinian PE with the Palestinians and uh and asking for aisf fire and genocide and the political and the political landscape is paralyzed M speaking of the icj ruling when they decided to take on the case um a lot of people especially the people under uh under attacks in Gaza they were hoping and waiting for a call for ceasefire from a legal and international humanitarian law perspective how do you look at this decision of not calling for a ceasefire I understand the people's deception because ceasefire is the only thing can that can stop the slaughtering of people the Carnage on a daily basis that are actually after the icj interim decision there was even a a and an increasing of violence which is which is shocking but it it shows the Defiance of Israel for international law at the same time if we read the the icj's interim I mean the provisional measures what they talk about is a s fire because there is no way to comply with these with these measures other than stopping the the indiscriminate bombing and the destruction of Civilian infrastructure the killing of Civilian so the only way to fully comply with the order is uh um by declaring and respecting as his fire what I would have expected was that the icj I mean the in a way the icj provided the offered the ground for the International Community to change patterns to change approach toward Israel what we saw was the opposite and and uh yeah it's been um we even Soo big Powers who are who are like the main pillars of the International Community when you hold a a a member uh seat at the U uh un Security Council you should be upholding International humanitarian law and international laws and then you see those same Powers um diminishing uh icj and doubting it your job you keep repeating that your role is to keep reporting on human rights and making sure that it's being applied um how how does this make your job easier or harder in my position the the biggest challenge is that I cannot visit the occupied Palestinian territory because of Israel's uh lack of lack of cooperation with the Mandate um at the same time you you I face like many the an in transigence uh in the inter I mean especially among Western countries um of will of abide by international law which I don't know if they realize the depth and the gravity of of each day that goes by without any hope for the Palestinians without any respect for international law because this erodes the basis for for the validity of the international um international law based system I mean I keep on saying it's true that international law um without politics is ineffective but politics without respect of international law is to be criminal and this is the reality we face today no matter how many uh arguments based on facts based on laws you present that you you are criticized highly criticized by uh Israel by everyone supporting it um why why do you think that I mean I I and this is the thing people ask me how do you cope with the attacks I don't even pay attention anymore because the reality on the ground is so serious is so monstrous it's so compelling that the only thing I care for is that there is an an end to this and an end that is not more catastrophic than the present for the Palestinians because they have endured too much and of course I have a lot of compassion for the Israelis as well but it I mean we should we should always be clear that the situation there is no symmetry between the Israelis and the Palestinians and the one without rights between the River and the Sea are the Palestinians so um the criticism I face is from those who are biased those who do not want to see or do not want to acknowledge and do not want to address this asymmetry in power and the fact that there are an entire people which is subjugated and has been subjugated for decades but I still feel more the love and the support of the so many around the world who who recognize this mandate and they they see it as a sort of a ligh house in terms of I mean not to lose hope in the International System it's so humbling um your main concern now is for this to stop now there are talks about uh a ceasefire that might uh happen in the few weeks maybe is it coming a bit too late is it going to be enough well it's not going to be enough but it's uh it's uh it's necessary it's necessary but not sufficient and it's necessary because until the military operations uh stop we won't see the end of The Killing Mass killing in in Gaza but also Imagine people who have been for four months under a rain of bombs not apart from the few days of ceire in November the population in Gaza has heard and and seen the the the destruction really R pouring from the the sky so the the level of trauma I think it's beyond beyond repair we need to face this so I'm also very concerned with the with the day after I'm concerned that the day after will not allow if not handled proper properly my result in force displacement of the Palestinians you worked a lot on Force displacement and especially Palestinian refugees what how do you see all these calls even um what itar the national sec security minister of Israel said we should give them incentives to leave Gaza how do you see it from Human Rights perspective it's ethnic cleansing it's ethic cleansing but this is not new I mean this is what Israel has uh has signified this is what Israel has done to the Palestinians since the very beginning I mean since even before existing as a state because the first refugees were displaced uh and never allowed to return as of December 194 7 so I've said from the very beginning this war Isis to be the the the largest distance of force displacement in Palestinians history and frankly if you need if you look at the displacement inside Gaza has already been because there are 1.4 million people yeah almost 1.4 million people who have been displaced from the north into the South and there are almost 2 million people who who are displaced in the sense they do not have a shelter they do not have repair anymore they are uh either in tents or in anra premises um and this is unacceptable so I've denounced that the risk I've warn against the risk of ethnic cleansing because under the fog of War this is what Israel does 4749 1967 and this is again another instance but also ethnic cleansing has been the the the late motive of Palestinians life under Israeli occupation since the I mean even without Wars because hundreds of thousands have been displaced over time you just spoke of hona you throughout your career you worked at the Ona and now there's this decision from major States contributing uh States uh to defund Ona based on accusations for only 12 employees of allegedly uh being part of the 7th of October the more we hear about it the more we understand that the some of these allegations are just like some of the uh employees just said we're happy we broke the prison or something similar to this um is it fair no I'm reading what comes out from the press and the fact that probably I mean the allegations might not be supported by evidence I mean this is something that was circulated yesterday in the media and seem to be confirmed because no one has seen the evidence that Israel claims to have but let's assume that anra staff participated in the seventh talk October uh attacks very serious very serious um there should have been an investigation and if proven true these people should have been terminated and then brought to Justice if they still if they're still alive because again we don't this is not what has happened anra has terminated them in the interest of the agency violating the the right of due process right it did it because of the criticism against the agency but the fact that member states have suspended funding to the agency is absolutely immoral and in my view also illegal it makes no sense from a logical point of view because why would you would you suspend the why would you punish the agency at such a critical moment and the agency as a whole affecting the entire Palestinian refugee population in the region at such a critical time especially for those in Gaza it makes no sense because why again and why now after an icj ruling which says that human humanitarian Aid is to be assured and is to be increased at the time where genocide is probably being committed there is a risk of of complicity of this country who have an obligation not to Aid and abet uh the legal the legal actions of Israel so it's I mean I I wonder when I saw the the the the information and the number of states uh um going up but say have they lost their mind we will see in the coming days what happens uh we spoke a little bit about the smear campaigns against you but on the other hand uh you are uh like the new hero uh of the new generation of the Gen z uh there are memes of you uh you are portrayed as the superhero of human rights do you see that there's a generational shift uh not only towards Palestine but towards upholding human rights in general yes yes but I am so amazed at the youth because I I really have well my hope for the future comes from the young people because you could see I mean and I started realizing it with Greta tomberg when this the the the mobilization that she she triggered it's something that sort of skipped my generation in many respects but was so easy among people of her age and of course I I mean it it touches me um the idea of being inspirational to young people makes me really really happy also because they need to believe in Justice they need to believe in human rights because human rights are like an armor but this is something that people fought and died for this is not a concession of States these are the this is the gain of of people who F fought against slavery who fought for Farmers right for Women rights minority rights indigenous people rights so this is something that we need to keep alive um and and the future belongs to them to young people the other thing is being able to I mean human rights are for the people not to be discussed in universities or big conferences so and if they do not mean make sense for the people they don't make sense at all so this unfolding genocide side caused a lot of deception for everyone who believes in human rights or the majority of people who believe in human rights who work in international humanitarian law um it it sounds really shocking that this is happening again even though we pledged for years that it's never going to happen again so what does IHL now need to actually be able to stop a gen side uh when it's happening or before it even happens no I mean it's it's clear that uh the member states with a few exceptions South Africa with a few exceptions have proven unable or unwilling to honor the genocide convention in in convention in that part that obliges states to prevent genocide we couldn't prevent the genocide in uh in Rwanda we couldn't prevent the genocide in Bosnia heroina and we couldn't prevent other atrocity crimes that have taken place and are taking place right now how we speak in Congo in Sudan there are so many crisis that are forgotten and this is why I think this this genocide is is mobilizing people globally for a number of reasons because because of the double standards and I think that people have enough both in the global South and in the global north of these double standards perpetrated by Western countries the second is that Palestine epitomize this uh this struggle for justice and this resistance to settler colonialism colonialism has transformed but settler colonialism has most most of the cases won over the native uh the indigenous people in Palestine not yet and and I do believe that there is a way for Israelis Israeli Jews and Palestinians to to live together in that land but it cannot happen without equality freedom and dignity Dignity of all and this is the struggle now uh people I mean my fear right now is that uh the powerful states might be pushing in the face of a genocide might be pushing for a return to the status quo which is gone it's broken forever it's gone and at the same time they they seem to be pushing for a return to the status quo so yes let's discuss about the two-state solution when it's very difficult to to make it materialize while what the Palestinians need because they are claiming Unity of the people in the land Unity of the land so it's dismantling the aparte this is the only way forward thank you very much Francesca alanza thank [Applause] [Music] you
