well I guess it's uh it's it's it's a first step and hopefully in the right I mean that after successive successive humanitarian poses and successive releases of Hostage hostages that would uh hopefully and ultimately pave the way for a ceasefire and I I guess that the latest diplomatic moves in the Middle East the visit by Mr Ambassador William Burns the director of the CIA uh touring some Arab capitals and then going to DHA to meet uh with uh the director of The Mad Israel's mad with the katari uh prime minister and foreign minister and then from there uh the uh Amir tamim flies to Egypt has flown to Egypt today to meet with the Egyptian president president I guess there is something cooking something cooking uh on two levels the first level I I I think is of course uh the release of some hostages against humanitarian forces uh negotiated by the Biden Administration the other level is in in the medium term that this poses could lead to a ceasefire that's and and that's why and and and that's why uh yesterday the three top uh leaders in Hamas were in CaRu and and and they met with the director of the intelligence service and I I guess my my I have a hunch that things are moving slowly in the right direction well can I challenge you on that analysis a little bit because intuitively I understand it makes complete sense and it's also what Hashem was telling us a moment ago that you start small right you start on a small window of cessation of fighting and the and and Biden is presenting it as a step in the right direction as you said the idea is you start small and you go towards a bigger pause in the fighting but is that is that actually the case I mean there's no evidence that that would be the case the Israelis if and when they formally agree to this pause in the fighting it will entirely on their terms won't it well I I doubt it very much because it seems to me uh going over the latest statements coming out of the white house uh and the statement by uh the United States Secretary of State Mr Anthony blinkin in Tokyo the day before yesterday uh after the meetings of the foreign minister G7 I guess this gives us an inkling of what the Biden Administration is is up to of course the American Administration does not want to uh get involved in in a head done confrontation with uh the Israeli Prime Minister bamin Nat and this for two main reasons first of all and the first reason is related to uh domestic American politics we all know the relations between Mr Netanyahu and the Republican party and the and the other reason is they don't they don't want they don't want Mr Netanyahu to appear in front of the Israeli public opinion as if he standing against the American Administration uh having said that having said that I guess the American approach now is to soften the positions by Mr Netanyahu personally personally and in order in the uh in the next few weeks they get what they are are aiming at successive poses on for humanitarian reasons and then ultimately cease fire having said that having said that U some some American uh military military are questioning the long-term Israeli strategy and the g yeah and we have seen we have seen a statement by the new uh Chief of Staff of of the uh of the United States when he said that we are afraid he's speaking about talking about the United States we are afraid that the longer this War uh uh lasts the more uh hsh and the more violent the Palestinians would become so I guess I guess yeah there is we I have I have detected I have detected some differences in approach in the American approach and the isra approach to how to manage this conflict right now and and what and and what will be the the ending politically speaking and strategically speaking if we go yes the day before yesterday okay just because I just because I'm pressed for time and we have so much to cover in this news before yesterday Mr set out set set out set out the red lines that the American Administration uh have laid uh down for everyone to hear and for instance when he spoke about Gaza he said no reconquest no Siege no forc displacement displacement of the Palestinian in Gaza all right whether now or tomorrow or again and again and then he spoke about the Palestinian Authority ex exercising exercising civilian control over the West Bank and the Gaza state so I I think that the American Administration is moving now into the broader picture and in order to carry out this I'm going to have to jump in and move on unfortunately okay I I really thank you for your time and your analysis I will note that as you as you speak and as you bring up you know the question of what is the strategy long term of course we're always looking at the live picture and it's so jarring to hear of what happens long term I'm not saying that it's uh that it's um not relevant it absolutely is but it is so jarring to hear of that when you're seeing what's happening in the immediate term and there are entire stretches of Gaza that have been reduced to Rubble as we this as we see the smoke billowing over the guys the Skies of Gaza alive um but we appreciate the context it's necessary and we'll continue to come back to that thank you very much Mr Hussein herid military analyst former field artillery officer thank you very much
