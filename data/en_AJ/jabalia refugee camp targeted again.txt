let's get more from the ground in Gaza Han Mahmud is in kanun in the southern part of the strip Han so we've just got this new number that 700 Palestinians have been killed in the last 24 hours it's one of the highest daily death tolls we've seen since October the 7th what more are you learning yes indeed that number has been confirmed by the Ministry of Health here in the Gaza Strip 700 people have been killed and we're looking into an increase of this number in the coming hours as there are still more people under the rubbles it's only normal for this number to go up rapidly because we're talking about entire residential blocks are being targeted carpet bombs completely destroyed everything in then people are targeted without a warning the thing is so far has been and areas that has been designated as red unsafe and dangerous people are in several blocks they they receive calls they receive Leist to evacuate but then you see another block being targeted before getting the warning and getting the calls from the Israeli military which is a trick that the Israeli military is implementing right now what people are doing so far they are moving from one block to another but at the same time of their movement they get targeted before getting to the safe area we are expecting the number to increase in the coming hours as I said before there are so many people under the rebels as of now we're talking about entire blocks with more with more than 20 and 30 residential homes in every block being targeted massively with barrage of air strikes and artillery and heavy artillery is Shilling and so far we're looking at people are are pushed into areas similar to more of like a concentration Zone we're talking about 1.7 million people are asked to move further south but at the same time while are they trying to evacuate to move there they're getting bombed that's the the the tragedy of the situations right now roads are getting bombed destroyed there's nowhere people for people to go there's no safe route for people to take it's a risk 100% risk for everyone living in Gaza right now honey I want to be clear you're telling us that uh residents in the southern part of the Gaza Strip are not being given enough time that's what you're just telling us um to to leave the areas you know what hold on I'm going to interrupt this this line of thinking because we're just getting hany the very latest pictures that have come in this is from jabalia refugee camp in the north which is the largest refugee camp in the Gaza Strip and this is the aftermath of uh a recent Israeli bombardment have you at this point and it may be too soon for for you to have accurate information on this do you have information on what has just happened at jabala refugee camp yes as the moment of preparing this report we learn from a source on the ground more residential buildings blocks and neighborhoods in jabalia jabalia refugee camp have been targeted we're looking at several homes at once being targeted leaving tens of people killed and again there are more people stranded under the rubbles the fact that the number is increasing is because these are very densely populated area there's also difficulty on the ground for the the civil defense crew uh to uh uh to rescue people in addition the civil defense crew are being targeted which hindered their effort of of helping and rescuing Survivor it impedes their work and imped it by hours it so it takes time for those Rescue Team to get to the site and start helping those who might have survived the the bombings you hany we're seeing pictures uh of massive clouds of smoke that are just engulfing an entire neighborhood of uh the jabala refugee camp as we watch this and we try to take this in and what has just just happened can you tell us a little bit more about the camp and okay hold on honey we can now listen to our correspondent inj we're listening to what he's saying this is yet another Massacre perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces a an entire residential block was leveled to the ground it was leveled to the ground while many were inside as you can see the magnitude of Destruction the scale of Destruction is beyond description oh my God the scale of Destruction is description one person here this is yet another Massacre committed by the Israeli occupation forces against innocent civilians this is a totally residential area the residential block was surounded by missiles without any warning residents and neighbors are using their bare hands to dig this concrete trouble here is another person uncle we can hear voices from under the debris residents and neighbors are trying to dig out and rescue civilians from under the rubble God here is a baby Torn to Pieces very painful scenes and entire the whole baby is Torn to Pieces large number of persons killed others missing hundreds under these rubbles the extent of damage is massive where is where is my father where is your brother children are looking for their family their [Music] killed he's still breathing give him a hand he is still breathing another victim being pulled debris here is another baby with his limbs severed most of the victims are children in this building what crime have these children committed what sin have they made look at us the whole world is sitting and watching oh my God all my children were killed they have gone as you can see the extent of damage is massive not only the residential block but also the surrounding and neighboring buildings were leled oh God have mercy on us okay I'll bring back in hany Mahmud aler is hany Mahmud Hy you're in Kan yunas in the southern part of the Gaza Strip we're still watching these pictures the latest pictures that have come into us from the jabalia refugee camp gaza's largest that is in the north of the strip um honey I'm not sure you can see what I what we've just all seen and witnessed so I I I'll just let you know what it is that was on our screen and a word to our viewers we do understand that some people will find this distressing uh a lot of it is this is the reality of what is happening inside the Gaza Strip at the moment so honey we saw bodies in the rubble we saw an entire neighborhood or several neighborhoods utterly devastated and destroyed uh the smoke still rising from the rubble we saw uh people who appear critically injured who were being carried on stretchers or even mattresses we saw babies um that appeared lifeless we saw a child who couldn't have been older than 10 or 11 years old crying saying that his father and brother had been killed in the bombardment those are the scenes that are coming out to us from uh jabala refugee camp at the moment I'm just wondering honey is there anything more you can tell us about the area that was struck well all what we know that jabalia refugee camp is a a densely populated area and any any air strike no matter how small it is will cause a great deal of damage to the area and Destroy much of its infrastructure and residential buildings and but more importantly and which is tragic the death of many many people uh now I can relate to what happened to just what you were looking at to what happened at the Eastern side of kanun earlier this morning where a group of residential home in a very populated area here were targeted homes been destroyed a great deal of damage and people bodies were thrown as the the the air strike were very intense were thrown at in the road away from their homes given the the the the air strike were intense in terms of scale in terms of magnitude but it's the it's the same kind of of a strategy it's this a a massive brutal air strike that not only kill people but causes a great deal of damage to the point that makes the area is unlivable make it unlivable and force people to leave it I call this a displac force displacement of entire population from where they live for the whole of their life and gradually pushing them to a small area designated as a safe area at the corner of the southern part between ra City and the Egyptian borders this is what's going on right now it's similar to what you were just looking at people are given a a a a map in the northern part to move to turning the entire area into smaller blocks but again the whole the whole area is under heavy bombardment I was just saying people get the call to evacuate an area and then they move to another area that gets bombed right away throughout like in in their joury journey to move to another area they get bombed on the road or if they make a stop to a nearby house or to a friend house or a family member house they get bombed there that's the how unsafe the situation H Mahmud reporting from hunis inside the Gaza Strip thank you very much for that as we've been watching these harrowing pictures coming out of gaza's largest refugee camp in the north of the strip
