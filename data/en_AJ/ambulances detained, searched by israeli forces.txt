but with no end to the conflict in sight we've seen near daily strikes in or near Gaza Hospital compounds by Israel the Geneva conventions are a series of international treaties governing conduct during armed conflict and we want to run you through what they say the main message is very clear that hospitals and medical personnel are off limits during war deliberate attacks on hospitals are considered a war crime that includes strikes on Health Care Facilities that aren't military targets the conventions State medical staff and transportation such as ambulances must be protected they also say medical personnel should be considered neutral players to be left alone to preserve and Safeguard lives a violation of these humanitarian principles have consequences including legal prosecution cordula droga is the chief legal officer at the international Committee of the Red Cross and you're joining us from Geneva thank you for your time today you know a lot of our viewers they're watching the news and they're wondering what's legal what's not legal now a little disclaimer here I know you don't want to address one specific event and be the judge of it on air for us and we understand that um with that caveat out there what is the general guideline because we are seeing strikes on hospitals ambulances all the things that we just said that in the con in the Geneva con according to the Geneva Convention are not allowed even in times of War yes the general rule is that hospital hospitals Medical Care the medical functions medical personnel ambulances must not only be respected but they must also be protected and this is because they have a life-saving function always but in War of course in particular so the rule the general rule is that they can't be attacked sorry goad the exception is if they are misused um and used by uh the opposite side to commit acts harmful to the enemy so for instance As Weapons Depot as um to hide able-bodied fighters to launch attacks then they can lose their protection against attack okay that doesn't mean then that doesn't mean though that there's then a free license to attack because any attack in in armed conflict always has to still respect the principles of distinction between combatants and civilians and between civilian objects and Fighters and the principles of proportionality and precaution and what that means is that any attack on a part of a hospital um still needs to take into account that the patients in the hospital the medical personnel the medical equipment the medical supplies all of this remains protected and also don't forget that hospitals often are not just one place they consist of many separate places and so again there you have to really just um look at what is actually being used very specifically to um to uh as an act to be harmful to the enemy so we have heard during this conflict Israel say that this or that medical Target whether it's a hospital whether it's an ambulance has lost its protection under international law because it was either used to um to shelter Fighters or or because weapons because Israel believed that there was weapons in one of those uh places how in the in the moment how does one you know how do our viewers make the determination whether it is therefore legal or not legal to strike that ambulance or that hospital whether it's legal or not legal to strike really depends on the facts on the ground and whether in actual fact the party has really verified that a part of of a military installation is used for ACT sample to the enemy but as I said don't forget in the hospital in the ambulance there are patients in the case of Gaza there are of course also people who have sought Refuge so civilians will be present patients will be present medical personnel will be present and that needs to be taken into account as well in determining the lawfulness of you so I suppose that when we come to this issue of proportionality right if it's a strike on a Target that has civilians or maybe even patients and Medical Teams you're saying even in the event that the party that conducts that strike were able to prove that the target had um had been used for military purpose there needs to be proportionality in the strike am I getting this right absolutely and even before we're talking about attacks on hospitals I think what we also need to look at in Wartime is that hospitals need to be need to continue functioning in their medical function and this requires that they have the you know the medical supplies the equipment the water the food for the patients necessary for their functioning and therefore also it is an obligation of the of all parties in a conflict to allow and facilitate humanitarian relief to reach hospitals uh medical equipment and also medical personnel to be able to reach the areas where the patients are in order to treat them and if that isn't done then the hospitals will cease to function uh and will not be able to treat the patients even though that is this up most basic tenant of international humanitarian law is that patients the wounded and sick need to be cared for okay thank you so much for laying all of that out because it's a question we've been asking over and over again really since the beginning of this conflict but we keep trying to finesse it and update it because as people watch the news that's one of the big questions that they have cordula droga Chief legal officer at the international Committee of the Red Cross thank you thank you
