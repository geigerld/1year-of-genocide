we're going to have to uh cut you off there because Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is speaking now let's listen I have spoke with a lot of families who lost their members or have members who are missing will never forget what have been done all those terrorist acts and we will not [Music] forgive and will not anyone forget this we are listening to the prime minister of Israel who is delivering a speech in Tel Aviv and that is talking about what Israel is currently doing we support our country and we will eliminate Hamas and we will make Victory it will take time but we will finish and end this war stronger than ever God will Revenge from all our enemies those who attacked thank okay that was uh Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli Prime Minister speaking very briefly there we're going to go back to uh Maan Bashar Al jazer senior political analyst and from what we could hear from Netanyahu there he uh he didn't say anything uh that we hadn't heard before Maan certainly nothing about uh this evacuation order for Northern Gaza no absolutely not in fact I I caught up his words in Hebrew before the the translator came on and uh he's basically trying to emphasize that Israel is United and it will never forget what happened to it the last weekend were his opening words in Hebrew and I think he's trying to uh Channel um the sort of you know Voice of Unity and steadfastness of the Israeli uh public and the Israeli military as it embarks on what seems to be you know some very tough long War painful War as the way he put it uh in in early times and I think it's clear that uh he's presenting himself as a wartime leader now and it's also of course he's having this unconditional backing from the West so I think and I can imagine as the Sabbath uh takes hold in Israel uh I think there's going to be a lot of reflection about the day after the Sabbath and how the Israelis are then are going to be tackling the uh the war in Gaza which as everyone seems to understand is going going to lead to tens of thousands perhaps hundreds of thousands of casualties yeah just on the evacuation order that Israel gave almost 24 hours ago if you ask a million people to move and they don't what happens after that well that's the thing I think he I think defense minister Galant was asked that during the press conference in fact at the end of press conference and uh I think he seemed to uh uh he seems to U avoid the the question he kind of just shaked his head and I think we've heard from the white house uh that uh this is going to be impossible that you cannot just give people 24 hours and expect a million people to just take off uh under some sort of an order of a of an enemy country right um so I think it's clear now to everyone including those in the United States and at the United Nations that this is not doable and hence when he was asked whether uh he's going to have to postpone it or whether there's another deadline again he tried to uh avoid an answer because I think Israel does not have an answer now to the ultimatum that they've given about 24 hours uh this is certainly not workable and clearly there's complications to its implementation even if it's giving 72 hours and more because the people in Gaza including Hamas of course you know have a different opinion about this it's not just because Israel have an order that means that Palestinians who are you know enemy of Israel are just going to now follow through on it of course a lot of families uh with a lot of children uh will probably try to look for safety and that's natural uh you would expect them to especially now that they will be you know looking for uh some sort of a shelter uh in the southern part of uh Gaza but I think many as it seems we've seen from some of the demonstrations now in Gaza that many decided just to stay put uh that will probably complicate everything furthermore but I think it's normal also for people who have faced a trauma in their past about uh you know refuge and displacement and and redisplacement that they feel that as if their Destiny now is is in their hands and in their very near future and I think they don't feel anywhere in Gaza is safe and as we've heard also from the various uh of your guests as well that a lot of people just cannot uh take off and leave yeah a lot of people are sick and elderly children you know and who don't have even means of transportations and what do you do with a family of seven once you just you know take off and go somewhere South where are you going to sleep how are they going to eat how are they going to survive yeah I I just want to go back to um the US Secretary of State Anthony blinken's uh little tour I mean he was in Doha today he's also heading to Saudi Arabia uh among other countries I mean is this a box ticking exercise uh from the US do you think in some ways it is because clearly I think this is a very important question in some ways it is uh they want to show that America you know has the ears of all the sides and maybe even the some sort of a consent of sort even if it's implicit uh and and certainly they're going to need all the help they can get uh from their Arab part as it were uh when things get uh you know uh much worse in Gaza so I think opening Channels with Arab capitals is necessary but I think it's also more important that they're trying to get as many people as possible as many leaders as possible on their side but as we said before the statement from the Arab League is already clear while the Arab League is not taking you know a a tough position they're not condemning Israel in fact the Arab League statement uh basically equated between Hamas and Israel which is was unheard of before this weekend in the sense that the Arab League has always taken the position that whatever the Palestinians do do Under the uh you know under the headline of uh of resisting occupation and that there is no uh equivalency between the occupi and the occupied but this time around the Arab League statement seems to equate between the two so already the Arab leaders are uh kind of you know giving in although four countries in particularly Libya uh sorry Algeria Iraq Syria and another country now I can't remember anyway they definitely registered their uh objections to the tone of the statement so all in all the Arab capitals are trying now to to convince the United States to uh you know hold back Israel from causing a major Tragedy by a land invasion of Gaza okay thanks so much Marin we really do as always appreciate you breaking it all down for us that is uh Mar bashara our senior political analyst
