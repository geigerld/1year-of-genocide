hello a fragile ceasefire in gaza appears to be holding egypt mediated the deal between israel and the palestinian group islamic jihad the u.n and qatar were also involved in brokering that truce at least 44 palestinians mostly civilians were killed in the conflict which began on friday 15 of them were children the israeli government says it was targeting members of the group islamic jihad and it killed two of its leaders during the offensive the armed group responded by firing hundreds of rockets into israel most were intercepted by the iron dome missile defense system now the israeli strikes mostly hit three areas in gaza the jubalia refugee camp in the north where several people including children and an elderly woman were killed an agricultural area and khan yunus in the south and several sites in rafah along the border with egypt those strikes killed palestinian islamic jihad leader khalid mansour let's cross over to gaza and bring in yumna sayid so yumna we understand now that fuel trucks are entering gaza as the crossings have reopened somewhat yes doreen so uh we we learned from uh the israeli side that they're going to allow 30 fuel trucks to enter uh throughout the day to the soul power plant here behind me trucks have already started arriving to the power plant company to start generating uh the electricity again as it shut down yesterday sunday after uh fuel was uh deprived from entering for the past uh six days so now as we witness the fuel entering and the soul power plant regenerating again we can we can find uh like we can witness more electricity uh uh coming to uh other facilities and especially hospitals here in gaza as this was the main issue that the ministry of health was warning from and as you mentioned it's a very fragile calm that we are witnessing here people are now uh are now mourning more of the the their loved ones that they have lost in the past a few days in the israeli air strikes and many as uh of the injuries are in hospitals but as a development of that cease fire when the the crossings are opened also medical aid is entering and humanitarian aid food supply is also entering and the aries checkpoint has been opened in front of the people who want to uh come from israel into gaza uh mainly the workers uh diplomats u.n delegation who which has just arrived a very short while ago into gaza uh the u.n uh humanitarian coordinator for gaza is actually now for palestine is actually now investigating the aftermath of the israeli strikes in different areas of the gaza strip all right thank you so much reporting from gaza meanwhile in the occupied west bank israeli forces have demolished palestinian homes during a raid in the north bulldozers accompanied by israeli forces destroyed two houses in the village of ramanaian near janine one belonged to the family of a 20-year-old palestinian who was one of two men accused by israel of killing three israelis in may let's cross over to west jerusalem we'll get an update from there with john holman so the ceasefire assumed that was saying john appears to be holding in gaza tell us what you're hearing from your end yeah definitely in southern israel as well where roads were closed where the trains were stopped and where pretty much everyone was going down to their shelter that's opening up now as well as what we're hearing the israeli president has also gone down to visit those communities in the south and has told them that without them there's no state of israel so sort of encouraging them um in terms of the crossing and it opening up the crucial thing obviously as well is when workers will be allowed to go from gaza into the state of israel there's 14 000 people with work permits to head into israel and obviously those incomes are crucial for their families for those families in in gaza where there's a lot of unemployment we've got in touch with the israeli prime minister's office uh with the military administration that deals with uh that sort of thing especially with relation to gaza and what we've got back is just them saying that they're going to evaluate uh and that um that will that will depend on things remaining calm that things will open up further if the situation remains quiet and calm i guess obviously they mean by that if no more rockets come across the other thing that israeli officials have begun to say to israeli journalists which is how news often percolates out here is that they're seeing uh what happened here is uh that they're getting a signal that they've been getting signals uh for weeks but not from islamic jihad with whom they've obviously had this escalation but from hamas hamas is really the power that controls gaza and hamas actually didn't get involved directly in this confrontation between islamic jihad and the israeli government the israeli government said that it has been saying to reporters israeli reporters that uh part of what it might be looking at is how to move this forward and that could involve prisoner swaps for example so they're looking at how to move this forward but not necessarily with islamic jihad with whom this fragile ceasefire is so far holding
