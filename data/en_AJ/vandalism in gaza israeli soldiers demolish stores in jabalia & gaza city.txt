now Israeli Army officials say they will investigate videos published on social media showing their soldiers vandalizing shops owned by Palestinians in Gaza City and jabalia they describe the behavior as inappropriate and contrary to The Valleys of the Israeli Army let's get more on this with h Abdul Hamid who is in rala tell us a bit more about this vandalism well according to the uh Israeli human rights NGO bat salm uh that issued a report a month before October 7th uh vandalism and looting is systematic uh when it comes to the occupied West Bank and they went the report goes on really depicting and and collecting testimonies uh from many Palestinians across the occupied West Bank who say that when the soldiers show up in their houses uh for raids or to detain someone they also ransack the whole houses empty the cupboards go through everything throw Basic Foods on the floor and many also said that they had money and jewelries stolen during some of those raid so it is not something new it might have been now happening more uh because there is that atmosphere of Revenge on any Palestinian uh regardless of regardless of what they think or not think or about the attack on October 7th but certainly Palestinians have been saying it's a form of collective punishment the lack of respect to us or our properties and the stealing and the Looting it has been going on for many years but it seems that now it's actually increasing there's actually even one um a story of a f a soldiers who go into a house and there's a piggy bank of the child in that house well the soldiers steal even the money that was in that uh piggy bank now when it comes to Palestinians getting Justice for that or hoping that a thorough investigation will be made by the Israeli military into that many would tell you that they have no hope whatsoever because even more bigger incidents like the uh killing of children just a week ago in Janine Point Blank while they were posing no threat that goes uh unpunished so they don't think that the stealing and the Looting uh will stop or anything will change when it comes to them and many would tell you that Israel is just paying lip service saying the right thing but in fact it won't do anything about it and hod I believe the Palestinian Authority has organized a upcoming strike what more can you tell us about this well there is a general strike that has been called actually by all the political factions the unions uh the activists uh here in the occupied uh West Bank and it's in support of Gaza and this call is actually it's a general strike so if you look out if I look out the window now everything is absolutely shut whether it's in a uh public service or private businesses everything is shut down for the next uh 24 hours and um the there's also called for this to happen also elsewhere around the world in support of Gaza and also to reject the US veto when it comes to a humanitarian ceasefire and the call is really about putting pressure on the International Community put to to call for an for a humanitarian ceasefire and that to come as soon as possible and certainly to also put uh some pressure on the United States okay thank you for that H Abdul Hamid there for us in rala
