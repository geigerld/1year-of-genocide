demonstrations have been continuing at college campuses across the United States in New York police raided a building at Columbia University occupied by students protesting in solidarity with Palestinians in Los Angeles a mob attacked a Palestine solidarity City at the University of California US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in West Jerusalem Lincoln said a deal for a ceasefire in Gaza is achievable and reiterated us opposition to an Israeli ground offensive in Rafa an Israeli strike has killed at least two children in Rafa the military has been attacking residential areas across the strip more than 34 and a half thousand Palestinians have been killed in nearly 7 months of War let's here now from Mar bashara Al jaaz senior political analyst joins us from London hi marwin um blinkin will leave Israel shortly pressuring Hamas to agree to a truce but failing to dissuade Netanyahu of a Rafa incursion regardless of a truce it seems a stalemate well yes uh I'm not sure if it's a stalemate it's perhaps a diplomatic stalemate but it's clearly an ongoing Onslaught on Gaza and maybe that is the whole point of the Diplomatic stalemate is to allow for the genocide to continue uh to unravel in Gaza and people to die and to starve and to uh be preoccupied uh with their with with burying their loved ones perhaps that is the purpose of diplomacy but if it's not it's clearly has failed and this broken record declarations and statements on the part of American officials has proved to be you know utterly humiliating and and nonsensical so in the end of the day because you so I've heard you throughout the day the last this week too you've been trying to understand the patterns so why does this continue and clearly there is some method to The Madness of American diplomacy what I can dissect that it's over the past six months the American officials have tried to kill Netanyahu with kindness It's been killing with kindness strategy no matter what he does no matter how many people he kill no matter what he provokes and invokes in statement of amalik and genocide and no one innocent in Gaza no M no matter how many Mass gra we're going to dig the Americans continue to shower him with praise and talk about anti-Semitism hoping that this will rub off on him well guess what he is immune to kindness Neto does not respond well to this sort of a thing and he continues on his own Pathway to uh death and destruction in Gaza because that's what he thinks that's how he's ingrained in his very ideological personal and political career do you think that's the same though the same sort of message messaging Maran from the US to the rest of you might say the Israeli cabinet because um blink has been meeting everybody hasn't he from the left and from the right and everybody else in between I think it's for keeping up appearances I think with a 64 uh strong majority in addition to several others like guns and Eisen Cott and so on nety feels very comfortable with his parliamentary majority to survive whatever is being cooked up for him or not being cooked up for him so as long as he continues with uh with this pathway forward threatening to invade Raa refusing to accept any permanent ceasefire he's going to maintain his government uh Mar when we spoke about this yesterday and we touched on the fact that the US Administration is under great pressure at home to spreading with the spreading University protest I mean it's not helping the Democrats or the Republicans in the messaging about their sort of fully-fledged backing for Israel and the tax dollars that are being spent uh on there but it's not actually helping any of the European governments and if we just pivot towards Europe what's happening in America is now happening in in major cities across Europe and a lot of these countries are going to the polls in the next few weeks and the next few months well I tell you something so and I think it's for our viewers around the world I think we've we've been having some some of the probably the most Exquisite the most excellent coverage at Ultra Zer of what has been going on in Western universities and on the streets of Western capitals and in terms of what's happening in in the society not just in the high politics but also so-called low politics and our coverage just today in the last few days and weeks in American universities has just been you know certainly contrasted with other networks who failed miserably to really distinguish the right from wrong the truth from the deception but we still have not talked about Generation Z we don't we didn't have the wider conversation who are these people that are ready to lose their expensive uh University tuition IV League schools right for the sake of palestin for sake of justice for the sake of morality and ethics what is this generation because this generation has been separate from us whether in Europe in the United States or elsewhere they've been busy their Network they're online all the time we don't know if they're playing video games or they're just getting more better informed certainly Biden and Adams the May the mayor of New York certainly don't understand this generation they think this generation as cynical as they are well it's not this generation is not ideological it is moral and it does believe in social justice and it does believe in Racial equality and it does believe in human rights and and the need for people to live free of fear in Palestine so this generation is organizing and this generation is sacrificing and this generation is the culmination of all previous generations in second world war so this generation I think is teaching us all a lesson in their sacrifice in their ideals and principles and we are seeing them not stopping they're seeing them continuing persisting and we're seeing them spread because they are better Network mayor Adams thinks that they need agitators to come from I don't know where to New York or Chicago or Los Angeles to indoctrinate he doesn't even understand that they are so well networked that they don't need anyone to educate them because they're so well informed and they are so agitated themselves this generation Z is thought to be Z you know kind of a bit maybe weird or whatever but it's not it is deathful it is zealful it is it is Zen it's all these wonderful things and they have proven to be the so the case and they're turning to be perhaps the last hope for all of us in terms of the fight for justice yeah let's see if the politicians also see what they're made of uh in the coming days and weeks for the moment thanks very much for joining us M Bashar there our senior political analyst make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
