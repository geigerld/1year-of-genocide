vabo thank you so much for joining us on up front thank you for having me Mark uh we've seen a massive outpouring of support uh for Palestine in your home country of Pakistan uh since the beginning of Israel's Siege on Gaza uh protests in the tens of thousands have been held in cities all around the country with little sign of momentum slowing uh why do you think the people of Pakistan have been so outspoken in their support um Pakistan has historically always supported um Palestinian um struggle and of course the ending of apartheid in Palestine it's a a relationship that goes back really um to when both countries were made in a sense Pakistan is born in 1947 and and Israel is created in 1948 but Pakistan has always had a a communion with with the Palestinian people we see from the United States to the United Kingdom to most of Europe and Beyond to countries like Pakistan that their people are wholeheartedly in favor of a permanent ceasefire whereas the governments are not um we see people demanding certain action from their governments which their governments are just ignoring so I don't think we've ever seen a split so wide and I don't think that's unique to just Pakistan um of course the Pakistani people uh have been protesting like people all over the world and I think this Global movement will continue uh on December 7th Israel killed the renowned Palestinian writer academic and activist rat uh as well as six of his family members uh over the past three months Israel has killed more than 18,000 Gins wiping out entire families in fact wiping out entire Bloodlines uh and yet elad's killing specifically uh has elicited an outcry can you explain to us uh who he was and why his death is being felt so so powerfully um in the last two months Israel has killed 89 journalists I believe the number stands at um they've killed over a 100 un um relief Works agency staff um they have killed um Palestinian Medics and health workers in the hundreds um and they have also killed writers artists musicians children newborns all these deaths have been painful to watch but rat was a voice of the horror that was unfolding so many of us were following the air strikes the daily struggle to get food the power cuts the internet cuts through rat's uh tweets through his Instagram stories and his his will to survive his poetry he's talking about the impact of literature the experience of writing that is one of the greatest human experiences because it Bears testimony to survival not just suffering and I think as well many of us know that this is really not just a war about October 7th it's not just a war about Hamas because in that case why are premature children being killed in neonatal War WS why are doctors being killed why are journalists being killed but why is a poet um Asad was why is a poet and a translator and a Shakespeare scholar and a writer being targeted in his family home along with his siblings it's it it it defies logic it defies everything the the pain of his death uh for many observers is compounded by what his death signifies in terms of the loss of art the loss of culture uh the loss of literature uh of course as you mentioned scientists have died journalists have died artists have died uh major cultural sites have been destroyed churches mosques when people lose their art when people lose their literature people lose their culture what's at stake everything everything is at stake you're losing um it's a patrimony of culture its Heritage its survival it's it's records you know when we talk about genocide it's not just the ab absolute Slaughter of a population it also means removing them from records it means removing testimony it means removing art it means REM removing poetry removing music um it means erasing the lives of ordinary people and I think when we talk about the destruction that we're seeing in Gaza it is to reduce Gaza to nothing to take not just homes but also libraries uh not just hospitals but also univers I ities and let there be nothing let Gaza be not even a memory a place that once was and never will be again not even in the pages of books and I think that is really what is so horrifying about this violence you know we know states are threatened by cultural figures we know that writers are powerful because they they hold power to account they keep a record of violence of Terror of these kind of nightmares and and that's why they kill them that's why they've always killed them art literature writers as you just mentioned not only hold power to account they also create space for us to understand ideas in a different way I'm thinking about your work uh for example your novel The Runaways allows us to understand through the lens of three young men who uh become effectively radicalized in Iraq through that lens we're able to understand how complicated political violence is how complicated the journey into quote unquote radicalization um is uh there's no condoning of hamas's killing of civilians uh we're not justifying the ongoing treatment of hostages you once said something that that stuck with me you said even as I watched my characters do terrible things I mourn the fact that they didn't have other choices how does that idea uh speak to what's going on with regard to the plight of Palestinians at this moment well you know we're talking today Mark um partly to discuss rater's um life and and his work and a lot of us came to know him through an interview he did um where he spoke against the backdrop of Israeli air strikes which are thundering behind him and all around him and he speaks through tears and he asks what the world wants Palestinians to do to to give up to drown to commit Mass suicide and he said very movingly in that interview he said you know I'm I'm an academic I'm I'm a a professor a poet the the most dangerous thing I have in my home is is a marker but if they come for me if they come into my house I will take that marker and I will throw it at the soldiers who have come to kill me I think that at this point um to keep Gaza as it has been kept um under a naval blockade a land Siege um there is no airport there no nothing can get in nothing can get out everything from food to water as we have seen is controlled um you are not allowed to move freely you are not allowed to speak freely you are not allowed to engage freely I don't quite understand what the world wants um that's in no way to justify violence um but when you push people against the wall when you don't offer them a solution for their future then they will take any any option that is open to them and that's not just in the case of Palestine that's in the case of Ukraine that's in the case of any people anywhere in the world and and it has been disturbing to see Ukrainian resistance um valorized and celebrated in the west um as Noble and profound and then the same kind of resistance um when it happens uh to be practiced by Brown people uh demonized um when the media picked up um footage of Tamimi a young Palestinian woman standing up to an Israeli occupation Soldier they misunderstood her because she is a blonde and you know fair skinned to be Ukrainian and when the media at large thought a tamim a Palestinian girl was a Ukrainian they were almost en raptured by her bravery the moment they found out she was Palestinian that conversation was shut down either we don't condone violence either we don't accept and valorize violence or we do and I've only ever seen it celebrated and accepted um when it's white people doing it another thing we've seen come out in the open since October 7th is a kind of hypervisibility of women uh over the past three three months for example there's been an emphasis on the visibility of women Israeli women uh at war with Gaza there was a headline in The Times of Israel that read Squad of female IDF combat troops eliminated nearly 100 Hamas terrorists uh while an article from the Australian financial review reported uh that quote Israel Israeli female only tank Crews made history on October 7th by fighting Hamas emphasizing that the quote slightly built soldiers showed no squeamishness at killing this isn't exactly the feminist fantasy that many people envisioned um it's absolutely not and I I I really think it's it's beyond deranged um to present hypersexualized female soldiers as some kind of feminism it's not it's it's crass it's vulgar and it's incredibly ugly for the message that it portrays you can't claim feminism when you're killing uh Palestinian mothers you can't claim feminism when your rifle is being aimed at a hospital you can't claim feminism um when there are children 25,000 Palestinian children have been orphaned that cannot be called the success of feminism another thing that happens a lot of times is now we see pink washing I mean on November 13th I'm going give you an example uh Israel's official Twitter account posted a a soldier a photo of a soldier standing in front of a demolished Gaza and the soldier was holding a pride flag with in the name of Love written in English Arabic and Hebrew and the post claimed that it was quote the first ever pride flag raised in Gaza when you see stuff like that how do you respond Mark I I don't think there are enough words to convey the utter perversity to hold a pride flag over the scene of a massacre over the scene of Slaughter and then claim some kind of ownership of Love um I think it is the most obscene kind of pink washing you know let's also remember that same-sex marriage is not legal in Israel um Israelis have to go to another country to marry their Partners if they happen to be queer and then maybe they get that recognized in Israel but it's not legal in Israel and so to use um queer language symbolism and history while they carry out what is essentially a Carnage it is the the genocide of civilians to use then uh Pride flags and claim some kind of advancement is is is so perverse I I I just don't think it can be taken seriously at all and also you know what do they know about um queer lives in in Gaza or in the Middle East or in the Muslim world nothing you know they don't know anything about our lives they don't even see us as as human beings and anyone who has any respect for queer politics queer Liberation knows that you cannot tie that to aarth you cannot tie that to occupation Fatima I want to think about Justice these kind of big picture ideas that we talk about you know what for you does it take to get there well um you know I think again as I'm not Palestinian um I I can't claim to speak for anyone but you cannot talk about Justice while an occupation a brutal occupation is underway and you cannot possibly talk about justice under the confines of of a Siege um of under apartheid I I certainly don't know Mark how there will be Justice for these mothers who are giving birth under the most Terri in conditions that that I can think of I don't know what Justice we can give those premature babies who were left to die uh because their hospitals were attacked I I don't know what Justice we can ask for for not just the journalists who have been murdered for for telling us about this horror but for their families who have been targeted and killed I I I wouldn't I wouldn't even know where to begin there I wouldn't even know how to ask I think we also have to ask forgiveness not just Justice fatimo I want to thank you uh for sharing your views with us we appreciate your time thank you
