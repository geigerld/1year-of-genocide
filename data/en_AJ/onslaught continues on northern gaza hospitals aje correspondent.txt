as you just saw Alexa hospital is warning of an imminent Health catastrophe if fuel is not supplied soon the medical director has issued an urgent appeal for assistance ala Hospital needs more than 4,000 lers of fuel a day so that we can cater to patients and provide needed treatments we have hundreds of patients including the injured and those who are diagnosed with kidney failure and need electricity for their dialysis treatment this will stop completely without any fuel we calling on International organizations to send 50,000 L of fuel before there's an imminent crisis here otherwise it's the injured that pay the price all the patients will be condemned to death especially those in the ICU the incubators and those relying on dialysis treatment let's join T AB my correspondent de aala in central Gaza good morning T let's just begin with the focus uh on hospitals and the concern about fuel well that's right soel good morning uh firstly uh the vast majority of gaza's hospital since day one of the fighting were grappling with the Deep shortage and severe uh reduction in amount of fuel being delivered to such hospitals in order to be operational and to continue to provide medical treatment for uh more than 1.5 million Palestinians and the situation now sounds sounds critically D for Al Hospital which is nearly to run out of the fuel as the uh electric current has went off uh since yesterday overnight and it's R turned early it means that the hospital is depending and using small generators instead of using large one that consume more fuel in order to make the hospital be operational uh using the very limited and minimum rates of capabilities uh inside this very uh uh important hospital that is facing more mounting H and neous uh human humanitarian medical pressure but the situation is also getting much more dire for hospitals in the north of the Gaza Strip in particular in Kamal adwan hospital that has been hit twice yesterday overnight by the Israeli artillery that is advancing towards the entrance of that medical compound alongside that Al AA hospital as we've been hearing from Medics there that the Israeli soldiers have been crashing and destroying everything including the doors of the hospital the department and as the military has been using loud speakers in order to order people and families of the patients to flee from the buildings of that medical combat that was previously by the way stormed by the Israeli Army and at the same time some of the Medics refused to flee until the uh Israeli military forces could bring ambulances who which can help patients in critical conditions to flee to western side of Gaza City or at least to a place uh which they can get a kind of proper Medical treatment so the overall situation is getting dire as more appeals being made by the wh to afford them an urgent protection indeed it's not just protection that the hospitals need as you say they need fuel too and it's hard to imagine how that fuel is going to enter the Gaza Strip when the crossings are closed and the bombardment by the Israeli military continues well that is the Striking reality uh in fact now the Israeli military continues to close borders including andam acrossing the South and there was no any kind of Aid now getting from the north of the strip only what has been getting into the Gaza Strip our commercial our commercial trucks that had been uh entering the territory in coordination with the Israeli Army and only humanitarian aid supplies from the recently floating dock that was established in the coaster line of the Gaza Strip and the numers of eight trucks that get into this trip cannot really match the 's needs of gaza's population so uh what is happening before is what was happening before is that the hospital was receiving uh a very limited number of Convoy fuel by the uh hona and by some of the humanitarian organizations but these organizations themselves right now are grappling in order to afford to afford fuel for their facilities it means that they are even struggling to keep be operational on the ground and this is a clear result of the military expansion of the fighting and Military incursion of rafah District because we said before that rafah is a very important city it contains the main two Crossing Borders that are responsible uh for delivering aids to the Gaza Strip and now with the closure of these borders the situation is exacerbating day by day as more Palestinians believe that the Gaza Strip will lose all kinds of Medical Services soon if there's going to be no any kind of an immediate intervention to rescue what has been left from gaza's hospitals T [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was zoomed there for us in Dar oala we're check in with you throughout the day thanks T make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
