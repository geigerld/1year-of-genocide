well as we mentioned earlier Us Media is reporting Israel has begun pumping seawater into tunnels in Gaza used by Hamas they've cited unnamed us officials who say Israelis are testing the targeted flooding of tunnels on a limited basis Israeli forces haven't commented on the report so far but Israel has claimed Hamas is using tunnels under Gaza to hide captives Fighters and weapons in Washington earlier US President Joe Biden was asked about the possibility there could still be some captives held inside the tunnels there is assertions being made that there's quite sure there are no hostages in any of these tunnels uh but I don't know that for a fact I do know that though every civilian death is an absolute tragedy and Israel stated its intent as I said to uh to match its uh its words with h its intent with word with actions that's why uh that's why I was that's what I was talking about today just as John hendin joins us now live from Washington DC so John what overall position is the Biden Administration taking on the issue of flooding tunnels well Sammy the Biden Administration has been critical of the civilian deaths going on in Gaza and President Biden called them indiscriminate some of those attacks so while Israel has tried to destroy some of those tunnels with air strikes liquid explosives it's gone in there with robots dogs and drones the administration seems less critical of the idea of flooding those tunnels with water if there are no host captives there as you heard the the president talk about just in that sound bite the concern seems to be that as long as civilians aren't killed they don't mind those tunnels being flooded so they cannot be used for Hamas Fighters um there are environmental concern concerns however that have been brought up you heard them a little bit earlier uh there are concerns that that salt waterer could get into the groundwater and the aquifers that it could pollute farmland and that it could cause structural problems to buildings so there are certainly concerns there but so far all we've heard from the Biden Administration is concerns that there might be captives kept in those tunnels and you heard the president say he could not vouch for the fact that there are none down there all right thanks so much John hendren let's bring in now Elijah MZ he's a military and political risk analyst joins us live from Brussels good to have you with us so first of all let's start with the question of how well prepared or not might Hamas be for this kind of situation thank you for having me I don't think the situation of flooding the tunnels had any military value in favor of the Israelis or counterproductive for Hamas first of all we have seen how the Israelis have occupied the north of Gaza and part of the South and yet in the north we have seen the most detrimental attacks against the Israeli occupation forces from the same area that Israel is occupying secondly we've seen how the Israelis on television have flooded already tunnels and we have seen that had no effect whatsoever of on the military performance of Hass because they still attacking the Israeli forces and they inflicting a very heavy casualties on them uh third it helps the Israeli Army to relax because they think they flooded these tunnels they blew them up and then Hamas has been defeated on the contrary we've seen always again the attacks when these Israelis are very relaxed that takes us to another Point what is the real in intention of the Israelis to kill all the soldier prisoners that are under the ground because they are under the ground and they are above the ground we have heard from the testimony of the Israeli captive that have been released that some of them were in tunnels and they War for many kilometers which mean all these tunnel can be linked and can feeling and this is why we've seen so many attacks from Hamas in small group in different areas simultaneously now the question is what is Israel's final objective for the future of Gama of Gaza so in in what they are doing they causing a serious humanitarian um disaster because they are indeed shaking the foundation and the civilian infrastructure which mean they don't want the people people that are living in Gaza to return or they want to leave it as a no man land or perhaps if they agree on the ceasefire at a certain point they want them first to suffer daily secondly to dependent always on the supply of water that comes from the Israelis secondly they are indeed destroying the natural Water Resources that's what if I could jump in how how much of a serious threat is this to gaza's freshwater Supply how long does the do we know what the quantity of flooding that's going on the in various reports but do we know how long we have how big the window is before one would be worried that even the freshwater resources that do exist in Gaza are likely to now be contaminated well the fresh s uh water is already very little in Gaza we've seen how the United Nation is supplying along with other humanitarian organization Gaza with fresh water because they don't have enough secondly we've seen how the Israelis on the first day of the attack they said we are cutting the water committing a war crime and crime against humanity by indicating how much Gaza is in need of water and how the Israelis are aware how much Gaza needs them to supply the water so being aware of the scarcity of the water is something that is extremely significant because it show how the Israelis really give a damn about accountability or international law now the area is very close to the Sea because it's a strip and it is extended on the long of the shore and when the situation is like that for any building it means already that there is high uh potentiality to have salt water when people try to dig their own well this is why CES an issue Elijah what about to any hopes for reconstruction at some point how much of a challenge would it be if there has been flooding of seawater through tunnels or through the infrastructure underground infrastructure of Gaza well already when uh construction are built on uh a on Sand is already requiring a lot of uh construction effort to consolidate the bases and it's always uh important to consolidate the building when it is constructed this is why Gaza needs a lot of cement that the Israelis were not providing and this is why before the beginning of the war we had more or less 100,000 Palestinian without home because they were delaying the construction for the lack of material so by flooding the foundation of Gaza it means adding more problems to the already existing problem the advantage for Hamas is why they dig so many tunnels because the Earth is very soft by being soft it is detrimental for the civilians to have all this flood under their knees by these reades who are very much aware what they are doing but they really don't care so they understand the damage they are causing to the Palestinian civilians all right thank you so much Elijah
