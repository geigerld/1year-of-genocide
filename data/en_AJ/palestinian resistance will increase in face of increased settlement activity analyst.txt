's war on Gaza has ented its sixth month at least 3,717 people have been killed since October the 7th South Africa has asked the United Nations Top Court the icj to impose new emergency orders on Israel to allow humanitarian Aid into Gaza joining us now here in studio is Omar asaw he's a professor of security and Military studies at the Doan Institute for Graduate Studies so many areas to focus on at the moment Omar I just want to sort of go to um where we are in terms of the various un officials and diplomats across Europe assessing and and having warned Israel of settlement expansion they announced more settlment expansion in the last 24 hours it's like a red rag to a bull Isn't it to to the Palestinians and to the the Islamic community to see this happening when there's also talk of a potential two-state solution sometime in the future absolutely it's further uh insults to injuries and we know 7th of October uh came uh because of um partly because of the settlement activities part partly because of the escalations in Jerusalem uh and partly because of uh you know the the the unresolved history of the of this conflict and uh of course this is uh is basically taking us into a similar escalation a similar round of escalation um so I don't know it it does not uh it it means that a peaceful resolution for this conflict is just getting further and further away if it will ever be existing various organizations have called it like a powder keg waiting to to explode really there's that much anger in the region especially in the occupied West Bank yeah it's the occupied West Bank at the moment uh you see a bit of an escalation at the moment you see some rotation even from some of the special forces units in Gaza towards West Bank uh there's uh sometimes they send forces uh uh specialized forces from the Gaza Strip to the West Bank and sometimes they withdrew them from the West Bank to Gaza so which means that we're going to see a bit of more escalation on in both uh in both places mainly because of these uh settlements policies as you talked about the escalation over the past several months even post October the 7th we've seen an increase in Israeli raids attacks shootings of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank yet there was no hamus in the occupied West Bank the attacks into Israel did not come from the occupied West Bank yet Israel has gone in yet again even more heavy-handed than normal the issue was never Hamas uh the issue is bigger than Hamas um even in in the Gaza Strip at the moment we're talking about six seven Palestinian organizations in the West Bank Hamas has some presence but it's not a dominant presence um but there are other organizations as well that uh launched uh it was sort of an Insurgency in the West Bank and isra the Israelis were were more or less following a a very harsh counterinsurgency policies in that sense um and U if the settlement uh continue if the these settlement activities occupation activities continues I think there will be more and more uh resistance in that uh in that direction and some of that resistance will be violent and then we'll see another cycle and we're seeing another cycle at the moment it would just escalate in terms of its intensity scale and scope we should what happens early again in the coming days and hours for the moment Mar thanks for joining us from The doart Institute
