for now uh want to bring in now Maran Bashar Al jaz's senior political analyst he comes to us via Skype uh from Paris is this a sign that the mediator's um patience is running thin and that there might be a willingness now to apply pressure to the parties to sign this ceasefire implement this ceasefire that's on the table right now well it's certainly a good way to put it that uh their patience is running out uh it's certainly the case for the mediators uh uh Egypt and Qatar uh in as far as the United States concerned I think there are two goals here uh for speeding up the process um we've heard only a few days ago that President Biden was on the phone with the Amir of Qatar and the Egyptian president in order to put more pressure uh to conclude uh some form of a draft for Israel and Hamas to look at and and agree to the details but I think there are two major factors here one is um the possible escalation towards war with Hezbollah and Iran threatening that they will be responding to Israel and uh it seemed like the Iranians sort of leaked that only a ceasefire will cool these spirits in the region and I think that was uh echoed in Washington the other thing that I think is a very important factor here we haven't seen much about it in the western press but one Israeli paper uh quoted that uh the American president seemed to have accepted netanyahu's demand that Israel could continue with the war after phase one uh for the past 3 4 days Nan has been demanding that this agreement by Biden that Israel can continue with the war after phase one be put in writing the Biden Administration refused to do so but they said they will give their varable support for it and once uh the first phase is getting implemented that they might provide something inv writing to the Israelis I think these are the two main factors why we see more momentum uh towards right and marn I just wanted to see you know what your view is on the following uh could we uh uh see potentially them Implement a a ceasefire without the kind of negotiated agreement that everybody is is trying to get and is so difficult to hammer out apparently but just a ceasefire um would that open the pathway with with this statement that's just been released no I think the idea here is that uh the going to go back to the table come August 15 uh and both Hamas and Israel would be looking at hammering the details and apparently there's a lot of details that still remaining include which prisoners which hostages how many hostages in the first phase uh how many Palestinian prisoners will be released in return and where would the Israelis be uh deployed uh whether they would withdraw from the much of the Gaza in the first phase and eventually leave the southern part of Gaza on the borders with Egypt so there's all sorts of details that would still need to be hammered next week I think what what we've heard now is basically the three parties the United States along with Egypt and qar saying that we have a good framework agreement now for the three stage ceas fire agreement and that uh there are still remaining details that the parties need to look at I think this is more or less a called for Action uh and certain uh call for urgency to act quicker than before and as I said the two main reasons is One removing the obstacle that nany has always insisted on that Israel can go back to war after phase one and two that there is an urgency of an escalation now with hisbah Iran threatening and hence the United States would like to see that uh undermined by reaching some kind of a deal and Marwan you know what type of you know success could we see you know this round August 15 these talks have you know when when you consider that the two you know main decision makers um are Netanyahu and sinir I mean will they see eye to eye on this well it depends on uh what is being proposed um but I I see your point that the gap between them is way too huge and certainly the uh the situation has inflamed as such the past 10 months with Netanyahu uh you know pushing uh red line after Red Line throughout and his government continued to speak of um you know ethnic cleansing torture uh tormenting the Palestinians starving them and so on so forth but eventually as the Americans have been saying the past few weeks that uh the war must come to an end that it needs to wind down at least and that the three-stage proposal just to remind our viewers around the world it was an Israeli proposal for God's sake it wasn't an American or or an Arab POS proposal it was an Israeli proposal it was the Israelis who've been trying to walk back that proposal for the past uh 3 months ever since the United Nations security Council has embraced it under American pressure so all the reasons for a deal has they really been there for the past three months and it's the Israelis that have put one obstacle after another I think the main obstacle has been removed with this apparent secret agreement between the Biden Administration and the N government over the capacity of Israel to resume the war after phase one if it wants to and the threat of War by Hezbollah and and and Iran which I think the United n the United States certainly the bid Administration Kamala Harris and so on so forth don't want to see a wider war in the in the few remaining weeks to the elections of November 7th Maran Bashar Al jazer is a senior political analyst thank you Maran make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer out
