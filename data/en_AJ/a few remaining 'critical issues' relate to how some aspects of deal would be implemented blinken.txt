Gideon Levy is a columnist at Hart's newspaper and author of the punishment of Gaza he's joining us live from Tel Aviv always a pleasure to have you with us on Al jazer Mr Levy thank you for your time um what are the Americans trying to do when they repeat the same lines about a ceasefire without using the levers that could lead to one why do they do the same thing but expect different results I think it's only an outcome of total Despair and and lack of cap ability to do something there's no other explanation I mean they are pulling it and pulling it for weeks now and months claiming that the the settlement is just around the corner the deal will be signed the deal is almost agreed 90% 95% knowing that prime minister of Israel Benjamin nany has no intention to go for a ceas fire now knowing that the Gap is much too big I really I want wonder do they really want to put an end to this war the Americans because if yes they know very well what they should do and if no why they bother us with all those declarations and and efforts which are totally in vain well why do you think they are doing this then I guess as usually it has to do also with domestic politics they don't want a confrontation right now with with Israel and without the confrontation it will not work as simple as this they have the leverage in their hand but they don't want to use it by the way they never used it it's not like it's only in in campaign times that they don't use it they never used the leage on Israel it was always a hollow hollow threats and Hollow advises without using any leverage on Israel but now when Israel depends so much on the United States it's quite bizarre that they don't use at least partially at least condition the aid condition the support with some kind of conditions nothing just Hollow declarations yeah and that's something that uh both major parties in the United States have made it clear is that they're not going to condition military military aid if we look at the different pressure points that either the United States or Israel face are the protests that taking place in Israel are they putting any pressure on the government unfortunately not that I would even say not at all this is not the political base of Mr Netanyahu and it doesn't cross it doesn't penetrate into his political camp and as long as this does not happen and as long as the protest is as polite as it is don't expect any influence he can totally ignore this protest and I say a lot of sorrow and appreciation to the those who go to protest devoted and and really aiming for the good but they have they have no influence on this government and what does all of this you know when we talk about what's happening in Gaza the lack of the ceasefire the lack of impact from these protests how much is it emboldening the Israeli government to continue on its current whether it's in Gaza or in the West Bank this government is much more solid than one would expect after such a fiasco like on the 7th of October and it's much more solid than most of Israel governments they can last for long time and you mention Gaza but I would like to pay the attention that by the time we are talking about Gaza and talking about hisbah the West Bank is now the next Arena and what Israel is doing there will soon be failed because Israel really went to a to a an aggressive campaign in tar in Janine in other places the settlers went wild the the West Bank that's at least the place that I can still visit the West Bank looks worse than ever with the checkpoints with the horrible econom iCal situation with the killings with using the Air Force like never before they never used the Air Force in the West Bank to kill people so all together creates a very very depressing picture and not less than this is depressing the passiveness of the United na of the United States Mr Levy uh we thank you as always for your analysis gide and Levy in Tel Aviv make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
