katar's foreign Ministry says it has not received any firm agreements from either Israel or Hamas on the Gaza ceasefire plan put forward by the US President Joe Biden however Ministry spokesman Majid alansari says he's positive it is moving in the right direction we haven't had concrete approvals to the suggestions on the table by both sides and uh we have all read and uh seen the contradictory statements coming in uh from uh Israeli ministers which doesn't f us with a lot of confidence over there being a unified position on Israel in Israel over this uh this current proposal on uh on the table uh however we can see also that there's uh a positive momentum building up within both sides as you said the statements from Hamas were quite positive uh although falling short of uh a commitment to to the language and asking for more clarification uh but they were positive we we have also seen a positive movement in in Israel where the government is meeting right now and that there discussions over accepting the proposals on the tables well our correspondent Assad B has more from kata's foreign Ministry in DOA now what we've heard from the kis is a cautious approach now what they have been saying is that there is no concrete proposals from both sides there's no agreement but also they've said that they've heard contradictory statements from Israel which shows that Israel doesn't have a unified position and that this doesn't give qat much confidence in the process but what they did say is that they are seeing a positive International momentum led by the United States to get both sides to agree to this agreement but what we heard from the White House was that they are blaming Hamas they said that Hamas is the obstacle to this agreement now that's not what we've heard from qarqatar said there's no concrete steps from both sides but there have been positive statements from Hamas but it falls short of accepting an agreement now in the past we have heard from qar that one side clearly wants to end this war and one side clearly wants to continue this war meaning Israel now that's not what they're saying now they're urging both sides to come together to stop this war although they say that there is no concrete timeline or whether it will actually happen Assad bag Al jaaz Doha wellan Barakat is Professor of public policy at hammad bin Khalifa University joins us here in Doha good speak to you again Sultan we've got Hamas saying that Israel is not serious about this deal and that the ball is not in hamas's court does that suggest that they are likely to accept Biden's peace proposal well they came out early on yesterday in fact and they were positive from the beginning and uh as we said earlier I think uh what has been offered is not too far from what they had already agreed to uh some 10 days ago so From hamas's perspective I think it is very clear that they want to see an end of War now the worry I think on their mind is when they read the details and they compare the statements a netanyahu's statements to his audience he says different things to different people his message to his uh far right is very different when he says it to the to to the rest to the United States and so on that is confusing also the United States uh language they talk about the possibility of uh Israel going back to war if Hamas fails to implement the terms of the agreement and you can imagine that their capacity no doubt has been reduced not just the military capacity but also the governance capacity until today Israelis are still going after their policemen on the street they go after the public service within Hamas that would make it very difficult for them to guarantee anything on the ground in terms of a ceasefire so th those issues must be playing on the mind as as they consider the final detail and let's look at other ways that the ceasefire plan might be implemented because it does say that Israel must withdraw all of its forces from the populated areas of Gaza that is most of Gaza isn't it I mean it's a tiny area it's filled with people these people mostly are intense depends on how they would Define populated they may say populated as in now people are concentrated in those areas which means that uh the uh in the middle of Gaza the Israelis have now introduced like a a security Zone that goes all the way to the waters which practic Bally split the Gaza uh the Gaza Strip into two that whole area is not populated at the moment they've pushed people out of it they may argue that they need to stay there so that they can uh filter through the Palestinians returning to the north they wouldn't want Hamas fighters to go back North so whoever is coming back they have to check them one after the other so a lot depends on the definitions and I think the Palestinians experience so far with Israel is that no definition can fit and nothing can commit them to implement uh they're doing all what we see they're doing now uh following the second call of the icj for them to explicitly not kill civilians in RAV it was unequivocal it's very clear decision and they're still pushing for it and Biden unfortunately although he's trying to Lobby the International Community the G7 came out in support of his plan the Arab ambassadors uh did the same he has The Leverage in his hand he has the key he can actually threaten to stop at least supplying weapons never mind cutting the financial aid or uh protecting Israel at the security Council so now they're trying to get the International Community to approve it he taking the decision to the security Council as well but all of this really playing around the edges the real uh instrument that the United States has is to stop supplying Israel with weapons so that they understand there is an end to this I mean that did happen didn't it during the sort of Rafa invasion in those early days certain yes no no they didn't stop I don't think they stopped they they certainly threatened it and it had an impact so why are they not why are they withholding that card now well I think partly because he saw the power of Israel in Washington DC I mean he's he's in the middle of this and Netanyahu was able to get an invitation from Congress using the Israeli Lobby in Washington to go for a fourth invitation fourth time to address the Congress never happened before in the middle of all this and against the wish of the IC or at least now that you know the request for an arrest warrant so he must be uh fully um aware of the fact that he has to delicately balance the Israeli interest s Barat always good to speak to you thanks for joining us thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
