welcome to the program we begin in Gaza where Israeli forces are showing no signs of slowing their attacks the main building of NASA Hospital in KH Unis is amongst the latest targets troops are surrounding the facility and intense bombing has been taking place around it overnight gaza's Health Ministry says no one has been able to enter or exit the hospital which was already struggling to treat the wounded the Red Cross is warning of thousands of preventable deaths if medical facilities are not protected from indis criminate assault hany Mahmud joins us now from Rafa in southern Gaza and it is a scenario hany that in these intense raids are ongoing around the very few medical facilities that are still operational yes indeed and this is what I've been uh reporting about since the beginning of the war and we seen what happened in the northern part and and Gaza City where Health Care Facilities were systematically attacked and and what's going on around Naser hospital and its vicinity and the direct attack on the emergency department and ambulance department at the hospital and the Maternity Ward uh building is just another reminder that what's going on against Health Care Facilities in Gaza is very systematic and only leads to one conclusion which is a complete destruction and uh and of healthcare system across the the Gaza Strip but the the fact that this is happening right at the at the time isra military talking about safe zones and evacuation orders for people is just making uh people very frustrated right now because uh hanun is a place that was designated as a safe zone for the vast majority of displaced Palestinians from Gaza the northern part and recently the the central area is now a scene of Devastation and and suffering and ongoing consistent and concentrated bombing campaigns across the city there at least half a million people who were uh ordered to evacuate now but uh with ongoing failure to provide a safe Corridor uh for them the very Road the coastal Road where people told to take to evacuate to rafah City within the past two days has been blocked by uh heav presence of Israeli tanks and armed vehicles and constant concentrated shelling of densely populated areas within uh the city just uh making it very difficult uh for people the latest of what happened is the attack on a vocational technical school managed and operated by Ona that's the United Nations for Palestinian refugee where 14 people have been reported killed and many other injuries uh here in Raa City for 45 of those who were critically injured in the attacks on The Vocational School honorable Vocational School arrived to rafu and naar Hospital due to difficulties and inability of paramedics and civil defense SEC crew to transfer those injuries to Naser hospital as Naser hospital is under heavy intense bombing campaigns with people still inside overnight attacks in ra included a mosque in the e in part of RA that was completely destroyed five people reported killed and were reported to a naar hospital and multiple other injuries from the vicinity of the mosque we're talking about at least five more residential homes were severely damaged just causing further displacement and panic uh to local residents of the eastern part of Rafa City in Western Rafa City an area that uh has been a site for thousand of newly displaced Palestinians within the past few weeks a residential home was also targeted uh the house included the owner of the house and those who have who been Sheltering inside the residential home one person reported killed and he happened to be at displaced Palestinians the other injuries are from uh the local residence of of Rafa uh City so far what we're looking at here is uh Gaza Strip been split into two parts uh two reservations uh safely to say one that is largely Starving in the northern part and the other reservation is overcrowded with with 1.9 displaced 1.9 million displaced Palestinians struggling to find food and drinkable water uh under constant heavy bombardment h m for in Rafa thank you
