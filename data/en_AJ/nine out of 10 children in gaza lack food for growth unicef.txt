well the United Nations children agency UNICEF is measuring child food poverty that's an estimate of how nutritious and how diverse a child's food should be it measures three categories five or more food groups is above the threshold but if a child is only eating from four food groups or fewer they are living in moderate food poverty and if they only have access to two food groupes or fewer that's severe food poverty UNICEF is saying that one in four of the world's children under the age of five are living in severe food poverty half of the world's children are experiencing food poverty overall report says household income is not the only factor that leads to severe food poverty children from so-called nonpoor households can be affected as well Alexandra Ritz house Pereira is head of nutrition action against hunger UK she joins us from kadis in Spain can I ask you about the uh Geographic concentration of this report about the whereabouts which sort of population are you most concerned about yeah thank you very much um so the the report uh has data that comes from 130 countries so it's it's it's a report that has been done with extensive uh data and we we have to to commend uh Unicef on on on the quality of the data they use for for the report um but obviously um the the data are more reporting on uh the region of subaran Africa uh South Asia which are the most affected uh regions of the world with uh F child food poverty um so the Africa region in general Latin America Asia are the the most um there are also the data uh from which we have the countries from which have more data uh unfortunately very often uh we lack a lot of data on on Child Nutrition uh child nutritional status in in Europe uh or or United States why is that uh simply because uh there are uh less uh Civil Society uh being involved in uh in collecting those data um those countries are also less affected by conflict uh or human situation um therefore there's not a regular uh collection of of those of those datas so so tell me in terms of it it seems as though mean from this report millions of families are struggling to provide nutritious uh and diverse foods for their children you mentioned that there is a the there is a difference in the data you've collected from uh Europe and North America compared to uh subsaharan Africa and those countries what is the main cause of this I know it's a very broad report but are we is it conflict is it the climate crisis is it growing inequities Rising food prices what would you say the main factors Driving Child food poverty you've you you've pretty much named them all um so there there is indeed so there are uh Global factors uh the you know the the crisis in Ukraine as well as we know has has driven the the prices of the food of main stable food up as well that has been a factor uh we are still facing uh the consequences of the the covid-19 epidemic as well on how it has affected Health Systems as well uh in in countries where there was already a fragile Health System uh and then uh climate climate shocks uh conflicts that also impairs uh parents to have access uh to the the right food they need for their childrens are are very important factors that drive food poverty in children and of course there is always a there is always concern about the physical effects of this on the body of a child but how does it affect affect cognitive uh brain development ability to learn yeah exactly so those children and the the report mentioned that there is definitely a link between child food poverty and malnutrition and that the country that are most affected by what we call chronic malnutrition or stunting uh are uh definitely more affected by severe food poverty in children and what it does is indeed children are not growing up to their food potential not only physically but in terms of cognitive ability so they are are not doing as well as they should at school which means that later on in in in life they won't have access to the same opportunities has a child who has the appropriate have the appropriate food um in their youth and this has of course then economic consequences for government uh and it's a type of vicious circle uh where if if governments don't invest into their nutrition services um they will never have the budget that they need to take care of the population the way they require thank you very much Alexandre rala Pera thank you for joining us thank you for having me make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
