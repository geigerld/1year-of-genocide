Mass protests have erupted across Israel against prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as his war on Gaza is close to entering a 12th month and that's despite mounting domestic and international pressure to agree on a ceasefire families of captives held in Gaza have been demonstrating in Tel Aviv and they're demanding that Netanyahu reach an agreement to secure the release of their loved ones also the UN Security Council is expected to discuss the issue in the coming hours joining us now is Usama hamdan who's a spokesperson for hamas's political Bureau thanks for your time Mr hamdan so as we're saying the UN Security Council is to discuss later on Wednesday the hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza as well as the overall conflict after the killing of six Israeli hostages over the weekend how do you view this well thank you Dar for having me in fact uh it's a good issue to be discussed but uh the big questions here for the security C counil they are trying to discuss or they are willing to discuss the death of six Israeli jail people in Gaza why they are not discussing the killings of 50,000 Palestinians they are not discussing the assassination of 60 Palestinians in the Israeli jails while they were tortured they are not talking about the situation in gazab in fact they are not talking about implementing the resolution of the international Council I have here to say that talking about the six Israelis who were killed uh most of those people who were kept in Gaza they were killed by the bombings of the Israelis some of them they were killed directly by the Israelis and I have to remind everyone that three soldiers were killed by the Israeli troops uh thinking that it was a trap and they declared that and announced that they they they they missed by killing them uh that happened in sh a few months ago also uh everyone remembers how the Israelis have committed a huge Massacre inat why they were trying to bring back some of the the Israelis there Ann they have four allow me just for a moment back to this particular incident that happened over the weekend the UN Human Rights office wrote on acts that we are horrified by reports that Palestinian groups sum summarily exec executed six Israeli hostages which would constitute a war crime and is also calling for an investigation I mean do you accept that this is a war crime to which Hamas may be held accountable for and would you welcome an investigation well well this is the problem they decide that it's a war crime they have only the Israeli narrative they didn't ask Hamas they didn't ask the Palestinians they didn't investigate about that they jumped to the pluging directly without asking anyone who is responsible for that and then they've said you are condemned you are criticized we we we accept the Israeli narrative and then we can investigate I I think that that that is very wrong way to deal with the Palestinians we didn't hear from them about the killings of the Palestinians in the Israeli jails we are talking about 60 confirmed killings in the Palestinian from the Palestinians in the Israeli jails we talking about 50,000 Palestinians who be whove been killed in the last 10 months we didn't hear anyone working to stop the Israelis from what they are doing they have to be balanced we have said you didn't hear The Narrative of the Palestinians you are just talking about what the Israelis are say Mr we put these questions we do put these questions to you and diplomats when we do speak to them but now i' just like to get your point of view on on the issue of the captiv and what happened in Gaza look alasan Brigade spokesman Abu abeda said that the captives held in Gaza would return to Israel in coffins if Israeli military pressure continues and he also warned that new instructions have been given to its Fighters guarding the captives in case Israeli troops approach what are we to understand these new instructions to be well the clear message from Ab from the Palestinian resistance was you have tried all the time to have your people back by the force and each time the that that action caused the killing of them I have to to talk back that we declared that some of them they were killed by by the Israelis themselves when they were bombing the houses we declared some names we have declared true they Alam troops they declared three months ago that they lost the contact with the people who were keeping her and they don't they didn't have the contact back and that was because of the the Israelis so this is why I'm insisting we have to talk about the Palestinian narrative the the message from abua was if you try to continue this way you will cause the death of your people so how are you going to secure willing to how is Hamas going to secure the safety of the remaining captives being held in Gaza by stopping the Israeli attacks the main reason of the killings is the Israeli attacks the people who who were killed they were killed by the Israelis either by bombing them or by shooting them and and they have four alive Israelis but they've killed at the same moment another three who were there in the same place so the idea to to send them back alive and to send also the Palestinian people to their families is is to to achieve the deal ceasefire complete Israeli withdrawal a serious pronal exchange okay let's talk about the CE months let's talk about the ceasefire because according to reports the US President Joe Biden is saying that Washington is very close to putting forward a final proposal for an agreement and reports are suggesting that it will deal with the Philadelphia Corridor and the presence of Israeli forces there which of course has been one of the major sticking points have you been told anything more about this officially we were not told anything no one talks to us officially we just hear rumors we hear from the media but I have to say through the the last months every time the Americans try to to be optimistic because for their own needs for the for their internal problems the elections the what's happening in the universities but in fact they understand well more than anyone else that the main obstacle was Netanyahu and his government they they rejected all the proposal which was introduced them although we have accepted at least two proposals from the mediators and after that the Israeli answer was the rejection uh everyone remembers two days ago Netanyahu went to a press conference and he insist that he will stay in in Philadelphia although he understands that it's International borders between the Palestinians and the Egyptians he does he is not supposed to be there for two reasons for because he's prevented by the the the Camp David the Accord between Egypt and and Israel and the second we believe this is a Palestinian issue we don't need anyone to interfere in that mainly the Israelis so what are your red lines going forward as uh these ceasefire talks take place I I think we we don't need more negotiations there was a a proposal introduced to both sides for to Hamas and the Israeli side we declared our acceptance for this prop proposal it was based on the President Biden initiative and the inter and Security Council resolution and and the Israelis they've rejected that in a practical way they committed the massacre of al- maasi and they assassinated hania and they even committed the massacre of in school I think what we need now a real pressure from the American side on the Israelis to accept that proposal which was accepted by mass and I have to say it wasn't introduced by the m migrators and it was written by the Americans themselves Mr hamdan just a final thought from you if I may on what's happening in the occupied West Bank how do you view things there and how will you deal as Hamas how will Hamas deal uh with the situation going forward in the occupied West Bank with the ongoing military raids and arrests as we've been seeing well what's happening in West Bank it shows that the Israelis they don't recognize the Palestinians as a nation everyone knows that for for for example in Janine there is a Palestinian Authority and they were they are supposed to have the full control on the security there they invaded Janine they didn't talk to the Palestinian Authority even when Netanyahu and his press conference was talking uh on on the map there was no West Bank it shows the real H will of this government to take over all the all West Bank and I think by invading the northern part of West Bank they are preparing for for for this step I have to remind everyone that two years ago smri have said clearly we have to evacuate 2 million Palestinians from West West Bank if we want a survival for Israel okay
