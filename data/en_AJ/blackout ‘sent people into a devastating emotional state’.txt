Al jazer hany mmud joins us from KH unun now and uh after the heaviest night of bombing since this War Began can you just bring us up to date with the situation as it stands there now what's the damage been uh over the last few hours or [Music] so yes Tom well uh within the past 30 minutes or so three different air strikes in different locations of the city of Han un including residential uh homes and residential buildings and the third one just a few minutes ago within the vicinity of a School honor school with uh with so many people uh taking it as as a shoulder we don't have an immediate reports about what are the situation near the school but ambulance and paramedics and civil defense personel just rush to the the school given how crowded it is and there is expectation that there's a large number of casualties but as of last night the horror of of the massive and and mass bombardment of the northern part in Gaza City and the the intentional cut of communication Network leaving uh people without connection with their relatives and and loved ones in addition to International Organization managing volunteers and and team members on the ground have lost communication with them making it difficult to coordinate any of the activities or Arrangement uh going on the ground the attacks left hundreds of buildings mainly residential uh buildings and entire uh residential blocks turned into into ruins and with hundreds of people being killed and injured uh only this morning uh at about 9:00 we were able to confirm a number of of family members 42 members of One family were killed uh as a direct result of the attacks at shot the refugee camp and as you can uh see right now the ambulance the paramedics are rushing casualties who were uh injured in the uh in the uh past few minutes attacks near the school and in the alqara area AL Family residential home that was attacked leaving two people killed and multiple uh injuries this is the situation so far and it's only getting uh worse by the hours and there's an expectation that by time night we might see another night as as horrific as and Asic as intense as last night honey can you just explain what it was like to to live through that Israel said that they uh had Land Air and sea 100 fighter planes were used in last night's bombardment can you just give us an idea of what that was like on the ground living through that yes Tom it it's pretty difficult and there is a a sense of of of of of tarnished shattered security uh among Palestinians here there is no place safe which is a practical uh translation of what one uh United Nations officials uh expressed that there is no safe place in Gaza uh what's really scary about this situation that these bombs are unpredictable you could be with a group of people or in your home or out in the street just minding your own business and there is a bomb falling either directly at at your vicinity or near you or at home and either way you're going to be a victim of these falling bombs so uh we are standing here and we are not really 100% sure that we are safe uh or not doing this because we haven't heard any confirmation that hospitals are are safe uh especially after the uh the attack on the Lei Baptist hospital but again uh it just no place is safe in Gaza whether it's the hospital or in our homes or in the streets it's a reality that we have to face honey once again we really do appreciate uh all of your time and effort uh that's honey mmud for us in KH Unice
