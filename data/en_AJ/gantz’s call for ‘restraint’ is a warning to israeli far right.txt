Jam jum is there uh so protests you're right in the thick of the protests uh Muhammad these are the weekly protests that we've seen they're both anti-government protests and they're also of course protests in support of um securing the release of the captives that means that the crowds behind you they very much want to see a ceasefire that's right s thousands of protesters have converged here in K Square which is the epicenter of the protest movement in Tel Aviv this happens every week Saturday night happening again tonight you see them behind us just a couple of moments ago you had the singing of the national anthem before that you had a moment of silence for captives who uh who were killed in Gaza during the war and everybody who's out here tonight is fully aware that this is a very critical moment when it comes to negotiations about possibly entering into a ceasefire everybody that we've been speaking with has said that the time is now they are concerned that if a ceasefire is not entered into and that if Israel were to then go into ra as Israel keeps promising to do that that would mean that the captives would be very much in a Harm's Way that they could be killed they could be caught in crossfire in the fighting they're very worried about that they are calling on the government to do everything that it can to go ahead and enter into a ceasefire and to affect a deal to release those captives now you have different groups here as you mentioned you have anti-g demonstrators people who are calling on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign because they don't they say he's not doing enough to ensure an end to the war and then you have relatives of those captives Who come out week after week and they are calling on the government to do more to ensure that their relatives and loved ones can actually return home it's a very vocal crowd we've heard numerous speakers already say that they don't believe that the government is doing enough they want to see as many people as possible out here tonight to try to put as much pressure on the government as possible so that the government will listen to their demands to that end this is not the only protest site in the country on this Saturday evening at this moment we're told there are also protests that are happening in hia and also in cesaria which is where the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a residence it's expected that there will also be protests in other cities throughout the country so it's a very fraught moment people very much aware this is a very critical time and this could very much really just um what happens tonight in the hours ahead could very much impact what happens to the captives going forward s I'm Muhammad thank you very much for your reporting there live from Tel Aviv we'll keep checking in with you throughout the evening let's go to Tar gabum who's in Rafa in southern Gaza T nobody has more at stake in these negot negotiations for a ceasefire then the Palestinians of course who live in Gaza who live under the bombs and under the Israeli attacks how closely are they following this well seral as you can clearly hear right now at the back of ground that Palestinian children men and everyone is chanting that we want to return we want to have hodna which means a ceasefire agreement they have been chanting this for a couple of hours ago and right now they have been re shanting as they are completely optimistic about this round of negotiations to be made that is ongoing in Cara between Hamas and Israel they have been following closely what was going on there as they have been really feeling the optimistic atmosphere of this round of talks in order to get to a ceasefire agreement but that kind of happiness that Palestinians are really having right now is completely mixed with a deep and completely hidden sense of frustration regarding any possibility for the collapse of the negotiations they have been calling for the return because they have been multiply displaced from the houses they have been going through really difficult humanitarian security conditions and they are waiting eagerly to the day they might really return back to the houses in the nor so any collapse of these ongoing negotiations will be extremely a shock for the vast majority of gaza's population who are really hoping to hear soon the announcement of a ceas fire agreement between Hamas and Israel all right tar kabaz thank you for your reporting there from Southern Gaza in Rafa where so many Palestinians have been displaced uh since the beginning of this conflict thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
