let's explore this more with rham Jafari who's a Communications and advocacy coordinator for the occupied Palestinian territory at action a joined us now from Bethlehem at reham this is a complicated workaround isn't it uh this Maritime plan and the US Port concept what's your reaction to it h thanks for having me uh and um uh our reaction that it is uh having a sea port or delivering aid until the construction of sea port is not a solution it is um uh it is a a long uh solution that needs a lot of time needs a lot of logistics the solution there are existing land Crossing Borders and uh they have their logistical capacities that uh uh could uh allow uh humanitarian Ian Aid to enter Gaza the uh delivery of a humanitarian Aid to uh residents of Gaza needs a ceas fire needs to ensure and to secure H safety for people who are uh waiting those humanitarian aids for the safety of Aid workers and work of a humanitarian organization H so this is another sign for the failure of International Community and you as Administration to reach and achieve a full and a complete ceas fire okay so can I just jump in there I just I just want to get an idea of of what the challenges are for Distributing Aid within gazer and even if there was enough Aid getting in which is clearly not the case in any way at the moment how does Aid get around how do people get their hands on it the roads are being blown to Pieces how how does how do you trans if there was a port how would you transport the aid from the coast inland where it's needed so there is many challenges the first challenge for delivery of a is the limited quantity that allowed to to Gaza now less than 100 truck is is in is entered Gaza Gaza needs now according to the estimation in Gaza needs more than 1,000 300 trucks each day due to the increasing needs of the people this is the if we talk from a a quantity perspective we have also the destruction of the roads ER the lack of safety The Continuous pumping the communication blackout which imped the coordination between local and a organization to H coordinate for the delivery of Aid so what and lack of fuel which is needed by the a trucks and uh conv to to to work and to function to be able to deliver air to different parts of Gaza there are many challenging challenges on the ground but they can't be overcome with a ceas fire and with a half strong decision to open all Crossing Borders are surrounding Gaza I mean land Crossing Borders surrounding Gaza yeah okay now there's huge quantities of Aid outside of Gaza waiting to get in can you tell us to what degree uh the Israelis prevent it from going in what is the process how do they stop it they stop it the there's a a a deliberate uh process of hindering the humanitarian AIDS there is a long hour of inspection for the aid trucks and there is a limitation and restriction on specific items that are not allowed to inter Gaza like the oxygen cylinders and some an anesthesia the and some kind of vegetables they are under the prex of security reason so there there should be removal for all the restriction and limitation on the IDS and in terms of quantities and qualities and uh kinds and the two cross two land Crossing Borders are not enough to deliver the huge and flows of a humanitarian Aid we need more land to more land Crossing B to be open and we need there's a need for the commercial uh Crossing Borders to be able to have more flows of a humanitarian Aid entering Gaza there needs to be a greater flow reham I'm sorry I'm just dropping in there because we need to move on but we do appreciate uh your contribution to the program reham Jafari there from action a thank you thank you
