president fellow at the center of conflict and humanitarian studies and co-editor of jadala which is an online magazine he joins us now live from Montreal thank you for joining the program so what what is your reaction to these a drops uh coming from the US today well I think it's worse than useless it's the equivalent of putting a Band-Aid on a metastasizing tumor and then claiming a medical breakthrough um every Aid organization that is involved every uh serious analyst who has looked at this has indicated that there is severe hunger and malnutrition throughout the Gaza Strip that famine is imminent that children are already dying because of lack of access to food and most importantly that the only way that this can be addressed is through a massive infusion of urgently needed Aid um over land the United States which is a full partner in Israel's genocidal onslaughts on the Gaza Strip and which is a full partner in the siege of the Gaza Strip is seeking to divert attention from its role and from Israel's role and seeking to provide legitimacy to The Siege by dropping a few thousand meals ready to eat from the sky which again everyone who has looked at says this is a drop in the bucket and will make no no meaningful difference um to the overall situation in the Us's defense other countries including Qatar and Jordan have also dropped Aid into Gaza this way yes there can be no defense of the US rule in the genocidal onslaught of the Gaza Strip I'm sorry you're correct that other countries have also engage in air drops but the only reason that they're engaging in air drops is because Israel with the full and unconditional support of the United States is preventing the delivery of sufficient amounts of aid over land and I I think what the US is trying to do now is to um as others have noted legitimize The Siege and legitimize a genocide Onslaught by throwing a few packets of food from the air at the starving population I think another Factor that's worth considering here is that as with the attempt um uh to achieve a pause in this genocidal Onslaught the US appears to be very concerned by the onset of the Muslim month of Ramadan in about nine days and is very concerned that this could be a a period of heightened opposition to the US Israeli policy and is Keen to have um some kind of stability for that period again to gain legitimacy for the renewal and intensification of the on of of the onslaught and of The Siege once Ramadan ends so I think the US deserves absolutely no credit for what it's doing because you know yeah please go ahead then well there has been an increased tone of exasperation from the US uh and President Biden towards Israel but but I mean how much is that down do you think to the pressure that President Biden is under domestically I I my sense is that Biden genuinely doesn't care and if he has to sacrifice his reelection in order to stand with Israel he's fully prepared to do so others in his uh leadership and in the Democratic party are of course extremely concerned and these airdrops may be one way of uh of of addressing this um but again you know given the severity of the reality and given the direct us role in engineering this reality I think the US deserves absolutely no credit for again effect for this smoke and mirrors for this diversionary charade for as I mentioned earlier putting a Band-Aid on a metastasizing tumor and then claiming a medical breakthrough we' we've been reporting this evening that the framework for a deal that would establish a six week ceasefire in Gaza is now in place uh Israel uh agrees to this framework and now it's down to Hamas uh to tell us what you know what they make of it and apparently they will tell us tomorrow uh what is your reaction to those latest developments well I can fully understand um given the desperation of of of the Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip that any respit is a welcome respit um but if it's simply a stay of execution and if it's a and if it's a stay of execution whose primary purpose is to legitimize the renewal and the intensification of the genocidal onslaught of the Gaza Strip it will w't ultimately be meaningless and if I can just make one additional Point yes there is a desperate humanitarian Arian situation in the Gaza Strip and yes this desperate humanitarian situation needs to be immediately and urgently addressed but let's not go back to the late 1940s and 1950s and pretend that the question of Palestine is solely a humanitarian question of giving these people the basic necessities of life and that there's no underlying fundamental political issue the national rights that need to be addressed and ful filled in order for this crisis to be ultimately resolved Mo Rani good to talk to you non-resident fellow at the center of conflict and human
