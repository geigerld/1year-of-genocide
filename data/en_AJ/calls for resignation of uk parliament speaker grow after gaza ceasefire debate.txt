and a debate on whether to call for a ceasefire in Gaza brought the UK Parliament into disarray with the speaker of the house now accused of Party politics nearly 60 MPS are calling on speaker Lindsey Hoy to quit for his handling of the Parliamentary session the Scottish national party which had tabled the motion and the conservative government have both condemned him for selecting the labor party's Amendment they accused the speaker of trying to avoid internal divisions within the labor party despite his duty of impartiality well for more this let's speak to Harry forcet he's across this forest from Westminster Harry it feels like more and more MPS are piling on here what kind of pressure is the speaker under right now well it's certainly increasing pressure especially since in the last hour or so the Scottish national party officially said as a party it's the third largest party in Parliament it had no longer any confidence in lindsy Hoy so Lindsey Hoy to carry on in his position as Speaker of the House accusing him of partisan politics in favor of Labor uh during the debate uh he came to the house himself a little earlier in the day um and he apologized again uh for the decision- making on Wednesday uh but he said that it was out of concern for MP's safety uh he said he never wanted to pick up a phone and find that one of his friends on either side of the house had been murdered by terrorists to use his to ology that that follows the killing of an MP in 2021 it follows a number of death threats that a lot of MPS have been talking about and part of his calculations he is saying uh in his decision yesterday to allow the labor amendment to be voted upon was to get the broadest range of possible options for MPS to make sure that they weren't voting in some way against their conscience and opening themselves up to potential danger at their constituency offices or their homes uh the the labor leader Kia starma has also been talking he was accused by the conservative party of having lent on uh K on the speaker of the house to ensure that uh his amendment was able to be voted on to try to stem any potential Rebellion within his ranks um he denied having threatened the speaker but he did say that he had urged him to allow the amendment to be voted upon Harry can you explain for viewers what exactly was quite so controversial about his decision on Wednesday because it's it's obviously within the context of the way that the UK House Runs it is and usually when on an opposition day as it was on Wednesday an opposition day for the Scottish national party when such a party puts forward a motion usually it would be that motion and only the conservative government or the government of the day's amendment to that motion that would be voted on if that had been the case on Wednesday that would have put labor in a very difficult position because uh labor would have seen its MPS either having to vote with the Scottish national party for uh an immediate ceasefire in Gaza without any uh sort of further caveat uh about as in Labour's Amendment there was about uh Israel not being expected to be able to continue to cease fire if it did no longer faced a threat if it continued rather to face a threat from Hamas and there were very other various other caveats along those lines and so his decision to dispense with tradition and the usual running of things to allow that labor Amendment really allowed labor to uh have its own MPS vote with it and not have a potentially politically damaging uh result another one uh in the House of Commons in the runup to an election so that's why it was controversial the Scottish national party says that it wanted to have its own motion voted upon as well because it mentioned Collective punishment of Palestinians in Gaza labor accuses the Scottish national party of playing politics Itself by trying to engineere such a division and Rebellion within labor ranks so all of this has really been sort of leveraging to some extent uh at least it's being seen by many to be leveraging what's been going on in Gaza uh as part of a sort of domestic political uh game and calculation and that is why so many people have expressed such dismay at what happened on Wednesday and along with that there is this very serious question over the future uh of the speaker of the house and indeed we'll see whether he survives this Harry forcet there with all the latest for us from Westminster thank you Harry
