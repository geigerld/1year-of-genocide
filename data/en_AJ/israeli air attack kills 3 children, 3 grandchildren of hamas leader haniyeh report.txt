we begin with breaking news out of Northern Gaza and Israeli strikes have killed three sons and three grandchildren of hamas's political leader several members of is Han's family were traveling by vehicle in the alhat camp when their car was hit we'll now speak to yusri who's a journalist he's also joining us on the line from Gaza City yusri uh tell us what you know about the strike and what's happened yes uh good afternoon and uh good evening and uh um we saw a misery situation here in the Sha refugee camp while we were walk we heard an explosion and uh we didn't know what happened because it was uh close to an H was school but when we uh ran and and escaped from the explosion uh some of the our neighbors said that um an Israeli drone targeted a a vehicle or a car so I went back and I saw uh the uh the the car and many buies were uh many buies killed and someone was severely injured and after that they said that he is Muhammad the son of is and he killed after that and and one of his I think his children and two of his brother's children a girl and a boy and this what happened is close to a shop Market in the middle of the beach refugee camp so yri you can confirm then that is Han's family his children and grandchildren were in that vehicle and it was targeted by the Israelis yeah yes sure they targeted them while they were visiting their families because today is the first day of the Eid so uh the Palestinians and Muslims are visiting each other so uh children went to visit their I think uncles so the Israeli drone target while they visiting uh the family and uh and we knew them because it's a a missile of a drone it's not an F-16 um missile so we saw their faces but unfortunately their bodies were cut into pieces what what what is there to be said about the timing of this attack as you're saying it is the first day ofid it seems that because of the is leader of Hamas and about the negotiation and the refusal of Hamas of the Israeli uh negotiation or uh the bargain about what's happening right now about the uh the the the prisoners and and the kidnapped Israelis it seems that the Israeli want to send a message to and to the Hamas uh cabinet and and and and the leader office that the Israeli will Target the whole families of the Hamas leaders in North Gaza and also in South Gaza this seems right now because they are civilians and they didn't do anything they are not militant group they're not related even to Hamas they are just sons of a leader of Hamas and they were just going by their vehicle to visit their family and their uncle and that's what happened here uh Y and I wonder if you can confirm whether or not I mean this is this is not the first time that the family members of hamas's leaders have been targeted yeah before that they targeted his um cousins but uh they targeted his house because we live close to house and we saw the the destruction of his house because it was uh destroyed the whole area not only the the the the building of is s house and and also the other offices which is related to his house or to the Hamas movement but what's happening before they didn't Target his family but this is the first time they target his son before that they targeted his um uh cousins and and and other nephews maybe but it's the first time they targeted uh uh uh Muhammad and and Haim and Amir they were young and uh the oldest one of those uh young men are 33 years old okay thank you so much for that update thanks for speaking to us from Gaza uh let's bring in our correspondent Han Mahmud hany you're obviously joining us from RAF and I mean as we're hearing people in Gaza are marking this first day of Reid under uh the threat of Israeli air strikes and now this news confirmed that is hanah's family members of his family have been killed yes well we we were monitoring the situation since early hours of this morning and of course from late hours of last night when the we we witnessed a surge in the air strikes across the grip that is started in the Central Area noat including in early hours of this afternoon once again refugee camp that's a block to that was targeted relentlessly with massive air strikes and many people reported to Ala hospital at the same time the Israeli military uh was attacking eastern part of Gaza City including the densely populated neighborhoods sh Z neighborhood by constant nonstop artillery Shilling since early hours of this afternoon and what we learned so far about what happened to the sons and the grandsons of isma hania that's the political bureau chief of Hamas in Gaza they were in a car and on their way to pay a visit for their relatives because today marks the first day ofid and this is the the Traditions that Palestinians here shareed together and and do on the first day of Eid is to pay visits to their relatives and close ones and family members uh what the description we had from an eyewitness on the ground the car was targeted by at least two missiles fired from a drone and completely incinerated the car beyond recognition bodies were removed from the car and they were coming off in pieces as they were also incinerated uh beyond recognition in the car that's a three CH the three sons of SM Hanah and three of his grandchildren two boys and one girl of the of the grandchildren now the incident including the constant attacks uh starting from last night all day long is viewed largely by many people here across the grip as a a tool of pressure to dictate the course of the Peace of the ceasefire talks in Cairo and it's also a a signed by the Israeli military that there is no lit up in the attacks and the Israeli military will continue uh attacking Palestinians across the G trip including those who are associated or family members uh of of Hamas or any other Palestinian group it's also viewed as a way uh to inflect as much pain and as much uh damage on people who already suffer already traumatized by this ongoing War for the past 6 months yeah and hany I mean we uh the Hamas leader is Han has said in fact that the killing of my sons will not affect the Hamas ceasefire demands that's what we're hearing right now and he's also accused Israel of killing his sons in quote the spirit of Revenge and murder so that is what the political leader has had to say about the killing of his sons as well as his grandchildren um but um hany speaking of uh the the ceasefire um how how are people in ra at least where you are um feeling about the ceasefire talks at the same time though we understand that there is a threat of a ra ground offensive yes well to put things in Contex Palestinians have been largely drained by the uh all the Le leaked reports and the ongoing on and off talks of a potential ceasefire deal and and the fact of matter that this has been going on for quite some times and got to the point where Palestinians are ready to receive Some solid uh news about about a ceasefire not some leaked report that there is a potential uh ceasefires has been very exhausting very uh very tiring for people who are suffering on daily basis still there is a famine going on in the northern part there are signs of starvation people are still dying at the record pace and it was the hope of people that the month of Ramadan was going to be somehow peaceful and they would not want to see uh their children wrapped in white sheets and be in the hospitals with no medical attention whatsoever the Kent talks right now though they are somehow they are constructive but it's still they haven't got to the point where where people can for sure feel there is a ceasefire coming off anytime soon particularly uh the all the the rejection of from the Israeli sides on one of the major demands which is the return of displ Palestinians here in in the in overcrowded rafah City to their homes the Israeli military is still rejecting this demand and we know Hamas and other Palestinian groups on the ground they're making this as a priority because they want to see a relief of the ongoing uh trauma and ongoing suffering and misery for the 1.5 million displaced F Palestinians in overcrowded southern part of the of the trip and hany uh while I have you with us just give us an update if you might on the past few hours in Gaza City and whether there's been any strikes uh not only in Gaza City but right across the Gaza Strip and their aftermath yes well we were able to monitor this surgeon the attacks from last night when just it's the night and just hours before uh e day started where in the Israeli military uh in a massive air strike targeted a residential home in a n refugee camp killing at least 14 people mostly women and it children uh at the same time they're ongoing the constant Shilling of of eastern part of kanun is an area that has been repeatedly targeted and and based on what we heard from people who went back after the Israeli military pulled out from the area particularly Aban Zen area those are the Eastern neighborhoods of Kan Unis have been destroyed beyond recognition for a lot of people the area was unknown for them completely alien to what they used to know so far about the the city the eastern part of of Gaza City also including sh and other parts were under heavy artillery Shilling and and the fact that there are drones those are attack drones in the area just casting many fear and concern for people to go back to these to these areas including the attacks within the past uh few but in the past hour and earlier in this early hours of this afternoon okay thank you hany thank you so much hany Mahmud reporting for us from in the Gaza Strip make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
