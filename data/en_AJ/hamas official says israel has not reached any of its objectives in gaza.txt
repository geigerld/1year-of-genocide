we're going to interrupt you because we are going to a Hamas uh press conference Hamas speaker sah Haman is speaking there let's listen in or about to speak so as I mentioned there we are just waiting for Sanden the Hamas representative to begin speaking here is of course um reflecting no out on what we have seen in the last few days which is of course an extension of the ceasefire for a further two days let's listen the Alam Brigade including Ahmed alandur Abu anas member of the alasan brigades military Council and the commander of the north Brigade in the alasam Brigade as well as the Martyr Commander raan AB abdah the murder Commander AB the murder ab and with them a number of Heroes and commanders from the resistance all of this will not break our resolve and will not stop us from continuing our operations on the contrary we will ramp up our operations inside our territory and outside our territory and we have other Heroes other commanders who have carried the banner and who have continued to perform in the field as seen by the enemy and by the world and they will continue to perform with resolve with pride and they will carry the Liberation March Until the End these brigades are the institution of Liberation for the Palestine that we await uh God willing where commanders rise as martys next to their soldiers and their Fighters and other commanders advance to carry the torch our Nazi enemy has failed miserably at all levels security intelligence and Military including the political and the media level before our people's resolve for our people uh deserve all the credit in this accomplishment and before the heroism of our resistance our enemy failed to accomplish any of their objectives and our enemy Rec recently admitted the number of soldiers that fell and were injured in the ground operation however that recognition falls short of the horrific truth that our enemy hesitates to reveal to the terrified internal front this recognition only includes a very small part of our enemy losses which will continue to grow in coming days based on the information of the occupation Army the soldiers who were injured in this ground operation number approximately 1,000 including over 200 injured soldiers who were Gravely injur injured including as well as 300 with uh intermediate injuries While others were lightly injured until now the soldiers of the defeated Israeli Army have not set foot on 80% of our the Gaza territory and they will not do that God willing as for the threats coming from Israeli leaders to continue the war after the uh end of the truths we look at these threats as empty threats destined for domestic consumption they know what they are facing and they know that what's coming is even bigger our people and our resistance will continue along the path of self-defense and the path of defend their territory defending their Jerusalem and defending their captives until such time as our Nazi enemy is defeated and forced to leave our territory among the captives who were released was one of the daughters of one of the settlers who by the way is an Irish citizen who came from Ireland to usurp our lands and our rights Thomas Thomas Hansen occupation authorities claimed and informed Thomas that that his daughter had been murdered by the alasam brigades this is the information that he was offered and he went on national television and started lying this settler who went on national television and was in tears on October 7th saying that he was relieved that his daughter was killed instead of her falling into the hands of Hamas and here you can see his picture actually added after hearing the lies of the occupation authorities adding you don't know what they do to them there he kept on describing all the torture and all the suffering that is inflicted upon captives in Gaza based on what he said however yesterday came the surprise because Emily was released and there was a great evidence of the good treatment that was received by the captives and in light of that we tell them we tell him and all those who believed nanyu do not think that we are similar to your government and to your to your military that mistreats captives in its prisons it is now time for the entire world to know the depth and breadth of your lies the brigades made sure to deliver captives all over the Gaza Strip in the North in the South and in the heart of Gaza City and this goes to show once again that the claims of the occupation Army were false and I'm talking about the claims of control over part of the Gaza territory the manner in which the captives were freed is a message to all those who are concerned that the resistance is continuing down the path and as a testament to that we ensured to free the prisoners near um this statue where we have a hand bearing dog tags of Two Soldiers that were C captured in 2014 Hadar golden and shaon arol they were captured in 2014 and today the occupation was forced to collect its prisoners next to this hand here the 4day truce secured the release of 150 Palestinian prisoners including women young men and children and this is a national accomplishment the uh released uh prisoners included people from all over the territory from Gaza from the West Bank from Jerusalem and the 1948 territories and this is only a Prelude to the promise we've made to all of our detainees that are still languishing in Israeli prisons and the more important message that everyone must be aware of is that the occupation only understands the language of force this is the only language that the occupation deals with and if the resistance didn't have any captives the OCC ation would not have released our women of and children some of whom have spent long years in occupation prisons and if we didn't have people who were captured by the occupation we would not have had to uh take people captive and force them into a swap and here I would like to remind you that there are prisoners in Israeli prisons who were supposed to be released based on the Oslo Accord however they were not released for a number of years because we could not speak the language anguage of force this release and this continuing battle goes to confirm once again that we are a United people in Gaza and the West Bank we are forcing the enemy to accept our own terms knowing that very few people of Gaza are actually captured by the Israelis while the majority of Palestinian captives come from the West Bank and here we would like to reiterate that we will remain Resolute in our land and will continue to defend our land despite the shear destruction and the ethnic cleansing and the genocide that we are going through our resistance will continue to defend our people and their aspirations for Liberation and return and our position will remain steadfast and unwavering in rejecting all plans seeking to find solution or imposing suspicious agendas that are outside the will of the Palestinian people and the Palestinian resistance and we warn of any attempt to deal with such efforts because this will only represent an act treason second given the destruction that was inflicted by the occupation and the lack of basic necessities in the Gaza Strip since the beginning of the war of aggression against the Gaza Strip and for a period of 50 days the Nazi occupation dropped over 40,000 tons of explosives on the territory of Gaza and on the houses of unarmed civilians they bombed us from the air from the sea and from land and they used all manner of missiles and internationally internationally prohibited ordinance they destroyed all aspects of human life in the Gaza STP and they waged genocide against our people and our property in order to further their Nazi and Colonial goals and to make the um land of Gaza uninhabitable and this is one goal that will never be accomplished we highly appreciate the visit of all official delegations that came into the Gaza Strip namely the delegation of the state of Qatar represented by Mrs lulwa Al minister of State for international collaboration I would also like to thank all the delegations representing charity organizations humanitarian organizations and medical organizations that entered the Gaza Strip recently and here we once again call upon the leaders of our Arab and Islamic Nation to translate the resolutions that were made at the uh most recent Arab Summit in Riyad in order to put an end to the aggression and to patch the wounds of our people in Gaza and put an end to the siege despite the increase in the number of trucks carrying humanitarian Aid that entered the Gaza Strip we once again reaffirm that they are not enough to meet the basic needs of the people of the strip and therefore we call for increasing the number of trucks entering the strip on daily basis in order to fulfill the dire humanitarian needs all over the strip and given the fact that hospitals are now out of service and given the rise in the number of wounded and injured people and patients we call upon the Arab and Islamic Nations we call upon the nations of the world we call upon International Medical organizations to send more field hospitals with various Medical Specialties and contribute to the evacuation of the wounded and receiving them abroad in order to receive treatment treatment given the sheer size of Destruction and the large number of bodies under the destroyed buildings and given the limited capabilities of civil defense in the Gaza Strip which was targeted by intense shelling and bombardment over 50 days we call upon the nations of the world to send civil defense teams equipped with specialized equipment in order to clear the rubble and recover the bodies of the Martyr and here we would like to express our refusal to what was mentioned in the initial report by Human Rights Watch pertaining to the Zionist aggression against hospitals in the Gaza Strip particularly the Baptist hospital and we would like to reaffirm that this report attempts to sell The Narrative of the occupation Army without relying on any evidence from the location but they use circumstantial terms such as maybe or perhaps the report does not also rely on eyewitnesses or the reports that were submitted by concerned authorities and we call for this report to be pulled and we call for the establishment of an international inquiry committee to investigate this crime that was committed by the occupation Army we also upon journalists and international media organizations to visit the Gaza Strip to take a closer look at the sheer size of the crime and the sheer size of the genocide that was waged by the Nazi occupation Army against children unarmed civilians and against our infrastructure and in this context we call upon Mr Elon Musk who visited the occupation a few days ago and we invite him to visit the Gaza Strip we invite him to visit the Gaza Strip to take a closer look at the massacres and the crimes that were committed against our people just in order for him to remain objective to remain credible and to avoid any bias or double standards in dealing with the cause of our people and their legitimate rights third as far as the liberated detain are concerned and the crimes of the occupation against them the testimonies provided by 150 liberated Palestinian captives have revealed the truth and the brutality of the crimes that have been waged and continue to be waged against them and against our detainees and in the occupation prisons and here we have a child giving a were you offered treatment nothing I was not offered anything who gave you this the Red Cross just now yes just now my finger was broken and my arm was broken when did they hit you one week so this is a child who prior to his release was attacked and assaulted even though he had been assaulted a week ago and that assault led to his arm being broken so this is how the occupation Army deals with uh our detes on the flip side the whole world saw how alasan brigades treated the uh the tenes that were in our custody including women and children and this shows the moral fiber that we have and the moral fiber that the is Nazi occupation Army lacks and here you can see the footage depicting the manner and the condition in which the detain were released and look how they are walking next to the uh alasam combatants even without any anxiety without any suffering because they received an excellent treatment from our combatants our people took to the streets in the West Bank and Jerusalem to welcome the liberated detes and to express their support for the resistance and this is yet another Testament of the support that our resistance enjoys as the main force that will provide Liberation and return the Israeli occupation continues to carry out violations and crimes that only demonstrate the fear of the occupation from our resistance and from our people and unfortunately we are not hearing a sound out of humanitarian organizations and institutions the occupation used all means to conceal the reality of their detainees that was released as part part of the prisoner swap and over the last few days there were a number of desperate attempts to conceal the humanit the Humane treatment that they received while being uh detained by alasam because that truth actually exposes the Zionist narrative however one female detane actually sent a letter to alasan brigades in which she expressed her thanks and her gratitude and here you can see the letter she wrote in her own handwriting in Hebrew so in that letter she expressed her thanks and gratitude to these men and she said I thank you from the bottom of my heart for the humanity you showed to my daughter Amilia she said that she felt that you were all her friends and not just her friends but actually loved ones in this long road all the people whom we met treated her gently treated her lovingly and I will always remember this Humane treatment despite the tough situation that you were dealing with and the tough losses that were inflicted upon you in Gaza and here we reaffirm that the lies being spread by us officials and a number of Western countries as well as us and Western media will only helped spread hate and instability all over the world and these politicians are the only ones responsible for these lies and for the consequences of these lies last of which is the attack on three Palestinian young men in Vermont the United States US President Joe Biden behind closed doors in a meeting with a number of and Muslim leaders actually admitted the mistake he made in contributing to the killing of thousands of Palestinians and this is a step in the right direction that the US Administration must learn from so this is what President Biden said I'm sorry I'm disappointed in myself however President Biden's apology you're watching Al jaer that's the tail end of a press briefing by assama hamon he's representative from Hamas uh unfortunately we lost the first few minutes of that but he was saying a prayer at the beginning of that press conference um a lot to unpack there clearly a lot of competing narratives between hamas's view of this conflict and what the Israelis are saying it is interesting on a day in which Israel has made public the number of its soldiers that have died in the conflict that amas feels the need to also reflect on its losses too saying it would if necessary ramp up the operations saying that we have other Heroes and commanders his words ready to carry on the to torch also said that at least 80% of the territory of Gaza was yet to be stepped on by Israel and when it comes to Israeli uh claims that it would be ready to resume the fighting in Gaza its campaign in Gaza at the end of this ongoing ceasefire he said well those threats were empty threats for domestic consumption again contesting claims that captives have been treated badly in Gaza instead accusing Israel of treating Palestinians badly in its jails and once again reiterating that current aid supplies were nowhere near enough Asama hamen a mass representative there
