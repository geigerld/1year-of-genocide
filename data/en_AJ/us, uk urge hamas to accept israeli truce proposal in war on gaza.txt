US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin hoping for more than just a deal between Hamas and Israel eager to restart stall ceasefire talks he says Hamas should accept a new Israeli proposal Hamas has before a proposal that is extraordinarily extraordinarily generous uh on the part of Israel and In This Moment the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas they have to decide and they have to decide quickly Hamas dismisses accusations it's delaying a ceasefire deal the group that controls Gaza blames the Israeli Prime Minister for putting his own political survival ahead of a lasting agreement and mediators Qatar and Egypt are continuing to explore chances for a new one but are becoming increasingly frustrated Qatar prime minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs says the biggest obstacle to Lasting peace is the failure of the International Community to solve the Palestinian Israeli conflict a lot of efforts must be exerted to sort out the military escalation for the sake of all countries in our region we need to bring peace to the Middle East the International Community has failed to find a solution to the Palestinian cause thus we now see the Bloodshed everywhere and every day in the Gaza strike us officials have been trying to build consensus for a postwar Gaza they initially said they want to see a new Palestinian Authority take over and when President Mahmud Abbas appointed a new prime minister Hamas rejected the move as a betrayal and there's another reason why the US wants a deal soon the Americans believe a long-term political solution to the Palestinian Israel conflict could encourage Saudi Arabia and many Arab Nations to establish diplomatic ties with Israel Hashim Al jaaz let's get more from this from our correspondent in occupied East ju and Bernard Smith is standing by for us and that news emerging of what a deal might look like from the Israeli side certainly being talked up by the US Bernard yes it is we've heard there in hashim's report Anthony linkoln describing this as an extraordinarily generous proposal we're now waiting to see if the Israelis travel on Tuesday to Ciro that's they're ready to do that they say if Hamas is accepting the principles of their of this latest proposal and if there's something for them to continue talking about sources are saying that now Israel is willing to take perhaps something a bit less than 40 of the 133 captives still believe to be being held in Gaza and in return for that they're offering an initial period of a ceasefire and then something called they call a period of sustained calm and in return the Israelis uh well Palestinians will also get the release of um a lot of Palestinian prisoners David Cameron Britain's foreign minister actually said it could ultimately be potentially thousands of Palestinian prisoners so we're waiting to see if Hamas accepts the proposals that uh that Israel has offered if any we had the the the joy of foresight uh Bernard because there are always stumbling blocks aren't there it's never easy to negotiate these sorts of things what sort of things could be or could hamper you might say the conversations that might happen in Cairo well it's how close the two sides get together on their differing demands Hamas has always in previous talks been demanding a complete end to the fighting a withdrawal of his troops so that Palestinians can return to their homes particularly in the north of Gaza so it depends how this wording of a period of sustained calm that Israel is offering is interpreted by Hamas and it also M depends whether Benjamin Netanyahu can politically get away with this one of his major calculations as many of his critics will say is whether he can survive politically so he's obviously have having to consider whe he can whether he can survive this offer politically we already know the far right in Israel wants him to go ahead with an operation in Rafa he is clear if there is any sort of ceasefire or pause in fighting that operation in Rafa will inevitably get paused Netanyahu calculating that he can perhaps get away with that and still survive politically Berard thanks very much for the update there coming in from occupied East Jerusalem of course we'll monitor events with Bernard through the evening joining us now on the telephone is assama hamdan he spokesperson for hamas's political Bureau joins us now Mr hamon thank you for joining us on Al jazer can we just confirm where is the Hamas delegation right now are they in Cairo or not and have the talks begun with Egyptian uh Egyptian mediators well thank you for having me um I can confirm that ham Del they have already arrived in kir and I think now they have started the the talks of the Egyptian mediators and the concentration on those negotiations talks is about to understand the real position of the Israeli side especially what it was the paper which was introduced to Hamas contained some uh undefined issues which we need to know exactly what was the meaning of from the Israeli side okay what are your demands then right now because because the ground realities seem to change day by day well Hamas position is very clear we are talking about five issues we have to solve it together a complete uh stop for the Israeli fight against Gazza the with second a complete withdrawal and the third one the return of the people to their homes the fourth one the construction construction of Gaza and the fifth one a fair exchange for prisoners it's clear from the Israeli paper that they are still insisting on two major issues they don't want a complete ceasefire and they are not talking in a serious way about the withdrawal from Gaza in fact they are still talking about their presence and the valley of GZA which means that they will keep continuing cutting GZA in two pieces uh we have a serious questions for the mediators if there was positive answers I think we can move forward the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin says the deal has been offered it's incredibly generous as far as the Israelis are concerned you won't really know how generous that is will you until your negotiating side has a chance to read the fine print well I I I I I can't understand how he's talking about this so far are as seriously generous he is a mediator he's he's a supposed mediator and he's supposed to be fair for both sides in fact the ideas which was introduced by the Israelis is not complete ideas uh I think he is doing such a propaganda in order to push the things forward especially he was talking to uh Arab uh leaders and he understands that all Arabs are willing to have a ceas fire and to stop the Israeli attack on GZA so he's using those words to show that there is something serious in fact without a complete withdrawal and without a real ceas fire there is nothing to happen the second Point stopping the attack against the Palestinians is not something generous the the attack itself is a crime so when you stop a you can't CL claim that it's a general action from the Israeli side they have to stop that in fact the United States has to make real efforts to stop that not providing Israel with uh 26 billion US Dollars 18 of them is for the military supporting the killing of the Palestinians in gazra we saw Gulf leaders in Riyad today uh issue a very strong statement to the us that they wanted to see a ceasefire they wanted to see a negotiated peace yet gazans are suffering famine and that's being recorded and reported in the general populace are you and the fighters of Hamas willing to continue to fight despite the hardships facing many thousands well in fact if there was a ceasefire and there was an international will to make an end for the occupation Hamas will receive that in a very positive way our aim as Palestinians our men goal is to liberate our lands if that happened by the pressure of the International Community and there was an end for the occupation Hamas will welcome that for sure Asama Haman senior spokesperson for hamas's political Bureau thanks for joining us make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaaz
