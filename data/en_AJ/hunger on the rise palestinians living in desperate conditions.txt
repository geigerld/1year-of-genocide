now Israel has reduced large parts of Gaza to rubble and there are serious questions about where people from Rafa will be evacuated to and what Israel's plan is most areas are uninhabitable recent satellite footage shows extensive damage to the infrastructure in the strip since the start of Israel's war 79,000 housing units are completely destroyed and another 290,000 structures have been damaged only six out of 36 hospitals are still functioning in Gaza under difficult conditions making it hard for Palestinians to access basic healthare well in the north of Gaza people are living in Desperate conditions they're running out of food and basic necessities alas Al Sharif reports from Gaza people are getting hungry in Gaza as Food Supplies run short as conditions grow worse many are struggling to survive we are experiencing great suffering our house was bombed we live in the shelters we are 15 people living in tents we're drenched in rain and sewage we have no food whatsoever the Children Cry day and night because they are hungry there's nothing except Shing and bombardment and hunger my children cry because they are hungry we did not receive any humanitarian Aid the children in Gaza don't get any humanitarian a the children of North Gaza are dying of hunger there is no milk for them there is no sugar for them there is no rice for them there is no flour for them hunger is killing us I ate only little pieces of bread today we are reduced to eating grass the water is polluted this is not fair this is Injustice either kill us all or give us a proper chance to live the suffering increases here in North Gaza as Israeli forces prevent entry of basic necessities obtaining food has become a dream for hundreds of thousands of families okay well let's speak to Nadia Hardman who is a researcher in the refugee and migrants rights division of Human Rights Watch many thanks for joining us so we are on the verge of another defining moment in this conflict one Benjamin Netanyahu says will assure total Victory but at the cost of 1.4 million civilians who are crammed into that tiny corner of Gaza Rafa what are your fears of this significant moment um I mean we are deeply alarmed Disturbed that Netanyahu is planning to evacuate um this area in Rafa um as you consistently remind you reminded your viewers this is an area where the majority of gaza's population is Sheltering including over 1.7 million displaced Palestinians the conditions are desperate um people are struggling to survive and overcrowded um flimsy tents and apartment buildings and many have been displaced multiple times I've spoken to people who've been displaced up to 10 times um when I ask them about their fears going forward they are desperately uh fearful of a potential ground Invasion and the one question they continue to ask me is where do we go um they have fled from areas that were once considered safe and I think it Bears reminding that the majority of the Gaza Strip is under evacuation orders Israel promised to provide safe passage must be analyzed in light of the fact that it has consistently failed to do this throughout the conflict I've spoken to people who've been targeted in their homes um before they received warnings to flee only to go to areas which were declared safe um and then that change from one day to the next uh this evacuation would be unlawful if it is ordered well I mean you clearly state that this would be an unlawful move for Netanyahu nevertheless he has appeared on two at least two US networks trying to justify this assault on Rafa saying that he would guarantee the movement of civilians North to allow Israeli forces to move on the city firstly how would that suggestion work in practice given the level of Destruction in areas that people are being told to go to exactly I mean large parts of haa simply been reduced to Rubble um the logistic um idea of of transferring so many people um to so-called safe areas as I said before nowhere is considered safe is just unimaginable um I mean this this evacuation order could spell catastrophic consequences and we cannot stress enough that we may see unprecedented levels of killings um even for this conflict uh it may spell Bloodshed just because people cannot access anywhere that is safe and other areas are continuously um experiencing airri air stri and bombardments and that's not to mention the humanitarian situation we may see blocking of Aid how is Aid meant to be coordinated under such a a massive displacement crisis I wanted to talk about something else that um Palestinians have been drawing the world's attention to in recent weeks and these are uh apparent evidence of execution style killings particularly in the north of Gaza there have been reports of another Mass grave um found um signs of extrajudicial killings taking place there of course one day this war will be over but what do these discoveries say about the kind of war waged in Gaza to date I mean it is a a brutal conflict and um these extrajudicial killings must be investigated as war crimes um we continue to document the the most horrifying um situations and I think this this proves again um that we must see accountability for uh such um terrible terrible things when it comes precisely to accountability the ruling at the icj the international court of justice the world's top Court urging Israel to cease acts of possible genocide resolution after resolution has been broken at the uh un Security Council how do we make sure that eventually accountability is something that we see that Justice is seen I mean I think the one thing we can just continue to remind the International Community to use their leverage to prevent atrocities from happening um I mean what I said before that this will be unlawful this may amount to the war crime of force displacement and you know the this uh this conflict has been live streamed into people's rooms um International leaders can see exactly what is going on and it must use all its power especially uh in in light of this impending disaster in Rafa um to to pressure Israel to reverse this course IIA Hardman researcher in the refugee immigrants rights division of Human Rights Watch so many thanks for joining us on Al thank you very much
