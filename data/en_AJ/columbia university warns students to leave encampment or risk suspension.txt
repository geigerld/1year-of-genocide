student protesters at Columbia University have been given an ultimatum leave or face suspension they were given a 2 pm. deadline which is now just passed hundreds of students have been arrested at universities across the United States as protests grow over Israel's war on Gaza they're demanding educational institutions divesting companies they say are complicit in genocide while we have teams of correspondents covering the protests in the US Phil is at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge Shia britans will have the latest from George Washington University in the US capital Christen salumi is at Yale University Heidi Joe Castro is at Texas University in Austin but first let's speak to Teresa B she joins us now live from Columbia University in New York where it all began and the deadline has come and gone what are you [Music] seeing well we have just been allowed in inside the campus we were waiting for hours outside and media are being allowed inside the campus for 2 hours each day I'm not sure if you can see right behind me that's where the encampment currently is there's hundreds of students that are there right now they say they want to shed light on what is happening in Gaza they want University this University to stop its Investments on companies that are profiting from the war in Gaza they say that they will remain there we're going to have to see there's an escalating situation we've been seeing lots of police uh coming uh towards University outside we do not know whether there's going to be an attempt to remove the students here by force that's what many of the students are fearing we're hearing that they've been given some piece of paper that they have to sign in that paper it says that they need to identify themselves sign that paper so that they can end this semester in peace however we're just hearing also from them that they're saying that Colombia University is fabricating a state of emergency to suspend expel and evict hundreds of students so you can hear them singing and chanting right behind me we heard a statement from the president of Colombia University earlier today she says that the university is trying to solve this problem peacefully she says that they're trying to guarantee freedom of expression that is extremely important in this country but at the same time allow the Jewish students in this University to feel safe she also says that the university won't divest from Israel that they're willing to hear proposals from the students about what to do with University investment however they're saying that at this point that is not something that is going to happen it's important what is happening here right now because many of the students are saying that this is an act what they're doing here right now is an act of Civil Disobedience there's a long tradition in US campuses and universities of them taking to the streets taking to universities such as this ones to express themselves back from the 1970s during the Vietnam War what people here are saying that this time is time to shed light on the killings on the displacement and on the hunger that is going on in Gaza we'll continue to follow what goes on at Columbia as we also see those aerial shots with you Theresa Bo there for us live in New York Let's cross over to Christen salumi who's at Yale University in New Haven Connecticut with more there obviously very large demonstration going on in New York what's it like where you are very similar situation here in New Haven Connecticut the home of Yale University where students are also demanding that their University administrators disclose their investments in Israel and divest from them specifically here they've called for divestment from weapons manufacturers who may be benefiting from the war on Gaza and already the university here denied that request it did so on April 17th that was shortly after the encampment which maybe you can see behind me in the distance here this is as close as they'll let us get with the camera uh that was first set up in solidarity with the Colombia demonstration uh at another location on campus the university moved in after 3 days uh to clear out the students they arrested about 44 of them uh but yesterday they came back they came back out there was a March in the city here of about a thousand people and I'm told about 250 of the demonstrators uh the student demonstrators anyways came back here to Yale to reestablish this encampment and much like the situation at Colombia they too are facing threats of uh possible arrest and suspension the university saying that the students are violating policies that are meant to uh uh policies as to who can set up on campus and what can be done on campus things like using loudspeakers and so on although what we've seen here today has been pretty quiet and pretty calm and they aren't blocking any of the buildings or the entrances nevertheless the university has said that they are in violation of school policies and uh they are risking rearrest arrest by being here and possible suspension yeah it's interesting to see what's going on in the different areas and different campuses around the country Kristen salumi there at Yale University in Connecticut thank you uh let's cross over to shab ransi who's at George Washington University in DC interesting to see the fact that what Theresa Bo is saying in New York the police may very well uh arrive in much larger numbers uh where she is in the coming minutes or hours sheab acquired a protest where Christen was but also the threat there of police coming uh to break up the demonstration the police where you are have been very careful about how they've behaved in the US capital and that's that's the bizarre thing s SEL that it's the university administrators who are the ones who supposed to you know be wanting freedom of speech and thought and critical engagement with the issues of the day who are begging the police to come in here and arrest and drag away these students and the police are saying no they don't want to because they don't want the the Optics of of of of frankly assaulting peaceful protesters there really is an infrastructure now that's been put down here with water and food and librar and now we have this rather unwitting art installation behind us and maybe Quinn one of the the protest organizers perhaps you could explain to us what this this amazing the symbolic barrier display is all about yeah so uh these barriers they were used to keep us in um they put them along this uh horizontal brick pathway here and they put us they put it along the front there uh they had us kettled in they cut off our bathroom access um food and water it was all brought in from outside they didn't provide any of it um actually in an email they they said that that was like a positive that they were allowing access to food and water which is uh strikingly similar to how the Israelis are are messaging their their war in Gaza but um or their genocide in Gaza but um so when when these barriers were broken down last night we uh decided to take them all into a big pile and uh put it in the center of the camp uh sort of as a message of um like why we're here and what we're doing uh I think it's important that everyone fights against occupation which is exactly what the people in in Gaza are doing and that's exactly what we did here yeah it is striking that suddenly people who are pro Israeli are against settlements given that's uh part of the the way they run things in the occupied territories but why do you think the university authorities are acting in such a or attempting to act in such a vindictive vindictive manner to the protesters um yeah I think that uh the only real parallel to this at least in America is uh 1968 with the Vietnam War um Israel specifically has functioned as an extension of American imperialism since 1967 generally 1973 specifically is when America really became the uh dominant superpower making those decisions and um one of our demands is to end academic ties with the Zionist institutions and so they don't want to do that it gives them it's important to remember that these tactics are not used um specifically because it works against Palestinians they're used specifically because they work and uh they've simply been been forged in in Gaza over the last 70 80 years we we're hearing such sort of rational discussion about the occupation and what the Israelis are doing in Gaza and yet you're being presented in certainly the Western media as a bunch of crazy anti-semitic radicals I mean are you any of those things I mean um no absolutely not um we've had some some provocateurs maybe they were counter protesters trying to trying to do like a false flag type thing or maybe they would just were lost and and frankly quite stupid but we've had anti-semitic messages and things show up nearby they've never been in the encampment uh they've never even been on uh this H Street in front of us here uh they were quickly escorted out and and it was made very clear they weren't welcome uh so no no one here Harbors any sort of anti-Semitism or anything like that is there any dialogue with University authorities underway right now um I am not I can't comment on that um when I say I'm not aware of that I mean I personally am not aware of that not that there were no uh negotiations I've just I'm not clued in all right Quin thank thank you very much yeah so still authorities do threaten the students W with removal but the police are saying they're not going to go in because this is actually a peaceful expression of students first amendment constitutional rights we'll see how long that lasts though indeed we will Let's cross over to Phil lval he's live for us at MIT in Cambridge Massachusetts and Phil it has to be said where even where you are uh there has been or have been signs of Confrontation and Prov provocation as well yeah absolutely and we just had a few more developments in the last few minutes I'm not just going to tell you we're going to show you so we're going to zoom in you might be able to see in the distance over there the Israeli flag which is flying next to a US flag that has just popped up and this is what could be team the kind of official counter-protest it's across the pathway for context from the en cment that has been set up by those uh students who've had that encampment there for a week we're zooming in because we're not allowed to be on premises MIT is private property to be made being made very clear that journalists with cameras have to stay away which is why we're reporting from outside but that is very different to what we saw just over an hour ago where there was a what you might describe was a popup counter protest where almost from nowhere 30 to 40 uh Israeli supporting students faculty members appeared from nowhere with Israeli flag straped over them American flags they were singing songs about Zionism they were waving uh banners showing pictures of some of the hostages taken on October 7th and they marched right into the heart of that encampment they sat down they started singing they were having a picnic they at one point started walking through the encampment when the protesters were ignoring them uh waving these pictures in their faces uh one of the protesters who's been there for a week said you know this is a real provocation but we are ignoring them because they've done this before and after maybe half an hour ago they walked off and they left but I'm going to bring my my guest here now this is David from MIT MIT Jews for peace what did you make of what we saw an hour ago yeah I mean like you said we're we're not really engaging with them we feel very resolved in and and why we're here and why we've been here for over a week uh we are here to demand MIT uh cut direct research with the Israeli Ministry of Defense these are these are projects like autonomous drone swarms which uh directly uh directly tied to the death of of the the tens of thousands of gin that we're seeing uh there's persistent underwater surveillance these are just some of the research uh projects that are the that MIT does with the Israeli Ministry defense and so we don't pay them any mind we're very resolved in what we're doing here but do they do they have any impact on on your negotiations because it's not you know it's not helpful is it when that you're trying to negotiate with the university and these things happen yeah I mean so I I'm not within the negotiation so I'm not exactly sure but we're we're not here to escalate with with other students staff faculty at MIT we're here to talk about the research that we do at MIT we all grow up uh and are told that we can do research for good for for ethical for ethical means and and what MIT does in their research with the Israeli Ministry of defense is not for ethical means how long do you think this en CA will be here how long do you plan to protest because it's becoming increasingly OB increasingly obvious that the president is trying to shut this down now yeah I mean we'll see we're we're going to be here until we can have a good faith negotiation with MIT and and and talk about the the research that we do with the Israeli Ministry of Defense we'll be here until we can have those good faith discussions David thanks very much got to draw your attention to a few other things that are happening around town as well because we're not just having protests here at MIT we've got Harvard University a few miles away where there is another protest that is behind locked Gates you're not allowed on site unless you have a Harvard pass but the chief of police there has said he is not going to arrest protesters just for protesting even if the university asks him he says they have to be violent or they have to be causing damage to property although the university is threatening to with some protesters now to withhold their degrees if they do not stop and then we've got TFT University where they've been told that at some point today there will be attempts made to stop their protest whether that means the police move in or negotiations Advance we don't know but we're watching that one very closely s Hal thank you uh Phil of for us at MIT in Cambridge Massachusetts thank you let's cross over the other side of the country now and to Austin in Texas where at the University of Texas Heidi Joe Castro is standing by and Heidi uh obviously where you are the university saw one of the you might say most violent police responses that we've seen in these past few days it must have left an indelible mark on many people that witnessed what happened that's right so H you know this is where we saw the police on mounted horses pushing down protesters last week and it had been very quiet here on campus until just about half an hour ago when suddenly this encampment sprung up behind me you're seeing some are UTS and students other are community members or other Advocate groups that have now come on to campus and erected tents that's behind the circle of chanters now and they're doing this uh at the risk of the a repeat of those images from last week which I me mention that violent Crackdown on protesters I want to bring in one of the protests here this is Lea Deca I understand you're from Austin and you came here to make this happen to join this why is that I actually came to support the students and we didn't know this was happening so it's kind of like an impromptu action why it's happening because there's been a genocide ongoing for over 6 months and whether you're Palestinian American like myself or Palestinian without the American whether you are black Jewish African um Hispanic it doesn't matter this is not okay and we want it to stop and the universities play play a huge part in this I saw there were police officers standing around when this sort of erupted a half an hour ago are there fears that there may be another rather harsh Crackdown uh fears as in anticipation perhaps fear as in fear of them doing something to the students no because we're here to protect our students I'm a parent I'm here for our students safety because what they did on Wednesday they will not repeat and there's administrative staff right there and he heard the same from me so okay and we do know that the University president is facing a call for a no confidence vote there's been a group of Faculty members I believe now more than 540 who have signed a letter calling for that why should that happen in your eyes he has blundered one time after another and he's made very bad decisions and choices and it's time to switch this Administration up with somebody who's actually composite and actually cares for all students equally and finally I want to ask you about the accusations of anti-Semitism Texas's Governor has said that the students participating are anti-semitic and he used that to justify the response can you respond to that um I'm Palestinian the daughter of Palestinians who cannot go back to Palestine and live there they can only go visit I'm telling you Governor Abbott you're the anti-ema we live with Jews for many many years we have relatives who are Jews we have friends who are Jewish we're not anti-semitic the only semi anti-Semitism that's coming up is from zionists and the governor because you don't have to be Jewish to be Zionist unfortunately and so we've got all kinds and so yeah we we completely reject the idea or the notion or the accusation that there is anti-Semitism on this campus thank you very much Leila uh and there's signs here that are trying to deny that accusation says anti-Semitism isn't the same as Zionism that's a repeated phrase we've been hearing here so hail but yes it's a tense situation we're not exactly sure what's going to happen in the next few minutes but again protesters University Administration police they're all on site now we'll see how much longer this happens this lasts indeed we'll monitor events with you Heidi in Texas and with all of our correspondents at University campuses across the US in the coming hours thank you make sure to subscribe to our channnel to get the latest news from Al jazer
