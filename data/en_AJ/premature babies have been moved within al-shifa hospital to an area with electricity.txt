dozens of premature babies in gaza's largest hospital have been given just a few more hours to live they've been transferred within the alifa facility to an area where electricity is still available but they're not in incubators because oxygen supplies have run out all hospitals in Gaza City are out of service only able to offer basic first aid the two largest are surrounded by Israeli forces and have been repeatedly attacked let's get the very latest with hany mmud who is live for us in hunis on the southern part of the Gaza Strip hany good to see you there have been more overnight strikes on the North and the South of the Gaza Strip can you bring us up to date yes well air strikes continue to destroy more homes more residential homes and more residential blocks destroying more of the public facilities and and and properties for people in the southern part and in in the Central and Gaza City and the north uh just overnight strikes targeted the city of khun the Eastern line of City KH Unis killing uh more than 10 people and destroying more of residential homes uh the worst of those air strikes of of late of early evening hours of of yesterday was in jabalia refugee camp um near near a very populated densely populated neighborhood that uh houses an inner mural Center Sport Center for uh for the community right there was completely destroyed uh and the vicinity of the area was also uh destroyed and severely damaged killing 31 uh people right right away right after uh the air strike with so many people are still uh under under the rebels in Gaza City and around the vicinity of Ali Baptist Hospital a fire belt was created in that area destroying much of the infrastructure and all the roads leading to the hospital and leaving the hospital in a complete blackout at its solar solar panel and solar power system was completely destroyed and the hospital uh it was already running on a very low capacity in terms of the service provide in terms of the uh the power capacity it has but now without those solar panels the hospital been reduced to uh less than a a a 5% of its its operations um but the the these whole thing are happening while at the same time people are still stranded in Gaza and and more of them are coming to the southern part but they're equally equally in danger equally at risk of during of of losing their life as air strike uh indiscriminately targeting every corner of the Gaza Strip from the city of Bon in the north all the way to RAF City in the southern part an area that is supposed to be safe but not uh as as these Relentless air strike continue uh to fall on them and Hy can you tell us a bit more about the condition of the people who are in the South those who have managed to evacuate from northern Gaza we hear millions of people there displaced living in in tiny little camps uh lack of water and food how are they surviving well the the situations in in the southern part this is at least where we at and we we witness it on on daily basis we see that the desperate needs of people who evacuated to the hospital or to honor what designated uh shelters uh uh there is a depletion of everything of of basic needs of of water of a bread of basic survival items and for example if we take uh hona school as an example as evacuation Center these are schools they are not they're not designed they're not meant to be shelters uh to uh accommodate people in times of War so if we think of the sanitation system of the of the hygiene facilities inside they are designed for students just to run couple hours a day for school for students and their time of school and that's it but when you end up with thousand of people in inside these uh inside these schools we're talking about three four families in every classroom that's a total of 50 and sometimes 70 people inside one classroom and and just run that on the the the rest of the of of the school you end up with thousand of people in such a small area there already reports from the hospital about the spread of infectious disease and and here atas hospital to start seeing a new trend of those disease as people uh are inside these schools they don't have a proper sanitation uh system they don't have or not they don't have because whatever left of the of the hygiene facilities have been completely uh damaged there is no access to to clean drinking uh water as most of the water they drink is contaminated in addition the the the shortage of medical supplies and you get sick you're likely to depends on your immun immune system because there is no medicine available uh whatsoever so the the situations are are very difficult and now people are are are fighting at two fronts it's just the war that is Raging in Gaza and the North and the air strikes continue to pound him but at the same time there is a new war going on which is the healthy crisis inside these schools as people are trying to stay as as healthy as they can despite the fact there is shortage of everything no food no water uh uh no medicine no survival items it's very difficult at all level at this point thank you so much for that update Han Mahmud reporting for us there from kanun inside the Gaza Strip
