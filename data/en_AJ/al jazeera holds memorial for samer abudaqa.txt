is a critical moment to all the gazans here we cannot say what today in the face of death in the face of blood in the face of blood bath we cannot put our feelings towards on this solemn moment this saddening moment this painful moment as we remember our fallen colleague the cameraman Sam abua whose blood has not dried on this V this is his vest we are joining our voices to yours we are here to express our rejection yet we cannot express our sadness we have lost many dear beloved ones what can we say amid all what's unfolding in Gaza it is true that this moment is painful yet it is unprecedented it is come clear that this is the aim of the Israelis to muzzle journalists to prevent us from carrying the message from telling the story from fulfilling our humanitarian and professional Mission our mission is being throttled here at Gaza Strip we were all hit by this sad news and all Al jazer colleagues and all the media extended family journalists from all other media are here to share their sentiments of sadness they are here also to express their heartfelt condolences we are all here part of the same Mission we are here to pledge that we will continue to fulfill our mission the Journey of Journalism continues even after the Israelis killed Sam abua and before that two years two and a half years ago assassinated our colleague Shireen AB this has not detered us we continue with the picture with the words with all conceivable means only to carry the truth to tell the truth to tell the whole world the truth and if there is any words to say or any pledge to reiterate is that we will continue we will continue we will continue to tell the truth so long as our hearts are beating and chest breathing we will continue to fulfill our mission until the acts of God and the promises of God are fulfilled as a matter of fact what is unfolding in Gaza is nothing so of crime it is insane as we speak more than 100 Palestinian journalists and cameramen were all killed by the same Israeli bullets this is before the eyes and the nose of the whole world the whole world who are lecturing on freedom of expression and human rights in the 20-year-old Vietnam War only 20 journalists were killed in less than 3 months in Gaza more than 100 journalists were killed yet we are surprised to see reports claiming that journalists are not targeted this raises a question mark it is with deep pain that we receive these false report reports from the world community that are preaching human rights and Justice yet our sacrifice will be translated as a driver as a motive to continue to work I am not speaking on my personal behalf or on behalf of Al jazer I am speaking on behalf of all journalists operating inside Gaza that we are here to reiterate that we will continue to fulfill our mission as we know that the communication are distorted in Gaza we will continue to work here as long as we breathe the words there of Al jazer correspondent in Gaz in this event marking the death the killing of the aler cameraman Sam abua he was killed six days ago when Israel struck a school where in jabalia where uh they were covering Israeli strikes on civilians
