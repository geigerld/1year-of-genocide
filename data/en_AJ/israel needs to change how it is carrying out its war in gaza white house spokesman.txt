interrupt you honey respectfully John Kirby is uh briefing reporters at the White House following that Biden Netanyahu phone call said you have said up in this Podium several times that that the Hamas was the obstacle to getting some sort of seire deal calling on Israelis to empower The Negotiator suggest that it's changed as the US assessment of Israel willingness to reach a ceasefire deal uh change in the last several weeks no it look it takes it takes active participation and the negotiation of both sides here um and uh and what the president is urging he's certainly in the call with Netanyahu urging that that the Prime Minister empowered his team to the maximum extent possible to see if we can get this deal in place and then just on the substance the real news from the president's statement there saying that he's going to conditioned creat support for this uh for Israeli the Israeli operations in Gaza um on what Israel does first off what is at stake what would be potentially cut off uh from Israel for using this war if uh if it doesn't change and second what do you want specifically to see from Israel or to do to protect civilians and humanitarian Aid workers I'm not going to preview um uh any potential policy decisions coming forward um what we want to see are some real changes uh on the Israeli side um and um you know if we don't see changes from their side they'll have to be changes from our side but I won't preview what that could look like now they talked about what I'm sorry is that just the body count or is there a specific again I'm I'm in terms of concrete steps uh what we are uh looking to see and hope to see here uh in coming hours and days is uh a dramatic increase in the humanitarian assistance getting in additional Crossings opened up uh and a u a reduction in the violence against civilians and certainly Aid workers we want to uh we want to see that uh that even as the Israelis work through their investigation that are willing and able to take practical immediate steps to protect Aid workers on the ground and to demonstrate uh that they that they have that civilian harm mitigation in place so again those are broad brushes I'll let the Israelis speak to what they will or won't do here but again in coming hours and days we will be looking for concrete tangible steps that they're taking thanks John just to go back to that point in your readout when you say the president made clear that the US that US policy with respect to Gaza will be determined by our assessment of Israel's immediate action could you decode that for us what exactly is the warning that's being issued here I I think it's very clear in the language itself Nancy um we're going to the we're looking for concrete steps to alleviate humanitarian suffering in Gaza again I won't get ahead of what the Israelis will or won't say or announce we're looking for concrete steps to be announced here soon um and it's not just about the announcement of concrete steps and changes in their policies but it's the execution of those announcements and those decisions and implementing them uh and so we we obviously will will'll watch closely and monitor uh how how they do on the commitments that they make and as um as I said earlier if there's no changes to their policy and their approaches then there's going to have to be changes to ours I think I think what the world wants to understand is is the White House warning that it may remove military aid what exactly is the threat here I think I've I've U stated it pretty clearly uh and I'm not going to I'm not going to as I said earlier I'm not going to preview steps I'm not going to preview decisions that haven't been made yet but um there are things that need to be done there are too many civilians being killed the risk to Aid workers is unacceptable uh now we have certain Aid organizations that are reconsidering whether they're even going to be able to continue operations in Gaza while famine looms so there has to be tangible steps let's see what they announce let's see what they direct let's see what they do uh but I'm not going to get ahead of that okayy I'm going to try this one more time because the president I reckon you would that's what we do the president seems to have said to to the Prime Minister today you know make these concrete changes or else it's the or else that I want to make clear here is the president threatening to withhold Aid to Israel if they do not make these changes the president made it clear that our policies with respect to Gaza uh will be dependent upon our assessment of how well the Israelis uh make changes and Implement changes uh to to make the situation in Gaza better for the Palestinian people and how much time are you giving them to make these changes to implement these concrete we we would hope to see some announcements of changes here in coming hours and days and I'll leave it at that that's short hours and days I done why today why today what why today for the phone call why why why this apparent shift in policy today I think look uh president all of us but particularly the president was certainly shaken by uh the attack on the wck U Convoy and the Egg workers as I said earlier um it wasn't the only event there had been others like that humanitarian Aid uh convoys coming under Fire and losing people uh and um and the president felt strongly that it was time to to talk to prime minister Netanyahu about his concerns would you characterize this call as an ultimatum I would characterize this call as very direct very business-like uh very professional on both sides um and the president laid out his significant concerns about the direction and where things are going um and quite frankly laid out as is clear in the readout um uh that uh that uh we are willing to reconsider our own policy approaches here um dependent upon what the Israelis do or don't do can you just tell us who all was on the call well it was it was a bilateral call between the two leaders uh prime minister n Yahoo and the president they were the only two speakers on the on the call vice president Harris also dialed in vice president Harris did uh did dial in yes Secretary of State dialed in Jake San yes I don't know who was uh also listening in on the Israeli side but the but the discussion was between the two leaders MJ so um Admiral you're not specifying what concrete steps Israel must take exactly I I I gave you some uh a broad sense of it we want to see more Crossings opened up we want to see more trucks getting in particularly from Jordan um we want to see tangible steps at the mitigation of Civilian harm uh particularly to Human Arian Aid workers but obviously all civilians but we want to see that they have uh that they have moved forward on proper steps to deconflict with Aid workers as they move around that the information flow U is viable that's language we've heard for weeks now you're not talking about uh sort of telling us how exactly you will measure those measurable steps right what I said was we're going to we're going to examine our policy approaches based on the our assessment of the way the Israeli side uh modifies their behavior uh modifies their policy and decision-making processes uh and so first of all let's see what they say they're going to do and then let's watch and see how they execute to what they say I don't want to get ahead of them and what they on what they what they plan to say about the changes they're going to make but we we'll base our policy decisions based on an assessment of how they execute to their policy decisions and you're not talking about what potential US policy changes are on the table can you say whether the president shared that with the Prime Minister on this phone call the president made clear that uh that absent changes um in the protection of civilians on the ground absent changes to the volume of humanitarian assistance getting in absent um absent any movement on uh a a ceasefire that will allow uh hostages to get out and more Aid to get in absent you know a calming down um that he will have to reconsider his own policy choices with respect to to Gaza and one of the seven Aid workers was obviously a dual American citizen did the Prime Minister offer the president an apology I I uh I'll let the Prime Minister speak to his side of the conversation uh the the I would note that the Israeli Defense Forces um their southern command Commander has made a public apology for the the strike and there was no mention of Rafa in this readout can you talk to us about how if that did come up and how that might have been discussed between the two this conversation was was focused uh primarily on U the need to get a temporary ceasefire in place the need for there to be a pause in in the fighting um so we can get the hostages out humanitarian assistance uh the need to see that steps are being taken to learn from this strike and to make changes in the way civilian harm is mitigated from an operational perspective and they did spend time as the readout makes clear talking about the very public threats from from Iran to Israel and the president as I said made very clear to the Prime Minister that United States support for Israel's ability to defend itself from a range of threats not just Hamas uh remains Ironclad okay Danny thanks screen thanks just things firstly how how long did this call uh last it was about 30 minutes or so and just going back to I mean Jeff's question about the um you know why why this sort of change in tone I mean has there been growing frustration on the part of President Biden that previous um messaging to prime minister Netanyahu just doesn't seem to have gotten through yes there's been growing frustration thank you so much Karim John one question on Israel and another on Venezuela we saw in the past president uh Biden pushing Netanyahu to protect civilians but how much words really matter here when on actions the same day of the attack on the humanitarian words the US was approving more bones to Israel do you we are now six month into the war how much the US actions are actually encouraging Israel to not do enough to protect civilians yeah look I I'm I'm kind of glad the question came up uh because I would tell you when I've seen press reporting you know about the uh about the uh the arm sales and that kind of thing and I I would just remind you that that uh it with the exception of the immediate two months after the attack we haven't really sent emergency aid and Military assistance to to Israel that was in the first couple of months but what you're seeing here uh is the result of a a process of foreign military sales to Israel that takes years uh and a lot of this material that's been reported publicly was notified to Congress many many months if not years ago and are in the train to get to Israel I think it's important to remember as I tried to mention in the last answer that Israel still has a lot of threats it faces I mean we're all focused on Hamas and I understand that but uh they still face active threats throughout the region including from Iran and the United State still has an iron clag commitment to help uh Israel with its self-defense and so a lot of these articles includ including the 2000lb bombs and the F35 so that's those are things that have been long in the train and not tied the S the foreign military sales process was not tied to this conflict can I have one more on on Venezuela quick because yesterday Nicolas maduru enacted a law creating a province of Venezuela in Guyana and he accused the United States of building secret military bases in ex a CUO so uh what is your reaction in is the us considering bu base to support gu to defend our sovereignty there's no plans for a secret military base and we've said many times that there's an 1899 arbitral ruling about the Border uh between Guyana and Venezuela and we want both sides to respect that ruling and to do it peacefully thank you um you said we would hope to see an announcement of changes I'm wondering if that is just hope or is it an expectation is it based on a commitment we expect that the the will be uh some um some announcements coming from Israel in the coming hours and days but I want to respect their right to manage that process on their own okay and um was there any update given uh by the Prime Minister on what exactly happened with the world Central Kitchen Envoy they they didn't talk about the actual strike in great detail that the Prime Minister uh did reiterate um as his military has reiterated that this was on them um that the the uh investigation was was concluding um that he looked forward to to seeing it and that you know he would take appropriate actions to make sure something like that couldn't happen again I mean they did obviously they talked about it of course uh but did they go through Point by point the investigations findings no because I think the prime minister's office is still evaluating um the actual investigation results and just to try to get a technical understanding is you described the very long process of uh supplying arms uh to to Israel if this contingency isn't met and there is a change in US policy how easy or hard would it be to um slow down or change shipments to Israel based on current law and all of the requirements and all the things you just described yeah again I don't want to get ahead of where we are uh let's see what uh the Israeli side does and says and what they Implement and where they go before we talk about actual policy decisions and I'm certainly not going to close down decision space for the president of the United States he gets to make those decisions uh but I mean obviously as commander-in-chief and yes the foreign military sales certainly is uh is supported by legislation but uh but there are certain authorities that you can do to manage that but again let's not get ahead of where we are uh this is really about uh seeing what the Israelis say they're going to do and then act on on those on those changes good admiral has the US lost its leverage with prime minister nahu you know I keep getting this question about leverage uh Israel is an ally and a friend and a partner uh and the president believes strongly and has for his entire public career in the security of the Israeli people and the uh and the longevity of the Israeli State and that's not going to change uh and uh I can say unequivocally and I don't think the Prime Minister would mind me saying here that in the call today the Prime Minister reiterated his thanks to President Biden and this Administration for the support that that we have continued to provide Israel it's longstanding it was before the 7th of October and it is now uh and that supports uh that support's going to continue but again um with respect to Gaza uh we need to see certain changes uh uh and if we don't then we'll have to consider changes to our own policy but it's not about it's not about leverage it's about the relationship and it's about The credibility I would even say the unique credibility that this particular president has in Israel and with Israeli leadership based on his long Public Service of support talk about this relationship do you think the prime minister is really listening it was uh I think it was evident in the phone call today uh it was uh a good discussion direct no question but a good discussion and uh and I I believe uh the president made very clear his concerns and the Prime Minister acknowledged those concerns in terms of the timing of this call we understand that this call was set up after the strike on the world Central Kitchen uh workers would you say if this call was a direct result of that was that the reason behind the call yes and then one one last thing response to Jose andr Chef Andre says that the Convoy was deliberately targeted any response from the US on that again I I haven't seen the Israeli investigation uh they have said themselves publicly after a preliminary investigation uh that there was no deliberate targeting of wck and and Chef Andre um they uh they're working their way through now in independent follow on Investigation which I understand is very very close to complete um uh the Prime Minister just talked about it broadly um and reiterated today the Prime Minister reiterated today that there was no deliberate targeting of uh of that that Aid Convoy good night thank you two questions uh Senator Co who was very close to the president said that we have reached a moment where arms restriction to Israel should be considered Senator Warren also said that we have Israel has violated our own laws are they wrong in their assessment the president I think it's clear in in the readout Nadia that the the president has has made it clear today um that if we don't see uh changes to the way uh the IDF is treating innocent civilians and Aid workers and flowing the humanitarian assistance that uh he's going to have to reconsider our Gaza policy so I mean he was very direct with the Prime Minister about that I'm not going to close down his decision space as satisfying as that may be for some of you I can't do that but he made it very clear that we need to see some changes on the Israeli side I want to ask you about very disturbing investigative report by an Israeli journalist who said that uh is the White House aware of an AI program called lavender that's been used by the Israeli Army to Target operative in Gaza in what they called a Kill Zone where this program has only 20 seconds of human supervision and it Leed to the death of thousands of women and children in Gaza do you think are you aware of it number one and second does the White House believe that AI can be used in this way without supervision I'm not aware of it you're going to have to let me take that question we'll get back to you thank you so much John I'm going to start with the trilateral summit then I'm going to move on to Rhonda first of all uh looking ahead to the trilateral summit next week what are some of the priorities and we recently heard the Filipino Ambassador say that the US Japan and the Philippines are going to start joint Patrols in the South China see very soon can you confirm that and give us any details I believe the Pentagon will have more to say about that this afternoon uh okay uh you have been listening to John Kirby he is the US National Security Council spokesman uh he is the one who is often the face of the administration on uh many of the Gaza Israel questions by the media and he was just briefing the White House Press Corps following the phone call between Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu so this is kind of how these things work let's bring in uh M director of the gulf studies Center at Qatar University I was saying it's how these things work usually step one you get the read you get the headline right what did the two leaders say and then step two you get the media gets briefed and you kind of get the explanation yes uh the official version of the explanation behind the headlines would you make of everything we've just heard in previous phone calls um the me this kind of press conference used to explain what happened and sometime def minimize the level of yeah the statement or the discussion saying you know it wasn't as being reflected in the media what I noticed that the language used by the spokeperson is actually reflecting to some extent what's been basically leaked in the last uh two hours uh as we would talk you know talk about change the Israeli commitment you know the Israelis you know that's that's a word we heard a lot there needs to be changed there need to be changed and and that that's that's something new previously uh you know the spokesperson of the White House SP National Security or or the Department of State they used to diffuse the the level of the strength of that statut now we see it's actually consistent at least now we are about 3 hours the the the statement Washington are consistent that itself telling yeah it's their way of of of um sort of nudging uh how the media is going to frame a certain event and this time as you say sometimes they'll dial it back they'll modulate what the headline says this time they're saying no no no you read this right yes the US president essentially excoriated the Israeli Prime Minister and he told him you have got to change something now he was asked on a timeline by when do these changes need to happen he said hours or days correct and and to to to lengthen that this the the reflection in the Israeli media they talk about what Netanyahu commitment to Biden in that phone call it seems that there were list of things Netanyahu was asked he um gave a promise that this will happen and now the Israeli media they talked about you know they Tred to um predict what are these kind of commitments you know and and they put the same question you have said for how long and when when do we expect this to happen yeah it seems that I mean looking at the language used by the White House so far it seems things that these days and and hours maybe yeah and and I think it's fair to say when the White House puts out messaging like this then then um the Israeli Prime Minister the counterpart is going to have to give something yeah and there's another interesting thing it's talks talking about media seiz fire that is also was was was was was mentioned to improve the humanitarian thing that is a new language and immediate seize fire to prove the humanitarian situation okay I have to run uh there's so much news to get to but thank you so much mry for joining us in the studio
