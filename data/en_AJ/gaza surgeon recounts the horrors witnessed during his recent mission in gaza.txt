we can now speak to Ahmed SED he's a surgeon who's just returned from Gaza where he spent two weeks working with the humanitarian organization RMA worldwide he joins us now from London doctor thank you for being with us on Al jazer I understand you've just come back from the strip you were there as part of a delegation of Medical Specialists can you tell us a little bit about what you were doing so uh it's a pretty shocking the last two weeks have been extremely uh shocking to me and my colleagues we went there as aoup group of of surgeons and in to help out uh with the casualities uh we were based in the European uh General Hospital and uh it's been very very difficult for all of us to be honest uh seeing all these casualities and come in after uh the destruction of all the bigger hospitals this is a relatively small Hospital 240 bedded obviously overwhelmed with with the amount of casualities coming in with the number of hostages tens of thousands of hostages all over the place uh and all these things just add to the stresses uh of of of the of the job and the situation on the ground doctor just for clarity there you said tens of thousands of hostages you mean people who were trapped in the hospital I mean I mean I mean refugees refugees uh tens of thousands of refugees uh flying all over the place you admit a patient uh onto a a bed and the whole family is there uh and when the patient is well enough to go home the family just stays there because it's not safe to leave the hospital premises uh it's it's uh you're you're we were operating around 40 to 50 cases a day a lot of patients unfortunately lose lose their their limbs and these patients don't just lose their limbs they they are sent out to a very infected environment a lot of patients almost all cases do get wound infections and and plus uh dropping off their their limbs and need reamputations at higher levels um I recall I'll just give some samples but obviously uh these these are not just names these are these these are not just numbers the the human beings young uh girl 20 uh 21 years of age uh had a right amputation above the knee and then unfortunately on on further treatment the in seeped through and we had to completely dis articulate her hip joint and there's only so high you can go and with every time you go up high the chances of her survival goes down uh and if she does survive the the disability becomes more severe uh meaning that if you've got a below knee amputation that's something that you may be able to walk with with with a prosthesis but when you go up to the hip you're really really in a difficult situation of course let alone the patients that have other problems from before so uh I I I was uh treating a lady who had uh two amputations both leg legs and because of her underlying leukemia she's not healing at all there's no signs of of her body a able to close up those wounds H and and these These are these are young patients these are patients in the 20s and 17s kids H and even when they stay in the hospital they're still not safe Yeah you mentioned you mentioned a lot of a lot of kids and young people we know that more than 70% of those who've been killed in Gaza have been women and children was that demographic reflected in in the kinds of patients you were seeing yes definitely yes I have not seen a single militant or Army Force come to the hospital all my patients and all my col Le patients are civilians mainly children women and men that have are civilians they are very tired they're very exhausted they're very uh everyone has lost a family member the one of the surgical assistants I was surprised and shocked to hear that she just lost her father uh another uh anesthetic uh assistant uh when he was asked how how's your family he just collapsed he collapsed because almost all his family died his mom his his dad his kids they're all dead Doctor you you mentioned I mean these these medical professionals are still going to work despite the trauma that they're they're living through you spoke a lot about amputations there were those the the primary injuries you were treating what other kinds of wounds were you seeing okay so so the more common forms of wounds are uh from what is called known as the quad copter these are bullets and they're not just set machine guns that go across uh shedding bullets no they have uh Hightech visualization and they can even talk to the uh to the uh to the uh civilians around them uh and one of the most most shocking things is that they come from head to toe so for example gazel was was a young 10-year-old girl she came to me the casuality and she was talking absolutely fine saying I can't move any of my hands or legs because the bullet passed through the spine wow at level C6 the neck vertebra column the sixth vertebra so it just cut off all the signals to the arms and legs and and it's that's it she's quadri pleased for Life what what's her fault this is a 10-year-old girl doctor what's her fault you were talking there about how the tens of thousands of people who are who are also still in the hospital aren't safe did did you at any point fear for your safety we obviously know that that hospitals and medical facilities have become Targets in this war oh definitely yes so at any any second you are being surveillanced by drones that have face recognition uh after the I mean when I arrived there were already very heavily bombarding uh narur Hospital which is just 15 minute Walks from uh from from uh from the European hospital and and uh and uh one of the bombs which was uh by F16 uh shed a a shrapnel that hit the skull of a 10-year-old at the doorways of the European Hospital what happened to that kid he basically lost a part of his skull and his underlying brain swoll and he lost Consciousness and for two days before I left he never regained it and I've sent you the pictures you might be able to to show it he's been on on on the ventilator mechanical ventilator and itu since and he's unlikely to ever come back and this is someone that thought he was safe No One Is Safe doctor you say that you were traumatized by what you've seen there over the last two weeks having seen what you've seen let me ask you what is your message right now for the International Community for people who haven't been on the ground there in Gaza I think I I think uh the world uh now has woken up as as as as a public that the politicians uh uh of the superpower so-called superpower uh countries have no uh Hearts they have no feelings this is 5 months now and you've just been talking about further attacking the most heav uh populated area in RAF just to get some hostages while they could have easily let the hostages from uh the IDF come out and in exchange for the safe uh Israeli host just to go back why do you have to kill everyone there's no point I I fail to see any sense for these politicians you can easily take your hostages back and just give uh the the Palestinians their hostages why do you have to destroy all these people and you're talking about 30,000 mortalities and a lot more uh disabled and a lot more under the rubble yeah under the rubble Dr Ahmed there a thank you so much for sharing your experiences with us here on Al jaaz doctor and we wish you all the best with your work in future thank you
