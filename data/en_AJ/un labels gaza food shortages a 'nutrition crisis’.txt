our correspondent hany Mahmud joins us now on the phone from Rafa hany first of all tell us what you know or what you're hearing about yet more people who are trying to get Aid being shot at by Israeli [Music] forces yes well desperate living conditions and situations across the distri are forcing Palestinians across thep to get to go anywhere and reach to anywhere they are possible to to get to in order to to find some of the basic necessities and Food Supplies and provide for their families and to to keep them alive in the face of this famina spreading everywhere the reports we're getting right now fromaz that's an area between Gaza and the central uh area of the Gaza Strip where uh these Aid or the food Aid that is available at that area was from what was dropped it from there within the past it's 48 hours by the Jordanian the amadis and then the uh the the us as well so that that food Aid was in that area that has been designated by the Israeli military as a combat zone and nobody was able to reach to uh the uh the food Parcels that were dropped as of today and given the famine the acute famine right now where people are dying of dehydration and starvation to try to reach to where the area to get to the food that is on the ground and that's where they were shot at by heavy machine guns and by tank shells there seven people reported killed right at the spot with several other injuries and the fact that those injuries we know from past experiences that because of non-operational Health Facilities the people who are injured are at risk of losing their lives as there is no way to get any proper medical uh intervention uh what so ever this is not the first incident happening within the past four days in a row every Aid boy and every a truck tried to make its way to Gaza and the northern part obstructed by the isra military and by the conditions created on the ground very difficult condition that keeps barring those uh trucks from entering and reaching to people who are really desperate right now either on where they were shot at or na around intersection roundabout where they were there was an atrocity better known among palestin now as the FL atrocity it keeps going on by these restrictions that make make it very difficult to get eight hany Mahmud bringings the latest situation there in Gaza thanks very much hany well let's speak now to Tamara Al Rafi she's anra spokeswoman and joins us from Cairo Tamar as we just heard from hany yet another incident where Palestinians who were desperately trying to get hold of Aid being shot at by Israeli forces why do we keep seeing this happen because 90% of the population today in Gaza is facing high level of acute food insecurity and therefore anyone seeing a convoy of trucks of Aid trucks going through their part of Gaza will jump on these trucks out of hunger and despair and fear and will try to help themselves onto these convoys especially as we're hearing more and more about children under the age of two now dying of hunger related diseases and dehydration the situation is so dire the despair is so high that any passage of trucks becomes an attraction to people who are hungry and very few trucks are actually getting through we're hearing of the world food program having its first Convoy being turned away at Northern Gaza in Northern Gaza the edge of Northern Gaza one wonders why the Israelis are stopping any Aid reaching those people in the north when they so desperately need it obstructions to the north have reached very very high levels accessing the isolated population north of w Gaza is a real challenge more than half PA the requests by the UN altogether to bring much needed food medical supplies clean water to the north have been rejected by the Israeli authorities we keep pushing but it's worth remembering that today's Convoy by the world food program is the first attempt in two weeks to go to the north un the agency I represent which is the largest humanitarian agency in Gaza today has not been able has not been permitted to to go to the north of Gaza since the 23rd of January that's almost 6 weeks of us not being able to bring food and medical supplies to people who are desperate and isolated in the north of Gaza we're hearing um from the EU that there are plans a foot for a human a maritime humanitarian Corridor via Cyprus what do you make of that the most straightforward way of getting Aid into the Gaza Strip is to use the existing Crossings namely kamam abam kamam Shalom and RAF from Egypt so there are many conversations about the maritime route there have been attempts to airdropping um of of Aid onto the strip but really the most straight straightforward way and this is what we at onra the largest UN agency have been calling for is there are existing uh land crossings that are much more straightforward faster more economical and safer and there are constant requests for a ceasefire that would allow an influx of humanitarian assistance why should we reinvent the wheel let us use what exists and what has worked before much of H's funding has been cut off for for some weeks now by a number of countries around the world how is the organization coping what operations are is it able to still do with in Gaza maintained all our much needed humanitarian response in Gaza let's remember we are responsible for people who are in our shelters it is unra that runs the shelters that distributes foods that sends Medical Teams into the shelters and we've maintained all that we've also maintained our 700 schools across the entire region and 140 Health Centers and that is thanks to donors who have not suspended their funding based on allegations so we we still have many close supporters and we're working on providing a lot of cooperation to the reviews of our own systems that will enable us to prove once again that we are a principled UN agency and we are indispensable in the response in Gaza but also in the region so we're working month by month we're maintaining our operations in March and in April and we're truly hoping to reverse the decision by some of our donors by proving how transparent and principled we are tomara alifi many thanks for taking the time to join us here on aljazera
