live for us now in Rafa in southern Gaza good morning Hanny uh what more do we know about these ongoing or recent strikes certainly and the aftermath yes well so far the reports that we're getting from a nsat refugee camp particularly from the northern part that's an area between waza and aat refugee camp this is a new camp as it is expanding as people numb is in has increased within the past years but this is the new block of a n refugee camp uh ongoing artillery shelling air strikes and and and and constant uh sh shots heard by the quadcopter these are attack drones in the area and most of the people who injured uh in these attacks are transferred to Ala hospital that's the other side of the refugee camp and nor refugee camp it's a small health facilities and the reason when we did ask about why people are being transferred to this small health facility is because the road all the way to alaka hospital in D B city is quite dangerous there's a risk for thei the civil defense crew members and the paramedics to drive all the way from this particular area from a refugee camp all the way to city but so far we're looking at five people have been killed inside the residential homes inside evacuation Center that's aluba school that's an honor School managed and operated by the United Nations for Palestinians uh refugees more of the infrastructure and the public facility we started to see based on on what we hear from Iron Witnesses a pattern of what happened in the city of kanun where the Israeli military withdrew within the past week leaving behind a sheer level of Destruction to all means of life including public facilities infrastructure residential homes including close to eight facilities managed and operated by Ona in the city of KH units particularly the healthc care sectors that has been destroyed Beyond anyone can imagine meanwhile in the northern part and Gaza City the Israeli military continues to pound across the northern part and Gaza City the popular Market that was targeted more reports of many injuries and also a the attack on a law enforcement officer who worked within the past weeks to secure the delivery of Aid to uh uh to the population in the northern part and Gaza City he's also the director of jabalia police department the Israeli military issued a statement saying they targeted killing Hamas operative but what we hear from people on the ground that he's a a law enforcement officer who's been working on securing the delivery of Aid coordinating effort with Gaza based Clans to continue delivering Aid and in terms in terms of delivering Aid what is coming into the region so far it is less than what what one would imagine to to help people combat the extreme difficult living conditions they created not only by the ongoing intense bombing campaign but also by the ongoing obstruction and restrictions on the ground uh to deliver Aid to the nor part in Gaza City so far we're looking at two parts of the strip that have been divided we have overcrowded Rafa City where there's depletion of resources and and BAS supplies and a famine that is Raging in the nor part in Gaza City 30 people have died because of the enforced dehydration and starvation the Israeli military announced uh 500 trucks will be would be allowed to enter the Gaza STP but so far this is only a drop in the ocean of the greater needs right now that people are experiencing from the other side of the Border are is the crossing particularly in which the Israeli military insist that it's it's going to be open it's going to deliver and see more trucks here into Gaza but based on a a statement issued by UNICEF stating that they haven't seen any AED trucks or humanitarian trucks coming into G from the landed Crossings the Israeli military announced it will be particularly used for more a trucks to get into Gaza K Mahmud there for us uh in southern Gaza thank you
