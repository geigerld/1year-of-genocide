Britain is expected to warn Israel later on Wednesday that its patience is running out over the humanitarian situation in Gaza Israeli War cabinet minister Benny gance is visiting the UK following diplomatic meetings in Washington this week that trip was reportedly not sanctioned by Israel's prime minister UK's foreign secretary David Cameron spoke of the Dreadful suffering in Gaza on Tuesday and protests against Israel's war on the Strip have been held regularly across the UK let's speak now to our correspondent in London Rory Chalin Rory buy gance we understand has arrived in the UK from the US how's he likely to be received by the foreign secretary David Cameron well Laur I think like the reception that Benny Gant received uh in the United States in the last few days he is going to get a message of deep frustration uh from David Cameron when he meets him here at the foreign Office later in the day now David Cameron has been briefing about it uh in the last few hours he said that he has warned a few weeks ago about the danger of famine and disease in Gaza and he says we are now at that point he says that patience needs to run very thin and a whole series of warnings need to be given starting uh with the meeting that I am going to have with uh Minister Gant he says that the amount of Aid that Israel allowed into Gaza in February was about half as much as it allowed in during during January so there's deep concern about the humanitarian situation there and another specific warning for Israel for Benny Gant that's uh coming from David Cameron saying that Israel is the occupying power it is responsible uh and that it has and that has consequences including he says in how we look at whether Israel is compliant with International humanitarian law so a lot of things for Benny Gans to be thinking about as he head home a lot of things but will any of it have any impact yeah well I mean there are a few things to say about that first of all is that yes though he goes back conveying this message of frustration uh and uh that comes from the United Kingdom and it comes from the United States David Cameron saying that patience is wearing thin The Logical conclusion of that is that there is still patience you know these already warm machine does still have some rope it still have some leeway from its allies uh in the west another thing to look at is well who is Benny gance anyway uh he is a member of the war cabinet yes but he is also an opposition politician a former prime minister this uh trip that he's on um I think is viewed by many people within the Israeli government as essentially a freelancing Enterprise uh Netanyahu is apparently no fan of it and it was reported in the isra media that he had told the Israeli Embassy in uh the United States not to support gance on this Mission so there are plenty in the right wing of uh Net's Coalition you think this this is a kind of Trojan horse for the United States to try and push the two-state solution which they are no fan of uh as well so don't expect many gants to go back to Israel and get a warm reception and an open ear from Netanyahu and his Coalition allies no indeed Roy Chalin many thanks for joining us with that from London some
