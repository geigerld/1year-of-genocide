these now are the main areas of fighting in Northern Gaza the shaded areas are where Israeli soldiers and tanks have made advances in circling Gaza City and effectively cutting the strip in half Israeli troops and tanks have completely surrounded the port of Gaza it's believe that the armed wing of Hamas the kasan brigades is fighting on what's being described as four decisive fronts in talawa Al shatti bit Laha and bate hanon let's speak to Andreas Craig about this he's a senior lecture in security studies at Kings College London joining us from London thank you Andreas for being with us okay let's begin with the situation at alifa first and this claim by the Israelis and the Americans that alifa is the command center for Hamas is there any tangible evidence of that well that's the problem I me we're looking at an ongoing operation nothing that has been presented by either side as evidence is very tangible or conclusive uh and things uh obviously shift uh around quite quickly what has to to be said though is that The Narrative of alifa hospital being somewhat the kwat center of Hamas has been going around for a decade so Israelis have always pushed that narrative it's now time of Truth where they have boots on the ground where they now have to come up with evidence that this is actually true so far they haven't presented any evidence and the evidence that the IDF has presented over the last couple of days around different hospitals in Gaza have always always not just been inconclusive but to a great deal have also been inconsistent and showed a lot of flaws and misinformation in it which also makes it very difficult to really trust their word for it and from an intelligence point of view as well I would say that the Americans are just copying what the Israelis are saying instead of actually presenting their own evidence so there isn't a lot out there right even even if they came up with evidence Andreas evidence like let's say a bunker in alifa hospital what would it prove it it doesn't prove anything uh per se and what we've seen I think the IDF said this morning in in in Hebrew in in on the radio that that they have not found any evidence for any hostages being there or having been there so that as well also disproves some of the the claims that they've made what is interesting is though that there have been stories around um uh shifa hospital already for a while where people said that there is a bunker system underneath the hospital not connected to the hospital that was actually built by the Israelis and that's what makes the Israelis so certain that there is a bunker system there um I find it highly doubtful that Hamas would still be in that system underneath that hospital considering that idea forces have moved so close to the hospital and if they had been there would have probably moved out by now um and so you know it it doesn't really change the protected status of the hospital and it still me means that the burden is both on Hamas and the IDF to make sure that civilians are protected inside the hospital yeah and as you said interestingly the Israelis have admitted there's no information right now about the presence of hostages in alifa what does this suggest about their intelligence or is there something perhaps more cynical going on there well I think in this operation more than ever the Israelis have shown determination to strike as they see fit um they don't double and triple check that as they might have done in in previous operations they certainly have been a lot more Lex with the application of international humanarian law in comparison to other Western uh countries or liberal democracies in their application of force I'm not saying that they they're doing it without intelligence but what can be said is that the intelligence might have been very good at the beginning of the operations on the 7th of October uh but obviously over time they've now depleted the target list to an extent where the Israelis don't have the targets anymore they don't have the intelligence anymore to actually go after targets and they're now guessing and the other thing that we need to understand is that the target the human intelligence the signal intelligence that Israel had on the ground um certainly doesn't apply to the intelligence they have underground so there is there are two different battlefields here and that's what people don't understand there's a battlefield overground and there's a battlefield underground that nobody knows about and that is not necess neily connected to the to the battlefield overground so uh that makes it so difficult for intelligence to become conclusive and it seems that the Israelis are just doing what they what they see fit because nobody's holding them to account yeah you talked about the battlefield there and we've shown the map of where the fighting is happening right now what is ultimately the goal for the Israelis in targeting alifa for example what is the military goal Beyond alifa well the the Absurd strateg IC Target or strategic end game that the Israelis are driving here is is saying they want to completely an annihilate hamas's infrastructure Hamas is primarily obviously an idea resistance is an idea it's a movement uh but even if they wanted to annihilate the military capabilities they would have to kill kill every single Hamas fighter so they're going literally house by house whether it's a civilian house whether it's a a dual Ed house whether it's a hospital or any other infrastructure they're going house by house and clearing it and making sure that no Fighters are in there and that is obviously not just very disruptive but is also somewhat counterproductive because you're you're basically being pulled in into firefights potentially and you're killing more civilians which again is something that you're trying to avoid if you fight an Insurgency so I think it's part of that just let's clear everything let's try to provide evidence and let's make sure that on the ground at least we're seizing and holding the ground that's the kind of IDF approach and that's going to take obviously ages and that means you have to clear every single building whether they're government buildings or hospitals Andreas very good to get your Insight about this Andreas from Kings College London joining us on the newsour thank you very much for your time thank you
