now an investigation has found that between October and December last year at least 60 Palestinian families suffered the loss of more than 25 or more members in Israeli bombings the agency the Associated Press analyzed 10 of the deadliest Israeli strikes between October the 7th and December the 24th they collectively killed more than 500 people AP says None of these strikes appear to Target a military objective nor was a direct warning given to those inside many residential buildings one family lost at least 270 members in an attack on the densely populated jabalia refugee camp Israeli bombs wiped out the entire block of buildings nearly 40 members of the same family lost their lives according to gaza's health Ministry 300 Palestinian families have lost more than 10 members double the number affected during the 51-day war in 2014 Israel says it takes measures to mitigate against civilian casualties but the world's top Court the international Court of justices considering whether Israel is committing genocide in Gaza aad Abu akesh is the accountability program director with defense for children Palestine he's in tulkarem and joins us from there live good to have you with us sir on the program is this report an investigation by Associated Press coincidence or a reality when missiles and bombs hit such a small community in a very small area that sort of entire families can be wiped out in an instance I think as a result of the intensity intensity of the bombardment towards residential area uh or residential areas in Gazza STP which is part and parcel of the Israeli military operation in Gaza to put the pressure on civilians so the killing of entire families and different Generations from uh the uh same family it's a as an organization we documented many cases where some part of the family were killed in U one incident and the other part of the family were killed in another incident so this is because of the in intensive bombardment whether aial or ground the bment towards residential area of Gaz strip and we come across many who were targeted two or three times during the process of their evacuation from one place to another place in their attempt to seek for um uh Security in another place despite can I jump in there sir just Mr let me just jump in there when you spoke to those families who moved from one location to the other did they feel they were targeted were they given any um for warning that their building or that their location was going to be targeted uh in majority of the incidents there is no warning from the Israeli side to uh those uh families and uh almost all our documentation indicated that this place was targeted without prayer warning and which led to the killing of many of those families among them uh children so uh this uh is one of the questions that our field worker ask the families who list a family member or more whether uh they receive warning or not and in other incidents they inform us that uh they reive warning but the uh time span was not enough in order to uh Evacuate the place that has been targeted or the neighbor uh uh house or building was targeted without their knowledge so for the Israelis it's not an issue to warn Palestinians on the contrary we believe that part of the uh military Israeli military strategy is to claim the life of civilians in order to push to put pressure on the resistant group in order to surrender and this um explains casties civilians let me just let me just jump in there then so obviously a lot to unpick so therefore are you saying from the evidence that you've cated in relation to this investigation by Associated Press which are both independent and both very different one outside of the Gaza Strip and one uh from where you are uh within the occupied territories how do you expect or how do you think your findings and your report and your conclusions can be used to Enlighten The Wider public the leaders the politicians the uh activists in terms of making them understand what's going on on the ground certainly in Gaza I think the problem now it's not a lack of knowledge or understanding of what is going on in Gaza it's uh related to the lack of iCal will in order to restrain Israel from continuing the genocide against Palestinian people because U what's going on in Gaza is a life in many televisions and uh the International Community is fully aware about the genocide that Israel is committing against Palestinians living in Gaza Strip H but the problem that there is no political will to put any uh measures in Israel to stop this genocide before we used to say that the International Community uh is absent but we believe that now the International Community is present in supporting Israel whether in terms of political or diplomatic or military support for uh Israel and this emboldened Israel to continue it's genocide against Palestinians so the problem um related to the flow of uh uh uh Essentials for people the International Community is watching the uh starvation that Israel is committing without being able to pressure Israel to the FL of we certainly get that part of the the the the the narrative certainly we have to leave it there I'm afraid Sir Mr a Abu at thanks for joining us from tul thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
