for joining me live is sari Bashi the program director at Human Rights Watch she is also the co-founder of gisha and is R organization that promotes Palestinians right to freedom of movement in Gaza thank you so much for joining us here uh for this NewsHour I mean just running through everything that is happening inside Gaza at this point in time how would you descri you describe how this crisis is unfolding I think what's so tragic about the last two weeks is the way in which civilians have been targeted and basic rules about protecting civilians that are accepted under the laws of war have been flouted the latest Salvo in in this round of violence was October 7th when Hamas Le Fighters massacred Israeli civilians and took others hostage in the worst civilian massacre in Israeli history Hamas needs to release all civilian hostages the fact that Hamas Fighters committed war crimes against Israeli civilians does not not justify the Israeli authorities committing war crimes against Palestinian civilians and that is what we are seeing right now the the refusal to allow Aid into Gaza is a war crime it's collectively punishing civilians for the actions of Fighters and because nearly half of the people in Gaza are children it's collectively punishing children for the actions of adult Fighters and as we see that day after day they keep getting away with it there's they're not being helped held to account at this point in time are they I think we need to be very specific about what the international communities demands should be from each party Hamas need and other groups need to immediately release all civilians and countries like katar and Tura who have influence with Hamas should press for their immediate and unconditional release countries like the United States Europe and other backers of of the Israeli government who are also arming Israel need to immediately demand that the Israeli government restore water and electricity to the Gaza Strip there's no security reason not to turn the Taps back on and allow fuel including through the ru Crossing with uh with Egypt without fuel the hospitals can power their generators sewage plants uh water water pumping stations cannot operate we also need to require the Israeli government to open its own Crossings with Gaza for humanitarian assistance as brutal as previous Wars have been in previous Wars the Israeli government has found ways to open its Crossings with Gaza in order to allow in humanitarian Aid and that's what needs to happen right now yeah just on the fuel uh point it sounds like hospitals could run out as soon as Thursday um to fuel their generators there one thing I want to clarify it's not just about getting Aid through the borders though is it because Israel actually controls the power and the water that is running into Gaza and they could if they chose to turn it on at any point yes they could and they should flick the switch back on we know that the electricity grid has been badly damaged but we think some lines are functioning particularly in southern Gaza some of the water lines are functioning and there is some ability in Northern Gaza they need to turn that back on the Israeli government developed gaza's infrastructure to depend on supplies from Israel including its drinkable water and most of its electricity that needs to be done immediately yeah as we saw a couple of days ago when the summit was being held in Cairo with many of the world leaders uh gathered around that table I mean many of them not all of them though were calling for a humanitarian ceasefire but really without the United States putting pressure direct pressure on Israel to do it there's really little hope that that's actually going to happen my concern is that the United States government has been extremely active in this particular conflict and brokered a deal to allow very limited amounts of Aid into rafle Crossing but they didn't ask for things that are very very basic like the Israeli government restoring water and electricity red lines are being crossed this is the first time in the history of its conflicts with Gaza that the Israeli government has cut off water water for children in Gaza this it needs to be very clear and very specific Israel needs to open up the water and electricity to allow people some modom of relief and the aid that the limited Aid that's being allowed into Southern Gaza is not responsive to the needs of people in Northern Gaza it's almost impossible to get Aid up to Northern Gaza and I'm worried that the Israeli government is abandoning its responsibilities to civilians in Northern Gaza it has told them to leave repeatedly and according to the UN it dropped leaflets yesterday telling them in Arabic that if they stay they they're likely to be considered part of terrorist groups that is a flouting of international law under international law civilians retain their protections whether or not they choose or are able to comply with evacuation orders and I want to remind us that in the so-called evacuation zone is gaza's main shifa hospital with thousands of patients including people who cannot move okay thank you so much for for laying out just how dire the situation is in Gaza at this point in time that is sorry about the program director of uh at Human Rights Watch thank you
