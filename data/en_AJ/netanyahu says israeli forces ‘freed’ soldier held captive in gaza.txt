Let's cross now to Tel Aviv the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived we believe he's about to deliver a statement of course there is news of a uh Soldier a female Soldier has been freed after being held in captivity in Gaza by Hamas uh Netanyahu himself is under intense pressure there's been protests around Israel to bring the prisoners home big protest outside City Hall and many believe uh the war in Gaza should stop uh so the prisoners can be brought back but they can't see how it happens while the offens goes on he's speaking now so let's listen to him would enable us to move beyond the barbaric horrors of the past towards a better and Brilliant future many believe that we could go about our comfortable lives and that evil will simply pass Us by it will not the horrors that Hamas perpetrated on October 7th remind us that we will not realize the promise of a better future unless we the Civilized world are willing to fight The Barbarians because the barbarians are willing to fight us and their goal is clear shatter that promising future destroy all that we cherish and Usher in a world of fear and Darkness ladies and gentlemen this is a turning point a turning point for leaders and Nations it is time for all of us to decide if we are willing to fight for a future of Hope and promise or surrender to tyranny and Terror now rest assured Israel will fight since October 7th Israel has been at War Israel did not start this war Israel did not want this war but Israel will win this war Kamas launched this war by perpetrating the worst savagery of people have sin since the Holocaust Hamas murdered children in front of their parents murdered parents in front of their children they bur people alive they raped women they beheaded men they tortured Holocaust Survivors they kidnapped babies they committed the most horrific crimes imaginable and they're part of the Access of Evil that Iran is formed an access of Terror that works by arming training and financing Hamas and Gaza his Bala in Lebanon theis in Yemen and other Terror proxies throughout the Middle East and Beyond the Middle East in fighting Hamas and the Iranian axis of Terror Israel is fighting the enemies of civilization itself victory over these enemies begins with moral Clarity and wrong it means making a moral distinction between the deliberate murder of the innocent and the unintentional C casualties that accompany every legitimate War even the most just War it means holding Hamas responsible for the double War crime it commits every day by deliberately targeting Israeli civilians while deliberately using palestin civilians as human Shields it means making clear that the use of human Shields is not only an immoral tactic of Terror but also an ineffective one because as long as hamas's use of Palestinian human Shields result in the International Community blaming Israel Hamas will continue to use it as a tool of Terror and so will others Hamas will continue to use the basements in gaza's hospitals as the command post of its vast territ tonnel Network work it will continue to use mosques as fortified military positions and weapon Depots it will continue to steal Fuel and humanitarian assistance from un facilities while Israel is doing everything to get Palestinians civilians out of Harm's Way Hamas is doing everything to keep Palestinian civilians In Harm's Way Israel urges Palestinian civilians to leave the areas of armed conflict while Hamas prevents those civilians from leaving those are gunpoint Hamas is also preventing foreign Nationals from leaving Gaza altogether and most despicably Hamas is holding over 200 Israeli hostages including 33 children holding them terrorizing them keeping them as hostages every Civilized Nation should stand with Israel and demanding that these hostages be freed immediately and freed unconditionally I want to make clear Israel's position regarding a ceasefire just as the United States would not agree to a ceasefire after the bombing of Pearl Harbor or after the terrorist attack of 911 Israel will not agree to a cation of hostilities with Hamas after the horrific attacks of October 7th calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas to surrender to terrorism to surrender to barbarism that will not happen ladies and gentlemen the Bible says that there is a Time For Peace and a time for war this is a time for war a war for our common future today we draw a line between the forces of civilization and the forces of barbarism it is a time for everyone to decide where they stand Israel will stand against the forces of barbarism until Victory I hope and pray that civilized Nations everywhere will back this fight because Israel's fight is your fight because if Hamas and Iran's axis of Evil win you will be their next Target that's why Israel's Victory will be your Victory but make no mistake regardless of who stands with Israel Israel will fight until this battle is won and Israel will prevail may God bless Israel and may God bless all the those who stand with Israel so the first question will go to news 18 India nage please take the microphone sir good evening sir good evening nearest from India I I represent Network 18 group in India my question to you is that how do you see the India's stand on UN resolution India abstained because in resolution there was no condemnation of terrorism I think that uh resolution was deeply flawed and I was sorry to see that even many of our friends uh did not insist that there would be a full and Powerful condemnation of the hards that were committed here that are Horrors that no civilized country including uh your country and so many others would tolerate yes watching the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin nety who saying that Israel will not agree to a ceasefire that is a call to surrendered to Hamas he said this is a time for war he talked of hospitals and mosques being command posts of Hamas and said that Israel is doing everything it can not to hit civilians he said he said that Hamas is preventing civilians from moving at gunpoint let's go to straight to Alan Fischer now who's joining us live from occupied East rum has been listening in and Allan so clearly the the Israeli Prime Minister very defensive and well on the attack as well all at once uh exactly a lot more emboldened than he was on Saturday evening when he spoke uh in Hebrew to a domestic audience this was aimed at an international audience and you could tell that from the language that was used and the fact that he spoke in English uh making references uh particularly to America not calling for a ceasefire after Perl harbor not calling for a ceasefire after 911 he is comparing it to these two pivotal moments in US history and he obviously sees this as a pivotal moment in Israeli uh history uh attacking Hamas again pointing out what they had done as far as the Israelis are concerned uh on the 7th of October um and saying that this is a war for civilization against barbarism and again making an appeal to the international Community saying that they have to pick aide almost Echoes of George Bush famously at Ground Zero after 911 saying you're either with us or against us not quite as Stark in the language but certainly making the point that Nations need to stand with Israel uh and just in that last question criticizing some of even their friends who uh were critical in the UN resolution about the way Israel is conducting the war in Gaza excuse me and the growing death to there indeed and the Israeli Prime Minister under a lot of pressure with all the protests that been going on within Israel uh for him to stop the war so they can get out the prisoners who were taken by Hamas well certainly we were under the impression that one of the things he would address and addressed fairly early on was the video that was released by Hamas in the last few hours which shows at three women who are being held captive and one of them it speaks very directly to Benjamin Netanyahu and is very critical of his position saying that there was a security military and political failure which led to her being held captive saying that that he needed to to do more to release those captives and then in the last couple of hours we've heard news of a an Israeli soldier being freed while an operation in Gaza they say they're not going to give any more information out about that Hamas say that it's a cynical by the Israelis alleging that this Soldier was afraid to detract from that video so you can see that this isn't just a battle that's being fought on the ground in Gaza with obviously all the casualties it's inflicting this is a propaganda War as well with both sides fighting to do whatever they can to gain the upper hand and create the narrative which then becomes more dominant around the world and uh again Alan the Israeli Prime Minister referring to unintended casual saying that Hamas deliberately targeting Israeli civilians while using civilians as human Shields within Gaza and it's a line he's returned to several times uh but making the point here that Hamas in his view deliberately targeted uh men women and children civilians whereas Israel is doing all it can to avoid uh civilian casualties that would perhaps surprise many many people in Gaza including people like our our own correspondent there who received a call today to say that her house was possibly being targeted H and certainly those who move from the north of Gaza to the south on the instructions of Israel and then found that the South was also being bombed would perhaps argue that uh Benjamin Netanyahu is using that as an address to the wider World rather than addressing the real situation in Gaza that innocent civilians are being killed more than 3,000 children more than one every 10 minutes so that that that certainly while he's making that point it is a line that Israel has used again and again and they talk about using Precision bombs but as you've heard from many experts in the past if you send a Precision bomb into an area where there are thousands and thousands of people there is going to be collateral damage which is a very Bland way of saying there is there is going to be a number and a large number of Civilian deaths all right Alan thanks for that Alan fish there in occupied East Jerusalem H let's take this on now we can speak now to Abdul Hamid Sam who's the professor of political science and Middle East studies at rgas University Welcome Back uh so this speech from the Israeli Prime Minister uh as Alan says it's a familiar refrain isn't it this a reference to unintended casualties Hamas using civilians as human Shields and so forth uh who's taking seriously no one I believe I mean he's speaking to the converts only but around the world no one believe him you cannot talk about collateral damage it seems the US yeah because the politicians want to believe that because even if he doesn't say it they will say it for him because it's one one discourse between Israel and the US in this war especially and again you have 8,000 more more than 8,000 civilians killed including 3,500 children killed and you call that unintended killing what about if it was intended to to kill half a million what what what kind of a a speech he he delivered uh and again the world is becoming uh aware of what's Happening he is losing the media War now because of social media go travels around the world young people are uh technically Savvy they distributed these videos and and now it's common knowledge that is they are punishing the gazan the people of Gaza because they embraced Hamas Hamas was part of the the fabric of the people in Gaza it's okay hold on right there because we're just going to knit back to the press conference well we were going to but I see that the Israeli Prime Minister has now moved on so so from his point of view uh from Net's point of view is an important speech to a familiar ref frame but an important speech and really delivered for a domestic audience yeah yeah he's trying to calm his domestic uh the domestic pressure coming from the families and coming from the public about especially the hostages about over 200 people they they they putting pressure on him to do something about it yeah and especially and again the failures also of the the whole Israeli apparatus in what happened on on the 7th of October so they will not forgive him for for that you saw what happened yesterday when he has dispute with his intelligence Chiefs so he has to retract his uh his tweet yesterday yeah exactly and also we have this you know the latest thing the video that came out of out of gazra of the hostages of the prisoners there um and that's not going to help netanyahu's calls back at home is it I think now generally the Israelis unite normally when there time of conflict but not this time I mean the there is fraction as we see the battle is going going on I mean they support the Army but they're not supporting Netanyahu and there will be more pressure on Netanyahu in the next coming a few a few we days and weeks especially with the hostages still held in Gaza uh importantly he also said Israel will not agree to a ceasefire that is a call to surrender to her Mass this is a time for war and that is not something that is going to sit well with this growing push uh from lots of leaders around the world at least to go for a humanitarian truce unfortunately he supported by the us on this I mean Jack Sullivan said exactly the same right a ceasefire means giving Hamas more chance to uh regroup and benefit from a ceasefire so the only country I think even the Europeans met the other day and asked for a humanitarian Corridor they didn't call exactly for ceasefire but I around the world they been talking about either truce or humanitarian pose or ceasefire these are the three terms floating from one place to the other and the Security Council is meeting this afternoon in New York time to discuss a draft resolution prepared by the yes I was going to come on to that so so they're going to prepare this draft resolution prepared by the UAE so so what what do you make of that and and what chances that it actually something will pass this time because they've made various attempts since the start of October the 7th and they've all failed so far at the security Council I think they're trying to benefit from the experience of four different draft resolution did not make it so they might ease the US uh insistence on condemning Hamas they might include that and they might talk about humanitarian pose with and release all hostages and uh cancel that order of removing about 1 million to the to the southern part of Gaza so they might these four elements which the these elements came also in the general assembly resolution it didn't mention Hamas by name the ga resolution but it could come here you think think Americans would buy that though would they would they vote for that they have to negotiate with them I mean when they put it in on a vote I believe it might take a day or two they will negotiate hard to try to get consensus or at least no veto and all the while there is this issue going back to the prisoners there's this issue of those that have helped captive in Gaza and those Palestinian prisoners within Israel and Hamas saying that they're prepared to do as Alan Fisher puts it an all for all SWAP I I'm don't think that will say but that's a bargaining uh starting point I don't think they expect there's about 8,000 Palestinian in jail, 1600 of them were arrested since uh October 7 but at least there are women they can release they can release all women all children all DET detainees who are not indicted and maybe some other prisoners who finished either their term or some of them like leaders like Maran barui or some some but there could be a bargain I'm sure the negotiation will end up with some a package of that satisfy both sides yeah and meanwhile the the ground invasion is continuing we've seen uh the sky is pretty clear at the moment but we have seen great spirals of smoke going above the sky of the Gaza night sky as the the strikes continue and the ground Invasion goes on and apparently a female Soldier has been released or freed we don't know that if it's confirm because it was I don't know if you would thought it would have been mentioned in that press conference would yeah but Hamas said that is a propaganda War to divert the Israeli public from the other so we don't know anyhow I think a full fledged ground uh attack or Invasion maybe is not in the making now but they keep expanding the incursion every single night they expand it they try to destroy and and move on um for now I think the um maybe the US is not for full-fledged ground uh Invasion for for the time being right but people are being forced to relocate on on a big scale aren't there and there AR and their fear is that this displacement might last for Generations I mean after all there's previous on this isn't that yeah but where they going to go I mean they going to go to southern part of Gaza but but nowhere to go I mean Gaza is so small so tiny that if you push everyone to the South you going to end up having two over 2 million in half of what Gaza size which is 15 in 150 kilom how they going to survive that how how can to be this area going to be viable and uh people allow people to survive and continue with their lives there okay we'll leave it there for the moment thanks very much ABD Hamid appreciate that we'll see you a bit later thank you as things continue here
