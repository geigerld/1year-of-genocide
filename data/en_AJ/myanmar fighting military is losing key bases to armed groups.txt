Myanmar where fighting is escalating between the military jent and rebel groups in the East the violence has been focused near the Border Town of mwadi an important trade Hub and a source of revenue for the cash strapped military Rebels say that hundreds of soldiers have now surrendered Thailand has also increased security along that border as people in Myanmar try to flee the fighting the rebel groups have made significant gains in recent weeks weakening the military's grip on power well let's speak to Tony Chang he's been following the story for us and he joins us now from the ti Border City of mesot Tony Myanmar seems to have suffered a series of defeats recently including in a strategic town just over that border behind you what is the state of the fighting there now well I think it's not a defeat yet uh we understand there was fighting from early this morning a continue throughout the day fighting so fierce in fact that it could be heard on this side of the Border in mesad until about 4 hours ago then it seems to have ceased we haven't heard anything since we've been here but security is very tight the ti is clearly taking no chances we've got a lot of tha military presence a couple of Humvees just uh 100 meters down the road with big machine guns a grenade launcher on the back lots of soldiers on foot on the other side of the Border things look a little bit more relaxed we understand security has been passed from the the military to transitional Border guard Force they say they are there simply to ensure the peaceful transition that does seem to be happening at the moment we haven't heard uh of any U any fighting close to the Border Point people are still coming across hundreds have been fleeing the fighting during the day coming into Thailand and people are still coming across the border uh those troops say they will leave as soon as the Kent ethnic armies who've been leading this fight against the government troops uh enter this area they will back away and hand over power uh but at this stage that one remaining Battalion of government troops have not uh surrendered as I think the Kem were hoping they might do we understand there are also reinforcements coming from the provincial capital pan uh a couple of armored vehicles and 20 trucks of troops so they may be re being reinforced I think that's an indication of just how important miaw is it's a vital trade town a billion dollars worth of goods goes across this border every year and it's clearly something the military don't want to give up so the battle's still clearly ongoing there Tony but this all obviously also has Regional implications especially for Thailand who as you've said they've had to deal with people hundreds of them fleeing across that border how is Bangkok engaging on all of this well I think we've seen a slight change of policy from Bangkok which after the military coup had really been myanmar's main friend within Asen think much to the irritation of other other asan nations who felt that it was blocking asan pressure on Myanmar to try and force some kind of peace or at least some kind of transitional government um we've heard from the Tha prime minister he now recognizes that the military is in a difficult situation we've also heard from the foreign minister that Thailand is making pre operations to receive as many as a 100,000 refugees across its borders but I think Thailand will be uh trying very hard to provide temporary accommodation for people who do seek Refuge over their borders but to get them back as soon as meamar is secure and I think the hope is here that this fighting happens quickly is wrapped up and everyone can go back home Tony Chang in the thick of things for us in mot the Thai border city bordering Myanmar there thank you very very much Tony make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
