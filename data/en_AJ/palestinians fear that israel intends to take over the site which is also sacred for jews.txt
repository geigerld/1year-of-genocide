Al jazir is Muhammad Jam jum's at Damascus gate in occupied East Jerusalem he sent this update first let me just tell you what's going on behind us as you can see there's still a lot of security Personnel here uh we have started seeing worshippers that have been emerging because Friday prayer is now over so we're expecting to see more in the moments to come um we did see as Sarah mentioned a lot of men who were in younger ages of 35 and under who had been turned away not being able to access Damascus gate and get to Al AA MOS compound in the past hour hour and a half and I spoke to some of them to ask them what they were feeling some of them after they emerged waited here and off to the side where we are they gathered and they prayed they went ahead and prayed out here close to the street um other ones spoke to us and talked about the frustration that they're feeling about not being able to go in not being able to get to the Moss Compound on a day like today but also we asked them about their feelings right now in the wake of what's going on in Gaza so many of them told us about how concerned they are are about Palestinians in Gaza they're extremely concerned today because of the fact that there has been this evacuation order they say they don't know where the residents in Gaza are going to be able to go many of them said to us they believe this is going to be a humanitarian catastrophe uh one man that I spoke with also pointed out he said that he was very very dismayed and very disturbed to have seen what happened when Hamas attacked Southern Israel and he said that civilians women and children should never have been targeted another man that I spoke with said that the fact of the matter is right now the situation has grown much more perilous in his words for Palestinians he says because of what happened because of the attacks he said now the the the future for them is far more uncertain than it was and it was already very uncertain he says things are very dire now and they're very concerned that essentially they're going to be facing a much harsher reality than they already do going forward now I just want to mention again you see this stepped up security behind us we were told earlier in the day there's at least 2500 security officers officers that have been deployed to this area of occupied East Jerusalem today now that's one of the reasons we have not seen a lot of worshippers being able to access this area being able to get into the al- akamas compound um but also one of the things that we've seen people have said that they know relatives who didn't want to come out today they're concerned about the security situation they just don't know about what's going to be happening in the hours and the days ahead so it's a tenuous situation it's a tense situation it has been quiet here where we are at Damascus gate we have not seen any clashes but certainly what we've heard from people they are very worried about what's going to be happening in the days ahead
