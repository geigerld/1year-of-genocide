I'm Francis merini a student at Columbia journalism school I started covering the protest in the encampment the real first day I feel like the kind of access we had was unprecedented because really first week media was not allowed on campus so this allowed us to go there to talk with to student protesters and also to build trust with with them because they were really weary of the of the media so as we were we were reporters but we were also students and it helped us a lot the night the NYPD came into campus access was heavily restricted it was really hard to report we were all outside of the Columbia Jour School building and then at some point the police started to come towards us decided to push us inside telling us not to go out otherwise we would have been arrested it was something I've never experienced before and and didn't even think I would have experienced a situation like that that was nothing happened to us but I realized that it was potentially dangerous I think I've learned so many lessons in the last two weeks I know that it is a really polarizing topic the ongoing war in Gaza I would say taught me how to be a reporter and not an advocate because I know of course I have an opinion like everybody does and and uh also that made me realize how dangerous this job can be but at the same time I didn't change my idea about what I want to do so I still want to be a reporter make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alzer
