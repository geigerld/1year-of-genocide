discuss all of this is our senior political analysts Madan Bashar Madan very very good to see you so when we last spoke about a week ago and it was before the UN Security Council was hearing this resolution that was put forward by America that wasn't passed and one of the ideas that you talked about is that one of the ways instead of threatening Israel by with withdrawing Aid the one of the things that America would consider is giving them more military aid as an incentive and that's exactly what we've seen happen since the UN Security Council passed that resolution since the icj told Israel to allow more humanitarian Aid into Gaza it's not doing either of those things and yet the US has approved more weapons to Israel it's uh it's mind bugling uh for for an observer for an objective Observer it's mind bugling for a student of international relations and of American policy in the Middle East there's hardly anything surprising there that's why it wasn't genius on my part to predict that I think there's a pattern there in US Israel relations and in American relations with its uh uh allies around the world and usually they're not exactly the good guys they're the most autocratic regimes usually but the way the United States uses Leverage is possibly to reduce Aid especially military aid for autocratic regimes and I think the occupation regime is probably one of the most Auto ratic regimes or increase Aid military aid and I think the United States generally leans towards increasing aids for two reasons one it has even more leverage on the country and its use of that Aid that military aid two because it's very good for the military industrial complex in the United States but is it effective if the United States really wants Israel to scale down its operations in Gaza if it wants Israel to protect civilians not go into Rafa where at least 1.5 million civilians are is giving them more weapons going to deter them from doing those things that the US says they want Israel to do but does it does it the last six months has shown us that the Biden Administration speaks out of both sides of its mark on the one hand the rhetoric is we want less civilian casualties we want the genocide to be a bit humane a contradiction in term we want you to have maybe a few pauses we want you to be a bit more reasonable we're not looking good around the world our standing in the region is uh deteriorating the international public opinion is up in arms there are investigations at the icj there is a un Council un Security Council and so on so forth that's the rhetoric in reality and you have been and you and I have been looking at this for the last six months America has never stopped supporting Israel policy on the ground in real terms since October 7 from the very beginning Biden and Netanyahu agreed that they're going to have to defeat Hamas that they must defeat Hamas and that America will protect Israel if others will step in like hisbah or whoever the hthis and and America did exactly that yeah and now Israel is bombing Syria bombing hisbah and others in Syria and so on so forth but and America is increasing the military aid because America and Israel strategically speaking they are still in agreement politically speaking they might have some minor disagreements but strategically speaking unfortunately and I say that with with heavy heart that Biden has been dealing cynically with this question I was shocked today before yesterday or three days ago when President former president Obama said that Biden deals with Israel with moral Clarity moral Clarity it seems to me like more moral bankruptcy yeah it's really surprising coming from a President Obama knowing how he felt about Netanyahu was there any chance that Israel was ever going to follow a un Security Council resolution or what the international court of justice asked it to do if America was just going to increase weapons when that is perhaps the greatest leverage that the US has with Israel that's exactly what I was that's why I sounded like I was the the odd man out the past few days because I was quite you know skeptical about the UN security C resolution having any meaning or any uh effect on the ground because Israel was definitely not going to abide by it and the United States is not going to do anything about Israel not doing anything about it and in fact Israel is going to speed up its uh bombardment in Gaza and it will probably be invading Raa so not only has not that helped over the past several months but in fact everything that Netanyahu and his generals band of generals and fascists and Fanatics in the cabinet everything they said and I say that again with truly heavy heart about the crisis of humanity that we live in nowadays after 32,000 children women and civilians have have been killed is that everything they said from the very few first days in October they continue to do it today despite all the public protest despite all the intern law International Community UN resolution so on so forth everything they spoke of about the Invasion the land Invasion about the bombing about the destruction of Gaza about the heavy price that Gaza is going to pay about the fact that they're going to stay there that they're going to create a security Zone and that they're going to bring the Arabs in in order to police under their security supervision yeah all of that is happening today it is incred and all of it has been allowed to happen my one thank you very much that's our senior political IC analyst Maran bashara
