this hearing is being followed closely in the occupied Palestinian territories in Israel our correspondents are following reaction across the region hard Hamid is in rala TK abum is in Rafa in southern Gaza first we're going to go to sakarat in t Aviv so in the sort of minutes or so immediately after the the hearing ended there wasn't a great deal of reaction from Israel but I understand we're getting more lines that have been coming out now how what has the reaction been like that's right we've been hearing uh from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that's called uh this lies and he's also called it an upside down world where Israel is being accused of genocide whereas Hamas is the one that is committing genocide not just against Israelis on October the 7th but also he said against the Jewish people and he compared it to the Holocaust uh this is also a rhetoric we've heard from the defense minister yav Galant who was speaking to a camera from within the Gaza Strip to be precise from Khan Unis and he said that this is the most moral army in the world and that they have made every effort to separate uh the fighters Hamas fighters from the civilians and uh to be honest this looks like this is what Israel's case is going to be tomorrow this is the defense they're going to put forward uh showing evidence it seems this is what at least Israeli media is talking and speculating about uh showing that they had uh been dropping leaflets upon those in Gaza to evacuate their homes uh talking about their tactical operations to ensure that civilians had safe P Passage through uh those corridors and that's what they mean when they call it a moral Army but of course we know that what we've seen on the ground is very different now in terms of what the Israel media has been talking about and I tell you they've been talking about it extensively uh today is saying that uh some of those hardliners in this coalition government such as the finance Min Minister rather bzal smotrich as well as the uh uh national security minister itamar Ben gav they were both mentioned as cases that was brought forward today that we saw in the court by South Africa they believe the Israeli media has been talking saying that it's because of those Hardline um outlandish comments that have been made against Palestinians and certainly in terms of uh Israeli uh resettlements and pushing out Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip they believe that this has helped uh South Africa with its case and that's why it's been able to take it to the ha and that's been one of the biggest concerns uh so far for them is that they feel also that the world here is standing against it certainly with this here in the ha but also uh even though uh for example the US has been the biggest Ally of Israel and has in a visit by US Secretary of Anthony blinkin call it called it baseless uh it still doesn't bode well for Israel even though this is not legally binding but it will have repercussions moving forward in how it's seen by the International Community Sarah thank you very much indeed sakar talking to us from Tel Aviv well
