Israel's prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu has pledged to attack Rafa in the south of the Gaza Strip with or without a ceasefire deal with Hamas that is despite international calls for restraint 1.5 million forcibly displaced Palestinians are Sheltering in the city let's go live to Bernard Smith in occupied East Jerusalem Forest Bernard so Netanyahu adamant that the Rafa operation will go ahead despite American objections yes F not only did he say that he said ending the war before reaching our objectives is out of the question one of those objectives being the destruction of Hamas as a fighting force uh Israel believes there are still four Hamas battalions in Gaza in Rafa now only yesterday Anthony blinkin was urging Hamas to take advantage of an extraordinarily generous proposal that he said Israel was making that was asking for 33 captives less than previously in return for a large number of Palestinian prisoners plus a 40-day ceasefire followed by what was phrased a period of sustained calm the indication the suggestion being that there was going to be a very long period of quiet on offer in Gaza but now Netanyahu has come out and said he still intends to invade Rafa at some stage and in an IND indication of the pressure on him well Ben he's had a meeting with Edmar benav the farat national security minister who said says that he was promised by Netanyahu that Israel would enter Rafa promised that the war would not end and promised there would be no propagate deal and his far-right Finance Minister bazel smotrich has said in the knesset in Israel's parliament a deal with Hamas is a terrible defeat for Israel and it gives Hamas a resounding Victory on a silver platter so if Hamas was asked to consider yesterday that there was a very long period of Peace on the table the suggestions are now from the Israeli side that it's still intends to go in to Rafer at some stage thank you Bernard for that Bernard Smith live there in occupi D Jerusalem Let's cross over to hany Mahmud now who is in Rafa in the south of the Gaza Strip uh what's the mood there after netanyahu's comments honey I imagine a lot of Anguish and a lot of [Music] worry yes and it's a quiet right now received with the great deal of frustration the eyes of yesterday uh secretary blinkin made a statement about a generous offer and it made people feel that there we are very close to adila right now with listening to netanyahu's comment about not a deal whether uh whether there is a Deal or No Deal he's going to come to ra very concerning and quite frustrating for uh the vast majority of people here the 1.5 million displaced Palestinians across overcrowded RAF City since the initial weeks of of this war just making uh uh people to lose any left sense of of safety or hopes for uh for a potential uh ceasefire deal now the what makes it worse right now is people feel like they're like in a limbo right now they don't know whether there is a deal and in case there is a deal Netanyahu also promised that he's going to come to ra and invade ra which make makes the whole point of going to a deal quite pointless that there's a great deal of Angus worry and and concern and frustration as things are not clear and when we talk to people they said uh it's quite similar to all the past narratives of moving people and hurting them from one place to another for the purpose of evacuating them to Safe zones that eventually happened to be not safe at all because people were ended up in areas that they were killed in in in those safe Zone designated by the Israeli military what we look at right now is RA has been bed all these past months and is still being monitored by surveillance by drones by attack of drones by reconnaissance a crafts causing great deal of noise and and just grinding down the mental and and physical health of everyone here on top of that the Relentless attacks that almost nonstop attacks for the past months everywhere it's like it feels like n has already invaded ra City yeah the the psychological impact indeed is huge honey meanwhile uh prosecutors from the international criminal court have been interviewing I understand staff from two Palestinians uh two hospitals in the Gaza Strip um that is after the discovery of mass Graves on the ground of the two facilities hundreds of bodies were recovered from three Mass Graves on the premises of the NASA Hospital in Khan Unice this month and the remains of dozens more people were exed at alifa hospital in Gaza City after an Israeli Siege of the facility hany what more have you found out about who the ICC investigators interviewed at alifa and Naser and what about precisely what we learned so far they identies of those uh being interviewed for the IC for the purpose of investigation and collecting evidence of of what happened has not haven't been disclosed yet they are protected and given the sensitivity of the matters this this is something that people have uh suppressed over the past few weeks and the time when the Israeli military not only stormed Naser hospital and destroyed the vast majority of its facility but also it happened in aifa hospital in the past months and also in the northern area where Mass grave was discovered at a checkpoint that set up by the Israeli military what we know so far is from the reports that we did and the what what we have been able to document that hospital and from a shifa hospital it it goes very consistent with the the testimonies that we heard from nurses and medical staff and evacuees who were inside these Health Facilities when they were uh when they were under the military Siege and when they were stormed by the Israeli military they describe horrific scenes of what Israeli military did to patients injuries and evacuates inside the hospital that is that that went very very consistent with what we covered and documented on the ground and consistent with the description that was given by the civil defense department either in Khan un City or the northern part of Gaza City thank you very much for the update that's Al jazer hanim Mahmud reporting their live from Rafa in southern Gaza make sure to
