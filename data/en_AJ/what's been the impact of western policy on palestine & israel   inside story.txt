the West has United in backing Israel since Saturday's armed attack by Hamas and Western governments have avoided criticizing the Intensive Israeli bombing of Gaza so how is Western policy towards Israel and Palestine over decades affecting the conflict today this is Inside [Music] Story hello there I'm James Bay the death toll in the Gaza War continues to rise as Israel pounds Palestinians with its intensive bombing of densely populated areas since Israel was founded in 1948 the United States has been its staunchest Ally sentiments expressed by the US president after Hamas gunman killed hundreds of Israelis on Saturday my commitment to Israel's security and the safety of the Jewish people is unshakable the United States has Israel's back and we're going to be working on this all through the day and Beyond the UK is another of Israel's strongest political and Military backers and has pledged to continue with its intelligence and security support we already have a very longstanding relationship with Israel we're one of their strongest allies we've provided in the past the T kinds of equipment that they've used to defend themselves uh over the past couple of days and as I said to the Prime Minister we will continue to provide whether that diplomatic intelligence or security support as they need shortly after Saturday's attack the EU commission president Ursula V deline was quick to support Israel in a tweet she said I spoke to my friend president Isaac Herzog and conveyed to him my full support to Israel in the face of today's terrorist attack by Hamas I re reiterate that Israel has the right to self-defense the EU Mourns the victims of these senseless attacks and stands by Israel today and in the next week the the US and the EU have also provided financial and humanitarian support to Palestinians but that's coming under pressure and increased scrutiny since the events last weekend the Biden administration's provided about half a billion dollars in funding since most was frozen by the previous president Donald Trump hours after the attack by Hamas a European commissioner declared more than $700 Million worth of EU Aid to Palestinians would be cut but the EU has since clarified that funding will continue for so now let's bring in our panel of guests to discuss it all in Doha Abdullah Al Arian associate professor of history at Georgetown University in katar he's a specialist on us Middle East policy in Rome is Maria Louisa Fant tapier head of Middle Eastern Africa program for the Italian Think Tank Instituto afari Internationale and in Dublin is Richard Boyd Barrett a member of the Irish Parliament with the people before profit party a warm welcome to you all right I would like to start with you Abdullah if I can right at the beginning and the basics perhaps no surprise at all Israel is staunchly being backed by the US yeah I mean and as you say there's no surprise really in this policy this is something that has been part and parcel of US foreign policy in this region for quite some time but I would like to focus on wa maybe what some of the differences are I think what we're seeing really over the course of the past decade or so has been a complete abandonment even of any pretense of big becoming a so-called honest broker we know the US never uh effectively managed to offer uh you know the Palestinians of course being um you know completely uh you know denied their own Liberation their own State there was a thought in the 199s that the United States could sponsor or process the the so-called Oslo Accords as a means of providing them with statehood but from the very beginning I mean really going back to the mid 90s it was very clear that Israel had no intention of actually delivering on this two two-state solution and instead use that opportunity of pacif from the Palestinian side to double and triple the number of settlements and so expansion across all of the Palestinian territories and then of course later on once we get into the mid uh early to mid-2000s we see this blockade of Gaza beginning and the kind of encirclement and besiegement of what is now over two million people population and so I think what's really distinct about the last decade in particular you know going back maybe to the late Obama periods who then of course under Donald Trump who everyone saw as being a kind of very exceptional uh president as as one who sort of says out loud what most US policy makers would never dare to speak is that he cared nothing whatsoever for the plight of Palestinians he completely circumvented and bypassed any demands and kept them basically in the exact same situation that they continued to be in and instead focused on this idea of normalization between Israel and a number of Arab states all of whom of course found mutual benefits in that Arrangement under a kind of us Regional security umbrella um and along with it of course all of the major economic benefits and so in the meantime the Palestinian question was no longer even on the back burner it simply didn't exist there has been no discussion whatsoever and then we get to the Biden Administration and they simply inherited the Trump foreign policy to the Middle East we've seen no distinction between what Trump was doing uh you know the Biden Administration endorsed the move of the US Embassy to Jerusalem which was an incredible volatile move and a and a very daring move in a way in terms of upsetting what had been seen at that point as being something of a no-go because of the fact that Jerusalem continues to be uh considered occupied territory by the UN by international law and then of course we see this push to double down on the normalization agreements between Israel and now with Saudi Arabia which is kind of the big fish in all of this so I think there is something to be said about the fact that US policy has gotten even more staunchly um you know in in opposition to any notion that there should be anything of a settlement for Palestinians who continue to be stateless and and very much um stuck in this kind of apartheid situation Maria um let me just ask you you could say what we're seeing on our screens is what we've seen play out many times before in Gaza but there are big differences too the scale of the Israeli casualties the largest loss of of life and an attack in the country's history the tactics that were used by mass and also how important do you think is the fact that this time there are captives inside Gaza no definitely I mean this is uh something uh that is quite unprecedented and uh in terms of like the level of uh infiltrations within like the the Israeli territory and I think to a certain extent it's a it's something that came also as a shock to the Western and European public opinion and this is why also there has been such sort of schizophrenic responses also from the EU institution to a certain extent because the level of the violence has been so uh shocking to the public that then this has created a very emotional response to a certain to a certain extent and um definitely uh the you has been always uh like supporting the idea of the two-state solution but I think that uh the problem has been that the first uh the first responses were actually much more uh inclined towards showing solidarity towards Israel which is normal but however I think there has been a mismanagement in the communication also because uh this has created some confusion on what actually on where the EU stands Vis A of of this conflict um so a lot of emotions and a little attention I think for the what has been the EU strategy towards this conflict for for many year in terms of EU approach and EU responses in the early days of this conflict Richard you are also in an EU Capital like Maria um I want to come back to the EU if I may does that emotion that Maria talks about does that explain the fact that early White House statements seem to lack any of the usual cuse calls for proportionate response or exercise of restraint yes um I think that is the case and uh I mean take for example our Minister for foreign affairs yesterday where he was being interviewed as I was uh on the radio and he felt able to say that Israel was acting in self-defense uh so when he was questioned about Israel's threats to uh starve Gaza and all its population of water of energy of uh food he he he could use terminology like self-defense and obviously I you know I challenge that very very strongly and said that this was not self-defense and the threat to collectively punish 2.2 million people to uh you know bombard with massive artillery strikes um the most densely populated residential area in the world were war crimes uh it it they if you like we those who were speaking on behalf of Palestinians were being put on the defensive uh so I think there's the United States and Israel feel emboldened to be able to act with greater impunity than they might otherwise uh feel um and uh we're seeing that you know with the extraordinary explicit and Brazen Threat by Israel to commit and indeed they've started to commit war crimes um in front of the eyes of the world and say explicitly that what they're going to do which is by any de definition is a war crime that they're just going to do it anyway and the United States stands firmly behind them and many if not most of the European union leaders uh equally sort of giving legitimacy to what Israel is doing so it really is shocking when of course the truth of the matter is that uh what happened and it you know the loss of life is terrible and everybody is is opposed by this escalation of violence but certainly I think I feel and many people would feel none of what happened at theend could have happened were it not for a 177e long Siege on Gaza the extraordinary sort of escalation of the war on the Palestinians by the Israeli this particularly vicious Israeli government uh of Netanyahu smotrich and Ben giver but that is that is the real context uh is the is the ongoing crimes against humanity being committed against the Palestinians but there is no doubt that uh Israel feels emboldened at the moment as do its major backers so Richard has just laid out the narrative as he sees it in the context there Abdullah but just tell us a bit about how this is seen in the US because you study the US and its policy towards the Middle East I mean I watch Us Media as well in fact I I I live most of the time in New York although I'm currently in Doha 22 US citizens killed 17 missing and may be held prisoner do you think the prisoner part of it and the world word hostage is the one that's being used in the US media do you think that perhaps explains some of of of of of the reporting and then some of the actions by the administration well certainly I think you know part of it is the media coverage I think there's a narrative that immediately takes hold the moment events like this um you know happen and that narrative tends to in in a kind of a very uh one-dimensional way you know paint one side as an aggressor paint one side as victim and then erase all history all context all even recent events as if you know everything just sort of occurs in this bubble in this vacum on the day of of you know these these horrific events and so I think can I ask you can I ask you the historical context of of hostage crisis I mean I'm going a long way back to 1979 but in fact um you know President Biden was one of the closest supporters of President Carter do you think that historical Echo May perhaps explain why why the occupant of The West Wing is pursuing the policy he is I don't know that that that would necessarily be the connection I mean I think in general there's been seen as this massive support for Israel in particular because let's not forget there are Palestinian Americans that are constantly being victimized that are constantly being oppressed that are being killed by Israel right we we know the case of your colleague sharen abaka who's a Palestinian American journalist and if you look at uh all of the attempt by the family to go and seek any kind of Investigation on the part of the us into her killing by Israel last year um there was almost no response right and the US Secretary of State who's now flying to Israel to to have conversations about the safety and return of Israeli Americans could never do the same for Palestinian Americans I think that's a there's a fair question there as far as why is this always been the case why is there a double standard why are some American citizen lives um you know worth less than other others I think this is this is certainly something that comes out of a much deeper Affinity that the US has always had with the state of Israel irrespective of its actions irrespective of as we've seen there's now a growing International consensus about the fact that there's an apartheid system that's in place about the fact that we've seen violence of this scale um on multiple other occasions although now certainly it's been ramped up even further in in in large part because of the US offering a kind of a green light that we've never really seen um up to this point and even in terms of the the violence that we're seeing it's not just in Gaza but even going into uh the West Bank with some of the shooting sprees that we're hearing about in terms of of um you know Palestinians who are essentially escaping some of these kinds of Revenge attacks that we've seen so I think that there's a there's a bigger deeper context here that seems to be ignored we don't hear about most of this in the US media and public opinion and sympathies have certainly aligned in a very particular kind of way that is very much in keeping with the longer standing narrative the dehumanization a Palestinians the idea that you can have officials both in the US and in Israel um make you know incredibly dehumanizing racist genocidal remarks and it goes completely un un uh responded to right or the media does not make any kind of an attempt to challenge any of those narratives well let me bring that up with Richard I mean some of the things you probably heard uh from across the Atlantic uh parallels with 911 Senator Lindsey Graham we're in a religious war and I unapologetically stand with Israel at a news conference in recent hours the US Secretary of State and the Israeli Prime Minister saying Hamas is the same as Dash or or isil whatever you call it what do you make of all of that that sort of language yeah well I mean I think Abdul is absolutely right I I mean I I think public opinion over the last number of years has increasingly become aware of the the apar nature of the Israeli regime of its H its you know ongoing campaigns of ethnic cleansing uh it its disfunctional and sort of uh abnormal character has been highlighted by the Amnesty International reports and Human Rights Watch reports and other reports about the aparte nature of that state um so on the one hand Israel has been delegitimized in the minds of millions of people but now uh Israel and its backers feel they have an opportunity to push back against all of that and again as Abdullah said it's like they start the clock of this story at what happened over the weekend as if there is no other context uh and uh they rely on you know the lack of knowledge or information or awareness of the background and history to all of this uh of of of significant SE ctions of the public in the United States and in Europe to kind of you know ignore all of that history uh so it it all just started at the weekend now I think you know we all know that's not true um in fact I will give credit to the Irish president Mary Robinson the former Irish president she was being interviewed on the radio uh just about an hour ago I was listening to her and she was making the point that during the summer she warned that if the siege of Gaza was wasn't lifted if the impunity Israel was enjoying in terms of the ethnic cleansing the illegal settlements the ongoing brutal occupation if these matters were not going to be addressed by the International Community that she feared and this was during the summer that we were facing into a terrifying escalation of violence an uncontrollable I think escalation of violence and she was absolutely right and that is the context but of course Israel the United States their backers in Europe want to pretend that there was no history to all of this and it All Began uh with the events of the weekend and they are trying to use that then to justify an even more Savage uh escalation of the war on Gaza and on the Palestinians generally Maria I'd like to put to you the point that Abdullah made earlier on that this is a complete indictment of the Biden strategy on the Israeli Palestinian conflict which seems to have been as he said a continuation of the Trump strategy and it basically was to ignore the Palestinians to go around the Palestinians try and get an economic peace um with Arab countries um what's your view of how that strategy has played out I think that it has played out in a tragic uh way in the sense that uh despite definitely there are local causes to this conflict that is latent is ongoing from several decades however there is a regional context in which this attack took place and the regional context is uh one which for several weeks and for several months there has been enormous pressure exerted by by Washington on uh on Saudi Arabia and uh on the gulf in general but on Saudi Arabia in particular to obviously go ahead with this normalization deal so um which if uh between Saudi Arabia and Israel so if this uh normalization deal um which could have happened against Saudi Arabia receiving a certain amount of military uh uh military uh infrastructure if this deal would have happened obviously the Palestinian issue would have been I think obliterated completely from the uh from the from the discussion because despite the Saudi wish or uh statements that they wanted to deliver something on this it seems to be that actually in Tel Aviv there was no in Jerusalem there was no actually wishes from the netan government to actually deliver anything on this so the Israelis obviously were convinced that the Saudis could be okay just with with the military deal the Washington administration probably thought the same and that obviously has created a push back it has created a push back I believe not only uh from local movements like Hamas but also I think from uh many other Regional players who did not want this C to disappear from the debate so I think that the am the attack of amas in some way re brings back the Palestinian issue at the very center of the regional equilibrium at the moment in which it risks to be totally um deleted but it is important to say that part of this tragic event is also I think the indirect and even uh indirect result of a US strategy which really forced the hand of this normalization and didn't uh understand that in order to to achieve normalization you needed time you needed concession but they didn't have time because there was the presidential election and they didn't want to um make concession or they didn't want to pressure the Israeli government to make concession it seems and so the result has been obviously a push back so I think that somehow if you compare this approach with what we have seen over the past months the Chinese approach which has been that one of trying to actually um bro break broke a deal between Regional Rivals such as Saudi Arabia and Iran it almost comes to the point of saying that the Chinese strategy has been in so far maybe more successful so uh I think that really there is a lot of rethinking of how Washington moves uh when it comes to uh to normalization I think that normalization could be possible but not without some steps forwards on the Palestinian issue which is substantial step forwards Abdullah we see secretary blinkin in the region now um he's not looking at the big picture he's showing support for Israel but he's also focusing and we he talk about humanitarian cor corridors and passage there's already been detailed negotiations we understand between the Israelis and the Egyptians and the US now reported that the secretary of state will be coming to Qatar um but I'm also hearing reports that Egypt's not allowing a mass movement of people into its territory could we be looking at as some sort of deal where dual Nationals us Nationals we think they're about five or 600 are allowed out out of Rafa and the rest of the population of Gaza gets stuck there I mean I I don't think we have any indication of that as of yet that there's a specific concern for for US citizens there certainly there hasn't been over the course of almost a week of of incessant carpet bombing of the entire territory of Gaza um you know I and I think in terms of what the response has been for people who have attempted to go to the border of course we've seen um you know instances of of Israel actually bombing the crossing and so people who were attempting to cross at that point then there's also been of course uh the denial by Israel and the threats made that if Egypt were to try to offer Aid to enter into Gaza that they would also be bombing that those eight convoys so you know there there really is a question here about who even controls uh the territory the border between Gaza or Palestine and Egypt and I think that's you know and there's another point that I think is worth considering which is going back to to kind of the previous conversation about the view of these normalization agreements from the Arab side as as well because I do think that that you know we have transitioned from a period in which you know many of the Region's rulers would at least pay lip service to the notion of the Palestine issue to the point where it gets completely erased and I think that's because the nature of how legitimization of these regimes happens has changed substantially in the aftermath of the Arab Spring uprisings and so now we're looking at over a decade from that period in which many of these governments are ruling their own populations quite ruthlessly so it's not surprising that they would not even entertain the notion of of justice for Palestinians and so I think this has actually in some ways Eed the process by these normalization deals can happen Maria back to you we' seen the responses of the US and the EU and on paper they look very similar but do you think within the EU Camp there is perhaps some unease behind the scenes certainly before the latest events over the last 18 months in my day job at the United Nations speaking to EU politicians EU diplomats who are who showing real disart about the Israeli most right-wing government and some of its activities oh definitely there are different me I mean different member states have also different policies or different approaches there has been definitely a discomfort with uh the netan government and the retrenchment of democratic freedoms in Israel but I think that overall there has been always um I mean the discussion about uh supporting the Israeli concerns when it comes to security concerns of of Israel this is is is something that is always present but I think that the other question to ask is more of what role for the EU also in this situation because after this very confusing response where one commissioner came out saying we will have to cut the aid the develop the humanitarian Aid to the pales territories then you know there has been um a going back to this position and say no we will not and then so there has been a very confusing response in the first days I think that however now the EU is in in the interest of the EU and in the interest also of the United States to really avoid um the regionalization of this conflict and therefore this is why such emotional response uh and polarizing tone on the conflict are not helping I think that the EU should sort of rethink its approach reinvest really into the what has been like the two-state solution idea but also and most importantly on the idea of how to um start the leveraging on those Regional players especially in the golf who actually do not want a regionalization of the conflict engage with them um and uh try to really um sort of support a containment of this of this conflict if we can say so and not it's spread out across the reg let me put that put that to Richard because you are just one individual EU politicians what should individual politicians what should members of the public do very quickly to end our conversation well I I mean certainly what I'm doing and others like mind are trying to say in the face of people being horrified at what they are looking at this terrible escalation of violence that we have to get to the root cause that if if this is not going to get even worse uh and continue forever uh that we need to get to the root cause and uh in my view and certainly what I have been arguing very strongly and I think many others are is that the root cause of this is uh the aparte nature of the Israeli State the colonialist nature of the Israeli state that it is based on the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians on the denial of their most basic rights the rights to return uh the right to self-determination uh that it is based entirely on the ruthless uh brutal and murderous suppression of Palestinian rights and that this in the same way as aparte South Africa was not acceptable uh and a movement eventually of resistance inside South Africa as well as internationally finally led to the dismantling of the uh that regime that that is the only way we are going to get peace and Justice uh in Palestine thank you Richard thank you to all our guests to Maria Louisa Vanier Abdullah Al Aran and Richard Boyd Barrett a fascinating conversation if you didn't catch it all you can see it again on the website al.com on this show we discuss
