well aler is Hy Mahmud joins us live now from Rafa in southern Gaza hany so this new UN resolution calls for more Aid to get into Gaza what are people there saying and what sort of a difference will it make on the ground do you think yes Darren well so far there is a sense of a frustration and and Devastation over the fact that this resolution did not include not even a word about a permanent ceasefire because as of now people are still being killed at a record number and they were looking for something that protects their life from the unpredictable uh Fallen bombs uh on their homes there are more residential home being destroyed more people are being killed more public facilities are being destroyed the situations on the ground and when we just run an assessment of in terms of Logistics in terms of a crew uh members who are working with with the humanitarian Aid in terms of a supply chain mechanism it all almost does do not exist on the ground and helps with the delivery of the and just for the sake of argument people are saying in terms of those more increased uh amount of humanitarian are you are they going to make it to the northern part and Gaza City or is it going to be limited only to the southern part I mean within the past two two uh days we heard about the a large amount of food insecurity across the G trip and imminent starvation those uh numbers and Analysis suggested that part of the G trip is in fact is uh is facing imminent uh famine uh due to extreme shortage uh of Food Supplies water and medical supplies and other survival items the bottom line here there's is a sense of U of of depression because what people as of now they're looking for something that protects their life not only uh not only uh receiving uh more Aid they want this along with the permanent uh seiz fire because for a large portion of the population in Gaza when they heard about the the resolution uh is they said this is again a repeat of the pause the past pauses that happen and more of a a reprieve time they're going to be killed while they are full this time not hungry yeah honey and as you say uh Israeli air strikes continue across Gaza both North and South hitting several refugee camps what More's been happening M well yesterday's all day long and and overnight the more Relentless air strik concentrated in the central part of the Gaza Strip mainly refugee camps at the Eastern uh side of of the Gaza Strip mainly at the Eastern side of Salah Road we're talking about a a combined population that were ordered uh to EV evacuate in a preparation for Mass bombardment we're looking at a little over 150,000 people were ordered to leave those area but overnight as people started to move uh at at early evening hours uh the large part of these neighborhoods were targeted destroyed more of infrastructure and more of a residential blocks were targeted directly and destroyed creating more uh displaced Palestinians who uh ended up going to uh the again the designated safe area by the Israeli military in their unfortunately this very particular area came under uh heavy bombardment on artillery Shillings out of of this of early hour of this morning it completely shatters any sense of of Safety and Security and once again uh people uh are reacting to this by saying they have the those those narrative about designated safe area are contradictory vague and confusing for them as of now they're confirmed there is no safe area across the Gaza STP all right Han mmud live for us there in Rafa in southern Gaza hany thank you
