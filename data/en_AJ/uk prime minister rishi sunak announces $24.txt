in the last hour the United Kingdom has said it will provide an additional $24.5 million in Aid to Gaza the United Kingdom's foreign secretary James cleverly joins us now live from Westminster Mr cleverly thank you so much for your time with us here on Al jazer your government is offering a substantial Aid package for Gaza some 20 million pound but the people of Gaza would need much less Aid trucked across the border if Israel simply turned on the water and electricity they have the power to do that on a grid that they designed is prime minister Rishi sunak asking Netanyahu to do that well uh thank you and as you say the Prime Minister just a few minutes ago announced an additional 20 million pound in humanitarian support for the people of Gaza that is on top of the 10 million uh that we announced uh uh last week and on top of the 27 million which was our pre-existing commitment to humanitarian support in Gaza we are trying to alleviate the plight of the Palestinian people uh in Gaza and I recognize the uh the uh the situation for them is is difficult and of course sadly we have seen uh the water pipes that uh have been previously funded by the EU videos of those water pipes being torn up by Hamas and turned into Rockets to fire into Israel we have seen fuel that could go to uh electricity de generators and the desalination pants being used to facilitate the attacks going into Israel of course of course we want the suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza to stop as quickly as possible and the quicker that Israel can be reassured of its self uh uh defense and its security the quicker the suffering of the people of Gaza can be brought to a Hal so foreign secretary just for clarity there the British government is not asking Israel to turn the water or the electricity back on what we have said is that in all the actions that Israel takes they should be conscious of the plight of civilians they should do everything they can to pre to preserve a civilian life we are of course seeking to uh ensure that that is the case we've had those conversations uh with Israel uh Israel have uh made the decisions about how that they how they will conduct the military operations uh in Gaza that's a decision for them to make but in all our interactions with Israel we reinforce the importance of international law and the preservation of civilian life uh foreign secretary you mentioned fuel there some very limited Aid we know has been allowed in but not fuel the United Nations has put out a call Martin Griffith himself the un's aid Chief has asked for fuel to be included in the these Aid deliveries UNICEF for instance is warning that over 100 newborn babies and incubators will die if they can't be powered are you urging Israel to consider letting fuel in on some of these a trucks well of course Israel is not the only decision maker with regards to the facilitation of humanitarian Aid uh as you uh as you alluded to into your uh introduction the United Kingdom has been very very significant in its Aid donations to support the Palestinian people in Gaza we want to see that Aid and all the aid that's needed all the types of Aid that is needed getting to the people uh in Gaza that's not just a decision for the Israelis it is of course a decision also uh for Hamas and the other people who are the de de facto controllers of Gaza and we liay very very closely with Egypt who manage the Rafa Crossing and the international uh Community to try and make make sure that Aid in significant numbers get to the people that need it so sorry foreign secret just to clarify your last statement there the UN is calling for fuel to be included in those Aid deliveries which are being also facilitated by the international Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations is the UK asking in your diplomatic Channels with Israel for fuel to be included well what we have what we are doing is we are leing very very closely with the United Nations uh my colleague and friend Andrew Mitchell who is the development Minister uh on behalf of the British government is leasing with uh Martin Griffiths of of the uh un humanitarian organization on what is needed by the Palestinian people in Gaza we're looking to support that but also as I say the decisions about what Aid in what volumes is a decision that the UK is not uh directly able to make but we do uh we do speak with uh the decision makers in the region to try and make sure that the Palestine people in Gaza get the aid that they need sure um foreign secretary let me ask you about something that prime minister sunak has said in the last hour he stated that your government has Intelligence that the devastating blast at the alaki hospital was caused by a rocket from the Gaza Strip can you elaborate on what evidence you have and if you'll be sharing it with the International Community well we have used uh the uh the evidence that is already in the public domain allied with the intelligence analysts that we have here in the United Kingdom and of course uh uh British weapons experts our assessment our thoughtful balanced assessment is that the likelihood is that this was done by a rocket or part of a rocket emanating from Gaza directed at Israel and is unlik likely to have been caused by Israeli military action that is the information that the uh prime minister gave to the house and that is based on our assessment of the information which is already in the public domain okay foreign secretary let me ask you a little bit about diplomacy we were talking a little bit about it there in terms of aid but when it comes to the security Council for instance I believe the United States has come up with a a new draft resolution suggesting the possibility of humanitarian pauses humanitarian corridors will the UK vote in favor of such a resolution well we we always look at the specific details of a resolution before we make the final decision about voting we worked extensively with the Brazilians uh on their wording in the end the UK's assessment was the wording did not quite go far enough of course we will work with the United States of America on the wording of their resolution to try and find something which is is able to reflect the uh Collective opinion of the International Community but any voting decision will be based on the specific content of the text of the Revolution resolution rather and that is always the uh uh yard stick that the UK uses for deciding our votes at the United Nations of course foreign secretary then let me ask you a specific question about humanitarian pauses does the United Kingdom currently believe that humanitarian pauses and humanitarian corridors are currently needed well of course in order to facilitate humanitarian uh support in order for uh people to get hold of what they need they need to feel safe and they need to feel safe uh for a realistic amount of time but their safety is not in any one organization's hands uh there have been extensive rocket fires from Gaza initiated by Hamas and others into Israel of course in Israel are responding to those attacks and the terrorist attacks on the 7th of October if we can create a situation where there is a pause a genuine pause to facilitate humanitarian access of course we will be supporting of that but of course that does need to be in both directions and there needs to be a credible belief that not only will uh uh Israel not be uh conducting military operations in Gaza but no operations will be conducted from Gaza that is the challenge that we have here at creating these humanitarian pauses so FR secretary if I heard you correctly there you're saying that the United Kingdom would be in favor of a humanitarian pause if both Israel and Hamas agree not to launch things at each other so if there is a resolution calling for a humanitarian pause from both sides that's something the UK would be in support of well as I say I'm not going to commit to our voting pattern without seeing the specific wording of a resolution and calling for something and achieving it are very different things and that's uh the work of the United Nations of course is important but that is also why we fly to the region the Prime Minister was there I was there that is why we speak uh directly where we can to decision makers because the the the reality on the ground has to facilitate that humanitarian access and calling for things uh at the United Nations without the accompanying direct diplomacy in the region will not get us what we want and what we want is for the people of uh Gaza the Palestinians of Gaza to receive that humanitarian Aid one of the issues that was raised around the Brazilian resolution in the security Council was the lack of language around Israel's right to defend itself the UK has always said that Israel has the right to defend itself we now know there are 5,000 people dead in Gaza more than half of them women and children do you regard that as legitimate defense well firstly I would I would say that we have to remember that Israel is responding to the largest terrorist attack in their history the largest loss of life at a single event since the end of the Holocaust and continued attacks from Gaza into Israel so uh we must never lose sight of what uh initiated this uh latest military operation we have always said we respect and support Israel's right to self-defense and we have always said that they should do so in strict accordance to uh international law we also recognize we've seen uh evidence of this on multiple occasions that where Israel has sought to warn civilian populations about where military action is about to take place Hamas have actively prevented Palestinians from leaving those areas of danger uh now clearly the loss of life the the the loss of Palestinian civilian life is heartbreaking just as heartbreaking as a loss of Israeli lives in October the 7th and since we want to bring this to a conclusion of course we do we want to prevent further escalation of course we do but we also need to respect Israel's right to defend itself against the brutality that we saw two weeks ago the British foreign secretary there James cleverly joining us from Westminster and London thank you so much sir for spending this time with us on Al jazer well let's now bring in Sultan Barakat he's a professor of public policy at hammad bin Khalifa University he joins us now in our studio in Doha Sultan last hour we were talking about Western countries Western backers of Israel and whether or not their their tone on this has shifted what did you make of what Mr clevy had to say uh it was very disappointing to be honest and it I'm not sure who's briefing him but he he got a lot of things wrong uh the reference to the diversion of fuel has not been verified by any other organization the business about the desination uh plant is been dismantled and used for missiles Israel for 14 years has had a very very strict regime on anything that comes into the Gaza Strip no pipe has been allowed in that can be used dual Ed with the same you know the quality of the casting and so on so whatever this story I don't know where it came from it's not true that plan took years to build and it was paid for by the European Union and some Scandinavian countries so uh that is not not the case also the uh the uh reference to uh Hamas preventing Palestinians from moving from North to the South I don't know where he's been I mean I has he not watched the news to they not give him accurate briefing how can Hamas come on the streets to prevent the Palestinians from moving we all saw the Palestinians making the move they couldn't go anywhere they were bombed we all uh followed the stories about the hospitals how can you evacuate hospitals has Britain done anything to EV evacuate those hospitals nothing and finally I think this idea that it is sufficient for a superpower United Kingdom one of the five permanent members to only call on Israel to have a conscious uh uh awareness of the blight of the Palestinians I think it's ridiculous to be honest and I'm very very disappointed and when you contrast the same statement the same uh State people uh two years ago when they were talking about uh Ukraine it's in it's two different worlds and this is why uh I find it very worrying not because of what's going on in Gaza it's because of the hatred that is now Brewing all over the world uh towards the west and in particular has right to protect itself we know that it says that in the law but also the law says Israel cannot and should not Target civilians to Simply ask them to avoid civilians to moderate their attacks is not good enough Security Council they don't need to argue over the the definitions the only thing they need to say Israel has got to respect international law full stop Sultan Barak there professor of public policy at hammad bin Khalifa University always great to get your thoughts here and studio in Doha thank you sultan
