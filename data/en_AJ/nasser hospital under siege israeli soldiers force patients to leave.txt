well we can now speak to Tess Ingram she's a spokesperson for Unicef she joins us now from un headquarters in New York Tess thanks for joining us on our deser I understand you were in Gaza last month can you talk us through what you and your teams are seeing there now are the situations very different between the North and South they're incredibly different uh the situation in the South which we're able to uh provide some limited Aid and also have some access to there's uh you know some level of food all of the families that I met and spoke to said that they were incredibly hungry but they are able to access uh tinned vegetables from Aid packages and and perhaps bread from a community fire uh food is limited and the diversity in that food is not enough nutrition for for children to grow up healthy and strong but in the north the situation is is even worse uh unbelievably because Aid access to the north has basically been non-existent since the beginning of this year we haven't received the safety assurance is that we need to get up into the North and provide Aid there and what we're hearing from families on the ground in the north is is that hunger is is catastrophic and people are resorting to to non-human foods to to try and survive uh just really harrowing stories that we've been getting I've been wondering what's actually getting across the border at the moment me it feels like restrictions have increased over the last days and weeks what reason are Israeli forces actually giving to Aid workers for for turning trucks back so it's it's uh very opaque we we do our best to try and get as much Aid in as we can but the process for screening at that border is is very complex and it's very long and one of the challenges that we have is is when we kind of surrender trucks to that screening process we don't know when they're going to arrive on the other side which makes it very difficult for us to plan the distribution and then once we do receive the goods we then have to battle with the ongoing security challenges on the ground the lack of trucks fuel the damage to the roads so it's incredibly difficult for us to move around even more so now with the the threat of a grand invasion in Rafa Tess just in terms of of clarity can you give us a sense of what's gotten in in terms of aid over the last few days we're hearing that barely anything especially in terms of food has made it made it into the strip at all yeah so I know that we've definitely um got a couple of trucks in but supplies have been really far lower than the needs uh at the moment UNICEF is bringing in um nutrition supplies like uh therapeutic food and an infant formula but far more needs to come in than than what's coming in at the moment and I know it's the same for other agencies like wfp which brings in things like flour sure well let me ask you then about the impact on pregnant women and children last month your agency issued a a warning about child wasting can you explain that for our viewers yeah child wasting is the most severe form of of um childhood malnutrition um and it's basically when children just don't get enough of the essential nutrients that they need in in order to be healthy it's compounded by a lack of clean water and of disease so at the moment we're seeing this real triple threat in the Gaza Strip where um children are dehydrated they're hungry and they're sick they're living in really poor conditions and we're really worried that for the 335,000 children under five in the Gaza Strip that the rates of of malnutrition are going to increase in the coming weeks including of that really severe form of malnutrition C wasting which will have ongoing effects for for their lives before we move on I do want to ask you about funding right now for unra obviously a lot of it's been suspended is it affecting other a agencies un agencies in Gaza like yours given the fact that they were coordinating so much of the aid delivery it would be catastrophic uh for the Gaza Strip and for operations of other agencies like UNICEF if an wasn't able to completely function in the Gaza Strip um we we work with them very closely on on many things like a distribution and and vaccinating children um it's not you know it's not having an impact yet but it certainly could if as unra has warned that they would have to wind back operations as as soon as the end of this month M so your agency test UNICEF along with the world food program and I see the who have issued a call on the need to change the flow of humanitarian Aid I I see that you're asking for access to Ash ashod port in the north where could other border crossing points be how could you change things so we we are restricted at the moment to to two uh Crossing points into the Gaza Strip and there are other points that were operational you know before the escalation in hostilities that we would like to see return to operations so that we can get more Aid in but it's not just a matter of getting more Aid in we then need to be able to to um have that Aid come in faster with less restrictions there's still um equipment that we'd like to bring in that we can't get in like for example generators uh we've had generators sitting at the southernmost Crossing for for weeks now um and they're so essential to running um Water Systems uh and sanitation systems that ensure that the people of Gaza can have clean water so we need more Aid we need you know different types of Aid and then we need the assurances on the inside to distribute that safely of course Tess Ingram there spokesperson for Unicef speaking to us from un headquarters in New York thanks so much for joining us on Al zero
