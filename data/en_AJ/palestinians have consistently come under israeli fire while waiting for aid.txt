Israeli forces have again opened fire on Palestinians trying to get food in Northern [Applause] Gaza the crowds come under Fire from guns and tanks as they gather to obtain FL in the Arid Road near Gaza City on Monday Israeli forces have fired in crowds trying to get Aid several times in the past the un's food agency says it recently suspended Aid deliveries to the north because of the violence Al mm is joining us now from Rafa satanic was just mentioning a moment ago about the kind of struggles that people have to try to get humanitarian Aid even if it is air drop to focus through what is happening where you are in those efforts to try to get Aid yes Rob well this is not a newly born issue it has started at initial weeks of the this genocidal War when the Israeli defense minister imposed a total Siege across the G Gaza Tri preventing anything from coming into Gaza in terms of Food Supplies Fuel and medical supplies and other survival items needed and now coupled with intense bombing campaign not only we're seeing the great deal of Devastation caused by the ongoing bombing but also the fact that markets have been are depleted from basic supplies hospitals across the G STP are suffering from extreme shortage of of medical supplies and in a scarce amount of of necessarily than desperately needed amounts of of survival items but also right now the uh the famine the famine that has been caused by the ongoing bombing campaign have forced people to to uh to eat plants and eat animals feed just to stay alive in the northern part and Gaza City here in over crowded ra City not only we're seeing a children roaming these rubbles filled roads looking for scraps of food what at the same time those who are somehow well off and have the cash flow necessary for buying food struggle to find basic supplies in the market so it's not an issue for some people it's not an issue of money as much as the availability of goods in the market and but for the vast majority of people it's a combined issue with the lack of financial capabilities but at the same time the lack of of basic supplies and particularly when we look at the number and the amount of a humanitarian Aid being allowed into the Gaza Strip is just is nothing compared to the actual need uh that people right now they they look forward to having an every in each passing day just to survive these difficult conditions and meantime of course the Israeli attacks continue talk us through the latest well at this particular time I can't really recall any draining time more than these hours as they're growing reports of a potential deal but at the same time it's growing a threats of a ground Invasion to RAF City and also reports of Hamas spokesperson talking that these leaked to FR Mor is not what the Palestinian are looking forward to having just mixed feelings here optimistic but very cautious about what's going to happen at the same time they are enduring intense bombing campaign here in Rafa City and the central area just within the past couple hours we' seen ins surging the artillery Shing of the eastern part of the Central Area including D bah Al B refugee camp Al magazi where more than 10 people reported with different injuries to alaka hospital in overnight attacks in raah City eight people being killed displaced family included in this attack uh and also the children of the owner of the residential homes another uh residential home in Al barazer neighborhood that's the eastern part of raah city where one person reported killed and uh more than seven injuries also reported to a naar hospital now there is this cycle of uncertainty but at the same time growing panic and fear as the bombing continues and the killing continues across the STP H Mahmud in Rafa Hy thank you very much
