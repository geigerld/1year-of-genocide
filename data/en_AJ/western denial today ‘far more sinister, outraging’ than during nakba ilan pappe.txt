during the 1940s more than 15,000 Palestinians were killed in dozens of massacres committed by Zionist forces the first mass killing was recorded at balad Al where at least 60 Palestinians were killed by the hagana forces in April 1948 an estimated 110 villagers were murdered by Zionist paramilitary forces in the village of De Yasin near what is now occupied East Jerusalem but the killings didn't stop there after Israel was created at least 200 V were reportedly killed in fighting and Max executions between May the 22nd and 23rd in 1948 at tantura near haa Ilan Pape an Israeli historian who wrote the book the ethnic cleansing of Palestine he's a professor of history at the University of exiter and joins us now from Detroit in the US good to have you with us sir on the program how should we compare what happened how should we compare what happened in 19 48 to 2024 is it comparable well there are some features which are comparable but on in many other respects it's even worse uh than uh the events of 1948 you already mention yourself the difference in the numbers of uh Palestinians killed uh but I think the main difference is that the U impulse in 1948 was to try and expel this as many Palestinians as possible the massacres were then used in order to persuade people to leave I think what we see now are massacres which are part of a genocidal impulse namely to kill people in order to downsize the number of people living in the Gaza ethnic cleansing is a terrible crime against humanity but genocide is even worse so I think we are seeing a transition from using ethnic cleansing the methods of taking as much of Palestine as possible with as few Palestinians in it as possible we are moving into a far more lethal method that of genocide and that lethal method is is voiced by government officials I mean in the first few months of the war Israel's AG Israel's agriculture Minister described the current displacement and persecution uh of Palestinians in Gaza as the knar of Gaza 2023 I mean these comments are sort of in line with the way the government has been talking ever since it was put into Power yes well that is very interesting because for many many years official Israelis denied the nakba denied that they were responsible for ethnic lensing that including uh more than 30 massacres of Palestinians but then how using it uh in a way that we always thought thought that they always said that they used which was to try and eliminate the Palestinians in 1948 and they are now warning the Palestinian that they would do again or would perpetrate again the very crime that they claimed had never existed so at least if something positive can come out of this horrific chapter in the history of Palestine is at least for the world now not to deny anymore the crime that was committed in 1948 which is now admitted fully by the very Israeli politicians that have just mentioned and of course the nakba in 1948 it was supported by Western States and Colonial Powers there is a comparison to what we're seeing in 2024 as well isn't there yet these very Western powers are also saying that there isn't a genocide going on most of them anyway I think now it's even worse because at the time in 1948 there was no television people did not have smartphones and it was relative easy to cover up the uh the NBA the ethnic cleansing and uh to claim that it didn't exist it is impossible to say now that people cannot know what is going on when it appears on our screens whether on small screen or big screens so I think the level of denial uh today is far more Sinister far more outraging and uh really I think is one of the main reasons why the civil societies even in the west find it impossible to be silent anymore and are LED Now by a brave group students all around the United States and elsewhere to show that they know exactly what goes on and they do all they can to stop it yeah I did want to come to that question because Global societies really are calling this a genocide and they're sort of calling their own governments out do you think I mean in more or less you know we're going to European elections soon here in the European continent the United Kingdom is going to go to a general election very soon do you think this is going to come back to bite these politicians you might say in the posterior for for not listening to their public who have been coming out in the hundreds of thousands in capital capital cities not just in Europe but across the world well first of all I hope that it will and we can mention also the election in United States it's very clear that the Arab American vote and Progressive people are now a bit doubtful whether they should support Biden although they don't want to support Trump because of Biden's policy towards Gaza uh I'm a bit skeptical that in the next elections in Europe uh uh politicians would be still uh would change their basic indifference and the international immunity they have provided to Israel but I'm confident that uh in the near future beyond the 2024 elections this kind of attitude that has been displayed by European politicians would come back to bite them because they are not representing Faithfully their electorates when it comes to Palestine they never did before but in particularly in the last seven months their positions have been very different from the moral position displayed by most of the people who have a modicom of Consciousness and decency in them when they understand what goes on in Gaza and when they're showing the support for the people of Gaza it's good to get your Insight sir and the relationship to history as well Ilan Pape thanks so much for joining us from Detroit thank you cameras have captured the struggle of Palestinian refugees then and now over the past 76 years Palestinians say the ongoing Israeli War and the military expansion are clear evidence of a second nakba [Music] [Laughter] make sure to
