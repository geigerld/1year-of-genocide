[Music] after more than 7 months of Israel's devastating war on Gaza which has killed at least 35,5 62 Palestinians the chief prosecutor of the world's top criminal court has sought arrest warrants for Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister yav Galant they are accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza Netanyahu says it's a complete Distortion of reality the ICC prosecutor also wants arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders for the October 7th attack in southern Israel a move that has been denounced by Hamas Osama bin jav begins our coverage Starving Children is a crime killing civilians is a war crime and willfully causing suffering is also a criminal act those are the top three reasons the prosecutor of the international criminal court has cited for requesting arrest warrants for the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and defense minister yof Galant I have raed grounds to believe on the basis of evidence collected and examined by my office that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Minister of Defense yuav Galant bear criminal responsibility for the following International crimes committed on the territory of the State of Palestine several Israeli ministers have denounced the allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity the foreign minister Israel ker says it's a historic disgrace and that a special war room has been set up to counteract the decision but not everyone agrees Israel will again protect itself with this wall of the whole world is anti-semite and the whole world is against us and it will unite again the Israelis in a very nationalistic even more nationalistic wave and everyone will feel so just and such a victim by this evil decision I think it's a just decision the ICC prosecutors also seeking arrest warrants for Hamas political and military leaders isma hania Yahya senar and Muhammad da there are reasonable grounds to believe that these three Hamas leaders are criminally responsible for the killing of Israeli civilians in attacks perpetrated by Hamas and other armed groups on the 7th of October 2023 the Palestinian group says the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Galant are several months too late and rather than equating the victim with the perpetration ICC should order the arrest of all occupation officials who gave orders and the soldiers who carried out the crimes if we want to be honest we should be looking at what it is that the government the Israeli government has been doing the orders that it has issued to its soldiers and it's issued orders to its soldiers to carry out a genocide if this court is to have any credibility it should be going after the people who are committing genocide rather than just simply trying to play this game of both sides ISM for months the the ICC prosecutor faced criticism as the Carnage in Gaza unfolded kareim Khan's critics even at the UN Security Council criticized what they saw as his in action to hold Israel accountable seiz fire seiz fire Israel's allies including the United States also expressed anger ahead of Monday's ICC announcement Target Israel and we will Target you said a warning letter from a dozen us Republican Senators they threatened to cut funding and sanction ICC staff in their families this is Gaza today in the mere talk of arrest warrants is unlikely to have an immediate impact on the war which has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians and displaced Millions more since October B Javid AL jaaz Prime Minister Benjamin netanyahu's government has banned aljazera from reporting within Israel so we all reporting from the Jordanian Capital Aman where Imran Khan is standing by so Imran the the Israeli Prime Minister is simply put Furious that the chief prosecutor of the ICC is requesting an arrest warrant against him what did Benjamin Netanyahu say well there's one key thing that he said which is now being echoed across the Israeli political Spectrum it doesn't matter whether you're the leader of the opposition like y Leed or whether you are a Storch Netanyahu supporter or whether you're a member of the war cabinet like Benny gance uh like uh the defense minister y of Galant and I think this is the message that is being pushed right now this is the key sentence the Absurd and deceitful warrant of the prosecutor in the ha is aimed not only against Israel's prime minister and defense minister it's aimed against the entire state of Israel and that last bit is absolutely crucial S I could spend about an hour going through all of the response uh coming out of the Israeli political echelons but it's all pretty much similar uh the reaction is one where everybody is saying this isn't about individuals anymore this is an attack against the state of Israel that's the messaging uh that's coming through everybody seems to be lock steep behind uh that messaging it's even being echoed in the media why are you making a false equivalence between us and Hamas uh this is just absolutely absurd it's an attack against Israel that's a direct quote from an editorial that I read this morning in Israeli newspaper so there you go that's where we're at right now in terms of reaction however response is going to be uh the real litmus test of how Israel deals with all of this now it's worth pointing out again Israel isn't a signatory to the ICC uh but it is taking this incredibly serious there have been meetings uh strategy meetings meetings with legal experts from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the National Security Agency see that's how serious they are taking all of this and we're beginning to see the response come through not only is it about blaming Israel uh sorry deflecting blame from Israel and saying this is ridiculous but it's also about reaching out to allies President Joe Biden last night said Israel isn't committing a genocide uh in Gaza and that's something key that would be something that the Israelis can hang on to and point to and say look if the president of the US has said it uh then clearly we're not committing a genocide so that's really where we're at right now it's it's all about the messaging it's all about the reaction uh but the response is what's going to be key and that's going to be coming uh swiftly and over the next few days Imran Khan reporting from Aman the Jordanian capital thank you very much for all that context there Imran we'll speak again just a reminder that prime minister banned aljazera from reporting in Israel so that's why we're reporting from Aman now this issue of equivalence between Israel and Hamas is what I want to get into with Eric witty former ICC official who served as an adviser to the former president of the international criminal court he joins us from uh from Brussels so there is this symmetry in Kareem Khan's statement he goes after Hamas crimes goes after Israeli crimes and he ends his statement with quote international law must apply equally the lives of all human beings have equal value this symmetry is very noticeable and it can't be an accident I wanted your thoughts on that yes thank you it's important to understand what that symmetry means and what it doesn't mean um what the prosecutor has said is that the law applies equally to everyone uh that both sides in this conflict as in other conflicts before the international criminal court are bound by uh international law uh and their actions will be equally scrutinized what it doesn't mean is that the prosecutor is saying that the actions on one side are necessarily the equivalent of actions on the other side or that the two sides are equal in nature in some way um it just means that both sets of actions will be measured not against each other but against the law that's really interesting and I that's why I wanted to raise this topic with you because you've been hearing our correspondents Hamas Biden Netanyahu have all the ICC and they all seize on this point saying that Hamas and Israel are not equivalent in Israel's telling of it of course it's that we're acting in self-defense you can't equate us with Hamas in hamas's telling of it they're saying we're being slaughtered victims can't be equated with their executioners so both of them suggesting that the prosecutor has got the plot completely wrong and that that somehow negates his request for for an arrest warrant those arguments are really a diversion um whether intentional or not from the core issue the international criminal court is not looking at the justification for fighting on either side it is not saying that Israel does not have a right to defend itself in fact the prosecutor noted uh in his statement that uh Israel does have a right to defend itself against attacks um it's not a a judgment on the right of the Palestinian people to pursue uh their freedom um the question is what means have the two sides used and not as States but individual criminal responsibility this is about the actions of individuals and not necessarily uh the state involved um they may have political implications for those States uh and and of course uh it has has great political meaning the impact of this um but what the court is really looking at are the actions of the individuals what are the specific allegations um can it be proven that uh the named individuals have perpetrated these uh these acts yeah this is really interesting because what it what it tells us listening to you is that both Hamas and and the Israeli response totally and perhaps deliberately missed the point right because the point is that actions of certain IND individuals do not comply with international law regardless of a bigger narrative that they may want to the frame or shape in any way there are illegal actions according to kareim Khan that have been committed by both the Israeli lead leadership and the Hamas leadership um was this perhaps this sort of symmetrical 50/50 almost presentation uh of the request for arrest warrants was we said it was likely intentional by Kareem Khan was this you think the only way for him to move ahead with the case I think it I think it likely was um I think it's important there's been tremendous suffering on both sides um and it's important to think about the victims on both sides um the hostages who are still in custody the families of those killed and missing uh in Israel um the Palestinians have been subjected to starvation to uh the allegation is that they've been specifically targeted as a civilian population by Israelis leaders I mean there's just been massive suffering and we see it play out on our television screens every day um and it's impossible to compare the two uh but what we can say is that victims on both sides are deeply deserving of justice of accountability um and that the broader International Community has an interest here in seeing standards upheld that there are standards even during wartime even if you feel your cause is Justified even if that cause is Justified it doesn't mean that you can use any means whatsoever uh to to pursue that cause Eric let me let me put it this way and I'm circling around the same point here is if kareim Khan had gone after just one side Hamas or even just gone after both sides Hamas leadership Israeli leadership but separately different moments in time wouldn't he inevitably have been accused of BU and wouldn't his case inevitably inevitably have lost credibility I think that was a real danger here yes um I think it was important for him to show that the uh that he was scrutinizing the actions of uh leadership on both sides of this conflict all right Eric Woody thank you so much for joining us I have so many questions for you we will speak again next hour I look forward to that thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
