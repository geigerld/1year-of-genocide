te now says it will impose restrictions on exports to Israel until it reaches a ceasefire with Hamas Israel called it a unilateral violation of trade agreements and has promised to respond these new measures come a day after Israel declined Anchor's request to airdrop Aid into Gaza we had submitted a request to participate in the humanitarian Aid operations with cargo planes of our Air Force we've learned that this request which was welcomed by the Jordanian authorities was rejected by Israel there can be no excuse for Israel to prevent us from providing aerial Aid to starving Garin in response to this situation we have decided to take a series of new measures against Israel well for more let's speak to our correspondent cam kolu she joins us now live from Istanbul cam this is obviously a symbolic gesture on the part of te but talk us through the details what do these restrictions relate to in terms of exports nasia this is the first significant measure that turkey has imposed uh against Israel since the beginning of the war in October uh uh last year uh the uh products uh that include iron steel fertilizers chemicals aluminum and many other mainly Construction Products and I have to remind that Israel is Turkey's third biggest trade Partners so uh according to the trade Ministry the exports and imports have already declined within the last 6 months around 33% B mainly Turkish exports to Israel decline 4 to 3% already but uh let's remember that these are all mostly private uh sector experts uh to Israel and they have uh declined without uh the with without the government's uh imposing on those companies so far but uh one of the major uh incidents besides Israel's rejection of turkey's air drop uh uh to air drop Aid delivery to uh Palestine is the backlash from the uh Turkish Society mainly the is pro-islamist young people who have been demonstrating and who have been calling out for boycott against Israeli products that has actually found a ground among the Turkish Society H as from right to left uh when it comes to Palestine it's a common issue people are very sensitive and they have been they have been uh individually boycotting some Israeli products that have also led to decline in the uh commodity products but of course uh as I said Israel is Turkey's largest trade partner and this is a big step uh since uh Turkish foreign minister fidan announced that uh the measures will be effective immediately in place as of this morning these the menion products uh 54 uh materials uh products in construction uh industry uh will not be exported uh to Israel but of course Israel has another chance for instance Germany is another supplier but uh this will be cost for Israel uh we will see how it will end up as turkey says these restrictions will be lifted as as soon as a ceasefire is in place back to S kolu there with the latest for us from Istanbul well let's now get the view from occupied East Jerusalem and speak to Imran Khan Imran are you hearing anything from the Israelis by way of response here to ankora well there's a very strong response from the foreign minister of Israel Israel cats who actually said ER thean is once again sacrificing the economic interests of the people of turkey for his support of Hamas we will respond accordingly and prepare an extended list of additional products that Israel will prevent turkey from exporting he's actually also gone on to say that Israel is going to appeal to pro-israel countries and organizations in the US to stop investments in turkey and prevent the import of products from Turkey it's also going to reach out to friends in Congress to try and figure out if isra if Turkey is actually in violations of boycotts against Israel and try and apply some sanctions on it so a very tough response there from uh Israel it R to be seen how quickly all of that can take place ceasefire negotiations like I say are taking place they being downplayed by Hamas and uh by Israel but they're certainly taking place and any kind of trade boy boycotts do take a long time to be able to put in place so at the moment this is very much a war of words what practical um element it has on the ground whether it's an immediate stoppage of trade between the two countries let's see what happens in the coming days Imran Khan there follow that's spat for us from occupied East Jerusalem thank you Iman
