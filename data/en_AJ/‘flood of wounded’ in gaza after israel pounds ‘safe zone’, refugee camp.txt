let's speak now to T abum he joins us live from Dar bah and so Tark strikes on refugee camps socalled safe zones all of this must be leaving civilians even more devastated than ever yes that's right Sammy in fact what is happening is a clear escalation from the Israeli side regarding the attacking refugee camps and areas before were designated as safe humanitarian zones we remember the attacks that were carried out in Al masasa area and yesterday at least 39 Palestinians have been reported killed in ashati refugee camp as this place was have been designated to be safe as Israeli military started the military incursion of rough of jabalia refugee camp now clearly the Israeli military is focusing on the refugee camp due to its symbolism for Palestinians at the same time Palestinians there have been living for years and they have been now been told by the Israeli military to leave this battered camp that was widely targeted since day one of the fighting and after uh the eruption of this round of conflict but seemingly Palestinians as we have been talking to them in ashati refugee camp they have expressed their deep concerns and they are absolutely terrified and Incredibly unable to feel safe again because the area that was targeted without getting any prior warning from the military and at the same time Israel says that the targeting and the attack was aiming to eliminate one of Hamas top military officials while Hamas movement has said that the attack was carried out against aul residential neighborhood targeting civilians and that is what we really discovered later where the vast majority of the victims were children and women and but surprisingly what we've been hearing from the civil defense Crews is that they are still working till now in order to recover the victims from under the rule of the destroyed houses are reports about dozens of Palestinians are still messing as the members of the civil defense saying that the we are facing insurmountable challenges in terms of extracting and bullying the victims from under the remnants of the destroyed houses due to the lack of essential uh Med essential civil supplies that are necessarily required in order to help us to accelerate the process of searching for survivors but they have been saying that multiple story buildings that they were destroyed and these areas usually are overcrowd and overwhelmed with evacuees and even families that have been right now uh completely now under the ruple of these destroyed areas so Samy generally there is a great sentiment of frustration among people there in the north who are not only suffering from the Israeli ongoing attacks on refugee camps but also from the ongoing starvation Rising there day by day as well and thic it's not just attacks which are picking up reports of cases of malnutrition Rising too tell us about that yes in fact that's what the Gaza Health Ministry in the north of the strip says it's they say that they have been recording more cases in terms of malnutrition as the vast majority were young children who are unable to get their essential basic humanitarian supplies including milk and essential medical treatment in order to be uh treated from the surging number of diseases that continue to struck the Norther part of Gaza now the Norther part of the Gaza Strip generally is the place that has witnessed different sorts of pressure including military and even humanitarian one as there is no any kind of Aid get into the north of the strip since the beginning of the military incursion in jaali as whose citizens have been punished by the Israeli military despite the international uh court of justice resolution to uh remove all kind of obstacles and to increase the capacity of Aid to uh people who are in a very desperate need for but till now as we've been hearing from locals friends on the another part of Gaza they say that we are about to die from starvation due to the lack of all kinds of basic Food Supplies there all right thanks so much tab make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
