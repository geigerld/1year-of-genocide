the future of palestine's official government the Palestinian Authority may be playing out in communities under Israeli attack husy was beaten in front of his children when Israeli soldiers raided his home in the balata refugee camp when they read in the middle of the day it's to weaken and make people hate the Palestinian Authority I'm a security officer in the PA I'm a son of the PA they do this on purpose it's delate unable to protect his family he says makes him feel defeated the first air strike carried out by the Israelis in nablo since the second inada was targeting the offices of fata the political party running the Palestinian Authority it has people wondering how can this organization be expected to protect its own people when it can't even protect itself day and night Israeli armored columns move freely throughout the occupied West Bank in villages plagued by settler violence residents say the PA is failing to do even the bare minimum we defend ourselves we got no one to protect us here we depend on each other on those who live in the house our neighbors there's no PA security presence here there's no protection at all no presence for the PA Security in the entire area this is an area under isra control not being vocal enough on Gaza maintaining links with Israel things that have contrib to the PA's falling poll numbers but public trust was through the floor even before the war more and more people losing faith in a negotiated settlement appear to favor armed resistance the people want the authority to implement good governance they want the Palestinian Authority to take positions that are proportionate to the events cut ties with Israel withdraw recognition talk about Gaza how many times did the president speak to the Palestinian Community being close to the people is important the Palestinian Authority says if it seems helpless It Is by Design it's clear that there is a US Israeli understanding that this is the last war they want a solution of some sort for the Palestinian question it's part of a plan whereby Israel joins the regional Arab system and the US has control of the Middle East in the 30 years since the PA was formed Palestinian lands have consistently shrunk it is something fueling the popularity of armed groups who are in the eyes of the people at least doing something to actively resist Israeli oppression while the PA has a security Force estimated to number between 30 and 40,000 their main function appears to be quashing internal dissent accusations of corruption a public image of capitulation big houses fancy cars the feeling on the Palestinian streets is the PA has all the wrappings of a government without a country to govern Zan basravi Al jazer in the occupied West Bank
