it's 15 GMT that's just past 5:00 p.m. in Gaza where Israel's assault on the Strip is intensifying and killing even more Palestinians the Israeli military has Target the targeted the jabalia refugee camp for a second day several homes were destroyed killing dozens of people more are buried under the rubble in the past 24 hours at least 700 Palestinians being killed it's one of the highest daily death tolls since the War Began and it's expected to rise in Gaza City there have been Street to Street gun battles between Israeli forces and Hamas Fighters members of gaza's civil defense team are desperately working to move the most vulnerable civilians away from the fighting for those who do manage to flee safety is nearly impossible to find Israel has struck one of the two main roads linking Northern Gaza with the South several Palestinians were injured as they were traveling on salahadin road and in the South families have been saying their final goodbyes that's in canun they are carrying the latest victims of the shelling on their shoulders and laying them to rest more than 15,500 people have been killed in Gaza since October the 7th acid bag begins our coverage Children Are Meant to play in the dirt but in Gaza it's the Shroud the bombing has continued in areas that the Israeli military said were safe I was asleep I woke up I found myself under the rubble I didn't find anything all around me was logs and rocks I tried to move but I couldn't because there were a lot of rocks I kept screaming and calling for the people men came and carried me they put me in the ambulance and more strikes on the jabalia refugee camp reports of dozens [Applause] killed my father and brother are dead he says there is no respite for Palestinians here civil defense teams frantically Traverse narrow streets of hunus in the South Palestinians homes and lives continue to be ripped apart many have already moved from the north to the South making these areas even more densely populated than before when the Civil Defense teams came they were confronted by an unimaginable scene a residential area consisting of more than 50 houses as for the testimonies of the civilians and residents stating that this Square was highly populated by residents and internally displaced people it was targeted by more than 10 bombs launched by Israeli occupation forces we're talking here about hundreds killed hamas's alasan Brigade Fighters released video which appears to show them taking on the Israeli Army in B hanon in the northern Gaza Strip Israel says it wants to destroy Hamas but Fighters continue to resist its military Advance the sixth day ceasefire which ended on Friday gave people a few days of calm now there's more Bloodshed fewer hospitals operating fewer emergency vehicles and if this rate of killing continues fewer Palestinians left in the Gaza strip Assad B Al jaaz let's go live to our correspondent thuk Abu aom he's in can yunas in southern Gaza and thic canun is the Israelis have said is now a war zone but their attacks are continuing across the strip with devastating consequences yes as we have mentioned earlier that the concentration uh after the end of the last truce between Hamas and Israel on the ground had been directed towards Huna City and the south of the Gaza Strip where it had been under Relentless Israeli strikes uh during the last couple of days and in particular these kinds of are rates intensify at night against several residential areas and even agricultural lands in the Eastern areas of uh khuna City where also the coastal line of the city had been attacked widely by the Israeli Naval warships uh the uh residents inside the city of canun are really terrified as they have been informed and they received different re leaflets that had been dropped by the Israel occupation Air Forces informing them to flee to Rafa District in order to be away from the Israeli bombardment as they are turning uh the kanun city into a war zone area uh that uh will have further kind of expansion of the military operations on the ground so the situation right now is very uh catastrophic and very difficult as the number of people who had been evacuating to the hospital right now had been doubled and also the people who have been uh now get backed in order to flee to Rafa has been increased during the last couple of hours due to the Relentless strikes that dropped the city earlier today ttic the Israelis are saying that they're focusing on Kan yunas because Hamas is operating from there but hundreds of thousands of people we believe have fled the fighting in the north since October the 7th and are in canun do we have an idea of how many people are there well uh personally I believe uh that the situation for those people who started to flee to raah district is really inhuman I was just coming to work uh earlier today and I found a lot of people who are just moving using the coastal line that linking between uh that is linking between kanun and draa they are moving moving to RAF city and what is also very uh catastrophic is that they are now setting up uh Camp tent in the middle of the streets in the uh in rafah uh area because the uh the the majority of houses in rafah District had become full of evacuees who had been forcibly uh eved uh from the houses from the north and Central areas of Gaza as they were also have been told by people there that they have been informed to flee and they are afraid to lose their family members and their beloved ones and while the uh the the main result of the these a strikes is that more waves of evacuation are taking place as I clearly uh so people have being loaded their trucks with their Furniture their stuff their items preparing themselves to flee to rafah District which in fact exat the situation on the ground in the south of the Gaza triptic thank you very much for that that is Abu AUM with the latest live incar newness in southern Gaza
