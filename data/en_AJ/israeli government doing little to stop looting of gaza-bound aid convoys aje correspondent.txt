Israeli forces have carried out at least eight strikes on humanitarian workers convoys and premises in Gaza since October even after their coordinates were shared with the Israeli authorities that's according to Human Rights Watch the report also finds that the Israelis didn't issue any advanced warnings the latest casualty is a United Nations staff member killed in eastern Rafa this is the first International un casualty with more than 190 Palestinian un workers killed since October the 7th our correspondent Steph deer joins us from the Jordanian Capital Aman since benj Benjamin netanyahu's government shut down aljazera in Israel so Stephanie when Israel killed seven Aid workers last month and angered the US president they apologized and they said that they were going to set up a new process to avoid a repeat event and yet here we are again with Israel targeting and killing Aid workers yes uh the Army the only sort of official reaction we've had has said said that they were in an area of active combat and that they're looking into the incident they're investigating the incident but the UN has incredibly strict security protocol when they operate even when it's not a hostile environment sarl I mean even just moving around when things are business as usual in Gaza even the occupied West Bank um so they have a very strict deconfliction information giving to Israel um and certainly again like I don't know what else can be done because what they do is they give the coordinates of their locations in terms of you know hospitals schools uh headquarters and then they also very much give the uh information when it comes to a moving Convoy so there's been a lot of pressure on Israel to do more but when it does happen at some point sometimes there may be an apology but there's never any accountability um so you know it's just a reality that is ongoing and as many Palestinians will tell you of course there's more International Spotlight usually when it's an International uh that gets killed at the hands of Israel but Palestinian Aid workers as you mentioned there get killed on a daily basis this has been the most deadly Conflict for un staff and for Aid workers uh in modern history so it just gives you a sense um of of just you know the question mark is how do you how do you prevent it from happening it seems certainly under Israeli uh you know modus operandi impossible Stephanie if I can get your reporting on something completely different now um it's related it's obviously about Gaza Israeli settlers have been attacking Aid convoys that are bound for the Gaza Strip what do you know about that yes well these are convoys that are leaving Jordan leaving from here uh and they cross the occupied West Bank and it's been many events really over the last couple of weeks and months they've intensified recently last night the latest uh you prob I'm not sure if you're playing the video but you can see settlers these are sort of far right wi Ultra nationalist in their ideology so they're taking off the bags they're throwing them around you even have small kids doing the same thing and nothing is being prevented this is the extraordinary thing s like the Israeli police the Israeli security forces the Israeli Border Police the Israeli Army who you name it is not doing anything they could very easily uh be accompanying these convoys through the occupied West Bank and getting them uh to Gaza now it's reaching International condemnation the the US National Security adviser Jake Sullivan yesterday basically saying this total outrage that people are attacking and looting these convoys that they are talking to the Israeli government at the highest levels that they're looking at what measures they can use to stop this um Jordan has condemned it and saying that it's Israel's Duty legally as an occupying power to ensure Aid gets to Gaza but politically the head of the police force the National Security advisor is itar benav the right-wing Minister who has the same ideology as those attack attacking the Convoy they believe that no Aid should be going uh to Gaza not to Hamas not to civilians they see them as par and Par the same um so of course there's a lot of criticism that Israel can do more and it's simply not doing that all right Stephanie Decker reporting from Aman Jordan because once again the Israeli government has shut down Al Shazer within Israel thank you very much Stephanie let's bring in Muhammad El masri a political analyst professor of media studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies Muhammad to be honest uh regardless of one's position on the conflict it is hard to watch the footage that we just saw right uh all our reporting is that that Aid is so desperately needed inside the Gaza Strip and there has been almost no food no water no fuel going in for a week and now the footage we just showed we're seeing settlers that are being um uh Allowed by Israeli authorities to to just throw the Aid on the ground when it's within within meters or kilometers of Gaza right well people like Elon Pape Gideon Levy and other Israeli Scholars and journal J have talked about a type of blood lust that exists right now um among a significant contingent within Israeli uh within Israeli society and those people don't want Aid to go in as you've been as Stephanie was was reporting in fact when they've done these sort of man on the street interviews uh some of the Israelis are very open in saying that they don't want Aid even to reach children they're saying that these children will grow up to be terrorists and some of them have said we should have killed the children back in 2014 when we had the opportunity because those kids are now uh terrorists so um this is the attitude that I think um everyone has to realize uh uh that we're dealing with um now it's interesting and I don't want to be reductionist about it but so much of this comes back to the United States uh well because the United States is the one international power The Entity that can stop all of this as we've said numerous on numerous occasions uh and they're not even acknowledging that Israel is committing a war crime with the prevention of Aid they released this memo a few days ago it's littered with contradictions on the one hand they're saying Israel doesn't seem to be doing all that it can to allow Aid in on the other hand they're saying that there's no evidence of a war crime that Israel is actually actively preventing Aid uh from from going in and we have to remember here there is an international consensus here among experts that Israel is committing a war crime by actively preventing aid from getting into the strip and there's some pretty glaring and major blind spots uh in the US's messaging on the one hand they'll say for instance a couple days ago they were saying well the US president was on the phone with Benjamin Netanyahu uh and he got some kind of assurance that the border crossing of border crossing of kar Abu Salam would be reopened because the Israelis had closed it right and now we're seeing no for a week nothing's been going in the White House messaging we got the Assurance this would be reopened the fact is no right well the assumption is always that the US exerts uh pressure on Israel that's been the historic assumption but the reality is what we're seeing is that it's Israel that exerts pressure on the United States and forces the US's forces the US's hand uh the US how is that even possible I mean the mismatch of of power you know is obviously in the US's favor well it's fascinating um John mimer political scientist from the University of uh of Chicago says that this relationship between the United States and Israel is unlike anything that we've ever had in the history of political relations right it's a very extraordinarily uh special relationship and it's one where Israel can exert power over the United States number one because the US long ago decided to marry itself to Israel to sort of adopt uh Israel as its long lost son um and then the other thing is that the the Israeli the Israeli Lobby inside the United States it's incredibly powerful and it it exerts a lot of influence over us politicians at the micro and macro level so you end up having the us having to react to What Israel is doing on the ground Israel says no we're not going to do this we're not going to take your advice and the US has to react but that's the thing is that even with your explanation and I follow what you just said the US seems to be following Israel in what they in what the US considers mistakes I was bringing this up with you earlier right blinkin said uh today's Tuesday so blinkin said two days ago pull out of Gaza this is a mistake you're going to end up with an enduring Insurgency and they're not doing it they're committed to the war and the US is also signaling well they haven't crossed our red lines right and I want to be clear I'm not saying that this is rational or logical or that I agree with it I'm just saying this is this is the US strategic calculation I actually happen to think that it makes no sense for the us to do for for the US to be doing what it's doing I think this is undermind the US there's nothing about what's happening in Gaza that ends up helping uh us interests in the region and now it's even hurting the US domestically we have these protests you have Biden effectively committing political suicide I don't think there's any way at this point barring something unforeseen something cataclysmic happening over the next few months I don't see any way forward for him in the November uh uh election against Donald Trump he's losing in six of the seven uh swing States the opinion polling data are quite damning uh you have young people all all over the country uh protesting and uh the reason he's going to lose this election I think is because of how he's handled Gaza Muhammad mus that's okay I I'm going to let that hang there that's really interesting it's something that's going to warrant another conversation but we will get a chance to have that conversation thank you very much mamad M make
