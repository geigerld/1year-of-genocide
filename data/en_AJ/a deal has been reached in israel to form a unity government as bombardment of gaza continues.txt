meanwhile Israel's primee Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been meeting with the leader of the opposition to discuss forming a Unity government Phil Marx has been following that meeting he joins us now from West Jerusalem so is it now confirmed villum that this government has been agreed to yes it is now confirmed the national Unity party that is the second largest opposition party inside the Israeli knesset with 12 members they have now formally agreed to join an emergency government with prime minister Benjamin netanyahu's leud party and two other far-right parties inside his Coalition just to give you some details about it though Sammy uh in terms of Who's involved in this there will be what's known as a war cabinet that's being set up uh that will involve Netanyahu Benny gance the former Defense Minister also the former Chief of Staff of the Israeli Army and the head of that National Unity party uh the defense minister yav Galant as well well as the another former Chief of Staff of Israeli military g eisenkot Who belongs to that same National Unity party and also the former Israeli Ambassador Ron durma to the United States uh also from that National Unity party headed by Benny Gant those five will form what's known as a security cabinet they will be the ones essentially helping to prosecute the war in we assume Gaza and then there'll be a wider addition to their political security cabinet the cabinet here essentially that will be five members including those three from the national Unity party they will be the ones that will be deciding perhaps larger issues of policy around perhaps conflict with Lebanon other issues outside of this current Conflict at least all right let's talk about the powers that this government will have this will be very much Sammy about how they strategize and how they execute on Military orders the idea there will be a smaller group of individuals just five of them inside that war cabinet deciding what the Israeli military does over the course of the next days and weeks in theory will be designed to help speed up decision- making in practice will mean there'll be perhaps fewer voices at the table who might have uh questions around the way things are being prosecuted what's really important for Netanyahu of course is to have these two very experienced men Benny gance and Mr Eisen Cott both of them former heads of the Israeli Army sat in that room with him providing advice and obviously I would imagine sharing their own opinions on the best course of action for the Israelis and if you can talk us through the looking at the members who's in the government you know what happened with the question of Gant versus it itamar benav some of the farri members what it means for the the future of Netanyahu distill it for us vill as much as you can right so benir the national security minister here the head of a far-right party that allows Mr Netanyahu as prime minister to have a governing majority inside the parliament he will remain inside that broader cabinet that may have jurisdiction over larger National conversations but he's being excluded from that war cabinet he's someone that seemingly has not been thrilled at the prospect of this happening but seemingly Under Pressure either from members of his own party or more likely from L could party members those that obviously work with Netanyahu inside his own party seems to have backed away from that moment what that will mean longterm for Netanyahu really really thorny question to try and answer it could threaten the long-term viability though of his governing majority once this conflict if this conflict at some point calms down right thanks so much for the marks there
