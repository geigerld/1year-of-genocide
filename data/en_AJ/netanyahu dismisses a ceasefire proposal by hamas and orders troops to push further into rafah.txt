the US Secretary State Anthony blinkin says there's still room for an agreement after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the ceasefire proposal the deal was put forth by Hamas after mediation by the Qatari by Qatar and Egypt Muhammad jamdom reports from Tel Aviv less than a day after Hamas submitted its response to a potential Gaza ceasefire plan US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin arrived in Israel hoping to build on that momentum but hours after meeting with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu Israel all but rejected the current framework for a cessation of hostilities now is the time for the Israeli Defense Forces to allow safe corridors for the residents of Rafa we shall continue destroying the capabilities of Hamas until we achieve that and I emphasize we have no other option but decisive victory hamash for its part said that unlike Israel they had taken a positive approach to the ceasefire proposal Netanyahu and his government are seeking to continue to mislead the public opinion in Israel and to prolong its aggression despite the losses they sustaining in personnel and equipment with the attempts to Halt the war seemingly at a standstill one significant point of contention continues to be whether any agreed to ceasefire would be permanent despite the Diplomatic setbacks at a press conference in Tel Aviv Lincoln insisted a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was still a possibility good evening we had an opportunity today to discuss with the Israeli government the response that Hamas sent last night to the proposal that the United States cutter and Egypt had put together uh to bring the remaining hostages home and extend the humanitarian pause uh what I can tell you about these discussions is that while there are some clear non-starters in hamas's response uh we do think it creates space for agreement to be reached and we will work at that relentlessly until we get there it was an intense day of talks for America's top Diplomat at the end of it Anthony blinkin did offer a positive outlook on ultimately finding a path to peace but he also gave few details about how America now envisions finding a way to end the war Muhammad jamj jaaz Tel Aviv is joining us from occupi Jerusalem so the Prime Minister has ordered his troops to push further into ra as we've been hearing at the same time Rory dismissing a ceasefire proposal by Hamas how are we to understand this and what happens next when it comes to the negotiations well from the point of view of Jerusalem from the point of view of netanyahu's coalition government there is no change the war goes on from the point point of view of Hamas in the tunnels underneath Gaza there is no change and the war goes on and from the point of view of the people in the ruined streets on the surface of Gaza in the in the tent camps of course as well there is no change they can continue to be killed and the war goes on in DC in uh Doha in Cairo and in Riyad as well well there's going to be some head scratching and trying to work out how they can take things forward what next you could hear the disappointment I think from uh from Anthony blinkin in that press briefing yesterday you know he didn't just come here to put a a brotherly arm around Israel and try to guide it back towards a a quote unquote more acceptable form of warfare he came to get a deal and he didn't get it he reminded me in that press conference of uh you know a spurned lover who's just had a massive rejection but still thinks that he's got a chance he is trying to keep the possibility of U A Renewed ceasefire alive and he is going to be trying to work out where the possibility is for bridging that huge Gulf between the positions of Hamas and the positions of the Netanyahu government and he might be right there might be a chance but at the moment uh he is going back to DC after wrapping up a few other uh supplementary meetings here in uh this part of the world he's going back to DC and he's going back empty-handed okay thank you Rory Chalin reporting from occupied East Jerusalem let's now speak to Shaham Akbar Zade who's a research professor of Middle East at Central Asian politics at Deacon University joining us uh from DHA thanks for speaking to us let's first look at uh netanyahu's comments when it comes to the draft proposal put forward by Hamas he called it delusional do you think that he rejected it or or is there is still space for negotiation going forward I think from n's point of view first thanks for having um from his point of view um any deal with Hamas would give credibility and recognition to Hamas so he's very averse to the idea of signing a a ceasefire deal even end of the conflict the peace be with Hamas secondly he knows very much that his future political future is tied to the right wing in uh Israeli politics he has people like the security minister who was uh actively advocated the capture of Gaza and repopulation settlement of Israelis in Gaza so uh netanyahu's future is very much in the hand of the right wing and he's not going to antagonize them by U stepping back from his promise of destroying Hamas right but the more time passes the more risk there is that more captives are killed in Gaza by the Israeli bombing as we've seen so is there a timeline here that Netanyahu feels like you know he has to work with I think Netanyahu has accepted and I think all um the families of hostages have recognized uh that the hostages are acceptable collateral damage nanyo is not making decision based on the interest of the Israeli hostages in Gaza he's making decision based on his own interest his political interest um in the future of Israel will how much pressure do you think is the US Administration willing to put on Netanyahu at this point in time we heard uh Secretary of State blinkin in Tel Aviv uh saying that negotiations towards a deal will continue do you think that he sounds uh optimistic I think it's despite our running to see the United uh State Administration um change its position from an unconditional support for Israel to uh self-defense uh as that's the way uh they presented the war in Gaza uh to now gradually asking Israel to modify Its Behavior Uh try to avoid civilian death and perhaps discuss some kind of a ceasefire te it does put the US in a difficult position but at the end of the day the United States is is Israel's steadfast all International Arena and it's not going to um abandon that position so the the pressure and the power that the US has over Israel is quite limited actually so what happens in the next few days when it comes to this draft proposal we have an Israeli reaction Netanyahu says it's delusional what next I think as your correspondent uh made it clear what next is more War uh Netanyahu Israel has the power to accept or negotiate any ceasefire any peace de and the current Israeli Administration under the ring government ofo has made it clear that they have no interest in uh a ceasefire and all going out they're going all the way out for the destruction of Hamas which means destruction of Palestinians in Gaza okay we'll leave it there thank you Shaham Akbar Zade for speaking to us from DHA thanks for having
