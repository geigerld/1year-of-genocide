Israel Hamas and the mediators haven't said anything specific in their discussions about a possible ceasefire but the broad proposal is believed to be based on those three stage processes that Charles just mentioned the first phase would be that six we ceasefire during which Hamas would release women and elderly uh and wounded captives in exchange for Palestinian held prisoners in Israeli prisons the second phase would include a permanent end to the hostilities and release of all remaining Israeli captives and third phase would be that reconstruction of Gaza and the return of the remains of any deceased captives to Israel let's bring in Tamar Kut who's a conflict resolution specialist and an assistant professor of public policy at doart Institute for Graduate Studies joins us live now from Belgrade in CIA good to have you with us again Mr kmut on the program can we just talk about these technical teams that the Israelis are sending to Doha I mean we've seen this scenario happened before but it doesn't really mean that there'll be any breakthrough in negotiations because we don't really have or we're not privy to that information it's just yet one more um stage in the process to getting to the you might say the conclusion of what both sides want yes um exactly so yes we have been there before and previous rounds of negotiations have failed miserably and um um I'm pretty not sure what's the the the the new developments or the new you urge especially for Natan because he feels he's impune uh uh that would enable such developments that would enable this round to succeed as well because as we talk as we talk people are dying and dying in big numbers I mean as the war continues in Raza so just imagining that these negotiations might take weeks to materialize it's a horrifying idea given uh the the the miserable and the genocidal crime that we see being aired on TV now uh so I'm I'm I'm really not sure and and and I'm quite pessimistic because as we talk also we have been hearing that there there are disagreements between Nat and his Minister of Defense also over the deal as well uh so I think I think uh let's wait and see I mean there's so many unknown factors for us and uh we have to know what's what's there okay let's let's UNP pick it a little bit more because these talks are going on behind closed doors Israel is making very public through its prime minister what its red lines are are those red lines realistic now in terms of the pressure that's being applied we think by Washington on Tel Aviv over getting to a ceasefire well I mean if if the pressure really exists and that's an assumption I mean so far I mean I I feel this is I mean in my opinion in my opinion that this is kind of the last Push by the Biden Administration and then after this push if things don't work the Americans will be fully busy with their elections and the Gaza war will not be will be a secondary priority or a third priority for them uh so but again the devil is in the details because natany is has been there before and he has sabotage many of these uh negotiation deals so it really for me if this round is to succeed I think it needs an American a real and a sincere American pressure and some deadlines by Washington I hope the Americans are there but I'm not sure yet yeah I think it's a wait and see at the moment there's a bit of a holding pattern to see what happens as these talks finish in Doha for the moment T Kut thanks for joining us
