an Israeli soldier recounting his actions during a raid in Gaza City Body cam video from last November sparked widespread outrage it revealed the soldier discussing how he repeatedly shot an elderly Palestinian the victim was 73-year-old ATA ibraim who was a well-known disabled man in the refugee camp where he lived his relatives say he was deaf and his attempts to communicate by sign language were futile we were in touch with him since the start of the war when the Israeli soldiers invaded al-shati area we lost contact during the first truce we asked neighbors who said he headed south we were shocked to see his images on TV Witnesses told Al jazer the entire neighborhood served as a temporary base for Israeli soldiers during the course of their operations at least 50 Palestinians were killed and their remains are buried in a mass grave many homes were raised as Israeli forces pulled out the Israeli government has confirmed soldiers were in the camp at the time and they investigating the family of the disabled Palestinian are still searching for his remains and if they're successful hope to give him a dignified burial Axel zovich Al jazer salut is joining us now from occupied East Jerusalem so uh when Israel says that it will investigate this incident I mean where where are they in that process and what do we expect will happen well Darin Al jazer has reached out to the Israeli Army on Saturday morning to get more information about the situation that we saw in this video the Army had responded by saying they would check but we have not heard anything back since however one Israeli media Outlet did receive a response from the Israeli military after submitting their own inquiry in which it said they are opening an investigation into the matter they say that Israeli forces were operating under what they describe as a complex situation in the Shala refugee camp and that an unarmed man was shot because he was quote thought to be a terrorist the statement Ends by saying that there will be an investigation this video is incredibly and deeply disturbing an Israeli soldier essentially boasting about killing this unarmed 73-year-old elderly Palestinian man who we have learned is both deaf and mute and the soldiers around him also really congratulating him on the matter offering words of praise the soldier was also saying himself that the sly man was waving his arms in front of him to perhaps show that he did not have any weapons on him and the Israeli military says they're looking in to the incident but the video itself really the images speak for themselves yeah and if to put this into context ham this is not the first time that Israel is accused of killing civilians and in this manner in the nearly six months of this war the Israeli Army has not once acknowledged an unlawful killing of a Palestinian in fact there are several incidents the Israeli Army says they are investigating and looking into in a war that has seen the deaths of more than 31,000 Palestinians the Army not acknowledging once that any of those deaths were on lawful there are a few instances that the Israeli Army has said they're looking into matters I mean just last week we saw the flower Massacre when that happened the Israeli Army changing their story quite a few times essentially absolving themselves of any blames and rather deflecting it on the Palestinians who were seeking this life-saving humanitarian Aid since they are essentially starving the Israeli Army saying that the massacre that had happened was essentially their own fault additionally back in December the Israeli Army is accused of executing 19 Palestinian civilians in Northern Gaza when Al jazer did ask the Israeli Army about this they said that they didn't know the details of this event as described and they categorically denied that as well those Palestinian accounts but and then gave us their version of the story saying that the military had evacuated civilians in the building they were encountering Palestinian Fighters there at the time but we also want to mention that the one time the Army has acknowledged that they made a mistake was when they killed three of their own captives and then this prompted the Israeli Army Chief of Staff to say that the militaries open fire regulations do not permit soldiers to shoot at those who are surrendering those waving a white flag those dropping their weapons those waving their arms so this soldier in this latest video essentially bragging about not following the status quo of the Israeli Army when it comes to their open fire rules and regulations so while the Israeli Army says they are investigating several matters often times we don't hear anything back as a result of those investigations and this particular incident the Israeli Army has not yet released any findings okay thank you hamda salut reporting for us from occupied East Jerusalem
