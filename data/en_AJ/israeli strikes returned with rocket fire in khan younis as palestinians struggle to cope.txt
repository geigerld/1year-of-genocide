and now there's a new challenge for the people of Gaza the rain tents housing thousands of displaced Palestinians in un run schools in the southern Gaza Strip have been damaged people say they're also worried they could now die from exposure let's speak now to our correspondent in carun TK Abu aom T first of all let's look at the weather there it has been raining heavy rain has flooded the camps what are the conditions yes uh people inside Gaza Strip were always waiting winter and even rain in order to enjoy and spread happiness in their hearts but now they're afraid of having rain due to the fact that they are being completely displaced from the houses they are taking shelters in a school but these schools are not highly equipped by uh the uh United Nations and it's also it cannot protect them from being exposed uh from the rain as they they are totally are forced to get up early no matter what if there was rain or not in order to have access to bread have access to water and they are forced to do that under dire humanitarian circumstances so rain is considered to be now a new concern for the majority of displaced people inside the territory as more people are fleeing from the north and Central areas of Gaza Strip to the southern areas people uh dramatic situation is getting much more worsening as also they are having different kind of shortage they did not really manage to bring uh their clothes from the houses because they are only allowed to have only one bag as they are evacuating and some of them did not really manage to get any bag of clothes with them and others have run out of money they don't have even money to have the ability to purchase anything from the market so the situation for them is really dramatic and witnessing much more exacerbation people are still fleeing from the north and Central areas of the territory and in order to uh know more about that we are hosting right now A young Palestinian girl she is ragad Mahmud uh ragad thank you so much for joining us today so as a Palestinian uh young girl uh as a Palestinian young girl uh tell me about your feelings as the Israeli attacks on the Gaza STP continue and you are a displaced person from the central areas of the Gaza okay of course I can tell you like now the world can't see anything that's happening now in Gaza just now there was a harsh booming around here and you can see behind me lots of ambulances like getting the wanded and martyrs as for me I got out of my neighborhood since like around 5 years 5 days and because of that there's was around 20 harsh rids around our house and you can imagine that it's only 20 or 50 m all from our house there was no doors no windows not anything not a block on a block so you can't live there there's nothing there you can't have your life and since I was living there I had me many many memories there so you can't okay and what is your message to the world what would you like to tell the world about that I would like to tell them that I lived in Indonesia and Malaysia around 6 years and I lived there my life I did go to entertainment places I went to restaurants I went to everything but here you can't have your actually can't have your peace because like you are under an Israeli aggression you can't have uh anything I lived there around 60 years and I also had my life I also that the land is for the this people but uh as for us we have only one city or two okay thank you so much for your vulnerable time thank you so much and this is uh how life in Gaza Strip looks like as Israel keep displacing people from the cities heading to the southern areas where bombardment also continued in the south of their territory yes T amazing strength and eloquence from that young girl you were talking to just there explaining like what life is like for her and others there in Gaza she mentioned uh the commotion behind you was due to hosp ambulances bringing new casualties from new strikes what what can you tell us about what's happening yes uh the southern areas of Gaza Strip and in particular in khuna City there were there were massive numbers of Israeli ongoing strikes on the south of the Gaza Strip as they are recommending people to flee to the southern areas which considered to be safe from the Israeli perspective now just before a couple of minutes before we went live the Israel occupation forces attacked a residential building in the Eastern areas of kanun as till now the ambulances are evacuating victims and injured people from the location of the attack and they are the entire hospital now is in a state of aler in order to uh keep riding treatment for them also the attacks continued in the central areas of their territory around the vicinity of the main Central hospitals including the Indonesian hospital and even the asifa hospital which considered to be till now trapped and besieged by the uh Israeli occupation forces who prevent anyone from getting out of the hospital as they were forced today Administration and medical workers to pury dozens of Palestinians inside a mass grave Cemetery inside the uh the medical complex which give a CLE sign that situation there is totally unbearable so t as you're talking to us we can we can hear the ambulances we can hear the commotion of people arriving how is that hospital coping with this influx of casualties that it's seeing every single day yes uh hospitals inside Gaza in particular in the south of the territory as we are right now standing inside uh they are trying to cope with the current situation and even with the surging number of people who are being wounded and injured from the Israeli a strikes from time to another by using the minimum and primitive medical uh care uh facilities and even U uh approaches there are due to the lack of medical supplies and also with the surging number of those wounded people Medical Teams are tirelessly providing treatment and the capacity of the hospital is uh is uh become much more full and the majority of those medical workers are trying to conduct different surgeries uh some of them are taking long time to be uh conducted others are requiring to be transferred outside the Gaza Strip to receive uh treatment in the Egyptian hospitals or any any Hospital up road so literally they are doing their best in order to keep rinding a treatment for the wounded people every day dozens of inent people are turning up to the anas hospital and they are receiving a treatment inside the corridors of those hospitals as you can clearly know the air strikes continue as even the number of Palestinians getting killed and injured by those air strikes had risen to more than 11,500 Palestinians killed and with more than 20 uh uh 7 27,000 Palestinians also have been critically injured TK Abu AUM our correspondent in southern Gaza reporting there from Kan yunes even as ambulances behind him bring more casualties in from new Israeli strikes on that area T thanks very much for the moment well here's now a look at the main areas of fighting in Northern Gaza the shaded areas are where Israeli soldiers and tanks have made some advances in circling Gaza City and effectively cutting the strip in half Israeli troops and tanks have completely surrounded the port of Gaza it's believed that the armed wing of Hamas the kasan brigades is fighting on what's being described as four decisive fronts they are tal alwa al-shatti bate lahia and bate hanon we're going to go back now to our correspondent in kanun TK Abu aom because TK we understand that there were a number of rockets that were just fired out of the Gaza Strip from very close to where you are right uh The Rage of rockets have been fired TS the Israeli settlements in retaliation to the Israeli ongoing bombardment of the territory uh those Rockets did not stop since the early beginning of this round of fighting they uh the Palestinian Fighters are started this round of fighting extensively by uh launching different bages of rockets towards the surrounding Gaza settlement and even towards the main Central uh cities of the uh Israeli occupation uh uh State uh clearly these Rockets come as a retaliation by the Palestine Fighters due to the Israeli Relentless bombardment and the killing of civilians inside the territory those Rockets had witnessed a kind of shrink uh after the Israeli ground Invasion to their territory but meanwhile they are still firing and shoot and launching different bages towards the uh Israeli cities and even some of them had reached the Far North of the occupation state so yes I was going to ask you if they're being fired from Southern Gaza where are their targets within Israel so generally we cannot right now we are not expect to determine the the ation of the targeting but meanwhile those uh uh those uh Rockets are fired towards the Israeli settlements they might be uh just be directed or targeting the main Central cities of the uh Israeli occupation uh State as there till now there is no any further confirmation about the location of the Israeli attack of the of the Israeli city that had been largely bombarded okay and this follows as you were saying a few minutes ago or a few moments ago before we came on air another Israeli strike on an area in K Yunis an area that Israel has told people in the north to go to to escape the fighting yes uh this parage of rockets had been fired the Israeli settlements after the attack on a residential house in in neighborhood where totally as you could clearly see at the background that the different injuries have been proved to the hospital in order to uh be medically occurred and also these attacks continued in the south of the territory which considered to be a safe place for Palestinians to flee to but as Israel keeps also bounding the south of the Gaza Strip it it's clearly yet there is no any safe place in the Gaza Strip even in the South where people are recommended to flee okay TK Abu aom thank you very much for bringing us the very latest there from KH unun where we've just heard of a number of rockets being fired out of the Southern Gaza Strip towards Israel T thank okay
