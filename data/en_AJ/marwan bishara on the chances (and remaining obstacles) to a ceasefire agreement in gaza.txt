Maran bashara is alir senior political analyst you're joining us um by Skype from Paris Maran what do you think about this statement about where it appears to leave us right now look although the statement is General it's not expected to be anymore because the negotiations have not ended but the sense of optimism does reflect a certain reality uh over the last two days where they are Bing gaps um and it's not just the last two days uh the framework agreement that was proposed in May was worked on all the way through July 2nd when it last left by Hamas saying look we agreed to this we also made some concessions now Israel has to agree to it since July 2nd they made some progress but now the past two days they were able to bridge the gap on most of the issues where also the Israelis seems to have made some concessions on the issue of the ratio between hostages and detes between Israelis and Palestinians that is held by Israel and Hamas three points seems to be uh left three contentious Point important point one that has to do with the Philadelphia Corridor that Natan insists that the Israeli Army wants to maintain some form of presence there is the narim uh base or line that's right in the middle of Gaza smack in the Middle where also Nan wanteded to maintain in order to control the movement of the population from the north back to the south from the south back to the north meaning people want to go back to their homes Netanyahu doesn't want them to he want only those over 65 or something and the third Point had to do with Rafa who will be in charge of the crossing meaning in charge of all these goods are be going to be coming in after a ceasefire is signed seems that that the Americans uh have taken it upon themselves to deal with Netanyahu and Israel on the question of narim and the movement of population and why Israel really must withdraw its uh its soldiers from the middle of Gaza when it comes to uh Philadelphia this is more of an issue that concerns Egypt because you know Egypt is the country to the South with a peace agreement with Israel so it's going to be handled with Israel and isra with the Egypt and the Israeli military as to the nature if any at all Hamas rejects the presence of any Israeli uh presence in the Philadelphia C and as far as the RAF Crossing that remains to be a bit of an enigma the Israelis don't want a PA a Palestinian Authority presence they certainly don't want the hamash presence it remains to be seen whether the Palestinians can work out some some some sort of a formula in the coming days whereby it'll be Pro uh provential provisional and workable but Marwan these are so these are all important um what the mediators are referring to as details right important details within a possible framework agreement but I'm still thinking about the main part of this agreement which is it's supposed to end the war and until recently you were still hearing from Benjamin Netanyahu this this war will not end until we've totally um defeated Hamas we've WIP them out remove them from the Gaza Strip and on the other hand you still heard from Hamas uh we're not signing a deal that doesn't totally end the war so that's you know that's the big that's the really huge thing that they still seem to have no agreement on until recently yes absolutely but listen just to so so that you and I can be on the same page and it's very important for me that you and I are on the same page these are not details right sure I mean whether there is or there isn't Israeli military presence in the middle of Gaza or in the South part of Gaza or in the RAF Crossing this is by definition whether the war continues or the occupation continues today as it has the last 10 months but the root causes for the war continue so it's a very important what's going to happen with the Israeli military presence the details are more into how many what day will be released and then how many will be released in the second week and what happens in terms of Israeli redeployment during that time this these are the details these are the implementation details now I agree with you about the fact that even if this is signed does this really mean that it's all um uh you know Rejoice about peace and stability absolutely not I have always been saying that Israel has got got away with genocide and I don't think the traces of genocide are going to disappear overnight and I don't think the Israelis are going to leave Gaza overnight and I don't think the Israelis are going to try to avoid or miss a chance to say assassinate sunir next week when there is a ceasefire right so the the the chances for Reckless Behavior and the chances for this thing to be torpedoed and the chances for Israel to walk away after the first phase when most of its captives are released are very high the Americans have given the guarantees that to the Palestinians and to the mediators that they will work with the Israelis so as to not relaunch the war but they seem to have also given guarantees to Netanyahu that if he must relaunch the war then they're not going to stand in his way which means that a lot of these eventualities are left in the hands of the Americans which means the Americans are the sponsor as the mediator and the partner of Israel will be uh directly implicated in the implementation of this three-phased agreements until it's fully implemented Al senior political analyst Marwan Bashar thank you very much Maran make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
