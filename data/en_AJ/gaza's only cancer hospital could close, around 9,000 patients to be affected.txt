the only hospital for cancer treatment in Gaza says that it could be forced to shut down because of Israel's continued Siege the Turkish Palestinian friendship hospital has already stopped some services like Radiology the fuel and Medical Aid shortages are affecting some 9,000 cancer patients who have nowhere else to go for treatment the hospital is currently operating on a single local generator well we can talk to Dr sub skake director of the Turkish Palestinian friendship Hospital inside Gaza so you running this Cancer Ward how long do you think you'll be able to continue treating your patients uh good evening for everybody you know as it has been known to all of us it is the 13th day of the this massacre unide against Gaza already a lot of killed patients we are approaching the number of 4,000 um you know being killed and injured patients we are approaching the the figure of 12,500 something like that and this still many of the bodies are under the destructive houses and and buildings you know we had already more than 44 health workers who has been targeted ambulance drivers Rescuers and many of the nurses and the doctors while providing the service to their patients we are having still about more than 70 injured health workers still there are four hospitals as you have mentioned really they they are out of services and we cannot forget I think all the what I I think cannot forget that Massac two days ago Al Ali hospital this Hospital Al hospital and other one apart from other medical dispensaries now if I could if I could jump in I understand I'm told that you're at the hospital right now so could you bring us into your reality that real reality of running this Cancer Ward I mean when you hang up after this interview what's going to be your priority yeah my priority is to save my cancer patient in my place in this Palestinian uh Turkish hospital we are giving or providing the Cancer Care only for our patients you know it has it's known that more than 10,000 cancer patients are in Gaza currently I am having more than 70 75 or 80 in the morning you know there are many patients coming to the hospital during the day we are inside the hospitals and others are you know I you know are coming daily on routine basis before the war we are having more than 500 patients coming a day repairing more than 150 patients to be treated abroad because you are having a shortage of plenty of the needs for cancers now just a couple of days ago we have declared that uh in 48 hours I mean this is just you know about you know 30 hours ago declared that there is after couple of days there will be no more fuel in my hospital this cancer hospital to let the hospital being run uh to to provide the service for ccer patients simply we will not be able to prepare the drug medications the chemotherapeutics for my patients to to to to treat our patients I will not be able you know to to all all the services yes do you expect that you are going to get medical supplies from those 20 trucks of Aid that are expected into Gaza tomorrow because they will be carrying as we understand it medical supplies do you think some of those will come to you and your patients definitely I think you know those AIDS coming to Gaza definitely they are thinking of the health of the patient they are thinking to help the injured patients but they are help they are to they have to think of the sick patients also talking those sick patients the cancer patients which are a huge number in my area you know those patients are suffering a lot day and night you know most of my patients in the hospital now they are big radden they are in pain day and night they are in need for chemotherapeutics they are need for good monitoring in the hospital in the Intensive Care Unit in the Intermediate Unit they need to have some oxygen some generator to to to you know to give some oxy oxygen for them they need plenty of Investigations and plenty of other resources just to let them Thrive to let them decrease their pain what is called as paliative care I mean if my patient is having a pain or having any problem I have to treat them those patients cannot be treated anywhere in Gaza except in this Hospital except in this Turkish Hospital which is providing the you know the basic the very basic service currently speaking to my cancer patients because already we are about two weeks of the war being run now we are having very limited resources before the war even now we are in a bad very big shortage the drugs to the patient and what will complicate the problem is no more fuel so I cannot operate the machines which can prepare the the the drugs for my patient I cannot prepare you know this oxygen generators to for my patient I can operate my laboratory investig it's a big problem even the water this is connected to the electricity if no electricity no water no sewage no no no no lots of the problem so is a big cry must be through your respected channel to the whole world please come and save cancer patients in Gaza please come the second injured patient in together this is as simple as that already to to to regulate my my activities in the hospital we have already decreased down reduced the the electricity in many areas you know the list in being stopped lightning is being stopped we are trying you know to preserve what could be uh you know minimal at least to to to linken the you know to L the area where I can provide but thank you so much will be no service for those patient definitely they will die and the cancer being spread in them it's a terrible humanitarian another another another disaster another genocide against Gaza people to kill cancer patients this way you know cancer patient are being killed three times here in Gaza by this by their cancer by the disease Itself by the shortage which were there already because of the do thank you very much ugly restrictions and now they are being short of
