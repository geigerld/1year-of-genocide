[Music] in a makeshift classroom in canun Palestinian children practice their reading the hum of Israeli drones overhead doesn't dampen their enthusiasm hello hi those drones alongside the rest of Israel's Arsenal have destroyed schools across Gaza forcing these children to learn in a tent I learn in this tent as an alternative to Royal kindergarten that was bombarded I don't like learning in a tent I want to be in a proper kindergarten the old one I used to go to the Israelis have destroyed that kindergarten and I wish it would come back they don't have a permanent school to go to the kindergarten running these classes says it's doing what it can to help them continue their studies the idea of this initiative is to highlight education everyone else is focusing primarily on entertainment we're focusing on kids education which has been neglected for almost 7 months to enable them to read and write in the circumstances we are experiencing here the UN says close to 400 schools across gazer are known to have been damaged and the actual number is likely higher those that remain are being used as shelters for displaced Palestinians the children here at the roal kindergarten aren't just missing out on learning many are missing family and carrying trauma my name is Muhammad I was displaced from Gaza to Rafa my father remained in Gaza and he was killed I came to this kindergarten to learn inside this tent Palestinian children get a rare chance to live as they did before Israel's invasion of Gaza but the war still awaits them outside Freddy AAR Al jazer
