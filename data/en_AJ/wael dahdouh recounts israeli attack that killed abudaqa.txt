events of the Israeli drone strike in Khan un at the time we spoke we did not know that his colleague Sam Abu had [Music] died and then all of the sudden something happened we can't tell what happened exactly I only felt that something big happened and I fell I fell down and I lost my helmet and my microphone I Tred to gather all my forces and I was barely able to stand up I was feeling dizzy and I was losing my balance I thought I was expecting the second uh mile to be launched short L and I was able to do so although I was not completely standing with balance I try to hide in one of the uh destroyed houses or at the school or to continue walking because I was bleeding in my shoulder and my arm so I realized that I will keep bleeding and nobody will be able to reach us where we were so I tried to press one of the injuries that I had on my arm and I tried to walk slowly I tried to walk while standing on or using the walls and try to avoid the tunnels as fast as I can at the end I was close to the main road I saw there an ambulance so I shouted and I tried to wave with my hand so that they can come but the situation was very challenging and they were not able to reach me where that where I was so I needed to continue walking until I reached the ambulance and they tried to stop the bleeding at least temporarily we got in the ambulance I asked them to go back to where I was because my colleague Sam Abu Daka was still there and he was screaming and he was calling for help I think most of his he would he got injured in the lower part of his body but the paramedics told me that we need to leave immediately and that they will send another ambulance so that we won't be all targeted we then came here to this hospital and as you can see sammer and whatever we were able to record are still there there are attempts to send a an ambulance and the ambulance got shot there was some kind of a coordination again but the ambulance of the red crescent refused to go back there because the area was very dangerous and they requested an vehicle or an ambulance from the Red Cross or the United Nations agency but the Red Cross did not move swiftly which made the life of our colleague samur and all the others this this lack of action or slow action put everyone's life in danger but we are still hopeful we we are hopeful that we will have sammer back with us and wish him a speedy recovery as far as I'm concerned um this is just um a first message and I'm trying to gather my thoughts and my force in order to continue what we have started since the first day of the war I expect to be able to start working again tomorrow morning despite all the wounds peace be upon you see you soon
