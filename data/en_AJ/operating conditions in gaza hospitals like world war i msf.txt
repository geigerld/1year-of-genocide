our surgeon working with the aid agency Doctors Without Borders inside the AL AA Hospital in Northern Gaza has been injured in gunfire from outside the facility let's speak now to Leo can head of the Doctors Without Borders Mission he joins us live now uh from occupied East Jerusalem thanks very much uh for being with us so um tell us more about what happened here as as as far as what you've heard uh I think you know that the situation in ALA hospital is catastrophic uh it's really Under Siege since uh several days now um uh it's very difficult to get uh information from what is going on inside the hospital because of the Comm communication issues that we know since the beginning of the world which is a real challenge for us to coordinate operation but as well for the for the for the ambulances and all the the services to to to uh give help to the people it's a real challenge a lack of communication what we know from now is like one of our surgeon yes has been injur the last information I got is that critical situation he's doing okay but we are waiting to really be able to talk to him and have more direct information but we are of course outraging outrage but what is going on in ALA right now uh it's a bit the same scenario of what happened in shifa hospital that is repeating again and again in the different hospitals uh you mentioned that the the surgeon um involved uh who was who was injured from the gun is is is doing okay I'm wondering are you able to talk a little bit more about the extent of his injuries and and his his prospects for Recovery no not yet I think it's a light in from n so we have all the hope that he will be okay and we hope it's it should be the case and he should be even maybe able to to to work again and and operate patients so it's a it's a I'm sorry I cannot tell you more right now but I told you it's extremely challenging situation for us to to reach out to the people and just to stress that the fact for us it's very difficult to work in this context because our own staff our own colleagues they are in a in a in a survival mode all of them so it's very difficult to help people when when even yourself you are in a in a in in such distressful situation absolutely I mean when when when your own security is is in danger it's it's hard to even just focus on on the job that they're doing there as difficult as it is but I was wondering if you could talk about um the general beyond beyond the the the security uh challenges and and just as you say being able to survive what sort of conditions uh medical conditions are they working under there in terms of um the the supplies that they have the medicine and so on because the picture we're getting from hospitals throughout the Gaza Strip is they are desperately uh short of of of so many basic things is that is that what you're hearing as well absolutely absolutely and is the case in every Hospital of course the hospital in the north it's even worse but you know since the beginning of the war there have been a systematic targeting of the Whole Health System not only hospitals but the health system as a whole has been targeted and it's completely collapsed in the north there is no more functioning Health System even the hospitals that are still uh open they working and maybe two three four five% of their capacity we cannot call them like really hospitals they are they are not at all and in the South it is collapsing we have surgeons working in in Alexa in NASA hospital and in European General Hospital as well in Rafa and and and the same story all over the place they are Laing everything a lot of Childrens are arriving with a with a very bad injuries that they cannot operate in one go so they have to do multiple operation but then there is no more beds because the infrastructure for the for the of the health system is not made for that many people it's not made for that many wounded patients so just the beds is a good example we are operating people on the floor it's totally inhuman it's totally unacceptable um when we operate someone there is nowhere to put him afterward so we have to discharge patients which which in normal cases we will never discharge them uh one colleague msf doctor he told me few days ago that he had several patients with warms so leaving worms inside the wounds because this patient was coming from the north it had no change of the dressing for several days and the the wounds were infected we have 60% of the patients with infected wounds and some of them to the extent that there were worms inside the the the the wounds uh our surgeon you know we have international also surgeon coming to to work in in a in Gaza he told me uh he stated directly that right now the host it's like the World War I situation it's the same standard so to give you a picture in two months we pass from a relatively good health system with very uh good doctors and very high educated surgeons and doctors they are now operating in a setting that is the same as in World War I yeah it's certainly a very Bleak and desperate picture that you that you paint there um and I I I have to ask you with with so much of this going on uh around in inside these hospitals for your colleagues where where do they find the strength to to to carry on and to continue to do their jobs honestly I don't know and I have to say I am impressed we are all so much impressed by by how much dedicated they are uh we lost people msf staff but there are also health workers who died during this war it's just uh incredible and I don't know where honestly it's a good question and it's like it's like it's incredible what they doing I'm just afraid that they are doing this they take a lot on themselves and when it will be all all over they will still have a like a lot of traumatic events that they are going through right now right now they have maybe the power to do it because they in the spur of the moment but the violence of what they are leaving is incredible and for doctors for example to operate a child without a uh anesthesia it's it's it's a trauma that they will they will keep with them for the rest of their life so it's a it's a it's it's terrible at the same time uh what they are enduring another story I want to tell you that we got from a psychologist working in hospital he told us that he was talking with the five years old uh boy that had Suicidal Thoughts five years old boy thinking about committing SU side because he was such in such pain and and such suffering uh because of lack of medicine and the the psychological distress of losing his family that he was talking about societal things so it gives you an idea about how difficult it is for for those healthcare workers that put their life in danger but also for their mental health it's extremely challenge yeah it certainly is a unbelievably difficult situation that uh your colleagues are facing there we appreciate you talking to us about all of this and and we wish them the best and thanks very much for your time Leo k
