is ruling on the situation in Gaza I'm joined by the UN special reporter on the occupied Palestinian territories Francesca aloni she's joining us from Tunis very good to have you with us and Al Z thank you very much the international court of justice didn't specifically call for a ceasefire didn't address that in in its ruling how optimistic should people in Gaza be after this uh hi Rod I understand the frustration and despair of the people in Gaza uh who just need to see the end of this horror the end of the hostilities at the same time I'm quite positive on this on this hearing and what the court ordered because it's first of all it has dismissed uh Israel's um request not to consider the case it does recognize the plausibility that what Israel is doing uh might breach the genocide convention constitutes the constitutes genocide and uh and the court has precisely referred to genocide as the denial of existence of a people of the Palestinian people so the recognition that what Israel is doing amounts to this is uh is is incredibly important because eventually genocide the way I see it genocide is the rather dorment Gene of settler colonialism which is the overall context in which the current assault against Gaza iscribes itself and the court has recommended a number of measures that signify a complete uturn uh compared to what Israel is doing it means to uh seize killing of people destruction of Civilian infrastructure particularly Hospital seizing starving the civilians in Gaza so ultimately what the court is order ordering is that what Israel has been doing until now is brought to an end and it by recognizing the plausibility of genocide the court puts a clear obligation also reminds of a clear obligation that members states have to prevent genocide so in my view um from a state responsibility standpoint member states are called to uh put pressure for a CIS fire because there there is no other way to end all these rather than a other than a sensation of hostilities you mentioned and I hope I I hope I'm getting this right you mentioned earlier that you you saw this kind of violence as part of um I think it was settler violence might have been the phrase that you use correct me if I'm wrong on that but of course that is something that we're seeing in other parts of the occupied territories as well in the occupied East Jerusalem and of course in the West Bank this ruling is focused on Gaza but where does that leave the Palestinians in the rest of the occupied territories precisely precisely of course what uh the Palestinians in Gaza are experiencing is an unprecedented escalation of violence that ultimately is not new in the sense it has been uh it has been there through and through the decades of occupation that the Palestinians have experienced um in the occupied Palestinian territory and the then the violence that the Palestinian as a people have the Palestinians as a people have endured uh for 75 years I mean the fact that South Africa brought the knba at the very beginning of their um oral submission to the court is so significant and it places what is happening today in a broader historical and still enduring context indeed what's happening to to the to the Palestinians in the West Bank is is um is certainly lower in terms of intensity um but again they are experiencing Force displacement uh summary executions settler violence so it's the overall context of the occupation which has been a con of setler colonial practices that is is put in question today M this ruling is binding but it's not enforcable by the icj just because of the way it's structured it has to go to the UN Security Council for any enforcement action or support uh to take place how do you think that this is going to resonate with those allies of Israel that have been supporting it through the action it's been taking I'm thinking obviously of the United States particularly which has exercised its veto on several occasions I think that it's going to be more difficult to to defend Israel's stands and it's true that the United States have often used uh their veto power um to prevent to prevent basic measures of justice but I think it's going to be different for European countries which have a clear stance on respect for international law um so I do expect changes but of course those who are active in the human rights community needs to remain um Vigilant and continue their and continue their their action to put pressure on their governments and I would say not just in the west this is something that needs to resonate as South Africa has shown us needs to resonate across across the world this is a global test for international Justice and it applies to the West as to the rest including Arab countries Francesca albanes we appreciate you being with us in Al Z man thank you very much indeed for your time thank you
