when I landed in Israel I landed in Tel Aviv and then moved to Jerusalem but having traveled all over I can't say with any certainty what's going to happen all that I know is that something big has changed and everyone I spoke to all believe something has to happen and they cannot return to how things were before and that's everyone on both sides my name is Neil Sadler and I'm a producer with alaz English and between us I fear that this war could become a much larger regional conflict I was based mainly in occupied East Jerusalem amongst the Palestinian community and they spoke about how the Israeli authorities the police and the soldiers had completely changed how they interacted with the Palestinian Community I didn't do anything well you asked me for my ID I showed you my ID so before if they had been treated badly they could complain but after October 7th all those rules went out the window and they were being routinely harest I met two young men who lived in the old city and they spoke about the collective punishment that the Palestinians in Jerusalem face every time there's a flare up intentions or in this case the war and there had been a real increase in the surveillance of what they were saying online no one could post anything that was prop Palestinian no one could even like a post no one felt they could speak to me about what was happening seeing some of these young guys I understood how they must felt to be pushed up against the wall their legs spread to be told things about their their mothers or their sisters um to have their phone search to be insulted but not be able to react to it I definitely felt how humiliating that must have been when I first arrived I went South towards the Garen border there there were very chaotic scenes Israel had Co up thousands and thousands of [Music] reservists the noise was relentless there was a continuous sound of missiles and an aerial bombardment that Israel was launching on Gaza but you would also occasionally hear missiles come the other way now in the north things were very different Israelis I speak to there was a real fear of hisel almost everyone I met in in a town called Kat shimone were armed with assault rifles and also with pistols on their hips it was an eerie feeling everyone was preparing for something the fear was much different to the South they were exchanging Rockets they perhaps thought the hisbah was more of a force to be reckoned with in the Southeast in theat they fear an attack from Yemen now across the Red Sea Yemen have fired missiles and drones at elat a US warship has had to take those out the Israeli Air Force scrambled when that happened so as I traveled around all over I understood this had the potential to become a much larger regional conflict covering this uh this war um compared to other ones that I've covered is incredibly incredibly I feel anything that is said will be criticized by someone and I also feel that operating in his Ro if you say anything that's considered sympathetic to Palestine there will be a strong reaction I feel I have to watch what I say at all times um but I I believe it's important to continue to say how people are feeling because especially the Palestinians I spoke to say they can't express themselves they said for 75 years they they' never experienced anything like this before they could say something to a journalist but now nothing nothing will go back to how it was
