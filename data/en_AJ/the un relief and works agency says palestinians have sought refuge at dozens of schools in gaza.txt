well Jennifer Austin deputy director for the United Nations relief and works Agency for Palestine refugees joins us uh also from Gaza thank you so much for being on Alit here I imagine that you uh absolutely run off your feet um at this point in time we know that there are shortages of food water power fuel medical supplies almost everything is running out very very quickly can you just give us a bit of an update of how dire the situation is there right now thank you and good evening yes it is exhausting but it's more exhausting for the staff of the unur who are working tirelessly to provide services to the refugees and I think I heard earlier in your um earlier speaker talking about our our schools our shelters that we've got 270,000 uh idps are in our shelters and yeah we are really stretched um our emergency response plans cater for 150,000 clearly like after a few days and we now into day six we've almost exhausted all our supplies it's extremely extremely difficult yeah we've just heard that fuel at El shifa hospital is going to run out in three days which could potentially mean that 1,700 patients that are at that hospital could die I mean that that's the kind of situation that people are dealing with or living with there is there a plan for for when these supplies do eventually run out completely well um that's not part of the of the UN um plan because that that's that's sits outside of the unu but I'm not sure this is part of the who's plan I guess but what uh what we're doing is we're trying to mobilize fuel resources that we can um get our get available um you know we need to have fuel fuel into Gaza is the most critical because fuel is running the desalination plants so it's got we can get clean drinking water fuel is running um the the generators for the hospitals you know without fuel um you know gazer is in really big big trouble yeah we know many people and and organizations are calling for a safe passage to allow civilians uh to get out of Gaza but also allow Aid and supplies in and I know that you you're clearly one of them who are you talking to about trying to get a safe passage open well our commissioner General has been working tirelessly at the highest levels you know up to their Secretary General I'm sure that everyone is doing all the advocacy needed working with Egypt trying to get safe Passage through Egypt Egypt and Rafa seems to be the only available option at the moment how you personally and your your teams there how long will you be able to operate because obviously you're suffering like everyone else in Gaza at this point in time yeah look that's thank you there we really are suffering we've got in our in our shelters we've got 270,000 idps as I said now we've got you know water for out of out of um I think it's over a 100 shelters we we we've got now and and we've got clean water for 50 of those and we can you know move water around and things like that we will last for 10 days or up anything from 4 days to 10 days we will run out of water so it depends and if we if there's in a ground incursion or anything like that then we can't run our operations because we can't put our staff at risk and therefore you know we can't refuel the generators that run the desalination plants that we have um within our within our shelters and if we can't refuel the generators then we can't get the clean water so we need to be able to get access to our shelters we need even safe passage to get to our shelters so we can refuel them so we can get clean water for people if we can't you know get the fuel into the into the shelters then we're in trouble as as well incredible it's anywhere from 4 days to 10 days it's it's a really tight timeline and it's changing every day and every day we get more people coming in and you know it's a moving feast and it's really difficult to get the data because roads are closed telephone lines are down and now that the power's been cut off um people's telephones will have run out and charging and things like that so it's really hard for us to know on the ground to get a feel for it but all we know is that it's just so bad and so critical um and it's very very difficult but we've got over 5,000 of our staff are working across the whole of the Gaza Strip um to look after the people who are in our shelters incredible work that you and your team are doing in in the most dire of circumstances we really do appreciate you taking time uh to talk to us and explain what you and your team are going through uh there in Gaza that is Jennifer Austin deputy director for the United Nations relief and works Agency for Palestine refugees thank you so much
