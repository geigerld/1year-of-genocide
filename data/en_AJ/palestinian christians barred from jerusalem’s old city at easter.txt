the patriarch's parade is actually entered here into the Church of the Holy sep but let me just show you around this is empty normally this place would be completely packed out all the way into the courtyard there as well now it's interesting because the parade itself was led by the scouts who would normally have drums who would have musical instruments and they would be playing them really loudly there' be a much more A celebratory atmosphere that isn't happening because of the Christian Community showing solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza now like I said normally this place would be packed full of catalic coming from all over the world those tourists have simply stayed away but there is a community that does want to come here Palestinian Christians from the occupied West Bank but they're not allowed to come in by the Israelis the Israelis have simply banned them uh from even visiting uh one of the Sacred holy sites on one of the most important key dates of the year now the Western and Eastern churches will be celebrating Easter over the next four or five weeks but it's likely that the numbers are going to be incredibly low Imran Khan Al jaer Church of the Holy sea occupied East Jerusalem
