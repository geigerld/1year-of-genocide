we begin in Gaza where a number of Palestinians detained by Israeli forces say they were beaten tortured and humil humiliated they've now returned to Rafa and it's the latest in increasing accusations of gross mistreatment of prisoners and violation of international law aler spoke to two men about what they went through I was at home when the Army stormed my house I told them I'm sick and I can't move they took me out of my house and put me in an armored vehicle I thought at the beginning they would take me to a hospital but instead they took me to Israel I spent 10 days in Israel where they hit me insulted me and humiliated me every day I feel pain everywhere on my body they forced us to bend on our knees for hours they kept asking me about the tunnels and about their captives held by Hamas I told them I'm 70 years old and I know nothing about these matters they hit me a lot when I couldn't find an answer to their questions I swear to God that I didn't have a single drop of water for days it was the worst 10 days of my life when we got an evacuation warning we left our place and headed towards the sea the moment we arrived at the security checkpoint the Israeli soldiers kidnapped us we weren't even given a chance to ask any questions we spent the first 3 days without food or water we were not allowed to go to the toilets we were beaten harshly all over the first 3 days after that they moved us to another place for some new methods of torture after a 3day starvation they gave us a meal that's not even enough for a child in the prison you're allowed to sleep in the yard where the weather's very cold and where you have only a very thin mattress and very wet blanket the Israeli soldiers didn't stop beating us insulting us and swearing at us all the time in the studio by Al jazer senior political analyst marn Bashar Marin I think we need to pause and uh take stock of what we've just heard from hany there because obviously this is a conflict in which we've all seen horror upon horror but what we've been reporting in the past 24 hours appears to be allegations of systematic torture extrajudicial educ executions about bodies wrapped in plastic thrown in in Shallow Graves I mean what does this say about the kind of War that's been waged by Israel and Gaza I think we've arrived at the Abu moment u in Gaza where the actual physical torture and humiliation uh physical violence and so on so forth is finally exposed so there's Revelations now more and more of them accumulating after months of war the gazans the Palestinians in Gaza have been subjective to a number or different types of violence right so for a long time it was The Siege and uh over over the past four months the sieg me started starvation it meant denial of basic human rights especially to children and to mothers and fathers and so on and that's a very particular silent implicit kind of violence then there was the bombing the bombing from the air artillery bombing from the sea but that was the kind of bombing that you do from a distance right it's very very hurtful very destructive very bloody but it's from Far you're a pilot you're you're Manning an artillery shell or whatever and then there is a psychological violence right the psychological violence the terror the drones scaring people and what have you and then there's this violence the primordial violence the Primitive violence the physical violence the torture the Abu type violence that's been exposed where Israeli soldiers are physically personally psychologically invested in torturing Palestinians in this in the kind of sadism in the kind of hurtful humiliating sadism against the Palestinians as if it goes beyond the Revenge of a primordial time as if it goes beyond defense Beyond offense beyond beyond racism it goes to something very very basic instinctive I would say animalistic approach to another human being it has been described by some as as a conflict of annihilation a war of annihilation I wonder where this evidence that we've seen accumulated over the past 24 48 Hours where that sits in the context of what has been decided at the international court of justice just uh just under a week ago today you know um I think the Israelis apparently have Lost in Translation right as if they have not understood and they're American backers as if they have not understood OD what came out from the international court of justice I mean my own interpretation I would say Israel has been indicted right there's no final verdict but they accepted the case Israel is basically officially indicted for genocide and you would think that they came out innocent because there is no ceasefire involved as if all the charges that were made and then all the the provincial measures the inter orders the icg ordered Israel in the interim to do a number of things because it's suspected of genocide but when you look at for example what they're doing in the hospitals or around the hospitals or in the hospitals like in Janine where did they disguise as doctors where they kill people in hospitals where they turn hospitals into battlefields or into targets there's something about you know turning doctors into enemies I mean I I I think for the Palestinians probably the Saints the present day Saints are the doctors and the nurses and the medical staff because they're the only ones out there at the Forefront trying to you know make the hurt go away or try try to listen the hurt of of Palestinians and as if that is angering the Israelis the most and hence there's the kind of a criminal acts you know a violation of all legality and morality by using the hospitals as battlefields or by bombing the hospitals as if they are targets they are of course meant to be places of healing marn stay with us because I also want to reflect upon some diplomatic movement that we've uh seen uh in recent days as well because katar's prime minister told National Public Radio in the US that the framework for a ceasefire with Israel is now being presented to Hamas he says indirect negotiations will take place in the coming days we cannot predict that is it going to have a breakthrough and will move forward very fast or how fast it will go it will all depends on both parties our aim is to finish this as soon as possible and to bring the hostages back but to put a closure for the war as well okay well I'm uh joined of course still by Maran Bashar is here in the studio with me so the message I think the takeaway message there was there is a degree of movement we cannot promise anything right now but tentatively discussions are happening these indirect talks are are underway is Haner um the obviously prominent Hamas figure is in Egypt being briefed what does all of this mean if we try and connect the dots well there's two ways to look at it I mean just to make it really simple one way is that this is all an attempt at creating the impression that something is happening and that America and nanah government the Biden Administration and and the Egyptians and everyone else trying to do their best in order to bring about an end to this and and to get the captives out and and and so on so forth because that buys Israel time I mean Israel now is benefiting from this whole movement to carry out its genocide that we were just talking about the torture right and then there is the other one that says look everyone is fed up uh including the Israelis the public by the war and the Palestinians certainly want to have an end to this Suffering The Americans are an election year they would like to wind it down so this interpretation says there is a good reason why all parties might be interested in at least some kind of a deal but the gap between Hamas and Israel is huge right the only way to bridge the gap is for the Americans to get in with the with the support or with the help of Qatar and Egypt and others and and give guarantees to both parties that if you sign on WE the Americans will guarantee you a number of things if the parties buy into the guarantees we could have a deal my only fear uh n my only fear is that they could reach a deal but it could break in no time Maran many thanks for your analysis as always m b then
