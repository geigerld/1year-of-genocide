so how much of a threat does this pose to prime minister Netanyahu in his Coalition and would his government survive the Fallout from such a change in policy we'll explore all these issues with our panel of guests in a moment but first this report from CA Lopez hyan Ultra Orthodox Jews have always been exempt from Israel's mandatory military service that is set to change but not without a fight those protesting say as religious Jews joining the Army contradict their traditions and lifestyle we preer dying we prer fing the jails to the Army we're not going full St along with military exemptions the ultra Orthodox also receive a government subsidy if they study the Torah full time in religious institutions Israel's supreme court has ordered the government to stop payments for those who defy the draft it comes amid growing resentment among those called to enlist we want the ultra Orthodox in the Army now no delays no politics and no tricks the issue is a challenge for Benjamin Netanyahu that could wreck his Coalition he built an alliance with right-wing groups to secure his term as prime minister and overseeing an end to the military exemption could be seen as political betrayal I am sure we can get this agreement with a majority in the keset but also one thing is clear to me it's impossible to obtain a total consensus it's been a controversial issue for years but the war in Gaza has turned it into an urgent one military leaders say they need more people to enlist and more people on the ground in Gaza some ministers say they're ready to resign if the exemption continues this nation cannot accept it and it should not be approved my colleagues and I will not be members of the emergency government if such legislation passes and if it enters the law books of Israel the issue is controversial and could Mark a significant shift in Israeli Society one that could extend well beyond Israel's war on Gaza K Yan Al jazer for insight [Music] story so what's the significance of all this for the Israeli people and the war on Gaza and Beyond the question for today's panel in West Jerusalem Ephraim inbar the president of the Jerusalem Institute for strategy and security that aims to advise Israel's leaders in defense and diplomatic matters in London Yosi meckelberg is the associate fellow at chattam house specializing in the politics of Israel in the Middle East and in Tel Aviv Marin rapor is the editor of local call a Hebrew language news site advancing citizen journalism and an independent media thank you all of you for joining us I'd like to get to the ultra orth Orthodox first but there are lots of countries around the world that don't have what some call the draft so let's get to the basic system first if I can to you Ephraim just explain what the basic rule is for Israelis as I understand it with some exceptions everyone at the age of 18 must serve you are correct the law is that everybody is to be enlisted there are Exceptions there are two main exceptions one is the Arab Israeli we prefer not put not to put them in a difficult position to fight their cousins literally their cousins sometimes and also the ultra Orthodox that for historic reasons do not serve initially when the state was established there was a political agreement between David benuron and the leadership of the ultra Orthodox to allow them to uh lend their legitimacy to the new established state and the agreement was to allow a few hundred 400 I believe Boys in Yesa in uh schools of higher Jewish learning to be exempt from service this is how it started during let let me bring in meron on this because before again before we go to the specific area of the ultra Orthodox just explain it to me a little bit more if if if you 18 years old and for example you object to the current conflict that's taking place in Gaza um on political grounds if for example you believe that Israel is not doing enough to get Aid in as the international court of justice says or if you believe there should be a ceasefire now as the uh un Security Council says is there an exemption for you there if you if you if you have political disagreements with the war that Israel is involved in no essentially no uh there are there is a you could be exent on a concial uh uh reasons but that is very very difficult to obtain uh there's you know all kind of gray arrangement in which um you know young uh uh people who who do not want to serve find you know all kind of health problems in order not to serve but if you say that you don't want to serve because you disagree with the with the with the policies of the government or the occupation or you name it you go to prison okay Yosi let's now turn to the specific subject area here which is the ultra Orthodox Community let's first work out exactly who these people are if you could give us a little bit of a history lesson I mean these are the Jewish communities that wear traditional clothing Embrace tradition OS modern values and practices just explain to me who these communities are and where they came to Israel from well many of the ultra Orthodox came from from east Europe the nowadays you have Ultra Orthodox faradi ult Orthodox political politically speaking they have two party in in in theet Chas in audat Israel and I think it's worth reminding our audience and our viewers that many of them actually opposed the Zionist idea they also said this is preempting the Messiah so the idea of establishing a state went against their Creed and they saw the Zionist movement as a secular one many of them were socialists or liberals and they opposed it so the phenomenon of them moving many of them you know you have Ultra Orthodox that actually lived for hundreds of years in in in what's known as ER Israel the land of Israel but many of them arrived after 1945 and after the Holocaust and their tendency to begin was to stay out of politics but realize that by staying out of politics there is a heavy price in terms of of being close to to power and what power comes with now one of the thing that the fry mentioned earlier at the early days of of the country the first Prime Minister exempt around 400 of them from serving in in in in the milit in the IDF and I think there are two pillars to this exemption one is is I think the some of the more secular soft spot towards those who dedicate their life to study the Jewish Theology and I think also there is which become more and more important as we come to the topic today is the needs to for the need of the more secular parties whether it's in the past labor or could nowadays for their support in order to form a coalition without paying certain ideological price when it comes to the issue with the Palestinians Ephraim then if you can bring us up to date you said earlier you thought that the estimate was about 400 in 1948 how many now and how politically powerful are this group well uh there are several cohorts age cohorts that were not enlisted and after a certain age after all the Army doesn't call you so we are talking about close to 70,000 uh youngsters between age of 18 and 24 25 that could be called into service but they are exempt this is a quite a large number the political power of the ultra Orthodox as Yosi has mentioned has increased over time because there are not left or right but in the middle politically in in modern terms and they basically can join any Coalition and therefore they can maneuver uh politically much better as a result of that they get a lot of uh of the benefits of the states and recently in the past maybe 20 years they have become part of the rightwing block making a coalition with Netanyahu also in Jerusalem was who all previous prime minister and this Coalition is now of course threatened by the issue of enlistment Maron then let's let's bring it right up to date and why it's become such a huge issue now seems to me there are two aspects one is the conflict in Gaza and two there's been a long running court process that seems to be coming to a head first um in terms of the war on Gaza how the fact that this community does not I believe there are some that have volunteered to fight but doesn't send soldiers at this time when Israel is at War how does the rest of the country feel about that that has always been a sensitive issue the fact that uh such a large community that is growing bigger because the the birth rate there is is twice or even third uh three times higher than in in the in the rest of the population so uh the tension that uh such a large number of young people do not serve uh has always been a sensitive issue certainly after the the you know the shock of October 7th and the war on Gaza and the fact that uh Israel lost uh more than 650 soldiers that's a whole Brigade almost that were killed 3,000 were wounded uh soldiers so the Army really needs and and and the prospect is of a prolonged war in Gaza and maybe in Lebanon and we don't know uh where else so so uh the Army really needs uh more soldiers they're talking about that they need at least uh more 7,000 soldiers new soldiers in in the draft in the regular draft and that's uh that's something that uh uh puts more pressure on the ultra Orthodox in on this tension between the secular side of Israel and the the ultra Orthodox it has to be added as a f said that in the last uh I would say 15 years the Orthodox Al Orthodox have become a major almost founding uh part of Nan's Coalition of right-wing Coalition rightwing block and therefore going against nany when uh the secular what is called now the liberal camp in in in Israel is going against netan is also aiming at the old Orthodox because because this is the weakest uh uh I would say part of the chain of the of the of the um of the right-wing block because they're not liked uh by the seculars they're not really liked by even the the religious the the National Religious the settlers they're not liked by them because the settlers go to the Army and the Orthodox don't they're not zist as as Yosi mentioned or not declared so there are lot of tension they are the weakest uh uh part of the right wi block and therefore when the liberal uh Camp attack uh there are also an easier Target as I said there's you see been a long running Court proceedings going on here very long running just bring us up to speed of where we are now because that has come to a head as well at this time when Israel is at War yes because there are many issues Beyond actually the military service first I think we the the fact that they have a voting pattern the ultra Orthodox that tells you almost you know in advance of any election how many member of neset they are going to how many seats they are going to gain and they can become Kings makers with this also come that they want ideologically to impose more and more religious laws and moving towards more Alaric state which upsets the the more liberal minded then on top of it what upsets many of of the of the secular those who serve in the army that those who are not going to the Army the ult Orthodox at the age of 18 they actually are paid by the government so their rabanal seminars that were mentioned earlier are basically sponsored by those who later you know first serve in the Army then are going to to work in something that's in in jobs that generates wealth in the society and pay for those that a don't serve in the Army B study in this rabanal seminars topics and issues mainly it's it's Jewish Juris prudence and and and scholarly that's not going to gener generate wealth what now this high court of justice says that if they don't serve in the Army then also that this money from the public PSE shouldn't be be be paid to this bcal seminars it's it's an attempt actually to create some equality within the burden that you have in every society who actually those who carry the burden whether it's in this case military service creating a prosperous economy and you are the one that actually if you look at the statistics in Israel the ultra Orthodox pay one nth when it comes to taxes to what to what the secular one or at least the secular and those who are not Ultra Orthodox religious that not Ultra Orthodox and that's what the kind of what you know the appeals to the high court of justice and the decision by the high court of justice is trying to rectify Ephraim this current headache for prime minister netanyahu's as we heard comes from the justice system um of course the backdrop from this over the last year is that the Prime Minister was having a battle about changing that system well I think uh this is uh something that happens in many countries over the division of power between the Parliament and the supreme court of justice we see it in the United States in many other Democratic countries I personally favor you know limiting the power of the Supreme Court of justice that imposes its values on the rest of the society such decision should be made by by the parliament this is my objection but I think the the issue is is different I think the secular uh population is frightened by the fertility rate of uh of the ultra Orthodox and if this demographic trend continues and I'm not sure it will continue because it can be somehow managed it will make the secularists and even smaller minority and you know the Israeli Society has is not dichotomic it has Ultra Orthodox National Religious which are modern Orthodox people and a large part of traditional Jews and the secularists are actually a minority they have been you know the founding element of of the Israeli State and they become a minority and it's it's a struggle for power and of course it it annoys not only the secularist what is happening with the service with the military service with the old Orthodox so in this respect they can find allies among other elements of the population in order to bring a change in the habits of the ultra Orthodox maybe forcing them to some extent into modernizing and becoming part of a modern economy and thereby changing somewhat their views and limiting their uh political influence Yosi if I can ask you to take a look inside prime minister netanyahu's Coalition and just explain to us how divided the cabinet is on this and how much of a problem it is for the Prime Minister who in the past in building cabinets has been described by some as a bit of a politic Houdini how's he going to get out of this one well it's it's it's a tough one because if he's losing the ultra Orthodox if they living the Coalition he has no Coalition because it will be followed also most probably by by people like Ben gun and and and Eisen Cod they joined only because of of of of the war and they due to leave the Coalition and for the ultra Orthodox this is one of the major issue one of the source of of the supporting them is because they the one that put pressure on any Coalition on any government and prime minister to exempt him from from milit military service there are a lot of C there to square and I don't I think it's it's the question here if they can legislate because always through legislation they can change the decision by the high court of justice in a way that is you know then that's why it's so important to resist what netan called the reforms because whether it's reasonable and and most most people in Israel think that's exempting the ultra Orthodox is unreasonable but there are ways to resolve it it doesn't mean that tomorrow all the all the old Orthodox which at the age of military service should be should be mobilized into the army there are ways to resolve it so some of them that want to join the Army be mobilized by reducing the the financial support of rabanal seminar maybe taxation of those that don't serve and incentivize those who want to want to serve in the Army but this needs really a national discussion around this issue because it divides the country meon picking up on that point I mean if they were forced to serve all these Ultra Orthodox how exactly would that work would they be willing soldiers would they serve in front line combat um units would they work cohesively in the military what's your what's your view on that I think this is very far away although um theoretically from tomorrow uh uh the the the law is abolished the law that allows them the uh not to serve is abolished and they should serve and the funding from the government should stop to the yeshivas to the ranal seminars should stop tomorrow uh I think the chances that this will happen are very slim uh they may uh refuse to serve uh and if we are talking about tens of thousands I think it will be impossible uh for for for the Army uh to to to lock up uh thousands and thousands of yiva BOS uh it will not happen uh the Army is completely unprepared uh to to to get them they you have to understand that they come also with very limited education general education they don't know English for example they don't uh they don't know mathematics uh it will be extremely difficult uh to enlist them uh you will have to change the Army in order to to give them the opportunity for culture uh uh Ms and culture training even meaning that they will not train with women uh so it's very very complicated I think the issues still now is more political I think Netanyahu is in a very weak point I weak point I think that detention within his own Camp I'm not talking even in the General Public within his own Camp are growing uh to allow for uh uh old these Ultra Orthodox not to serve is not accepted as I said by the settlers for example let me let let me bring Ephraim in on that point I mean how difficult a moment is this for prime minister Netanyahu not just this issue but there's the failure to free the captives still being held by Hamas there's growing tensions between the US and Israel particularly over the planned offensive there you've got a un Security Council resolution two sets of international court of justice provisional measures making Israel some would say um getting more of a par status how difficult is this now for the Prime Minister obviously Nan is in a very difficult position because of domestic problems and international pre pressure ER winning the war will change uh uh something and this means defying to some extent the United States although we share the same goal of defeating Hamas with with the United States as well as many Arab countries and he will try to find a compromise on the ultra Orthodox enlistment because if this issue becom Central uh in the next election it will be political suicide actually I wor him personally about it Yi um if we just look at this if if Netanyahu was to fall over this I mean in the middle of Israel still involved in a conflict in Gaza what then happens I assume you have new elections and then he stays on as the caretaker prime minister doesn't he and and that it takes a long time from my experience of to organize elections in Israel he could still be prime minister quite a long time even if he was toppled well if if we if you believe public opinion pools and they are quite you know continuously consistent that the public wants netan out and not surprisingly so so what Israel needs is is election many of people that supported the netan and lud party in the last election say outright that they don't want to see netan anymore as prime minister not even Le leud and power they are looking for something else at the end of the day what we see in Israel domestic and internationally the mess that Israel is right now in the name of Netanyahu is all over it whether forming the most rightwing and incompetent government in the country's history not being prepared for October 7 the the judicial the judici the assault of the judicial ER on the independence of the Judiciary what we see now with the AL that's all because Netanyahu is facing corruption trial is stying is trying to stay indefinitely as prime minister in order also to stay possibly out of jail and Israel can move forward only if and when netan is out Yosi thank you very
