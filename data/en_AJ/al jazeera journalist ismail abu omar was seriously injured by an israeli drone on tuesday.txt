all right we're going to go back uh to our coverage of Gaza now we're joined by Dr Muhammad alad he's a plastic and reconstructive surgeon and he's part of the American medical team with rahma Worldwide that's an independent humanitarian organization he's joining us from the European Hospital in Gaza doctor thank you very much for your time I understand that you've just recently arrived as part of a team of American doctors what is the situation in the European hospital what do you find uh thank you for having me on um the team we have just a minor correction uh we were're 19 surgeons from the United States Jordan and France um the situation here is undescribable to say the least um when we came we arrived Thursday night and um Friday morning with everybody went to the o just to start their cases um I can give you innumerable stories about um that will illustrate how the situation is best if I say this morning I had to do surgery without any gowns I had to do it with my scrubs um I've seen patients with minor burns that end up dying just because there's no care um nothing can be uh nothing's available actually to provide them with care uh I had a sorry to interrupt you Dr ala but when you say that you know nothing is available can you tell us what you mean exactly sure so I'm talking in terms of equipments I'm I'm talking in terms of supplies I'm talking in terms of um staff the Physicians and the uh and nurses are completely exhausted when we came on um we asked them to to kind of let us give them a relief however they still continue to work and uh they've been working on sto for for about four months now over four months and um you walk into the war and we are practicing an 18th century medicine here okay because we don't have equipments we don't device okay so that's what you mean when you say that you don't have anything what then does that mean for the patients at the hospital the care for them their chances poor outcome and high mortality um I'm telling you I had I've lost in this week several patients for for very simple reasons uh we don't have good dressing uh gauze we don't have uh some dressing supplies patient get septic patient die because the ventilators are um are not working well um we don't have enough medications to treat patients with so it's it's it's across the board it sounds like an incredibly difficult situation can you give us an idea of how many patients the hospital is meant to be servicing providing treatment for and the kind of numbers and injuries that you're seeing so I I don't have exact numbers however um my understanding from discussion with the staff here European hospital was not meant to be a trauma hospital it was meant to be like a medical facility to treat you know high blood pressure uh diabetes that kind of thing however uh due to the circumstances we're in right now they have to treat um massive casualties and multiple casualties uh uh in the ER uh last night we heard ambulances coming I ran down with a couple of my uh team members um out of six people in three died so mortality is really high we don't have ultrasounds in the ER we don't have centralized we don't have medications we don't have anything toate patients with so they just end up dying that is just absolutely horrific what describing I believe that you also know about the condition of our colleague is abuan and and I just want to make sure go ahead yes please continue and and I just want to make sure that whoever listening to us understand that this has nothing to do with what is your political stand or what's your ideological background or what's your ethnic background this has nothing to do with that this has to do with a a group of people that have been uh in in a crisis situation and no hands been extended to them to give them some support we're treating children we we're treating women we're treating elderlies and um mortality is really high across the board and it's I can't believe that 21st century we allow this to happen and you're treating people and you're treating people who are supposed to be protected under international law even during times of War including journalists I believe that you know about the condition of our colleague ismile Abu Omar who lost his leg in an Israeli drone attack how's he doing well at this point um he's still critical I just spoke with uh your uh one of your um um uh producers I believe another he he needs to be without ASAP because there's high risk of losing another limp will be a bilateral EMP and maybe losing part of his fingers and um we don't have any um any equipments or resources to treat him locally here he needs he needs to be sent out Dr ala thank you very much for joining us and for really describing to us the situation at the European hospital just one of few that are functioning in Gaza thank you for your time thanks for having me on
