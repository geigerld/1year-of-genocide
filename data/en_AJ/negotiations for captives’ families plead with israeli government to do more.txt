results are what these Israeli want and immediately gathered in Tel Aviv they make a desperate plea to the Israeli government to bring back their relatives and loved ones held captive by Hamas in Gaza I'm demanding from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the cabinet to give us answers and results where are you we have no strength anymore relatives are worried they'll lose their loved ones in Israel's Relentless air strike news of the death of one 19-year-old Soldier Noah Marciano has come as a shock for many on Monday angry words were directed at a member of parliament who called to erase Gaza there are babies Jews and Arabs by the way they're there what is it supposed to do to our mental strength to hear you talk with such slogans to erase to annihilate to flatten who are you flattening as people sit in cafes in West Jerusalem talk these days censors on how best to bring them back Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu insist the only way is through full military force I think they're going in the right direction but they need to put more pressure on Hamas we feel that you know they're not doing enough but we may not know the full story and so I believe that they are doing the best they can the government needs to do more to ensure captives are released through negotiations Hamas is offering a 5day ceasefire in exchange of releasing some of the captives among other conditions Israel hasn't responded now these are just some of the faces of the 242 captives being held in Gaza posters like this across the whole of Israel a reminder to bring them back home as pressure on the Israeli government increases every day Gerson Baskin helped negotiate the release of Israeli soldier Gad Shalit in 2011 after 5 years in captivity he believes that any type of ceasefire will be difficult to achieve there is only one way to bring all the hostages home alive and that's the all for all deal all the hostages for all the prisoners in in Israel that's very unlikely to happen we're talking about 7,000 people 559 of them who had killed Israelis and are serving life sentences 130 of terrorists who were caught in Israel after October 7 this is something that I cannot imagine Israeli Society or this current Israeli government agreeing to at this point these protesters will be walking to Jerusalem in the coming days to meet at the prime minister's office and demand the return of their loved ones as soon as possible sahat AL jazer West Jerusalem
