yumna say joins us on the phone from inside Gaza yumna the latest line that's just dropping as we go to air is electricity has now been cut can you confirm that yes Sammy exactly an hour ago at 2 pm local time it was the last warning that electricity is going to be completely cut off the Gaza Strip because of running of the last amount of fuel and now they have stated that it is completely completely cut off in all areas what does that mean for for life in Gaza right now well without electricity it means that there's no water it means that complete darkness through the night it means that hospitals are going to be only operating with their emergency generators which can only last from two to 4 days maximum it means that most of the light in Gaza depending on electricity has shut down and I mean just thinking through this basic things if you're in as many residents live in multistory rise apartments you want to switch on the water tap it's going to be hard to get water if your P electric pumps are not working if you want to switch an oven on assuming you have something to cook all of that goes out the window now right that has already been out of the window about three days ago already since we're only we were only uh witnessing uh uh 4 hours of electricity and then two hours of electricity no elevators working in any of the towers or buildings people only use the chairs um uh no water is being generated people are uh uh filling uh uh tanks and whatever they can fill uh to take to their homes we're going back to centuries before uh any kind of uh any kind of uh you know sophisticated technology let's say we're going back centuries filling uh water water in in in in buckets and taking them to our homes so that we can have some water in our homes this is exactly how it is but now uh it's even going it's even being worse because even when we had an hour or something of electricity where we could charge our phones where we could uh watch TV uh check the news out where we could generate water for a little bit it a store home all that is being disrupted now the scenes that you're describing it sounds like when you read about medieval sieges I mean to what extent do people have access to their own electrical generators and if they do do they have fuel to run them backup generators and so on now it's not generators or backup generators that are working these have been used uh extensively the past few days when we only had four hours of electricity these generators working in the streets and backup generators were the ones that were uh providing another two to to to four hours in in in best times or in in different locations of electricity but now those people who only have solar panels in Gaza are the ones who will be able to have some electricity in their home but again solar panels does not mean that you will have your elevator working it does not mean that you will have water generated it it would not mean anything of these facilities working it means that at least at least do you have uh uh some electricity at home for uh uh bulb lights you have uh some some Chargers that can operate on electricity uh at at at best time if your solar panels are uh a little bit strong you can have your TV operating so Y is Gaza on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe given what you're describing Gaza is literally on the verge of collapse it's we're already we've already been suffering humanitarian catastrophe the past few days since the launching of this war with the extensive uh bombardment of human homes of residential homes and uh the amount of people uh being displaced the amount of people under the rubble not having anyone to help them out uh the the the Health Service uh completely in in full crisis uh the the shortage in supply of food and water inside the strip this is this is exactly how life is in Gaza life in Gaza is slowly death by death ending it's like you're pulling oxygen out of something scy exactly yum know we do hope you'll stay safe thank you for your reporting for us in these very difficult conditions
