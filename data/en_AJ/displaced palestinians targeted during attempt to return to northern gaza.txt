hundreds of people leaving Central Gaza trying to reach their homes in the north traveling through El rashed street that runs the length of gaza's Coastline but their journey is cut short by an Israeli strike many Palestinians had heard that the Israeli military was allowing safe passage they said there's a return to the north we want our homes we want our lives we want to return whether with or without a truth want to return enough Israel denies offering people access to travel instead claiming it warned people against moving North and saying the area is still a war zone as it has been since the War Began on 7th October but conditions for the 1.9 million displaced people in Central and Southern Gaza that's 80% of the population are so difficult many cannot bear to remain where they are life here is very miserable the necessities of life are non-existent at risk to ourselves we are trying to return to the places we were in before and meet our families children and loved ones who remain there thousands of people are in overcrowded un shelters that were formerly schools and many more are in tense and makeshift shelters all with inadequate access to running water food and toilets we have not known Comfort since we were displaced we want to rest and return to our place but the journey home is dangerous and if they manage to get there they'll find widespread destruction with the majority of buildings including their homes flattened imagin Kimber Al jazer make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
