when it comes to Gaza the contradictions of what the United States says at the United Nations versus what it does in Washington was laid bare during an emergency security council meeting in response to Israel's attack on Saturday at a school where Palestinian civilians were Sheltering killing nearly 100 of them we mourn every civilian lost in this horrific incident and in this conflict at the very moment the meeting was taking place news came that Washington signed off on a new2 billion military sales deal with Israel the atmosphere in the council chamber was tense after the Israeli Ambassador claimed his country is the most moral country in the world you listen Palestinian representative and then personally attacked both the Palestinian and Algerian Representatives Algeria took the floor again I wanted testify here that the 16,000 children who have been killed since the 7th of October didn't kill themselves Israel's Ambassador then walked out as he was speaking resolution 2735 adopted by the council in June and ordering a ceasefire has been ignored as Israel continues its attacks on Gaza by the un's count bombing 21 shelters since early July this Council has responsibility to end the impunity with which Israel has been carrying out its atrocities against the Palestinian people it flies in the face of everything that the United Nations is built on peace and security human rights and sustainable development we cannot allow this to continue show some bravery take actions stop the criminals in getting away with murder it's frustrations are beginning to boil over after more than 20 emergency Security Council meetings on Gaza in the past 10 months have failed to end the genocide frustration that the captives have not been released that Israel continues to act with impunity and that the US continues to provide arms to the very country doing most of the killing Gabriel zando Al jaera at the United Nations in New York make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
