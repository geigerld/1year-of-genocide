alham salh is joining us live from occupied East Jerusalem so tell us more about what the Israelis have been saying about their operation at alifa hospital ham it's uh been more than two days that they've been there now right Elizabeth so more than 48 hours after the Israeli forces raided Al shifa Hospital the Israeli military spokesperson Daniel haadi is saying that they're going to continue their military presence there I want to also point to what the Israeli Prime Minister said in an interview with CBS news saying that Israel had an indication a strong indication actually that there were captives being held at Al shifa hospital but just less than 24 hours after the Israeli Army raided the hospital on November 15th they released a statement saying that they didn't have an indication there were captives being held there but rather thought that this Mission could assist them in finding information on their whereabouts the Israeli Army has been saying for some time that Hamas uses a shifa hospital and other medical facilities as bases and Military headquarters but they have not provided any concrete proof or evidence even two days after they entered the largest medical complex in the Gaza Strip they have not provided this large proof to back up the claims they have been making for quite some time remember in the beginning days of the war the Israeli military showed an animated video that that showcased a complex network of tunnels that were multi-leveled and a large military headquarters at the bottom of it but what the Israeli military did show in their findings was a an opening in the ground that looks to have been dug up somewhere around the shiffa complex so while the Israeli military and politicians alike have been making these claims for some time they have not been providing the evidence needed to support them the images they published on Wednesday of the weapons cash in the hospital couldn't be independently verified or fact checked but the Israeli Army is sticking with these claims they say that the operation at alifa hospital will continue and hagat says that they're quote looking to achieve more goals Elizabeth ham thank you very much for that ham Salud live and occupied East Jerusalem
