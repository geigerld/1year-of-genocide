right let's bring in alzer's senior political analyst Maran bashara joining us here on the set Maran thanks for for being with us um just in the last couple of minutes Reuters has had an exclusive uh wire drop saying the United States intelligence is confirming that it was an isol attack in Iran there's also the the killing of Salah alarri in Beirut in recent days which some conservative commentators are saying why isn't the US thanking Israel for taking out someone on its own Terror list with its own $5 million bounty on it but it seems that fears of escalation are really tramping everything else for the White House at the member yes but not necessarily in a negative way let me explain so there's no doubt that blinkin is once again in the Middle East to try to clean Israel's mess but it's an American Israeli mess because since day one when President Biden told prime minister Netanyahu go get Justice I think it was clear that this was going to be a devastating war and it's going to have consequences and that's why the United States sent two aircraft carriers to the Mediterranean it anticipated trouble it knew there was going to be trouble but that's strategically within the American calculus now in the past four months three four months it's it's got a beating in terms of its standing in terms of public relations in terms of accusations of genocide and all that stuff war crimes and so on but strategically speaking America doesn't feel to be in a defensive position it's on the contrary since Biden left Afghanistan humiliatingly since China tried to and succeeded in mediating between Iran and Saudi Arabia Biden has been saying America is back America is not going to leave vacuum in the Middle East for Iran China and Russia to fill so how will the United States then become Central to the Middle East it does it by two ways one it lightens fires and then it puts out the fires this is called pyromaniac fireman it needs to make and create trouble in order to be the solver of trouble it is the benevolent Empire the indispensable nation in the Middle East where blinkin comes as the savior of the problems America was already an instigator well one of the sort of recipes for putting out fires from the American perspective was going to be some sort of plan for the post-war situation in Gaza it had been pushing and pushing the N Administration to to come up with something now it has come up with something and it doesn't seem that it's anything like what the Americans wanted that's true by the way Netanyahu did not approve the plan yet it's still a military plan a military plan is indispensable because without the military there will be no plan right it be still in the logic of War now there are a few comments on that quick right one I'm not sure Israel is going to win the war in Gaza everyone's assuming that Israel is going to win and they're talking about the day after it's not clear anymore Israel is getting a beating in Gaza and if it must wind down the war it must withdraw the reserves it must stop the the indiscriminate bombing it's not clear anymore that Israel will actually win in terms of its own uh in game in Gaza defeating Hamas that's not clear anymore at all you think blinkin is going to intervene again to try and sort of wind things down before it gets to that point absolutely he has to now right now there are accusation of genocide now we're talking about the international uh court of justice there's a lot of complications we have boiling Arab capitals we have heating uh borders with Lebanon there's a lot of complications now and I think America wants to wind down the war in an election year that's not to the liking of Netanyahu wants to continue with the war because he has not re reached his objective now America has already said a number of things it wants the Palestinian Authority to be involved in Gaza Netanyahu and his government and his military say no now they're talking about local leaders they said they have to end the occupation Israel says no we're going to maintain security oversight there they said that there's going to be no Siege of God Israel is is not talking about that so whatever Israel is proposing is certainly not to the liking of the Biden Administration now Biden is going to have to Biden and blink's going to have to have some tough conversation with Netanyahu because America's looking bad America is going to continue to look bad as a student of Israeli politics I tell you nanyo is not going to listen to the United States unless America uses its leverage if Biden doesn't use his leverage with Israel Israel's not going to listen it has its own calculus it's insecurity it's own understanding of what security is and it's not simply going to roll over because blink came to the area the contrary every time blinking came to the air at the past five times he's the one who rolled over and nany continued the Israel continue to do what it wants to do in Gaza all right maren for now thank you very much
