from liptock this is a declared starvation war against more than 700,000 Palestinians in this region the whole word should remember always that this war has started with a clear decision that emanated from the government of the Israeli occupation forces Netanyahu and the defense minister Gallen where when they decided last October 99 to stop and not allow any water or fuel to access Gaza this is a war crime and the the world did not do anything about it or to put an end to it even after the international court of justice has declared that this is a war crime or intentional War crime against the people in Gaza Strip the situation is escalating the situation is dire and the whole world is watching every day as our children and our women are screaming and suffering in the north and even after many people died because of hunger now the situation is really urgent the willingness of the Israeli occupation forces to let our people die out of hanger with an intent to commit a war crime this is threatening the lives of more than 10,000 Palestinians who could die as our people are waiting for the International Community and the United Nations with all its agencies to take the concrete steps immediately in order to let all the AIDS enter the strip and to put an end to the besiege and to end this massacres we are surprised with the decision of Po in order to stop all the food aids to Northern Gaza after three days of trying or attempts to let some very small aids to get into Gaza as this humanitarian crisis is deepen every day in this region we call on fou and all the UN agencies including Ona not to surrender to the decision of the enemy and all its decisions to impose a war crime and to resume their activities and operations in Northern Gaza and to take conrete steps and measures in order to rescue our people and offer some relief in order to avoid the hunger that is now threatening the lives of our people and to take to take responsibility our national Duty also is imposing on us in order to take conrete measures and to put an end to the besiege and to convene and according to the Urgent Summit that took place last month they need to take concrete measures immediately in order to put an end to this war and to avoid hunger in Northern Gaza we also send a message to all the governments to people and international institutions across the world who are refusing the ongoing besiege on Gaza to take moves and to to act swiftly in order to put an end to the actions and Crimes of the Israeli occupation forces in know and to allow all the food and AIDS assistance to access the strip of Gaza by land and sea we also send a message to our brothers on the official level and to all the people from all the countries where the assistant assistance trucks are being sent to the occupier we send a message so that all those eight trucks should be suspended until the besiege on Gaza is ended and all the merchants that are dealing with and businesses that are dealing with Israel we tell them that this trade and this business this is Pro those prophets are stained with blood of Palestinians do you accept this do you accept to have unlawful prophets second as the schemes and plans against Jerusalem and Al aaos continue and all the raids and daily crimes in West Bank and in alayash Bank the Israeli occupation forces continue its war against al akam MOS and are continuing to take measures to restrict and prevent Palestinians from accessing the mosque Jan as Ramadan approach those settlers extremist settlers who are taking those measures is a religious war and a war against our religion that is and those measures are against our mosque as those extremists continue to commit those crimes against Al aaos and all the people who would like to access the MOs we confirm that Al AA mosque was purely Muslim and will continue to be so there is there will be no sovereignty and there will be no control from the occupier regardless their schemes and regardless their power our people and our nation will continue to defend the mosque with all the means until it is completely freed from the hands of the occupier we call our people in Palestine in Jerusalem and in the West Bank to refuse those decisions and to reject the decisions and any other similar decisions and also to continue to protect Al AA the Blessed AA against all those crimes and to block all those decisions and screams that are aiming at aiming against aimed against the AL AA anything that could touch the freedom of of worship in Al AA will never be not held accountable regardless the prices and the sacrifices we renew our message to our nation that defending Al aaos is defending the pride and the Dignity of our nation and also is defending the holy sites and the mosque of the prophet and all the holy sites of our and it is also defending all the Arab Nations and if we hesitate in defending Al AA MOS or to pay the prices in order to protect Al AA will only be will have only one meaning which is not being able to defend our pride and our dignity and our holy sites third as we regarding the hostages swap we would like to confirm that the government of Netanyahu that see that think that prolonging the war will not will help them not to be held accountable is still not accepting the fair propositions and the fair demands of Hamas and the different Palestinian factions including to stop the aggression and to let all the displaced people to go back to their homes and to lift The Siege in order to reconstruct everything that was distracted by the occupation forces we have tried to deal with them reasonably and based on our priorities including to put an end to the war against people in Gaza and to put an end to their humanitarian suffering and that all the displaced can go back to their homes and also to lift The Siege and to start reconstructing this trip we have been positive and we adopted a positive stances including to put an end to the war against people in gasan to put an end to their the suffering that that was imposed by the Israeli occupation forces and also the right of displaced people to go back to their homes in Northern Gaza and in all the different areas of Gaza and also to allow the assistant to access Gaza and to strike to start immediately the construction of Gaza Netanyahu should be held responsible and also instructed the delegation with four main points including not to stop the war or not to retrieve from this trip not to allow this place to go back to the north to Northern Gaza and not to have any concrete deal for hostages swap the personal interests of Netanyahu that who is backed with the extremist settlers those goals are against any all the stances that are being put on the table this requires from International Community and all the concerned countries to review the situation in an objective way as the government of Netanyahu continue insists in continuing the war in Gaza against our people not care enough killing more prisoners that are with the resistance as they continue to bomb they will never stop by any initiatives this requires clear and firm stances and practical measures against the occupier that should put an end to this war and to also meet the requirements and the aspirations of our people meaning putting an end to the occupation on our land we confirm once again that this Army failed to achieve their goals including to eliminate the resistance or to bring back or release the hostages will not be able to achieve those goals in any steps or any phase of this war and that the resistance the Palestinian resistance including alasam brigades will continue to face this Army until they eliminate them completely fourth regarding the reporter the report of the High Commissioner High Envoy of the United Nations regarding what is being committed against the women and children in Gaza in the report that was issued regarding human rights the High Commissioner Office issued a report on 11 February that confirmed that women and girls in Palestinian are being violated systematically by the Israeli forces since the start of the attacks on October

rape threatenings threats and also taking photos humiliating photos of women and posting them on internet internet including kidnapping of children and girls such as kidnapping of a baby girl and also separating parents from their children and we still do not know where some children are they are still missing we are calling for an international independent investigation that should start immediately in order to investigate and inquire in those issues and violations and to hold the occupation responsible in accordance with the law of Rome we also sent a message to the whole world regarding some lies that were promoted by Netanyahu and were repeated by blinkin and Biden and different members officials of the US government since October 7 and regarding the crimes of October 7 we have one question where are all those institutions now when it comes to the Palestinians or the lives of Palestinians are not important or they don't care about a report that was issued by a un office
