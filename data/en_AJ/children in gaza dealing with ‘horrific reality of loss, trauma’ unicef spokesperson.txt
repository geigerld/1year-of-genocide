now the war has taken an unbearable toll on gaza's children last month images of a headless baby in Rafa after an Israeli air strike shocked the world Ahmed was just 18 months old and he was killed when Israeli forces targeted a displacement Camp filled with families 45 people were killed Al jazer spoke to ahmed's grieving father and brothers Camille nelc has their story a family united in grief Huda dreamed of being a doctor Aran dreamed of being a pilot at just 18 months old Ahmed hadn't yet had a chance to dream of becoming anything Abu damar's wife and three children were killed in an Israeli air strike on a displacement camp in Rafa saw the bodies of my wife my daughter Huda my son Aran and my baby ammed I was told he was headless I just peaked inside the body bag and saw his body without a head I couldn't stand to see anymore I zift it up again and walked away decapitated in the blast Ahmed was among the 45 people killed in the attack many others at the camp burned alive in their tents they had been staying in an Israeli designated safe area they were killed just 2 days after the international court of justice ordered Israel to stop its incursion into Rafa despite ahmed's violent death This is how his family tries to remember him they've kept his toys and clothes a source of comfort and pain every time I look at my brother's belongings I overwhelmed with grief I hope to be killed so I can join him in heaven I miss my sister and brothers I miss them all I miss my mother my sister Huda and my two brothers Aran and Ahmed I wish they'd never been killed I miss them too much ahmed's head was never found and his family were forced to bury him without it his grave is next to his mother and siblings in the ruins of Gaza camil nelc Al jazer incredibly uh difficult to watch uh Sim o is spokesperson at unicef's Middle East and North Africa office and he joins us now live from Aman I mean these lives caught short in the most tragic of ways um the image of of baby Ahmed a devastating image of the horror that is this war how does a family and especially surviving children the siblings for instance of of ahed you know faced with this unimaginable trauma deal with this well this is this is a big question and I think this is just uh unfortunately one of the many stories in Gaza right now of children forced to deal with a horrific reality of loss of trauma of uh uh total Destruction and and uh yeah the the the whole story is is even darker than what we see because it runs deeper uh as as they grow up um unfortunately this this uh uh uh uh War has a profound impact uh on on their psychological uh uh willness and what we know is before the war started before the latest escalation started before 7th of October um there were around 500,000 children in the Gaza Strip who needed some kind of mental health support now we know that all of the children in Gaza need that support and need uh specialized support in in many many many cases so uh this is really hard to deal with the problem now is the services that are on the ground are almost non-existent we're talking about the only psychological uh uh um Psychiatric Hospital in Gaza has been uh out of service early on in this escalation and that means that the basic needs of of mental health can't be can't be met um also for children as long as they are continuing to uh to witness what they witnessing as long as they continue to experience what they're experiencing it's really hard to deal with uh with the trauma uh the first uh the first eight principles of of trauma is to remove the person from the environment of the trauma that's that's impossible in Gaza there's no safe place in Gaza there's no uh yeah there's no place that feels safe right there no escaping the The Chronic uh sense of insecurity displacement death and destruction and I think what was really difficult to hear in in that report that package uh that we just played is um ahmed's the 18-year-old baby um's brother basically saying you know I'd rather die so that I can I can meet him again I it's really difficult I mean how entrenched is this trauma and how do you see this generation growing up well I don't want to lose hope but what we're seeing is really uh drastic and this is something that um we have rarely if ever seen the amount the frequence uh the frequency uh uh the the extreme levels of this trauma um is unprecedented uh almost and uh that that quote of of the brother I'd rather die is just a testimony of how deep that goes and um we have a a helpline uh um that's running uh in in Gaza for whoever wants to talk about their mental health which receives a lot of calls uh each week and the parents come and and uh one of the quotes that that I have uh uh heard is uh the parents are really struggling because they say we can't even hold the children to tell them they are safe now because both we and them know that we are not safe so when you can't even hold your child and tell them it's going to be all right what what what kind of support can you give really parents are are facing a horrible horrible and horrific reality and uh they're being put in this very difficult position where they themselves can't reassure their children now the El Nar family's experience of loss um as you uh outlined as well is being repeated across Gaza um have we seen an an an uptick or uh a trend towards children um you know just not wanting to live anymore just simply they can't deal with the situation yes and I think we've heard a lot of those stories but also we've heard a lot of of children who can't deal with the reality they don't even they can't even express what they want or what they don't want um um we've heard from colleagues from people on the ground from our missions uh on the ground that children uh with withdrew uh children stopped uh uh expressing themselves or even some of them can't speak uh anymore uh they're uh wiing their beds at night they're uh uh there's a lot of self harming happening uh um there's a lot of not willing uh to eat or drink so there's a lot of of symptoms that we are seeing a lot of um uh if if you if you may uh loss interest in in life which is really what uh what kind of not wanting to live is even if they don't express it and the longer this trauma continues the the longer and the harder treatment and and dealing with these traumas will be that's why it's really imperative now to to have a ceas it's really imperative to have Aid and services at scale going to these children to help and in hopes to elevate a little bit of that trauma and hopefully make room for for uh uh recovery uh in the future this is not how childhood should be um Saleem o the spokesperson at unicef's Middle East and North Africa office
