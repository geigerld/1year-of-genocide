all right we're going to turn to one of our top stories that's the aftermath of multiple air strikes by Israeli forces on the almasi area of Western uh Rafa uh which took place on Saturday more than 90 people killed in that incident many still missing Maha husseini is a strategy director at euromed Human Rights monitor she joins us now live from Dera Bala in Gaza thanks for your time so the attack obviously on almasi sending shot waves across the entire region we've seen Palestinians protesting the attack in the occupied West Bank even people in Iraq showing their outrage there but still as we know the death toll is around 90 many people though still buried under the rubble what more can you tell us about the impact of this huge attack hello good morning um well yes unfortunately this has been a current a recurrent crime in the G St across the or throughout the past nine months it's nothing new actually uh it's it's a painful thing to say now after nine months that this has been recurrent for the past nine months um since the first po displacement order Israel made on the 13th of October 20 uh 23 when the Israeli military ordered residents to leave their homes and head to the southern Gaza Valley the areas in the southern Gaza Valley including Masis have been under continuous and indiscriminate uh bombardment so this has been ongoing for nine months straight uh this massacre yesterday is a complex crime where Israel gathered hundreds of thousands of civilians through legal displacement orders in one area that lacks the minimum life standards and Necessities deprived them from Basics uh like food water fuel electricity for months then bumbed them using at least five highly destructive BMS then preventing any ambulances and medical and civil defense screws from reaching the area by directly opening a fire at them our field team who have been uh in the area at the time of the attack documented Israel's use even of drones following the bombardment to open fire directly at anyone or any vehicle trying to evacuate the wounded um and we all watched actually live uh the scene of the civil defense Crews and members lying in the ground among the very victims they arrived to rescue um only a CP coup of hours following this massacre another Massacre was also committed in the west of Gaza City where residents were asked actually to move during the ground invasion of the Eastern areas of Gaza around a week ago and this is why we say that this is systematic uh because it's being practiced regularly almost every day in Gaza since the beginning of this war this genocide in Gaza and against any Palestinian across the STP right um actually uh we have witnessed that Israel is intensifying these attacks on displacement centers and nearby areas carrying out mass killings of civilians and displac individuals Maha only a few days ago the UN Secretary General described the situation for Palestinians in Gaza as being like in the midst of a game of pinball they're being forced from one place to another they're assuming that one area is safe only to find uh major attacks like this what does that say to you about the kind of War Israel's conducting well uh yes uh what's been happening here is insane on so many levels uh the mass yesterday is only an example of the recurrent violations and recurrent war crimes the Israeli Army ongoing war crimes in Gaz including the repeated uh targeted um uh killings of Palestinians targeting of un flag shelter centers um and killing of those inside and being um committed these these crimes being committed with the apparent intent to eradicate Palestinians while also ring them of all life Necessities with the International Community also remaining silent civilians are being used as a tool of political pressure and blackmail here in the G strip with no justification for these crime we have documented a a v variety of violations uh Israel has been committing uh uh the Israeli Army has been actually perpetrating all types of violations inside Gaza soldiers and the Army officials are given a green light even to do whatever they wish including Milling torture of civilians inside their homes Maha we've got a very brief question to ask you before we we move on and that is where do you now see hopes of a ceasefire uh given what we've witnessed in the past 48 Hours well unfortunately uh the the escalation now resumes or continues as uh uh folks about the ceas fire continue or resume uh what what what we actually see is that Israel is escalating these attacks uh while these TOS are resuming Israel is using uh Palestinians Palestinian civilians and is is using these displaced people as a tool of pressure and um uh intimidation uh during these talks so what we are seeing now is that uh uh there is no hope with Israel still targeting the civilian population still using the civilian population as a Target in okay Maha husseini good to hear your thoughts thanks for joining us
