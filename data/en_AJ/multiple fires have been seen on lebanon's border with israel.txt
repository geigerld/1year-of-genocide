because multiple fires have been seen on lebanon's border with Israel the United Nations interim force in Lebanon says that they are burning near minefields and that they're caused by fighting between the Israeli Army and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah un firefighters are at the scene Israel's military says at least seven soldiers have been killed aljaz Zena hoder is in southern Lebanon monitoring this Suzana are these fires started deliberately as part of the fighting or are they collateral damage of what's going on around this border area well Israeli strikes are being blamed for the wildfires that have been raging along several kilometers of the border with Israel according to the United Nations peacekeeping Force the fires are now under control but we've seen this in the past this is not the first conflict or first war if you like between the Israeli Army and Hezbollah in previous rounds the Israeli military they tar Target bushes trees uh uh cause fires so that Hezbollah has no place to hide so that their Fighters cannot approach the border so that they cannot launch attacks from those areas or launch any possible incursions into Northern Israel so this is definitely a tactic because what both sides have been trying to do is blind each other um about a few days ago Hezbollah said that it has been destroying surveillance cameras along the border on Israeli military position position so that they cannot see so the Israelis cannot see their movements along the border and that's why we've seen Israel use drones drones are in Disguise 24 hours a day and really that has made it quite difficult for Hezbollah to operate it has suffered quite a number of casualties nearly 50 in the past 3 weeks because they are operating in open territory and because drones surveillance drones are in this sky but in the past 24 hours we haven't seen any hezb attack at least no claim of response responsibility which could be an indication that the group is reassessing and seeing why they are taking these casualties and may come up with a new strategy Zena the big question for hisbah is and and that has been the big question uh since pretty much October the 7th is whether they decide to join a fullscale war against Israel now they've been keeping their cards close to their chest when it comes to that question but do we know anything more about hezbollah's intentions well they say that they are ready for any possibility and that they are in the heart of the battle but they also say we will not reveal what our next step will be but it will be depend on the events or the developments on the ground in Gaza a top ranking Hezbollah official has made it clear for us Gaza will not fall now the question is when and for how long can Hamas sustain attacks against the Israeli Army maybe then Hezbollah will decide you know take its strategic considerations uh into considerations its strategy because at the end of the day launching a full-blown military conflict with the Israeli army yes it is a much stronger Force than it was in 2006 according to the Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan nah he boasts of a force of 100,000 Fighters he also says that he has position guided missiles that can hit anywhere in Israel but Israel too is an advanced Army it has air superiority and it can target areas where Hezbollah supporters live putting pressure on the armed group we saw that happen in 2006 and also this is a country where you know people are suffering because of an economic crisis many of these people have nowhere to go and even to rent homes so the situation is a very difficult decision for Hezbollah but it has said Gaza will not fall Z thank you very much for your reporting and for all that context that's aljaz Zod reporting from the uh Lebanese side of the Israel Lebanon border
