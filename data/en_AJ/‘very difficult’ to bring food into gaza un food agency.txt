the United Nations is now saying that about a third of all humanitarian Aid missions to Gaza this month have been denied access to the strip it comes as the Health Care System nears collapse and the number of people going hungry increases every day Palestinians ceue for hours to get basic necessities like food and water world food program says nearly the entire population is facing acute food insecurity Karin fler is the world food program's Regional director for the Middle East North Africa and Eastern Europe she joins us now from Cairo how is your organization getting food and other supplies into Gaza well it's very difficult right now um we are not bringing in enough food and so uh we have to actually Cel or reduce the rations that we provide we provide assistance to about 1 million people every month we provide ready to eat food we provide cooked meals we support about 80 kitchen across the strip uh we give some uh nutrition food but we don't bring in enough and there are you know three reasons for that one is there not enough water crossing points open and we just have the north Aras and a little bit through kamam Shalom the second is once we get through there is a problem of Law and Order in uh inside Gaza that you know makes us have to be very tactical when do we bring food in so that we are not getting looted and then uh thirdly it's just a very complicated operations it you know it took me I was there just very recently it took me 7 hours to go from the balak to the north where we receive uh uh the Commodities at the border crossing point because roads are destroyed uh you know they are full of people and uh you know we wait for green lights and we wait at checkpoints uh because it's just a very insecure operation well you're working in a war zone as you say the roads are destroyed oper ations are very complicated so are you how much are you getting in compared to the the desperation and the need that exists in Gaza right now well last month we brought in a little bit more than half of what we require but you know also inside Gaza it is very very difficult you know with the with the evacuation orders affecting so many people but also affecting the operations we had you know to close down 19 foot distribution point point because of the evacuation orders because in the in the evacuated zones one of our warehouses with food inside is not accessible any longer uh so and so it is you know for hospitals for for for what what other organizations do and so the the basic services are at the brink of collapse and we need a massive change to be able uh to to support the people of Gaza it's now been 10 months uh and they're just only trying to C hope with what's happening what needs to happen to bring about that massive change because much of what you describe the this the situation is as difficult and and and horrifying as it is with you know starvation and famine particularly in Northern Gaza much of this could be tackled very quickly if Crossing points were to be opened well very clearly we do need a ceasefire uh but with the ceasefire we do need as you say more Crossing points to be opened more trucks to be let in uh and our operations on the ground to be able to operate in a in a safe manner for us to be able to operate in a safe Manner and for people to come and receive our food in a in a safe manner it's very dangerous uh I've never been in such a dangerous operation and I have been working for the W program for over 20 years all right Karen fer from the world food program thank you very much for updating us on your operations and what you saw when you were just recently in Gaza thank you very much make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
