diplomatic efforts to reach a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas are intensifying a Hamas delegation is in Cairo to meet mediators from Egypt and Qatar CIA director William Burns is also there the Israelis have yet to send their delegation it's not clear when that will happen sticking points remain as Hamas Demands a permanent end to Israel's war on Gaza that's something prime minister Benjamin netanyahu's government is refusing to do the hopes remain of a possible SE SP this was the scene in Rafa in the south of the strip Let's cross to hany mmud now who joins us from Rafa in southern Gaza Hy how hopeful are people there of a ceasefire well very very cautious anticipation and that did not happen out of the blue there were past experiences where people were caught in a limbo waiting for a potential ceasefire deal but keep it an eye on what's going on on the ground they have to endure this intense bombing campaign but right now it's a a very critical juncture right now because people they're caught in this limo weather they they don't know whether they're going to be packing up and going back to their homes that they evacuated from at the initial weeks of the war in the northern part in Gaza City and more recently in uh the central area on kanun or are they going to be parking up and evacuating somewhere else which by itself cast many doubts on the Israeli Narrative of evacuation zones the past experience that we had with evacuation zones including al- maasi at the western part of the gosp has been largely contradictory vague and misleading as these evacuation Z ended up not being safe at all people in fact ended up being killed inside uh the residential homes that they took as as shelters and inside the tents that they set up in the very particular area that were designated a safe area right now people are looking forward to hearing something positive there is a general consensus here that the bll right now is in netanyahu's court and he has to make a decision about whether he wants the deal or not but the ongoing threat of coming to rafah and expand the operation is likely to cause further Carnage in and already traumatized destroyed southern part of the Gaza Strip um just let's be clear about this that the raah city has been relentlessly attacked since the initial weeks of the war and so far according to people who T we talked to they see it the they see the growing threats of expanding the ground Invasion into city is more of a distraction because Netanyahu is keeping the world busy with this rhetoric about coming and expanding the operation at the same time relentlessly bombing the entire city including the areas that Des is a safe Zone like overnight attacks it destroy two of the homes in the Eastern RAF city as well as in the western part near the tents that they set up more of it in the central area as well okay hany we'll leave it there thanks very much indeed for joining us make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
