the US has announced sanctions on several dozen Israeli settlers involved in attacks against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank it's been a surge in violence since Israel began its war on October the 7th in recent days Israeli settlers raided a restaurant and launched an attack on a Palestinian father of six the US state department is announcing sanctions on several dozen Israeli settlers involved in attacks against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank let's get more from our White House correspondent kimbery hit joins us now live from Washington DC so kimbery according to un experts Human Rights group all settlements are illegal under international law is the US targeting settlers and settler groups in general or specific individuals yeah this uh according to the Secretary of State in his statement that has just come down would be targeting individuals under the authorities of the United States those who are not of US citizenship and wish to travel to the United States if they are affected by these visa restrictions would in fact be prevented from traveling to the United States now uh this according to the secretary of state is after many warnings uh the United States has decided to use its authorities because it is the view of the blinket administration that the Israeli government is simply not doing enough enough to prevent uh the violent acts committed by Israeli settlers in the West Bank against Palestinians and so in order to prevent that violence uh and after repeated warnings uh the Biden Administration decided to take matters into its own hands and do what it could with the tools that it had and so uh the Secretary of State and EST statement says these attacks are unacceptable and as a result is announcing these new Visa restriction policies against dozens of individuals who undermine peace security and stability in the West Bank and we should point out Sammy this also would include in some cases immediate family members as well who wish to travel to the United States we should also point out that there have been limited attacks by Palestinians against some Israelis and those people would also be affected by these visa restrictions as well the secretary of state says he is working with the Palestinian Authority to ensure that there is stability and Security in the West Bank Kimberly how is this impacting us Israel relations given that some of the members of the Israeli cabinet are settlers who given their backing to some of the violent settlers yeah well in terms of relations us and Israeli relations it doesn't appear that the Biden Administration is particularly concerned about that right now it appears that what the Biden Administration is more concerned about or is uh feeling is the pressure that it's under given the fact that there are such high civilian casualties particularly in Gaza we have seen all kinds of demonstrations outside the white house uh there has been International outcry there has been Global demonstrations there has even been pressure within the Biden in admin ation there have been letters that have been sent open letters there have even been resignations and the President Joe Biden's feeling the heat uh We've even seen uh movements such as the abandoned Biden movement in some swing States organized by prominent Muslim leaders in other words for a president who is trying to win reelection in about a year's time or less than a year now uh he's thinking about that he's got domestic concerns he's not worried about uh you know settlers in the cabinet or or what the knesset thinks right now and how that might play out what he's thinking about is how he's going to win reelection and what that might look like so this is part and parcel of what this policy is is responding to that pressure and taking action and so that is what the uh US president has done but it shouldn't come as a big surprise given the fact that he wrote an oped in just recent weeks in response to the spike and attacks on uh Palestinians telegraphing this is exactly what he was going to do all right let's thank Kimber halip but let's uh continue
