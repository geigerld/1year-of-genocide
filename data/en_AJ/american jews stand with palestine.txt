American Jews have rallied across the US in support of Palestine organizers of the if not now movement plan to protest outside the White House on Monday the demanding that US President Joe Biden uses his leverage to implement a ceasefire and every possible tool to quote Force Israel to Halt its genocide of Palestinians in Gaza the movement was founded in 2014 to protest to us defense Aid to Israel well for more on this let's bring in Mariah Kaplan who's the managing director of if not now movement she's joining us from New York thank you very much indeed for being with us uh first of all let me just ask you what is the motivation behind your organization the motivation behind our organization as you said we were founded in 2014 in a moment that had you know distressingly similar uh you know similarities to this moment and what we were seeing then and a lot of what we're seeing now is um the the Relentless um you know know beating the drums of War saying that you know Israel has a right to defend itself and and nothing else and um and that being used to um murder thousands of Palestinians um and we felt it was really important that there was a Jewish voice saying not in our name we don't believe that this kind of aggression makes Jews safer it doesn't make Israelis safer and it's important for American Jews to be able to say you know we do not want this type of violence to be happening in our name um and we want to urge our government to use every tool at its disposal to save lives in this situation so you're planning a protest outside the White House it's been what N9 years since you started started the the organization why do you think that the White House the or the at least the administration that is in the White House at the moment is going to listen to you any more than perhaps previous ones have Joe Biden has a long career of resolving armed conflict he also has a long career on this issue in particular I think he wants to lead on this issue he touts his close relationship with Netanyahu um you know but some from South Africa to Ireland President Biden has been able to resolve armed conflict I think um this could be an important part of his legacy rather than a legacy of um you know arming a genocide um and we believe that you know it's important for them to see that there are thousands and thousands of people of American Jews who are saying we will not let our grief or our the death of our loved ones be used to um to justify more war just before we talk to you you may have heard that we were doing a story about the six-year-old boy in Chicago who's been stabbed and his mother has been badly injured by Within what is being described as a hate crime How concerned are you about the rise or aise rise in in hate crime between uh Jews and Muslims between attacks on possible attacks on synagogues possible attacks on mosques in the United States as a result of this as I think we're seeing you know as these extremist positions are echoed obviously it leads to more violence it doesn't lead to less violence it's obviously incredibly dangerous you know for Palestinian Americans I think it's dangerous for American Jews and for Israelis I think the only way to end this is to implement a ceasefire get a just solution a lasting piece to this conflict not more cycles of War um you know we're hearing uh Israelis on the ground who have survived these massacres who have lost dozens of loved ones are saying these soldiers are a Band-Aid military campaigns are a Band-Aid this is just more of the same this isn't going to bring safety for anyone and what we need is for our government to use its leverage not to send weapons to uh to the Israeli government which has openly voiced its genocidal intentions but to really bring an end to this that is the only thing that is going to make all of us more safe we cannot bomb our way to a lasting peace as I mentioned before you were formed in 2014 and in that time have you seen any change in the level of Interest the level of of uh engagement if you like by um people who were wanting to join organizations like yours I mean what we're seeing in this moment is an outpouring of energy and support and people looking for some place to direct their energy unlike what we've what we've ever seen even in 2014 I think um there are a lot of people who are looking for guidance in this moment who are looking for somewhere that they can grieve for both Israelis and Palestinians um and I think you know hopefully our leaders will listen to us and see that energy and see that shift obviously in recent years there's been um growing acceptance of the term apartheid of understanding the systemic roots of the issue I think that is a good thing you know we can't find a solution if we don't get the problem I think there's more awareness coming around that and I think in this moment in particular is an opportunity to really harness the energy um of people who are saying we do not want more violence to be happening in our name we don't not want more violence to be happening with our tax dollars we do not believe that this is the right this is the role that we should be playing that you know that our community should be endorsing that our leaders should be pushing for um and that again we just need our government to act to save lives right now because they can if they choose to they can save lives thank you very much indeed for being with us on aler Mariah Kaplan we appreciate it thank you thank you
