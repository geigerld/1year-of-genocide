to interrupt you there we've got pictures that are coming from uh from alaz at the moment showing our correspondent wild D who's on that gurnie in a hospital that I can't yet identify uh as you were telling us earlier on he has appears to have been injured they appear to be treating at the moment we should remember wild duu had several members of his family killed and injured in an Israeli strike uh some weeks ago he then went back to work and was reporting the following day after he had uh uh been through the funeral service for those members of his family these pictures we believe that are coming from a hospital in conun I want to bring in our uh senior political analyst um Marwan bashara this is just an indication of the kind of risks that um obviously all people in Gaza are facing but of course journalists as well who are trying to report on the situation there you know um I'm honestly uh you know I got tired of uh of um of having to watch this where our colleagues have to go through this uh you know it seems like it's a it's a Non-Stop thing against not just uh innocent civilians but innocent journalists trying to do their job uh we've been covering our our colleagues and their families being subjected to uh the kind of uh inhumane violence uh by the Israelis throughout Palestine and even in Lebanon and it's just an ongoing nightmare that doesn't seem to stop but once again you know this is the thing about uh our people at Al jazer they are our family and their families also are going through this and here they are in front of our eyes in plain sight uh for the international public opinion just to watch uh what is happening in Gaza of course our uh our journalists tend to be part and parcel of the fabric of the societies they cover and and in the case of Gaza of course we are are unique in being present there with all our young uh professionals uh doing their jobs in and out and as you said Rob despite all difficulties despite the death of uh his family uh so many members of his close family died uh or killed uh by the Israeli violence and he rebounded within minutes to do his job and here he is again now he is the victim W our our you know our bureau chief that's been going there for years and years and years steadfast you know with his people covering the story of his uh the suffering of his people just basically um reporting on what is happening in Gaza to the rest of the world but Israel um you know not only attacks innocent civilians it attacks those who try to get their voice heard their cries heard in the rest of the world I want to go back to Han Mahmud who of course is one of our Al jazer teams who are on the grand has been reporting for for several weeks now since the conflict began honey just first of all talk to us about uh while himself talk to us about um the the kind of person that w d is because I know that he has been reporting uh from uh Gaza for so many years he's regarded as an institution there he's not somebody that I have personally met but I know that you and the members of your team may have done so talk to us about yes yes Tom we've we've known well for uh for quite a while a very professional uh a journalist doing his job to uh the best of his ability cons focusing on facts and only facts without painting any any flowery image of what's going on and this is a in his in his opinion as once we discuss it this is what Palestinians need just to stick to the facts and what's going on the ground it's the this the strongest message possible uh to the world to explain the Palestinian app well it on on the third week of this genocidal War just lost his his wife three of his children and several other of his family members and despite the the shocking news of his family L well on the next day after the uh the funeral procession they decided to get back uh in the field and continue reporting and documenting all the the the the atrocities and the the Relentless attacks on on on on defenseless Palestinians across uh the Gaza Strip and particularly today uh the incident at the school earlier this morning this evacuation School in haa Street that's a in in in in eastern in central khun it's an evacuation uh Center and the area this is not the first time being targeted was targeted repeatedly within the past few days it came under heavy gunfire tank shells arer shelling the vicinity of the school was was destroyed by air strikes uh as well the vast majority of the infrastructure the roads leading to the school were were severely uh damaged so the school was full of evacu but due the int intensity of the uh of the bombing uh several uh people decided to leave and move to the western side only remaining the school those who had no other place uh to go to and basically who believe that there is no safe place to go in in the Gaza Strip so we're talking about at least 20 families remain in that school and as early hours of this morning and this is the daily routine of so many this place if not all of them this place and evacuates in the G STP the daily routine of queuing in line for water and bread mainly women and and little kids do this along with their either older siblings or their fathers they were in the yard of the hospital when it came under heavy artillery shelling and tank shells uh uh this morning 12 people were killed mainly children and women and that's once again that we're seeing an entire generations of children being being targeted and killed and when we talk about the the level of precision and technology used in this weapon but we look at the victims a lot of people Express frustration that it's done on purpose a parent who lost two of his kids in this school talked that frustrated about the fact that Israel could have avoided the Israeli military could have avoided killing the children but in fact they did it and they killed uh they killed them so those 12 were rushed to the hospital mainly women and children 25 other with several critical injuries and this is the aftermath of what's going on it adds more pressure on the hospitals it already suffer from lack of of medical supplies and Necessities to keep it surviving but the the tsunami of injuries has put so much pressure on health facility and making it over overwhelmed so far what we know about the conditions of while he was shot in in his the upper right arm as not shot sorry but as a drone fired the missiles as sharpen now just hit him in the upper side of his right arm and his cameraman uh was was also hit with a sharp n but his injuries is more critical and it took time for the ambulance to get to the area it came under heavy Fire by the Israeli military it took time to get him to the hospital the last thing we heard that he's being he is undergoing a surgery right now in the hospital just to remove any of the uh the the sharpen no that are still in inside his his body honey for now thank you very much indeed
