I I I am just shocked that we're still having this conversation they executed tens of people Point Blank including many of our colleagues who've been detained now we haven't heard back from them previous students of mine detained young doctors detained we don't know if they're dead or alive they have been gone for over a hundred days so to say that this is a strategic targeting of Hamas is an insult to our intellect and our Humanity this is a destruction of people who heal this is a direct targeting of healthcare workers they're saying that when they leave the hospital civilians give them civilian clothing because wearing scrubs is sticking a Target sticker on their back and what I worry is coming to the remaining hospitals of Gaza of the Gaza Strip because it has been the pattern and we will not ignore it is a direct and systematic targeting of Health Care that is unjustifiable
