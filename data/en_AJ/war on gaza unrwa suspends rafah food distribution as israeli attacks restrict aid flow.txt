thanks for joining us we start in Gaza where Israeli strikes are once again targeting civilians in every corner of the strip it's been more than S months of unrelenting bombardment and just a short while ago the main UN Agency for Palestinian refugees unra said it was suspending food distribution because of security concerns unra says it has also run out of supplies to replenish its warehouses because food hasn't entered the strip more than half of the population of Gaza depends on food aid from un well let's get the very latest with hind alri who's in De Bala in central Gaza and hind unra as we mentioned there citing security concerns and a lack of supplies for this decision to cease a to Rafa but what does that mean for the population there well it means that the situation is going to be more catastrophic we're talking about more than half the population of the Gaza Strip that completely rely on uh food distributions from onwa onwa released that they will suspend their uh food distribution uh due to the lack of supplies and security but let's let me explain this we're talking about more than 1 million Palestinians who were seeking refuge in uh Rafa now they have been displaced for more than a couple of times they are they moved to kanun and to um the middle area and they do not have any type of food assistance the prices in the Gaza Strip are very high where people have not been working for more than S months right now they they spent all their savings and the only way they're relying on food and getting food and feeding their children is Ona and other a organizations but this was expected especially that for more than 2 weeks now nothing is being entering from uh K Abu Salim and the Rafa Crossing where all of the Commodities the food commodities and the fuel are not entering and this is leading for a very dire situation in the Gaza Strip all right hindel kudri speaking to us from dear albala thank you Scott Anderson is director of unra Affairs in Gaza and he joins us from Rafa itself uh a very warm welcome to you so first of all please can you explain to us what underscores this decision not to operate in Rafa given how dependent so many people are on your help thank you for having me on this evening and secondly our health centers in Rafa Camp were both imped by the operation and the evacuation orders um so we have two Health Centers sh Rafa Rafa Camp Health Center both those unfortunately were in the evacuation Zone um which is a significant security risk staff but also anyone that would be seeking Care at those facilities and as a result we've had to suspend operations this is the combats exacerbated by that we're having significant supply issues in terms of getting enough food medicine and other things in to sustain the operation what conditions would need to be met for you to continue operating again I mean I think that we need a cation of combat ideally I mean we need to have a safe environment so our staff can operate same people the innocent civilians that we treat uh can seek treatment um safely so what we need is an end to the current operation we need the supply open you know ideally we would have 350 trucks a day at a minimum just the popul Gaza if they all had the right cargo at the right time we're near that now we're less than 200 trucks a day coming in for uh bringing in the aid that everyone so desperately needs there are a few glitches on the line but we can mostly hear you so we will persist Mr Anderson let me ask you this because the unra chief Philip lazarini recently spoke about physical violence faced by unra workers operating across the Palestinian territories can you give us a sense of what that looks like I mean it's it's exactly that it's just many forms there's violence from people that are seeking food there there's violence that results from the the current conflict between Israel and Hamas and it's very much just people being trapped in a very small space with nowhere to go to seek safety um and it's unfortunate um you know many of our staff have died during this conflict and and they're acting quite heroic every day to continue to deliver services to the people that are here I wanted to get your response to the effectiveness of this pier or pontoon that the Americans have built uh just uh not far from from Gaza City the aim is to bring in obviously Aid much needed Aid to the Gaza Strip uh from sea although it seems to fall significantly short of what's really needed in total across the strip how effective do you think that is as a source of Aid I first I would say we welcome any openings that bring more a into Gaza and the UN has called for for a long time and you know as long as this is additive and not meant to be a replacement for other Crossings it's very much welcome uh few days so to really gauge its efficiency and Effectiveness is going to take a little bit more time uh but what I would agree with you that you said is we in Gaza and be that through the port be or the pier or through the Crossing in the North or primarily through Kum Shalom uh we welcome anything coming in through any of those Crossings but it needs to be at a scale that's sufficient to sustain the needs of the people in Gaza all right Scott Anderson senior deputy director of unra Affairs speaking to us from Rafa many thanks for joining us on aler thank you
