well hospitals in Gaza are being overwhelmed by patients and are desperately low on supplies in the largest one doctors are warning that its generators could fail at any time Russell sder has more these babies are struggling to survive dozens of them are being treated in this Intensive Care Unit in gaza's alifa hospital but it's close to collapse if the electricity is out in these departments where are 55 babies we will lose all those who need electricity within 5 minutes Israel is imposing a Complete Siege on Gaza and cutting off life-saving supplies and services electricity is one of them alifa hospital is now running on generators but doctors warn they could fail any moment shortages of medicines and the threat of the power cuts are putting the medical team Under Pressure we have ventilators but now seven ventilators are not working because we don't have the right cables to operate them we are only operating with 10 ventilators which is a strong sign that the failure of this department is looming some members of bulb's Team have been forced to work in other hospitals in southern areas of Gaza because of Israeli strikes and blocked roads alifa hospital is being overwhelmed by a high number of patients and thousands of people seeking shelter from his Israeli attacks Israel has bombed medical facilities several times in the past 2 weeks and those seeking Refuge here say nowhere in Gaza is safe RAR Al jazer well we can now speak to Steven Ryan he's a spokesman for the international Committee of the Red Cross or icrc he joins us now from occupied East Jerusalem Stephen just starting now with Aid we are hearing that there will be a sustained flow that's been agreed what does that mean in practice well certainly the icrc has been calling for a sustained flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza throughout this conflict what's needed right now is to make sure that that actually happens we have teams on standby as well as relief ready to go in and these are desperately needed items including uh medical supplies that you heard on your report just a moment ago are very much in need in addition uh we have uh our teams in Gaza have visited some of the hospitals that you've mentioned in in your report and they've seen firstand how difficult and challenging the situation is there not only for the medical staff who are doing their absolute best to continue to provide medical care to thousands of people but also for the thousands of people that have found refuge in places such as hospitals of course and from the point of view of the ICC our teams are ready to respond we just need greater access and a continued flow of much needed emergency relief sure by my count we've had 54 trucks enter the Gaza Strip so far that's obviously a tiny tiny proportion of what's needed how quickly can this be scaled up and is that realistic given the infrastructure damage that we've seen well certainly the damage to infrastructure is going to be a major concern because it's not just a question of goods crossing a border crossing into Gaza it's also getting them to where they're needed most the icrc's position is always to focus on providing AR assistance to people who are not part of the fight to civilians and this is our sorry goad sorry I just wanted to jump in there because as you alluded to a lot more can be done to try to deal with the humanitarian situation Aid Crossings for instance could be opened to the Israeli side that's I Believe been done before Israel could also turn the water and the electricity back on do you have any sense if that's a possibility at all are Israel's International backers for instance pushing for that well certainly our view is that any Avenue that's op to the Ico any way that we can provide assistance this is something that we're keen to see but it is to the parties to the conflict to agree on how uh they agree to agree on how assistance is going to access Gaza our goal is always going to be focused on getting to provide this relief assistance to people who need it most in Gaza as we do everywhere in the sure um Stephen Hamas in the last day or has said that it's offered two more captives to be returned on humanitarian grounds which makes it sound like time is of the essence Israel has said that that that offer was just propaganda ICC facilitated the return of of the two Americans do you have any information about the two other captives now being offered well as you can imagine the the issue related to hostages is something that's sensitive for all involved the role of the icrc is to act as a neutral intermediary between the parties sure in addition we called throughout for the release of all hostages as well as access to see them and this is something that I think uh the ICC will continue to do many of these hostals have medical needs that we are uh we are Keen to be able to meet but the the negotiations about the release of these hostages is something between the respective parties our role and it's an important role that only the International Community of the Red Cross can play is to stand a neutral intermedi and that's the the character of what ICC stands for of course Stephen let me ask you about the condition then of those being held captive you've you've asked for access to them can I ask how those requests have been received are you receiving any any indication if you may be given access in future well certainly these discussions are ones that are held with the parties to the conflict uh confidentially we do this in order to try to achieve the best possible results sure both for the people that have been detained or as hostes and for their families certainly our view is that the people that are taken as hostage should have their medical and humanitarian needs met and they should be able to contact their families we have called repeatedly to have access to these people that have been held hostage and we will continue to do so Steven Ryan there a spokesman for the international Committee of the Red Cross or ICC thank you so much for spending this time with us here on alaz stepen and we really wish you all the best you and your teams the best with your work
