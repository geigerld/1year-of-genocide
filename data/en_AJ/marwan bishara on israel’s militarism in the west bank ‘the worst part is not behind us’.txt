about this Maran bashara who's joining us via skite from Paris Marwan good to have you with us on the newsour uh I want to talk to you about these increased Israeli actions in the occupied West Bank what changes have you noticed in the way the Israelis have responded to these demonstrations against the occupation demonstrations which are not new but the Israel tactics in in responding to them seems to have changed oh there's no doubt about that Israel has used uh its rivaling genocide in Gaza the war on Gaza in order to execute similar policies though not at the same scale yet uh in the West Bank and uh clearly we've seen uh a degree of repression of intervention of um of of military deployment in various parts of the West Bank that we haven't seen at least since 2002 so clearly the Israelis are up to no good um in the West Bank now the it happened to be that uh this sort of solidarity movement with the Palestinian people in fact started back with the second intifada around 2001 2002 when International observers um like aishan would appear on the West Bank and uh would witness they are international Witnesses of Israeli crimes against the palestin Ian people and I think it was in the same vein that we had similar um Witnesses in Gaza the idea was uh that the world is not going to Simply turn its back that those young people would show up there and Israel would not be able to uh take advantage of international indifference and continue to repress the Palestinians so that protist movement has continued for the past 20 years except that Israel with its fanatic fascist likee government it's really cracking down not only in the Palestinians but on the international movement that is witnessing observing and supporting tell us more about the ways in which the occupation itself has changed since the war on Gaza began and what is ultimately the israeli's objective in the occupied Westbank well to be to be to be um accurate the overall change happen over time uh notably as uh Israel uh grew more fanatic and more fascist and its government became more radical more extreme and certainly more uh religious like this government and the previous government we've seen the expansion of illegal settlements the theft of land the um incursion into Palestinian cities that are considered part of so-called area a meaning they are supposed to be part and parcel of the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority not Israel but over the past few years and especially uh the past year Israel has uh deployed its troops even to places like ramala you know the the basic the de facto center of the Palestinian Authority so the repression the theft um the killings in the West Bank uh is basically now happening in huge scale probably unprecedented and it seems that it's going to continue and that's the worst part of it meaning the worst part is not behind us that perhaps it's in front of us because the Fanatics in this Nan governments are threatening that after Gaza it will be the West Bank right and and what is also concerning here I guess is that there is no um international power uh outside power that seems to be willing to reign in the Israelis uh when you look at the case of this American Turkish activist for example she is American but the Americans so far have not said they would launch an investigation into a killing how do you reflect on that and how how do we ensure uh that any you know that there is accountability for this killing and other killings that have occurred in the West Bank but also the Gaza Strip of course this is the thing for you right there is no accountability there's accounting right in America in the end of the day people are are dying in their thousands every day right I mean in New York and Chicago and Los Angeles and and Miami people die all the time the value of human life in America is not necessarily that important and people die Americans die all over the world all the time their their lives count when they for example die in Russia or they die in China or die in Venezuela but when they are killed by an American Ally their life does not really count that much the accounting is the accounting of je politics there is no accountability really that's why when you hear the likes of Miller going like uh transparen credibility blah blah blah I don't even understand what he said clearly he didn't mean what he said when he talked about credible transparent and Rapid investigation into the killing of a he did not mean that and the Administration does not mean that and when we talk about hypocrisy or double standard there is no double standard really I mean there is but there isn't when it comes to foreign policy there's one standard Power American power so America support its Ally Israel support its Ally Ukraine it doesn't matter how much violation of Human Rights Israel and Ukraine carry what matters is what sort of human violation Hamas or Iran or Russia or China carry so all of these issues really are defined within the geopolitics of American foreign policy we must continue to demand for accountability for justice for the end of American hypocrisy but we must also recognize all the time that this is and has been part and parcel of American SL Western foreign policy they might be democracies but their foreign policy is not Democratic Maran always good to hear your analysis
