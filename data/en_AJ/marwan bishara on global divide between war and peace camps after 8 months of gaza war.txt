senior political analyst Marwan bashari joins us from uh on Skype from Paris and so Marwan just picking up on christen's comments there about the very passionate remarks made by the Palestinian representative maid bamia and very powerful not just perhaps in his description of uh the suffering of the Palestinians but also in the way he was explaining how it has been allowed to happen and the sort of level of Cruelty and dehumanization to the point where body have been reduced to um numbers in unmarked Graves and where Palestinians are called Human animals in language and rhetoric that is accepted even uh in some cases encouraged by Israel's allies yes uh for many months now in fact for many years we've heard uh from Israelis and Palestinians speaking uh across each other uh they don't even meet at any one point there are two speeches meant for two different audiences as if uh within their own ecosystem and uh it sounds at least from the Israeli side there's always a zero some gain but today there was something different it wasn't just about the passion which was there and the Humane approach which was also there but was also about the counterarguments I think it's refreshing to see uh Palestinians uh putting out each and every every argument as Spilled Out by the Israelis and countering it uh with I think a more rational uh more reasonable uh argument that is quite simple and quite comprehensive for the audience at at least at the UN Security Council to understand but also for people around the world to get but what we also get maram and I think probably this is the most important for me coming out of this sort of session especially at the United Nations security Council as the South African have said and as the Palestinian have said is meant or is concerned with peace and security with International Peace and security where are we today eight months into this war on Gaza well I think we have two will defined camps and that just came out across at the UN Security Council there's a war camp and there's a peace camp the Palestinian representative was talking about peace the Need For Peace the need for ceasefire the need for negotiation diplomacy the Israeli representative was talking about war the need for war the need for the continuation of war the need for more offenses the need to intensify the war the the the reason why there are no other alternatives to war right to basically genocide because they had to inh helate Hamas and so on so forth and this idea the idea of a well defined uh war camp and peace Camp is not just at the security Council now they are the world over you see War mongers versus peace activists you see students versus cynical Elites you see might versus right you see peaceful protests and you see consp conspiracies in dark rooms you see mafosi type shakedowns and you see people uh uh uh crying out for peace you see people signing petitions for peace and you see people signing Rockets to kill Palestinian families you see international human rights organizations and you see arms lobbyists and Israeli lobbyists so the entire world today is responding in one of two ways War camps which is quite a minority and basically lies with Israel's main Ally today the sunak the Schulz and the bidens of the world and and then there's the rest of the world that wants peace that wants a ceasefire that wants an end to this genocidal conflict I'm just wondering about that you you speak about the rest of the world and you know how conscious are the Palestinians when they deliver their remarks at a meeting like this of that particular audience this growing movement that has been dismissed as anti-semitic threatened to have their careers and their reputations destroyed yet it is a movement that remains defiant you know when the Palestinian Ambassador is speaking about the hypocrisy of the politics he's making arguments about the failure to comply with international law is is this who he is really trying to uh to reach out to and to communicate with this is the thing right I think I mean in as much as the Palestinians are making uh today at least a very important discourse with a very important narrative towards peace and Justice I think a lot of the arguments made in the speech are actually inspired by Jewish activists around the world by peace activists around the world by this new movement for social justice for equality anti-racism around the world I think young people and peace activists and liberal progressives around the world are teaching leaders especially cynical leaders lessons every day in politics and diplomacy and international relations so when they when the Palestinian is speaking about how Israel is exploiting prostituting anti-Semitism and the Holocaust he's using those arguments that's really been made so eloquently Now by Jewish activists here in the west notably against the Netanyahu of the world saying stop carrying war in our name stop exploiting anti-Semitism in our name stop carrying genocide in the name of the Holocaust so I think these arguments are now widespread and people no longer buy into the charge of anti-Semitism when as the Palestinian spokesman said if the IC is anti-Semitic and the icj is anti-Semitic and the UN is anti-Semitic and international human rights organization antisemitic and South Africa and so so forth well then everyone is anti-Semitic and when everyone is anti-Semitic no one ismetric all right thank you very much uh P Alice Maran bashari joining us there from Paris thank you Marwan make sure to
