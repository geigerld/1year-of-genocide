Ultra nationalist Israelis are Marching through occupied East Jerusalem as part of their so-called Flag Day celebration St Marks Israel's illegal occupation of the area after the 1967 war crowds have made incursions into the AL AXA Moss compound in recent years thousands of people have joined the March through the city waving flags enchanting racist slogans these are the latest pictures from inside the alaxa MOs compound it shows Israeli forces detaining a Palestinian man well just a reminder Benjamin netanyahu's cabinet has banned Al jazer from reporting in Israel which is why uh we're joined by Sarah Kat in the Jordanian Capital Aman Sarah good to see you not an easy day to be a Palestinian in occupied East Jerusalem uh especially given Israel's warn Gaza I believe we can show you some of the latest pictures coming to us from Damascus gate uh in uh occupied East Jerusalem uh there you can see this is in the last sort of 10 minutes or so uh Sarah remind us why this is such a contentious day uh for so many Palestinians well as you said there you're seeing them outside Damascus gate that is the main gate it's one of several entrances into the old city and it's also been a flash point historically for uh violence from a far right Ultra nationalist youth movements uh as well as uh settlers Israeli settlers um and this time they're going through as one of the pathways through the Muslim uh quarters where a lot of the Palestinian shopkeepers are people go and buy their fruit they buy their clothes from there as Palestinians and we've already seen violence in the last few hours a lot of journalists uh were attacked including local Israeli uh journalists as well as activists that had been attacked by some of those young settlers you can see they're very young some of them as young as nine and 10 and mostly teenagers uh they've also been chanting uh some really uh racist and insightful slogan saying death to the Arabs and that also they refer to Palestinians as that and also if I take you back to 2021 this was the precursor that flag March which ended up in a war where uh Israel had attacked Hamas and that was because Hamas had fired Rockets angry at this flag March it's also a symbolic really especially with what's going on the occupation that Palestinians especially in occupied East Jerusalem as well as the occupied West Bank are living under just to give you a sense of how it is for Palestinians for example today many Palestinians have been arrested and often it's because they are trying to protect their shops they're trying to protect uh their produce and their uh the things they are selling from vandalism by these Israelis but also you see that they are often stopped from entering into the old city especially if they young male Palestinians and given the context of this war Israel for Israeli forces have been massively clamping down especially at a time when you have farite ministers like itamar benav speaking on local radio this morning encouraging Israel to turn up and join this Mark March rather tens of thousands of Israelis usually take part waving the flags it's not clear how many are going to be turning up today but I one would expect a lot of them will especially as this sense of nationalism is happening during this war on Gaza and SAR I just want to remind our viewers uh normally you would be at those uh at the March reporting for Al jazer but because Al jazer has been banned from inside Israel by the Netanyahu government you are reporting in Jordan okay let's take a closer look at the history of Jerusalem back in 1949 at the end of the Arab Israeli War the city was divided into two areas west Jerusalem had been Israeli territory since 1948 and the majority of people who live there were Jews East Jerusalem and its majority Palestinian population came under Jordanian rule but in 1967 Israel captured East Jerusalem along with the rest of the West Bank after the Arab Israeli War of 1967 more than 300,000 Palestinians were displaced East Jerusalem is still occupied by Israel while Palestinians demand it should be their future Capital meanwhile the rest of the occupied West Bank illegal Israeli settlements account for about 40% of the area Israel has built over 340 illegal settlements and outposts since 1967 effectively cutting off Palestinian communities let's speak now to sapir slka amran she's an activist and a human rights lawyer she joins us now from Tel Aviv thank you so much for your time how provocative a move is this do you think to allow this flag march to take place today given what's happening in Gaza yeah thank you for having me I think it's always provocative doing it for years but this year I think there's a direct intention to set fire um so I think bang and the rest of the rightwing experienced ministers H what they're doing right now is to try to do as much as they can by any means H to stop the hostage deal and to stop the ceasefire promoted by Biden and others and the demanding of the Israeli Society to stop the war and and I think they're using this parade and using the route going inside the mesos gate inside um The Old City and confronting and using violence against Palestinians um to to to escalate the situation so they would have an excuse to continue the war um and yeah and we can see that they're doing it by morning and I know that BV announced that is going to H even though it's not part of the route of the parade they're going to insist of going to ACTA and pray there which is to say that by by the way that I see religion and by farabic rabbis the leading sporadic rabbis it is forbidden for Jews right now to go and pray and AA and they're still doing it because they can and they consider theel as the landlords as they say so they came to prove a lesson to the Palestinians right now today uh so the point you're making is I mean Jerusalem has stayed relatively calm I would say in comparison to other parts of the country o over the recent period so the aim is here of the far right to deliberately to raise tensions in this part of the of the area yeah yeah and they're saying it clearly they're saying we want to show them that we were in charge we want to show them that we are the landlords it's because we were quiet and didn't do all all kinds of actions in Jerusalem in other cities to to not escalate the situation this fact became the escalation of the situation so now they're saying we need to be harder to use more force and more violence and to show that we are the landlords as they say and for them to for for that will be any kind of clashes and then you know the attention will go to the clashes in Jerusalem instead of talking about the war the hostage did and instead of talking about how this right-wing extremist government is the worst government that was ever been in Israel and talking about the protest against right now by Israelis you mentioned you mentioned that ceasefire deal uh which is currently on the table presented by the US president a few days ago how do you feel the majority of Israelis actually view this deal do they do the majority of them actually want this war to end or do they support the government's narrative which is it can't end until Hamas is completely destroyed I think people understand now you know when when the war started there was all these slogans in Tel Aviv in all over Israel a big sign saying we will win together now after eight eight months people started saying we're not going to win this war there's not going to be any chance that we're going to win because no one can win in a war actually but in this specific War we already lost in 17 October and what we're doing right now is going again to Gaza to places that will occupied before by the Army when soldiers were killed there and hostages were killed there and then Hamas took over these places again and now they're fighting again and there are more soldiers dying again in the same territory and I think more people are realizing it now and realizing that they can't count on this government to lead them politically and and I think more people including families of the hostages including people that used to support the right wing or still support One Wing saying this war is for the Existence not of the Jewish Nation it's for the continue and sustainability and existence of the right-wing government and talking about a hostage deal bank and the rest of his political party they announced that they are objecting the hostage deal they're objecting of finishing the war and to to ceasefire and they we leave the government and if they will leave the Coalition that mean that will go to an election so this is this is the political situation right now on the table and I think even Biden say it in a way okay um that that that he thinks that it's for the government and just to say for me I I don't want to be a landlord I want to live here in equality with the Palestinians here I don't want to be the landlord I know that there are people that are protesting Israelis against those actions today I hope that more people will join us and and I really hope that we will be in a POS position that we can talk about a different future and not just to talk about this ongoing war and and and the the minister of debt promoting it okay I appreciate your time
