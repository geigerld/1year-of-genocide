it was 2:30 in the morning when the soldiers walked into their backyard ransacking everything in their wake they were after Han karam's daughter bar an 18-year-old nursing student the anguish of a helpless mother watching her blindfolded daughter being led away a few hours later Hanah is riddled with anxiety she has the words of recently released theones ringing in her head we all heard about the beatings the strip searches the insults the threats of rape a child alone surrounded by between 20 to 40 soldiers I do not know what she's going through right now what kind of a harassment everything is possible but Hannah's first task is to find out where her daughter has been taken information the soldiers refuse to give her once a person is taken away the fam is left on its own to figure out where their loved one has been transferred to so usually they rely on NOS like the Palestinian prisoner Society it has been documenting all of the detention and more importantly collecting all the testimonies the files of former prisoners and those of hundreds still in jail are kept here and it's clear that after hamas's attack on October the 7th many rules went out of the window there are threats but no rap cases some soldiers try to touch the girls bodies while they're blindfolded it's a form of sexual harassment according to Israeli law only female soldiers can access female cells that doesn't happen anymore Roa Amro was asleep when the Israeli forces came for her as she was led away she was taunted he was yelling did you see how they raped our women how they beheaded children he told me that he will let these men do their business with me I told him go ahead what was I supposed to say then we were held at hasharon prison for interrogation some girls needed sanitary pads but they refused to give it to them perhaps it's more difficult for men to speak out but Ram Lai thinks it's important he was released on the same day as Raa from nak prison they would lock 12 people at a time in the bathroom just like in Guantanamo prisoners were LED away in their underwear they even swiped the prisoners cards in people's buttocks they would film the sexual harassment the officer in charge would beat us on the genitals in front of male and female soldiers they would enjoy it it was like being in a horror movie six Palestinians died in jail since October the 7th Ramsey is still coming to terms with how he survived those dark days and his thoughts remain with the thousands of Palestinians held in Israel mostly with no charge ABD Hamid Al jazer heon
