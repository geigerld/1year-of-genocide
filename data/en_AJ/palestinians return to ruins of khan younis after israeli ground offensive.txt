the streets of cunes once full of people are now in Ruins hundreds of Palestinians are returning to Southern Gaza carrying the few possessions they have left I'm coming back and I have faith in God I don't know whether we will live or die but it's all for the sake of the Homeland the 8ighth day Israeli ground operation has left behind a trail of Destruction homes reduced to Rubble streets impossible entire neighborhoods shattered civil defense teams say they recovered dozens of bodies most were found in schools being used as temporary shelters the symptoms of decomposition began to appear on the bodies of the dead it is now up to the forensic science to determine the causes of death and if there is torture involved in other things we already found dismembered bodies due to quadcopter direct targeting for those returning the challenges are immense food water and medical supplies are scarce but they're eager to reclaim what's left of their homes what made us return to our home is that we had no refuge or shelter nowhere to go no water or even toilets this is what made Us return home and by the grace of God we hope for what is good as Palestinians sift through the rubble of their former lives they don't know how long they'll be able to stay here before the next wave of Israel attacks or evacuation orders this is just one city in Gaza but the devastation is repeated in other areas across the strip people here say they want to rebuild their homes and live in peace as the war entur its 10th month with no sign of an end to the Israeli bombardment many fear it won't be long before their lives will be at risk yet again make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
