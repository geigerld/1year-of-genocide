Israel's war on Gaza or at least 60 people have been killed in the past 24 hours after a strike in a home in betah here rescue work has spent much of their time searching the rubble for survivors most of the injured are women and children aan Doan is the founder and president of the charity inara joins us now from De albala in central Gaza Mr Dam good to have you with us on Al jaaz thanks for your time I mean what we do know is that your group justes try and help those um across the Gaza Strip so in terms of getting Aid and permission and permission to deliver that Aid as we know is often problematic we've heard from so many sources that it can be what's your experience been of you trying to do your bit in the past 24 hours you know if I had to summarize what it was like to actually be in the humanitarian space in Gaza it's either constantly trying to turn yourself into a mental pretzel to try to figure something out or some sort of a weird dark obscure version of mental Olympics and I'll just give you an example of what happened yesterday where I was accompanying another organization to the north and in case your viewers are not aware Aid either comes in through a Crossing in the South uh kamam Abu salm or it comes in in a Crossing via the north but there is no movement or easy movement rather of Aid between the North and the South and vice versa and this is is problematic because the same items don't come through every single crossing point and in fact eight organizations don't have much of a say in what comes through so in the South you have a very robust commercial Market you have the availability of fruits and vegetables in the north you only have flour and I was uh taking part in in a mission to the north with another organization trying to deliver a truck of fresh vegetables for distribution which would have been sufficient for around 1,200 families happened uh was that even though initial approval came through for the movement then in the morning the Israeli side decided that they wanted the movement to happen not in a closed truck but rather one that was open now that's presumably for security concerns why do organizations now really want to shift towards using closed trucks it's because of the severe increase in looting and criminal activity and you really want the products to actually reach the people that they need we ended up uh deciding to just go up on our own in a vehicle shoving as much as we could inside because you know if you have the opportunity to move even if you're just able to provide for a small fraction of people in my opinion it is well worth the effort we then ended up waiting at the holding point for permission for the green light as it's called to get to the north for about 4 hours before we were ping ponged back and forth between turn back go through turn back go through we did eventually uh get through and what you you really see when you get into Gaza City itself is exactly how destructive and widespread the destruction actually is of every single aspect of life that would make the Gaza Strip inhabitable where I am standing right now in this is pretty much the only area in Gaza that is relatively speaking Still Standing every single other part of this tiny little stretch of land has been rendered almost completely and totally uninhabitable and in the north you not only have a shortage of you know just basic food items and hygiene items you also have people trying to live on top of the rubble on top of the rubble of their homes where their loved ones were killed with no sanitation no food no proper hygiene no water so uh m d you described really everything that you know we've heard of in minute detail and it is as always horrific no matter who witnesses uh the scene for themselves you visited Gaza many times before in your professional life do you recognize the Gaza that you saw over the last 24 hours to the Gaza that you remember no I I don't but even more than that you know I'm able to cross from you know from the southern part of Gaza the middle part of Gaza to the north um but gazans are not permitted to cross and I came back down with all of this footage from the north and I was showing it to friends of mine who are from Gaza City and they were scrolling through my phone saying arwa we we don't recognize anything they were asking me the street names because they couldn't recognize anything and you know we have to realize when we're talking about this level of Destruction it's buildings that are either completely destroyed or partially destroyed or burned or riddled with bullet holes it's you know streets that are now filled with piles of rubble and trash and garbage and it's not just that people don't recognize streets that were familiar the mental impact of all of this this constant bombardment on a person's soul and psyche has led to a situation where most people will tell you right now that they barely even recognize themselves or their own people there are very real fears about the lawlessness that is growing the criminal activity the Looting which is leading to conversations about who is actually going to begin to restore the the moral code that existed among people rule of law this is one of the conversation that happens when everyone is talking about the day after it extends Beyond access to humanitarian assistance it is uh an unfolding and disturbing picture that you paint for us but thanks very much for the update Arn Damon there founder and president of the charity inara joining us from dear oala thank [Music] you
