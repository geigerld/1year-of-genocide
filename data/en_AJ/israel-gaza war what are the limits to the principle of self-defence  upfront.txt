David fredman thank you so much for joining me on up front my pleasure uh David following the horrific Hamas attack of October 7th that left 1,400 Israelis dead many of them civilians Israel has been relentlessly bombing the Gaza Strip the bombing in The Siege is entering its fifth week more than 10,000 people have been killed including more than 4,000 children Fuel and electricity have been cut for weeks now and the enclave's infrastructure is buckling numerous human rights groups have repeatedly said that Israel's actions could amount to war crimes or acts of collective punishment which of course are illegal under international law again hamas's targeting of civilians and The Taking of Civilian hostages is unjustifiable and a clear violation of international law but then aren't Israel's actions too and by providing weapons Aid and political support to Israel uh is the United States complicit well Mark Israel is not committing any war crimes at all and you know under international law Israel has the right to defend itself I think everybody agrees I think everybody agrees that Israel has the right to eradicate Hamas Hamas has embedded itself within a civilian population uh I mean this is a cynical and a horrible organization I'm sure you recognize that and uh if you say that Israel can't defend itself that they can't attack Hamas then what you're really saying is that Israel has no right or ability to exist because if they don't eradicate DAV let me pause you for a second because just to be clear that you're interrupting no no no you're misrepresenting my my my statement I didn't say that Israel doesn't have right to defend itself the question is does is is Israel committing war crimes the right to defend oneself is not unlimited under international law and so the question is uh outside of just saying we have the right to defend ourselves is it a war crime you said the International Community agrees the International Community doesn't in fact agree uh no no no the the no the International Community agrees that Israel has the right to attack Kamas okay period I don't think anybody disagrees with that I don't think there's a single nation in theate that's what I'm saying that's a STW man no no no one is arguing that they don't have the right to respond the question is do they have is the I'm trying to what I'm saying is I that's why I want to avoid the straw man I don't want to take waste your time debating whether or not Israel has a right to defend itself we agree that it has a right to defend itself against Hamas or to respond to this attack that's not what's in dispute the question is are the are the attacks proportionate are the attacks uh sufficiently discriminate I.E not attacking civilians when it's avoidable are they not attacking targets that are deemed untargetable by international law these are the questions just to give you one example and I love your response to this the UN called Israel's bombing of the jabalia refugee camp quote a Brazen violation of international law and a war crime so clearly the International Community isn't in entire agreement with you here yeah look Mark you know I don't really care what the UN says I mean the UN has not been uh fair about about this issue for the last 50 years um here here is the reality under international law Israel has a right to attack Hamas under international law when you attack an enemy when you target an enemy to the extent that there is collateral damage against civilians it's not against Mark you're interrupting me no I'm ask a clarifying question what law what law you said what law I said under inter under the international laws of war what international I'm asking because I'm appealing to your expertise what international rules of War say that you can attack Hamas in the way that they had the Israeli state has which one everyone every single law of War say I need you I need you to name one sir sir that's not an honest answer which one just saying international law does it make it one the international law is not a magic book which international law there there there is there is a body of international law that deals with collateral damage Israel is not targeting a single civilian they're targeting Hamas wherever they identify Hamas they attack Hamas if Hamas is embedded with children Israel will do everything it can to avoid those casualties I've been in a war room I've been in the War Room when Israel has attacked Hamas back in 2019 okay I saw the pains that they take to avoid civilian casualties Israel has no interest they have no upside in attacking children it's the worst thing that could happen to them in this battle because it then results in international handcuffs being placed under battle it's not what Israel is okay so to the extent that they were casualties of War yes there are casualties of war in every single War there were casualties right now going on in Ukraine and Russia I don't hear anybody screaming and yelling about the the civilian casualties a lot more children K Ukraine and Russia okay so so a couple it is true it is true it is true nobody nobody's rioting on college campuses about Ukraine or Russia right now let's let's be honest okay so just for clarifying purposes numerous members of the International Community including the UN have absolutely uh spoken about civil civilian casualties uh in Ukraine I agree with you that they're not marching on college campuses in the same way I I I would concede that point but to say that the International Community said nothing about Russia's war cribes is absolutely unfactual but you said something else that I think is is also interesting you said that there's collateral damage in all war and that a body of international laws which you still haven't named any um say that collateral damage is permissible within War I agree that collateral damage is permissible within War again that's not in dispute what's in dispute is whether whether civilians can be deemed sufficient uh collateral damage or whether civilians can be uh within the realm of of the target if it's avoidable targeting a refugee camp jabal refugee camp is not an example of targeting Hamas and there's just a few casualties targeting a refugee camp where there are children targeting hospitals and mosques and churches are all direct violations of international law despite the fact that you keep saying that it isn't and and we can move on because I don't I again I there are lots of things I want let's not move on no let's not sure let's not let's not move on let's let's no let's not move on let's stay right there tell me tell me which hospital tell me which hospital that Israel has targeted tell me which one you said Israel targets hospitals the only hospital that got targeted so far in this war was targeted by Islamic Jihad okay don't tell me about and and by the way that a question I'm happy to answer Happ to answer question it's been proven it's been proven with certainty it's been proven with certainty that the headquarters of Hamas is under the alifa hospital in Gaza City now you know what happened a couple of days ago are you GNA let me finish I can't allow you I cannot allow you to name to say 15 things that are unfactual and not be challenged on them I'm happy to let you talk but I I'm going to ask clarify question you going to tell me what's factual Mark SP I spent I spent five years of my life studying this living it when was the last time when was the last time you were in Gaza Mark when was the last time you were in Gaza uh 18 months ago when was last time you when was the last time you were in Gaza um uh a few a few years ago okay so you said asifa hospital has been proving Hamas headquarters what independent uh reference what source what investigation has proven that who has proven that it's an alifa hospital since it's been a proven fact who proved it so now we're going to get into this basic like Hollis C denying idea that that evidence that Israel has shown is not valid I mean is that what you're doing do you deny that people raped everybody that challenges you is not doing Holocaust denial you said that it's a Hamas headquarter I simply asked you I simply asked you for evidence of it I said who and you immediately equated it to Holocaust denial Israel has presented evidence ask ask the CIA ask ask ask anybody who studies C sir you don't TR you don't trust the government you don't trust the American government you don't trust the Israel government who should we trust Hamas you want to trust Hamas go ahead trust Kamas the people the people that destroy that destroy D here's the point here's David here's the point under article 8 of the Rome statute and under article 33 of the 1949 Geneva Convention international law forbids the targeting of civilians do you disagree with that I don't disagree with that at all okay would you agree that targeting a refugee camp that has children in it and adults who are non Hamas members who are not actors in the military would would would would itute targeting a civilian I completely disagree with that completely disagree if if Israel is if Israel is targeting Hamas in a refugee camp and it's and it's pinpointing its attacks on Hamas and there is collateral damage there's collateral damage that's War that's called war w r that's what it is so so here's the challenge David Israel argues that Hamas is everywhere in Gaza that they're under every hospital that they're in every University that they're in every refugee came you agree with that right we can agree to that no Israel does not think they're everywhere Israel thinks that they are where they are and and there are those are in many but not all civilian locations so the challenge is by that logic virtually every civilian location is vulnerable and viewed as a legitimate Target and so what happens is thousands of innocent people die again when you bomb a refugee camp there's no reason to believe that it's the only way to get at a Hamas Target when a hospital is bombed there's no reason to believe that's the only way to do this and if you know that the quote unquote collateral damage you call it is thousands of civilians then yes it seems like an improper thing but again it's not just me saying this the UN the International Red Cross all of these bodies including outside of the UN who you said you don't respect they also agree that these are war crimes so why does the entire International Community believe that these are war crimes and not you so because I I think I have an unbiased View and I think there's a lot of anti-Semitism in the world okay there's a lot of anti-israel behavior in the world but let me ask you a question mark Israel gets attacked the worst attack since the Holocaust by a bunch of Barbarians okay we all agree they're barbarians they go run back across the border they take 240 hostages and they start embedding themselves with civilians that's it they won Hamas wins that's it according to your theory they win because every one of these civilian you know locations is off limits Kamas wins it's a great you know that's a great template for the rest of the world that's going to result in the destruction of America and Europe and all the gulf Nations because it's it's a great way for terrorists to defeat the peace loving people of the world okay great Theory you nailed it except you realize that everything you just said every every point you just disproved I never said that's again a straw man what I'm saying is that what I'm what I'm what I am saying rather than what you just put in my mouth which wasn't true is that it's not a binary uh it's not a binary choice we don't have to choose between letting Hamas do whatever they want and bombing innocent children we can be strategic we can we can be thoughtful and we can follow international law which says that you can't blow up mosques and you can't blow up uh uh uh cultural sites you can't blow up churches right this is international law there are numerous people numerous organizations and numerous laws and treaties that reinforce this belief and it's for good reason and I'm not saying it because it's in Gaza I say the same thing in Israel you're you're not you're not addressing you're not addressing the circumstances which are present here in abundance that terrorists embed themselves in mosques in hospitals in schools there have been rocket launchers in mosques rocket launchers in schools I mean you know you're you're you're you're focusing on a hypothetical set of of principles of international law that says Don't bomb hospitals don't bomb schools don't bomb mosks I agree we shouldn't bomb mosks we shouldn't bomb schools we shouldn't bomb churches unless unless there are terrorists in there that are trying to kill you in which case the rules change and then Israel on top of that will do everything it can to warn people people you've seen all the warnings you you see today The Times of Israel there was a guy on the phone with Israel for 15 hours trying to negotiate and find ways to move civilians out of Harm's Way Israel does everything it can to move civilians out of Harm's Way I mean they're doing the best they can David Freedman thank you so much for joining me on up front thanks Mark appreciate it very
