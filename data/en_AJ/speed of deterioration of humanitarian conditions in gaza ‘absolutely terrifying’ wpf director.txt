a huge obstacle to getting humanitarian Aid into Gaza are the Border checks Israel insists on making before trucks are allowed to enter supplies arrive in Egypt on cargo ships at Port s or by plane at Alish airport Aid trucks due to enter Gaza are then checked by Israeli authorities at Nana then cross back into Egypt where they head to the Rafa crossing the last time any truck was allowed to pass through Rafa was February the 4th or they go to the is really controlled Karam Abu salm Crossing for inspection and to enter from there now before the War Began around 500 trucks a day crossed into Gaza through kamam Abu salm but almost none are getting through now we can speak to Alex dwall who's the executive director at the world peace foundation and he's also the author of mass starvation the history and future of famine joining us from Somerville massachus thanks for your time with us on Al jazer you recently wrote a piece in which you said there's no inst since the second world war in which an entire population has been reduced to extreme hunger and destitution with such speeds can you elaborate on that and tell us what you're basing it on so I've been studying uh famine and particularly man-made famine the use of starvation as a war crime for 40 years I've looked at cases around the world Yemen Ethiopia um Sudan Syria and the the that are most obviously comparable in recent history are the sieges of of Syrian cities by the Assad regime but nothing is comparable in terms of the speed and the the concentrated effort destroying what is essential to sustain uh the life of people Nothing Compares To to Gaza over the last 75 years and the speed of deterioration of humanitarian conditions is absolutely terrifying would you say that this is a sort of a byproduct of the war or is it a direct result of Israel's declared policy I mean we heard from uh the the the uh one of the ministers back in October who declared that there will be no electricity no food no water uh to enter Gaza and what we see more recently is at certain border crossings Israel settlers uh are are preventing food and humanitarian aid from entering Gaza certainly there there's no doubt that um certain senior members of the Israeli government and certain groups within Israeli Society have the intent of starving Gaza what is absolutely clear also is that the military actions undertaken by the Israeli Defense Forces have that predictable and knowable effect and really at this stage it doesn't really matter what is the the the ultimate intent whether the international court of justice will find that Israel is responsible for the crime of genocide or not what we know now is that they are knowingly pursuing military actions in the full knowledge that this will be the outcome the the famine Review Committee and the highest International humanitarian assessment body made that determination back in December that if conditions if their military tactics did not change unless there was a full spectrum of relief operations Gaza would be in famine the international court of justice um three weeks ago gave instructions to Israel that it had to do certain things it has done nothing of that so it is knowingly creating these conditions and undoubtedly that is unlawful right and you also say that unless Israel changes course which you just kind of alluded to that they haven't since that icj ruling then it could be legally culpable for Mast starvation and you also say if the US and UK fail to use every possible lever to stop the catastrophe they then will be complicit my question is in two parts as an occupying power uh what what are the Israeli government's duties first of all in ensuring civilians have access to food and water and what can the US what should the US and UK do to avoid uh their complicity well Israel is under an absolute obligation regardless of whether it's an occupying power or not of complying with what the icj said and and the particular provision there is that it is inflicting on the group that is Palestinians in Gaza conditions of Life calculated to bring about their physical destruction and it had to desist from doing that and it has three week it has had three weeks to begin to do that and on the contrary it has intensified its activities now next week it has the Israel has to report to the icj on the actions that it has taken and clearly the report um will not be satisfactory and then it will be in breach of additional U obligations that it has under international law and then that brings the United States in particular into a very very um certain legal position because it may find as the United States that it has been complicit in uh crimes possibly the crime of genocide and certainly in enabling Israel to to violate the instructions of the icj and and quite apart from the the the absolute horrors of the of of the destru of the the people of Gaza and everything that sustains life there that this brings us into very perilous Uncharted uh legal and political territory okay we'll leave it there we thank you so much uh Alex Deval for joining us from Massachusetts thank you thank you
