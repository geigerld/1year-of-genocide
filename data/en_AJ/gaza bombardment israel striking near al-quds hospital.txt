so Israeli forces are bombing areas close to Al's Hospital in Gaza City that's after ordering the facility's immediate evacuation just a few hours ago some 12,000 Palestinians are Sheltering in the hospital the World Health Organization and Red Cross are expressing alarm over the evacuation order they say it's impossible to move hundreds of patients on intensive care and life support with babies in incubators inside Al's Hospital there smoke there's debris broken windows there's Widespread Panic as you can imagine as a surrounding buildings are hit by air strikes Medical Teams have refused to leave saying they will not abandon their patience let's go now to T abuo and KH Unis in Gaza and T you're in the south of Gaza just give us an update of the situation well the Israeli Army continues uh to attack uh different areas in the Palestinian inclave territory where heavy mment where could clearly overhead Central the Gaza Strip in talawa neighborhood where three residential Towers were level to the ground uh till this current moment uh citizens there have evacuated to alcott's hospital where there are more than 160 thousand Palestinians are res are residing uh in this Hospital uh escaping from the Israeli ongoing Relentless bombardment in that uh in in that area also uh it's clearly obvious that the Israeli occupation Ground Forces trying to have kind more for more infiltration and more ground Invasion to the territory which was uh confronted by the uh Palestinian fires till now the clashes continue in different SES and axis in the territory also the Israeli ongoing attacks when the Gaza Strip uh caused catastrophic damage to different residential buildings were complete neighborhoods were leveled to the ground a five story building was leveled to the ground in a area Central the Gaza Strip uh till this now more than 1,500 missing reports have been uh reached to the Palestinian Ministry of Heth which uh faces uh such uh dram dramatic changes on the ground where they cannot really uh have any kind of facilitation to reach the areas which receive different amounts of bombardment also the Israeli ongoing attacks claimed the lives of more than 8,000 Palestinians and with more than 20,000 others uh wered this great number has uh has uh doubled uh since yesterday due to the Israeli ongoing rates also people who were displaced from the houses uh really face uh such uh dire humanitarian conditions in the southern areas of the territories in order to know more about that we are hosting right now A Palestinian citizens called Ashraf shanan he is a Palestinian civilian who has been evacuated from his house to the central areas of the territory uh Mr Ashraf thank you so much for joining us today uh could you please tell me about why did you leave uh Gaza store well I left Gaza after they were there were threats by the Israeli military uh to all Palestinians in Gaza to to leave uh the area and head south of the Gaza Wy of the Gaza Valley but before before that Warning by the Israeli Army my house was bombed and completely destroyed and me and my family including my wife kids daughter-in-law and grandchild became internally displaced persons idps this is what Israel done to me and to hundreds of thousands of others in the Gaza STP so right now we're living in kanun we lived in a house with relatives and after five or six days the apartment next door was bombed and the body one of the of the victims flew into my son's lab and uh six people died that day so we had to move them again to another area not far from here from khun's n hospital for myself I I I couldn't stay with them because of you know too too many families living together especially women and children so I decided to come to uh Naser hospital and uh we're we have a small mattress provided by friends where sleeping on the sidewalk well uh from your own perspective do you clearly think that is there any safe place in the territory nowh safe in Gaza and honestly when I hear uh threats against hospitals and especially like a hospital with thousands of people there there's nowhere for them to go the only way for us honestly to go is just to swim into the Mediterranean nowh else okay thank you so much Mr ashra for joining us today uh well this is uh the current situation on the Gaza Strip as civilians have been forced to leave the houses meanwhile that are facing more deterioration in their humanitarian conditions even after following the orders of the Israeli occupation forces to leave the houses from the north and Central areas to the in the Gaza Strip and to move to the southern areas of the territory specifically with the ongoing Israeli attacks that relentlessly is non-stopping indeed T well done thanks very much for that update there let's head north uh to Gaza City near Al's Hospital yumna Al is standing by for us there uh so yumna over the last few hours we've been talking to you you've been hearing uh very close up the bombardment raining down around Al's hospital and last time we were speaking to there were great flares lighting up the night sky what's happening now well we just got a video from one of the people inside the hospital itself and the video shows how the hospital around it is being uh bombarded just 20 M away from the hospital itself they say the uh uh Windows of the hospital the glasses has all exploded inside the hospital uh premises uh onto the people there's a lot of smoke inside the hospital itself a part of the hospital all also uh from the bombardment have been uh there's debris everywhere uh in because of that uh very close bombardment into the hospital and yet the people there of course they're extremely terrified now trying to get away from the smoke a lot of children we could see in that video and a lot of uh people just screaming and running away uh the uh rescue teams inside the hospital themselves the Medics they were trying to uh give some first aid uh quickly to the people who were suffocating from the spoke especially the young children that are in the hospital so this is how the situation is as the bombardments still continue in the area around the hospital uh in in these instan y remind us of the numbers of people that we're talking about because it's quite staggering isn't it Israel said that they must evacuate but we're talking about what 14,000 people taking shelter within the hospital there's there's what hundreds of patients there's doctors there's administrative staff who are all staying and and everybody's still there right that's true we're talking about 14,000 uh residents we're talking about who are Sheltering in the hospital because their homes were bombarded in t neighborhood where the hospital Falls we're talking about a hundred of the Medics and volunteers according to the director of the hospital we're talking about patients over 400 patients in the hospital taking uh uh medical uh care and treatment they're kept they're being hospitalized in Al Hospital we're talking about premature babies in incubators in the hospital and other patients in the ICU unit in this Hospital there is no means according uh uh to the uh the uh evacuation to for these great numbers of people the director the hospital said it over and over to the Israeli military as they spoke to him that there is no means to uh uh to evacuate that great number of people there's no place that that they can shelter in there is no way of transportation to transport that great number of people and there are no ambulances that are uh uh prepared in order to take these people in the ICU unit and the baby in the incubators uh and move them safely to another hospital without endangering their life of course and what about medical supplies I mean it's running out of fuel is bad enough especially for those those babies on incubators and those in uh intensive care on life support systems what about medicines and how doctors can carry out operations and so forth already the Gaza Strip suffers from a great shortage of medical supplies and medical medications and medical resources and also ambulances now after almost 35 ambulances have been targeted in the entire trip which makes it very difficult for the uh uh medical staff here in different hospitals to operate they even said that the the the human Aid or the Medical Aid that has entered the strip Until Now does not uh does not meet 3% of the needed Medical Aid necessary for the uh situation of the war they have also said that they are getting uh uh medications that are not needed in this time of the war while of the medications and medical uh uh uh uh capabilities and resources and uh uh that are essentially needed at these times of the war especially uh medications dealing with Burns severe burns in the um in the bodies of the uh injured civilians are not even being uh included in these humanitarian or in these medical AIDs that are sent to the god of CH so this is another uh crisis that is already uh let's say compounding the already ongoing crisis well fuel remains to be the most important factor here where where uh hospitals have completely run of all the stored fuel that they had stored for times of emergencies they have been running some of them oh my God on solar panels you okay running yes um you can hear the bombardments are really uh loud they're very closed uh around me so yeah so you to just take us through what happened there because we heard what two blasts going off is that that was in the street outside was it close to you yes that's I'm I'm I'm right here in my home and these bombardments are very close around us uh just earlier uh we saw a lot of light bombs that were uh dropped in the sky and uh we can hear a lot of War Js On Top Of Us in the sky like they're already preparing for the bombard of this area just also half an hour ago two major bombardments in the same area uh this is I think the ansar area that is being targeted now it's very very close here uh this is H H one of the Civil complexes in the Gaza in Gaza City and it it holds a lot of civil uh institutions it's a whole area it has been bombarded many times before but they continue to bombard that same area again again this area is Ina neighborhood the same neighborhood that has been bombarded all through the morning which also HS or holds the uh fo Hospital in the same neighborhood a very densely populated area as well indeed y I mean it's it's impossible for us to imagine the fear that people must have in their hundreds of thousands at the moment when we heard you've said it yourself but we had a guest uh T was talking to somebody in caruna saying that nowhere is safe and guard so there is literally nowhere to go and you and your family right now are living right now in that with that bare fact I mean that's just just the way it is not knowing what's going to happen next well that's true and especially in the dark night hours I mean if you look outside the window in Gaza it's extremely dark there is no light at all the only light that we can see is SL is from the flares and the and the fire of the bombardments around us so it's a very very very scary and terrifying situation to be in such uh uh uh in such an an an area with heavy bombardments around you and you know that it's very difficult even for civil defense Crews and ambulances to get to the area where the bombardments are because especially at the night hours or evening hours the bombardments usually intensify large largely across the Gaza Strip and it makes it very difficult for civil defense uh Crews to get to the targeted areas and that's why many of the people who are being targeted or who get to be targeted overnight uh usually uh can't be saved in time even if civil defense to do make it under the heavy bombardment there is always h a problem in getting these people out of the rubble in saving them no enough ambulances uh number of ambulances is very few uh some of the ambulances that are running or operating until now are without Windows they just cover them with plastic sheets because they have been partially targeted or they were uh close to a bombardment and they got hit by a shrapnel of the bombardment so it's very difficult for the ambulances and with the huge number of zilian that and casualties that uh fall in every Israeli air strike as we continue hearing of homes residential homes with people inside them being targeted without prior notice it makes it very difficult to be able to save that huge number of people one very quick question yumna there's so many children in Gaza what as a parent do you say to your children about what's going on when there's blast like those we've just heard going on so close I can assure you that um as I'm I'm speaking in a in a room alone and I shut the door behind me but I know that my kids outside they're with their father they're with other neighbors we all stick together in groups but what the the the the major sense between the children is that they're always terrified they get more terrified when it's at night more than the morning at least in the morning they feel feel like you know there's a sense of security because they can see the daylight but when it's at night like that and all they can see is is is Fire in the Sky it's very terrifying for them uh the houses the apartments the buildings everything shapes and it's you can't really do anything as parent in such a situation except tell them that it's okay it's going to be fine it's it's far away it's fireworks sometimes I tell my little one it's a firework she cries and she tells me no it's not a firework it's a bombardment so even these young children as young as five years old now they know what a bombardment is they know how a a bombardment sounds and and they really get terrified and it's really nothing as parents that we can do we just feel so helpless in such a situation you know well of course we admire your resilience and that of your family thank you so much for talking to us and we'll chat with you later
