KH yunice is once again the target of Relentless Israeli artillery shelling the city and its surrounding areas have been repeatedly struck nearly 24,000 Palestinians have now been killed since Israel's War Began more than 10,000 of them are children let's get the latest from hanim Mahmud whose life from Raa in southern Gaza soan some Fierce gun barels in Kan Unice overnight bring us up to speed with one has been happening yes well so far in Kan Yunis people are not only have been displaced for the past few weeks and since the beginning of the war but now they are getting killed inside their tent Al maasi a western side of hanun City uh just a little bit of context here just alasi is an area at the western part of the Gaza Strip stretches is from the city of Dar balah passing through kanun all the way to RAF City and in the Egypt Gaza border but this particular area that has been designated largely by the Israeli military since the first week of the war when it ordered uh mainly uh uh all the residents from the northern part and the central part of Gaza to evacuate to because it's a safe area what we saw last night is the third time in a row where people are attacked inside in this evacuation Zone but namely Al maasi but this time not a residential home it's a tent that came under a an air strike by a drone a drone fired a missile at this tent and killed a three people inside and injuring the remaining family members where it's an displaced family who evacuated all the way from Gaza City from the sh neighborhood all the way to al- maasi Sheltering in that overnight air strike contined to pound the entire kanun city in in what seems to be a coverage an aerial coverage for the invading forces to push deeper into the central part of Kan large number of people have been killed so far we're getting confirmation of 33 people have been killed overnight the vast majority in kanun central area and Gaza City so the eastern part and Southern parts of KH unus have been a focus the focus of of fighting with 3 killed overnight but we're also hearing honey that more and more people are fleeing the center of the Gaza Strip Dar Al Bala I know that uh internet uh and uh call services have been down but what do you know is happening in that particular area of darala yes while there there is a large invading uh Force inside Khan Yunis operating on under heavy coverage of aerial bombardment the central area of the Gaza Strip has been a a site of Major Relentless air strikes with the smaller number of of of tanks and armored vehicles on the ground it's been the operations in the central part and the major number of attacks happened by uh by air and by the artillery shelling at the eastern part mainly the refugee camps andat and maazi alage where large number of people have been killed so far within the past weeks but an overnight attacks renewed artillery shelling and massive air strike destroying more residential uh homes and this is what we have been hearing within the past few days from s our source on the ground an eyewitness who managed to get to Rafa City what the isra military doing through these Relentless air strikes are destroying residential homes on major roads major uh roads lead leading to the entrance of the refugee camps and and Za and D B City blocking the entire roads and then move moving the bulldozer and and opening new route for the armored vehicles and the tanks to push to push deepers into the central uh part now the intensity of the air strike has LIF the entire healthc care system inside the central area in a bad shape we're talking about one only remaining semi functioning health facility ala hospital and not only we seen International medical staff leaving the area evacuating has becoming increasingly risky and D dangerous but now it's running out of a fuel risking the lives of of hundreds of injuries as well as patients with the chronic and threatening life uh conditions inside the hospital threatening their lives and threatening them of dying as extreme shortage of supplies and just one day after 100 days of ongoing War people are very frustrated they feel forgotten they feel largely unsaved and this is what they had to say about what's going on uh say so far in the area Muhammad Abu a is walking through the remains of what was once his home each step is a search for a closure he seeks a glimmer of his three children killed in Israeli air strikes who are still buried under the rubble I come here every day we still have three children remaining under the rubble Omar abdah and Mas in Hope one can pull out their bodies or take a last look at their remains but thank God this is our fate and we pray to God that we will be able to pull them out and see them the Palestinian civil defense says it has no resources to dig through the rubble and retrieve the bodies Israel's war on Gaza has LIF its marks across the trip Alor refugee camp in central Gaza was home to 46,000 Palestinians who were already displaced before the war now entire neighborhoods are destroyed after a 100 days of War most of Gaza is in ruin according to the United Nations Israel's bombardment has a trigger the largest displacement of Palestinians since anba or catastrophe in 1948 people fleeing their homes have nowhere safe to go there is not a day that we do not move from place to place from darala to can yunas to Rafa there are no goods and there are no basic things needed for Life there is no life we wish to have better life conditions we cannot find clean water or other necessities of life this is utter humiliation wherever you may turn your face children are the most impacted and we adults are helpless we cannot help our children or even meet their basic needs as the war drags on it's taking away their hope for an end to this suffering people in Gaza feel forgotten and unsafe they believe Israel goal is to completely remove Palestinians from their land the war has been going on for a 100 days has left many feeling like it will never end Han Mahmud Al jaaz ra Southern Gaza
