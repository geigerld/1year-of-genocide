well as we mentioned us National Security adviser Jake Sullivan's in Israel he's also going to be meeting Palestinian Authority president mmod abas in the coming hours going to bring in Marwan bushard alzer's senior political analyst so with regard to Sullivan in Israel first of all he made a phrase I'm I'm just looking at some of the statements that he he came out with uh in a press conference he said we we agree that the fight against Hamas will take months in phases now I'm quite interested about the fact that he's put in that line in phases what your assessment of that are we seeing some sort of agreement between Israel and the US that the nature of the conflict will change we actually we've been we've been talking about that for two weeks here on this platform more than two weeks that in the end of the day Israel cannot afford to continue full-fledged war with more than 300,000 reservists in full-fledged gear in Gaza indefinitely the Israeli economy can't take it the public opinion cannot take it the general world public opinion cannot take it certainly the United States wouldn't be able to support it for that long so we all knew that eventually this is going to come to an end sooner or later rather than sooner than later because yes we expected that this will go to some kind of a low intensity Warfare against Gaza meaning in the end of the day once you destroy or once you hit 40,000 I don't know I lost track do you know 50,000 Targets in Gaza bombed I've got it written down somewhere but yeah we'll go with but I mean you know tens of thousands of Targets in this little Enclave when you hit tens of thousands of targets such little Enclave what is there more to hit and in the end of the day you're invading your tanks are moving forward you're going to take more weeks to get to RAF and then what yeah so at the end of the day it's going to have to go to another phase what's pitiful in this is not that we didn't expect it and that the Israelis are not planning it what's pitiful in all of this is how the World Foremost super power of the past 70 years can be so degraded and and so humiliated in front of a small Rogue State called Israel the way America is being humiliated by Israel the way America's leaders are humiliated by the Israel leaders I mean look at this just we just said and and and Alan just talked about America laid a few red lines one of them was no reoccupation of Gaza now it's no reoccupation of Gaza on LA long term long term I mean like it's been occupied already for 56 years how long of a term would it be another 56 years you say they say something about you know no no no to the ongoing indiscriminate bombing right I mean Biden finally came out and and said it almost in a improvised way right indiscriminate bombing which is a war crime and then Sullivan comes to the region and says now we understand he went at length in a press conference to justify why Israel is killing tens of thousands of Palestinians or reaching 100,000 Palestinian casualty or something or killing thousands of Palestinian children he was just on air out of Jerusalem justifying israeli's war crimes so how do you go from being quite you know angry on the fact that you America are boxed in Behind These war crimes that are basically being fought with your arms kind of upset about it in a way right but then you continue to just justify Israeli actions and defend Israeli policies in public because every time we talk about a spat between the United States and Israel this actually involves a lot of Israel spitting and a lot of America's safe fa safe face Saving right it is not exactly a an you know an equal relationship of some sort the patron continues to follow the orders of the client it's kind of a very strange relations in international relations I was just looking as you were talking there just looking up some of the figures that we were talking about the ones we have and there are many 253,000 housing units partially damaged by the ongoing bombing more than 52,000 housing units completely demolished 194 mosques partially damaged the numbers are significant 275 uh schulls um damage there as well destroyed including 73 out out of service so the numbers are significant in terms of the changing nature of any Israeli uh military OCC military operation from this moment on to a degree the level of damage in terms of the infrastructure has already been done hasn't it I mean they they've essentially flattened so much of Gaza that one could imagine or would I be right in thinking that it is fair to assume that it is as you say in Israel's interest now to start changing the nature of the operation simply because what they' they would say they have achieved so far has has already been done there's nothing left to to fight over in that respect so it's easier for them at this point to change the nature of it it's interesting what you're saying but I'm not going to put words in your mouth I'm going to put words in my mouth by saying that in fact the objective of this war has been to destroy Gaza not to destroy Hamas only and this goes to again since we talking about Sullivan Sullivan spent a long time in the press conference explaining why Israel had the right to defend itself which it doesn't because this is occupation but anyway and explaining the whole idea of uh human shield right that Hamas hides behind human shield so can we now just once and for all resolve this issue of the human shield because everyone keeps talking about it right so from day one from October 8th right October 7 actually into October 8 October 9 the three leading men in Israel the president the Prime Minister and the defense minister said the following the president said there are no innocent people in Gaza all of them are targets two the Prime Minister said we are going to fight them like we fought them in biblical times the amalik and that we're not going to spare a man a woman child or their animals and then the defense minister said these are human animals they're going to get no food no fuel no electricity Collective punishment so we've heard the three leading men in his is saying that the population of Gaza the population of Gaza are are the target not just Hamas so the idea that we are killing meaning Israel is killing civilians because Hamas is using them from human shield is a totally discredited humbug because the Israelis have on the record the declared intention to punish the people of Gaza so they are not human shield they are the human target of the Israel occupation and that's why when we talk about 50,000 or 40,000 or 60,000 targets bombed meaning more bombing of Gaza than we've seen the bombing of British cities by the Germans in World War II or more bombing of the German cities by the Allied Forces in World War II only in the spare of two months not two years two months right that was not against Hamas and the end result as Sullivan and Biden and and certainly Lloyd Austin knows the secretary defense of the United States that most of the hamas's forces are not are not are not are not killed yet then Hamas is not defeated yet even though Israel tries to sell the images now of Hamas Fighters surrendering and that they are getting to them and you know it's just a question of time now what we know is despite the tens of thousands of casualties a fraction I don't know 20% I I'm not sure exactly 25% of Hamas Fighters have been killed or or or whatever so in fact this is goes to the not just to the indiscriminate nature of this war according to Biden but the disproportionate nature of the use of power meaning you're trying to get Hamas presumably but you're actually killing so much civilians but then once again regardless of everything solivan is saying right in the end of the day there's a declared intention intention which makes it genocide which makes this war crime genocide by the three leading men in Israel that we are going after the population not just after Hamas we're going after the the the social environment of this movement not just of the movement itself M thank you very much indeed I know we're going to be talking to you when Jake Solomon goes to see Palestinian president but for now thank you very much indeed
