well kata's prime minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Muhammad bin Abdul Raman althani and the eu's foreign policy Chief Joseph barell have just addressed the media here in Doha after meeting to discuss the war on Gaza alzer's hasham albar was at that press conference he joins us now live from there hasham it sounds like they covered a lot of ground in their discussions but it also sounds like a a deal around captives might not be very far away indeed and that was that the significant development today from that press conference with Muhammad ABD Al's foreign minister and prime minister saying that they have managed to overcome most of the sticking points and the a boys down now just to quite some logistical issues just to give some sense of perspective to our viewers in the past the biggest obstacles to a deal that would pave the way for the release of hostages a certain number of hostages in exchange for humanitarian corridors humanitarian PS and Aid to be allowed into Gaza was basically concerns voiced by Hamas for example that when they start releasing the hostages they want to ensure that there is an extended ceasefire with no drones flying over the areas they want to make sure that the groups task with transporting and carrying the hostages manage to make it safely at the same time Israel was insisting there's absolutely no way they're going to allow for anything that is going to be seen as an extended uh pause for uh uh in in Gaza now it seems that according to the Qatar prime minister Minister of Foreign Affairs they've managed to pin down all the details and that's just a matter of time before they announc a deal a deal broker by Qatar and once announced it was going to be the most significant breakthrough since the start of the conflict in October the 7th well we'll see how that all all goes in the coming days certainly hasham there was also clearly plent of discussion between Mr Burell and the Kat prime minister of a postwar Gaza I have to say they're not on the same page when it comes to what's next they do agree the EU is saying that Qatar is crucial for a deal however when you saw that press conference Qatari foreign minister extremely critical of Israel saying that the Israelis continue to relentlessly bombard hospitals schools Target refugee camps civilians the International Community is doing nothing about it he's saying that the EU in particular and the International Community are applying double standard when it comes to this issue in particular Joseph Burell the EU Chief Foreign Affairs policy guy is has been describing what happened in Gaza as a Carnage but he stopped short or short of telling us what's next he said that the last United Nations resolution 2712 is a binding resolution and it has to be implemented we have to remind our viewers that that resolution was calling for the need of a humanitarian POS it did not specify the need for a humanitarian ceasefire and it ask for humanitarian corridors and a to be allowed into a Gaza but the most presser by Burell when I asked him a question about what's next for Gaza he said Hamas is a turn chapter the Palestinian Authority will have to take over the Americans and the Israelis have been trying to convince key players globally on the need to start a new chapter in Gaza the Arab world does not really seem to buy into this approach which is a palestin Authority taking over because they know it's weak it has been beset by corruption has been weakened over the last few years and it's going to be an extremely delicate task for for them to take over Gaza once again to the point where the Europeans and the Americans have been floating the idea of an Arab pece for police force taken over for a transitional period uh this this idea has been completely brushed aside by the Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs who said that the notion of having Arabs step in into togethera they will be widely seen as colluders and traitors now what is going to be next it seems that the Americans themselves along with the Israelis are taking it on a daily basis they would like to see how it moves on on the ground on GA in Gaza before they decide what's next and this explains the massive divide that you see between some key players particularly in the region and the International Community and when I say the International Community the EU and the Americans who seem to be now trying to put together what looks like a new political map a new architecture for Gaza a Gaza the insist has to be without Hamas and the insist they would like to see the palestin authority with its own forces taking over he's certainly been doubling down on that idea Hashim albaha there with the latest for us from that press conference thank you very much hashen well joining me now in the studio is muen Rabani he's the co-editor of jadala and he's also a non-resident fellow at the center for conflict and humanitarian studies thank you for joining me again on Al jazer Moen one of the other things that was discussed well ostensibly discussed and between the cat prime minister and Joseph Burell was a ceasefire he says they did talk about that I'm curious about where that conversation is at given the complete lack of unity in the EU around the notion of a ceasefire I mean you heard hasham there talking about key divisions between different Global players there are certainly huge divisions within the EU itself yes um on the one hand the European Union has not come out with a formal uh position in favor of of a ceasefire but perhaps more importantly um the United States which is the party that would need to impose um a ceasefire on Israel um remains resolutely against one I think where there is Common Ground among um European governments is this idea of a humanitarian pause which I think if we look at the way it's developed is really a kind of diversionary charade when you talk about a humanitarian pause in the context of The Killing Fields of the Gaza Strip it sounds like a camaru coffee break um and and not much more well let me ask you then about some of the the things that Bell said about postwar Gaza and obviously there are there are concerns by many Regional Powers about even having that discussion now while the killing is ongoing but Burell has said and I'm quoting here he said Israel cannot stay in Gaza Hamas cannot stay in Gaza and as you heard hasham reporting he's very very assertive about the fact that the Palestinian Authority in his view is the only legitimate power that can take control of a postwar Gaza how is the Palestinian Authority regarded in Gaza well there are several issues here um uh the first issue is that the Palestinian Authority is disintegrating within the West Bank where it's based so the question becomes under even the best of circumstances how could it um uh project itself and its power into the Gaza Strip second of all is the idea that it would ride into the Gaza Strip on the back of an Israeli tank and this is something that even the leadership of the Palestinian Authority has rejected I think the more fundamental issue here is who decides on who leads the Palestinians is it the Palestinian people or is it Mr Burell is it the Palestinians or is it uh or Mr Biden and um there's another issue here which is that what we've seen over the past several decades every time Israel makes a determined effort to eradicate a Palestinian movement it emerges perhaps weakened on the ground but with its stature greatly increased and this may well be the case uh with Hamas as well and given the fragmentation and disintegration of the Palestinian movement I suspect that most Palestinians would favor a form of national Unity a leadership in which there is power sharing among all the main Palestinian political forces rather than one to the exclusion of others so a Palestinian Authority rather than the Palestinian Authority exactly I'm curious about the idea that obviously the future of Gaza should be defined by gazans now given the state of of the war the lack of access seemingly how they're being excluded from the conversation how how does that change who can bring the voices of gazans into these into these political Arenas and make that that that change for them well there are plenty of gazin who are giving voice um uh to their priorities and their agenda and more broadly I mean the gazin are not a a separate people or sect or ethnic group um they're an integral component of the Palestinian people um and I think think Palestinians as a whole also have a say in in the future um uh of Gaza of of Gaza and here again we get back to the main point is who decides about the Palestinians is it the Palestinians or is it these outside parties which I should also add includes um a lot of wishful thinking because all these day after scenarios that are being proposed by the outside Powers um presuppose a successful iation of Hamas at least from the Gaza Strip and by what we've seen in the past 45 days or so um that seems to be a very ambitious uh objective M Rabani co-editor of J Le and a non-resident fellow at the center for conflict and humanitarian studies always great to get your thoughts thank you for joining me again
