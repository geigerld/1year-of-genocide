started calling for us, telling us to go outside the house. Hamad area is a military zone. We were here to liberate Al-Rai, but we didn’t hear it. Where did they say, where should we go? Where should we get out? So we sat down. My father said, “Wait a little longer before they tell us. Where are you going? We sat and waited.”  Before they said that, a quarter of an hour had passed. We found the house sitting and staring at us. They started in the rooms. We strayed from the place to the other rooms and sat down and told them that we had given up and wanted to go out. We raised our hands like this. They took us out. They took us out. No one responded. I mean, now I found that my whole family was martyred on Saturday, except for my sister, but she stayed.  She called me and told me that I was suffocated, but take me out if you have a place. Take me out. I was looking for a place to get her out of and I was unable to move because all the rubble was on my feet and the whole door was also on my feet. I don’t know how to move.
