is the US complicit in the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and if so how much as Israel continues its attacks on the Strip the situation for its people is described as catastrophic Washington stands accused of turning a blind eye so what can be done to stop this catastrophe this is Inside hello and welcome to the program I'm SEL vaner after more than two months of war and Siege more chaotic scenes at the Rafa Crossing as people fight to get desperately needed humanitarian Aid before the war 850 trucks of Aid entered the strip every day through the Karam Abu Salem Crossing with Israel and the Rafa Crossing with Egypt now that ended when Israel imposed a complete block on October the 7th Israel has temporarily reopened the route through Karam Abu Salem for the first time to allow in more humanitarian Aid and 24 trucks were allowed through that was on Sunday but that's far short of the huge needs of the Palestinians should the United States a staunch Ally of Israel be doing more to help them and how complicit is Washington in this humanitarian catastrophe that's unfolding we'll discuss all this in a moment first though this report from Victoria gate A desperate Scramble for food and water at the Rafa Crossing Aid agencies say at least half the people in Gaza are starving and Rafa in the south is at the epicenter of what the UN describes as an apocalyptic humanitarian crisis we are tittering on the edge of a possible implosion because there is more and more a breakdown of a civil order and as long the humanitarian assistance remain a crumble compared to the immensity of the needs the more this tension will continue the more the environment is becoming impossible Israel's war has taken an unprecedented toll on gaza's entire population the UN says 1.9 million Palestinians that's more than 85% of its people have been uprooted from their homes more than a million have been pushed to Rafa which is now the most densely populated area in the strip food is scarce and there's no sanitation the UN says around 2.2 million people need food Aid to survive there's been no flour for 3 or 4 days there's no water no rice we're suffering there's nothing living conditions are 0% even minus zero I've come every day since Wednesday and returned empty-handed I spent the night outside the gate while the area was being bombed it's very difficult to endure this suffering I'm not able to buy food for my children Israel allowed a limited amount of Aid through the kuram Abu Salem Crossing on Sunday that's the first time since the start of the war on Gaza but as Israel's Army continues to bombard the strip un officials are warning The Limited delivery of desperately needed humanitarian Aid could lead to a breakdown in civil order Victoria gon B for Inside Story [Music] time to bring in our guests from Washington DC is Robert Hunter former US ambassador to Nato from Arlington Virginia is halel gindy senior fellow at the Middle East Institute and director of Palestine and Israeli Palestinian Affairs at The Institute also from Washington DC is Zena ashrawi Hutcherson director of development and expansion at the American Arab anti-discrimination committee you're an activist thank you all for joining us Robert first question question to you since the US is Israel's single biggest backer diplomatically politically militarily economically how much of this humanitarian disaster and we've just seen those those that footage of people fighting to get that food at the RAF of border crossing how much of this humanitarian disaster is the US actually responsible for well I think everybody here sympathized empathized with Israel on October the 7th when Hamas attacked killed about, 1200 people and took 240 hostages uh but that was now two months ago uh since then with the major Israeli Onslaught on Gaza which has killed I guess in excess of 20,000 people now and maybe 50,000 uh wounded and a displacement of 85 90% maybe even more of people in Gaza attention around the world and attention here certainly on the media has shifted to the disaster the catastrophe I think is the word you used uh for the Palestinian people and there really is only one thing that can be done right now is the president of the United States has to tell the prime minister of Israel to stop the bombing to stop the war and do it right now CU every day it goes on it's not only worse for the people there it's becoming worse for the president of the United States and his administration you're not you're not completely answering my question Robert I I take all your points but the question is how much is the you how much can the US be blamed for this since the US is providing diplomatic cover for Israel military assistance and economic help well how much can the United States be blamed uh Israel is actually doing uh uh the the fighting and and the killing of the civilians as well as I guess some people from Hamas but the United States is Israel's only Patriot Patron uh the bombs most of the bombs were supplied by the United States some of them are Hightech weapons some of them what they call dumb bombs uh we are actively engaged in this fight because without United States support Israel wouldn't be able to carry it on and we're we're Israel's only uh only friend in the world everybody in the world knows uh the the war would stop if the United States said to Israel it has to stop so do I infer from that that you blame the us at least in part for this or not quite well I I I think assessing blame is quite useless I'm trying to make the point that if the United States said uh uh stop it it would have to stop if you want to call that blame I I'll let you do it but it's certainly agency and it's certainly engagement and it's certainly responsibility of the United States now uh to to get Israel to stop holl it over to you you titled your recent book blind spot America and the Palestinians from balfor to Trump is the Palestinian suffering a blind spot in US foreign policy circles or in US decision making I I think there's no question that it is um the United States U us officials have historically had multiple blind spots uh most often to Palestinian political aspirations and rights um but now we're seeing a very pronounced blind spot with regard to Palestinian Humanity um it's it's uh I think it's clear that the United States is uh Bears enormous responsibility and frankly is complicit in the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza um the United States has supported uh Israel at every stage of this war um there are many things the United States could have done that it did not do it could have laid out red lines uh very early on with regard to civilians it could have said um it's not acceptable to weaponize starvation and disease uh in in uh directed at an entire civilian population we know that Israel is deliberately causing a uh humanitarian catastrophe and that is part of its strategy um and instead of of laying out clear red lines up front um the United States and frankly all of Western Europe um primarily um most of Western Europe um have also acquiesced in this in this catastrophe no one spoke out uh to say it is not acceptable to use food and water and medicine as a weapon of War um and so uh the United States Bears um enormous uh responsibility and is frankly finding it very difficult having offered no red lines and a and a bright green light the United States has now kind of painted itself into a corner where they can't uh reign in the uh the the the the military machine um the the death and destruction um that is being inflicted on Gaza khed you mentioned starvation um in fact just today just a few hours ago uh Human Rights Watch published a report called starvation as a weapon of War starvation used as a weapon of war in Gaz is the exact title of the report I'll quote from it Human Rights Watch writes the Israeli government government is using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare in the occupied Gaza Strip which is a war crime Israeli forces or deliberately blocking the delivery of water food and fuel apparently raising agricultural areas depriving the civilian population of objects indispensable to their survival um Zena Zena Shi Hutcherson I want to bring you into this conversation so the the question that I was asking Robert at the top of the show is how much the US can be blamed for it I understand Robert's point that you know he he doesn't see value in assigning blame but that so many of our viewers are asking this very same question if you have one party to the conflict that is not directly involved but that is allowing the other to carry out the war and the result of the war is starvation and a humanitarian crisis how much do you blame that supporting party and that's you know that's the central question that we're asking today um I mean I think it's there I mean complicity is simplistic even the US has been directly involved in this genocide uh since it's since the very beginning with generals on the ground with uh sending weapons and bombs and and financial aid of course and diplomatic cover and support continuously we also can't forget that we talk about Gaza uh and the Gaza Strip right now in terms of genocide but before this genocide started Gaza was in a really precarious position uh there was food insecurity they didn't have clean water to drink there was no sanitation you know U um infrastructure present so before this genocide started Gaza was in a precarious position and now it's beyond comprehension to be quite honest and the US has known about this has been complicit and directly involved in this genocide uh from day one and enabled it to continue with its silence as well as uh uh financial and diplomatic support but I also want to emphasize that in order for them to for the us to continue this support for Israel they need to have local support for for the genocide so for decades and it's sort of encapsulated in in in the Gaza Strip right now but for decades the United States has given cover for Israel to do whatever Israel wants to do Financial diplomatic um federally with resolutions and bills which we've seen now since the start of the of the genocide in the Gaza Strip uh a record number of bills have have gone through the the um federally through Congress uh conflicting anti ISM with the criticism of Israel Etc um there's also us organizations backing billions funding illegal settlements I mean we can go on about this there's APAC involvement there's ADL so I mean the involvement of of of the United States in the genocide on Gaza but also in the ethnic cleansing and the SE colonialism that Palestine has been experiencing is direct and long-term a few more data points uh to submit to all of you that are taken from this Human Rights Watch report on starvation used as a weapon of war in Gaza on November 15th the last operational wheat Mill uh in the Gaza Strip was bombed by Israel uh November 28th we had a report that more than a third of agricultural land in Northern in the northern Gaza Strip had been damaged or destroyed this comes from the Palestine food security sector the world food program says that there's serious risk of starvation in Gaza uh on December 6th the only water desalination plant in Northern Gaza was stopped being functional and on on and on and goes and you know the broader picture that this paints is that becomes very difficult at this stage and that's a massive understatement to eat to drink and to do all those things that just on a very very basic level keep people alive Robert I'll I'll come back to you with this idea of values one of the things one of the pillars of America's power in the world is that it claims to uphold values and to be a more ethical power than other countries right than some of its Rivals when the US ties itself to something like this where people just can't eat enough and there's a very simple answer by the way very simple solution to this allowing more humanitarian Aid enough Aid so that people can eat and drink at a bare minimum when the US ties itself to something like this what does it do to its power around the world this is one of the biggest concerns I think the United States has or at least Administration should have in terms of overall American standing in the world at the moment the US reputation for caring deeply about humanitarian issues is being shredded by what Netanyahu and his government and Israel and general are doing uh the United States is complicit uh the war could not continue without the United States uh the United States could demand instantly uh humanitarian supplies and the United States could instantly tell Mr Netanyahu that the war has to stop the president of the United States uh could tell Mr Netanyahu that is what has to happen and I don't think even a Netanyahu could afford to ignore what the United States wants to do but we the Americans are paying a very heavy price for what is being done in this war and uh it's going to be difficult for us to go back anywhere else in the world and talk about how other countries behave uh whether it's in Burma or in China or in Central African Republic uh the United States no longer at the moment has any credibility as humanitarian country following up on what you just said why isn't the US president picking up his phone giving the Israeli Prime Minister a call and saying now this has to change and we are going to have to allow in more Aid water and other basic necessities into the Gaza Strip well it's not just that it's to stop the bombing uh to which which makes it worse you can have all the humanitarian Aid you want but if you continue to slaughter people uh that's not going to help the the dead people uh why is the president doing it one because he has a lifelong attachment uh particularly in his generation to the security and prosperity and future of the state of of Israel but also he has political calculations we are now what 11 months before the next presidential election uh he has to think about a major part of his constituency so in some ways and this is what as an American within our politics troubles me very deeply uh it appears that the president is looking to his political base uh let's call it for what it is it's called the is Israel Lobby and not wanting to offend the lobby by coming out and saying I'm sorry for the good of the United States and yes the long-term good of Israel as well as Palestinians this must stop now and frankly if the president made that clear to Mr Netanyahu he would be taking a huge risk for his country if he did not comply Haled El gindi and Zena I want to hear you on on on this issue of us Politics as well and and re-election chances if um you take a stronger approach to Israel but how you first on this do you subscribe to this notion that you do not get reelected as US president specifically that Biden would not get reelected as US president if at this juncture he were to be harder on Israel I mean that's been the conventional wisdom for uh for many many years uh the the irony is that today the the political landscape is quite different and and it looks um like the reverse may may even be true that this might be you know the the the administration's handling of this issue has been criticized um and and is opposed by large segments of the American population well beyond the Arab and Muslim communities um or progressives um but but particularly his uh base uh young people uh people of color certainly uh the Arab and Muslim communities in in in the United States are quite angry at his um at his uh apparent indifference to Palestinian suffering and and his entire handling of this war so um we've seen polls uh show that he's actually lost considerable support um as a result of this and so this might actually be the first time a an American president loses an election because of their support for Israel as opposed to the opposite um uh but uh you know we I'm I'm not entirely convinced that that the president is acting purely or even primarily uh with regard to domestic politics I think he is a True Believer I think he is passionate about his support for Israel um and he is it is partly generational but it's also uniquely Joe Biden uh other presidents who've also been quite uh unshakable in their support for Israel have at least been able to see the bigger picture from a human standpoint from a strategic standpoint um the uh the the person of Joe Biden seems to be completely blinded of even to the realities of how this is going to harm us interests uh as well as Israeli security going forward I mean there's no there's no um it's impossible to imagine that in Israel inflicting this level of human and material destruction on Gaza is somehow going to bring security or stability to anyone I think anyone uh with some basic Common Sense never mind empathy can can understand that and so we're talking about a a a a serious blindness um a serious kind of emotional attachment that has blinded him even to the damage he's doing to American interests and and that is I think very uh very much a part of the the person of Joe Biden rather than simply a political or geopolitical set of calculations okay that's really interesting I want to come back to part of this but first Zena I had you waiting in the wings there about this this us domestic politics question you tweeted not that long ago election season is about to go in overdrive and Palestinians will pay the price of two failed leadership so you do seem to believe that this is going to be dictated how the US behaves on this issue is going to be dictated at least in part by us domestic political considerations how do you think that shapes what we're going to see so I mean just to go back a little bit while many supported Biden begrudgingly under false pretense and and with the intimidation of the vote for lesser of two evils in 2020 if you will um there's no longer a viable option for many and um there simply is no worse than genocide you know uh so for decades the Palestinian American Arab American Muslim American vote has been taken for granted particularly by the Democratic party and you know the party that boasts inclusion diversity human rights uh the umbrella um using a system of tokenization intimidation and mostly political decorative lip service uh we we've heard the talk many times we are starting to see people accuse and label protest a protest vote as a vote against democracy like a protest vote against uh Biden if people don't vote or um so accusations leveled against those demanding an anti genocide um that two months later uh remain unheeded and I want to make it very clear that the intimidation tactics and blame that have been used for decades this is not recent for decades on disenfranchised voters that if we don't vote for Biden or the Democratic party it's a vote against democracy it's not just an antithesis of democracy but it also strategically absolves the Biden Administration in this case and the Democratic Party from accountability on the direct involvement as we were discussing earlier in genocide and distracts again from the failed leadership of the political Elite um I mean imagine imagine the Palestinian Americans and Arab Americans and Muslim Americans and allies being chastised for refusing to support the killing of your own family members or imagine being shamed for refusing to be complicit in the Eraser of your own people uh imagine being blamed for the failure of democracy simply for participating in it if our votes are challenging A system that has historically been reliant on marginalizing manipulating bullying and targeting minorities as an un as undemocratic then again this isn't a democracy um many in leadership have long perfected deflection and blame as we know and projecting their own political shortcomings on those who are less capable and or less equip less equipped um to defend or protect themselves and this is also by Design so um a potential Biden Harris loss can only be blamed on Biden Harris and their Administration and the Democratic party any other claim is disingenuous to be quite Frank and and sorry to take up too much time but let me be very clear here I'm not saying not to vote or don't vote in fact I hope Palestinian American Arab American Muslim Americans and allies uh in our community register family and friends to vote go out and and educate people on what it means to vote and what your voice means and matters z z here's the here's the thing and sorry to interrupt and jump in but here's the thing about about about when you go to the polling station you know on uh when it's when it's election day in the US presidential election it's a little less than uh it's about 11 months away now just under 11 months away is that voters will likely at this stage it's not a guarantee but likely have the choice between Biden and Trump so anybody who wants to punish Biden on account of the way he handled this war would potentially be voting for Trump you know uh and I'm not sure if your moral compass says I wanted more support for Palestinians and therefore I'm not voting for Biden I'm not sure that same moral compass then leads you to a vote for Trump yes but nobody first of all it's this is what democracy is when you have a two-party system you have to vote for one or the other and in this Cas are you saying they should vote for Trump then are you saying that people who support the Palestinian cause should vote for Trump in November 2024 absolutely not I'm actually not advocating for a votee for Trump or Republicans at all in fact I disagree with almost all of their policies um what I am saying uh is showing up to vote and writing in a name or simply voting for down ballot candidates based on policy is accountability for genocide and for 75 years 75 plus years of total impunity that the US has afforded Israel at the expense of the Palestinian people and the morality of our just cause so accountability is uncomfortable but it pales in the face of genocide and the ethnic cleansing of uh that's happening right now in Palestine the Democratic party win or lose needs to have some serious soul searching after this many already felt that they don't belong in the party but we're we merely tokenized and and being part of the party because they don't have anywhere else to go now it's time to act on it and this is not exclusive to the Arab Palestinian Muslim um communities either if I may so Robert we have about three minutes left a little under three minutes in the show at this point um there's a question we asked at the very top of the show and I recognize it's a little bit more aspirational but we said what can be done to stop this humanitarian catastrophe you've been a practitioner right of diplomacy at at the highest level you were NATO Ambassador what would be your answer to that question well the president of United States needs to tell the prime minister of Israel this has to stop and be willing to back it up uh with immediately stopping a supply of arm he's not so far that's the whole point stop stopping the economic support uh do what President Eisenhower did in 19 56 and just said we love Israel we love the relationship but if you don't stop this now they're going to be very serious consequences for you and he's got to show it and he's got to make it happen instead of sending people out there as he did this last week is going to this week and say well we're really for you but please pretty please don't be so beastly to the Palestinians that is not only stupid it's crass and it's immoral all right that's all the time we have for today but thank you so much to everybody for coming I want to thank our guests
