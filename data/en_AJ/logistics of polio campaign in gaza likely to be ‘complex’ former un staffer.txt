speak to Dr mukash capill who's a former emergencies doctor at the World Health Organization he's also a professor emiritus at the University of Manchester joining us from Geneva doctor good to have you with us on Al jazer what's your um reaction to this news coming out of the who saying Israel has agreed to limited pauses and fighting to enable a polio vaccination campaign do you welcome this news I think this is a a r is a good news from the region and of course it to be welcomed even if it's inspired by Israel's self interest because obviously conditions like polio respect no borders having said that I think let's not underestimate the uh complex Logistics ahead almost certainly three days are not going to be enough but it's good if they have agreed that the Falls may be expended may be extended um if if needed I don't know whether we can build on this and do some other immunization as well and some other humanitarian aid but of course that might be a prayer and a wish too far what sort of impact do you think this is going to have on actually uh stopping the spread of polio because eight agencies are saying that they must reach 90% of the estimated 640,000 children uh in the Gaza Strip who are under the age of 10 oh absolutely so uh this means almost Universal coverage it's not a question of a good enough job uh and at least 90% if not more are going to be needed including all the little ones who are you know hidden away in here and there in overcrowded camps and all sorts of other locations and getting to and many of them will be frightened many of them will not trust what's going on because they've already been uh bombed despite being assured of the safety given evacuation orders and so on so Outreach from the a gencies Plus winning the trust of the people so they bring the children forward and they must be absolutely frightened by everything that's been going on is going to be extremely important that's why I hope very much that people are not fixated on three days but they allow a decent amount of time to get the job done when you say decent amount of time um what do you what do you mean by that exactly how long well when I was dealing with Afghanistan and uh uh even even the Taliban allowed the poopes in the past and they were for much longer periods so sure three days is good and Gaza is a small territory uh and the agencies are ready and they've got plenty of supplies and all that is good good stuff I I just worry that excessive kind of Jubilation at the beginning we don't want to undermine the operation let's see how it goes and I would think at least the week is probably going to required to reach the 90 plus Target that we must uh reach on public health grounds and the Gaza Strip of course has been polio free for the last 25 years so how big a threat is its emergence now and also uh when you said that the PO polio doesn't really respect borders is it a threat to other regions as well absolutely it's a threat to the whole region obviously immunization rates in Israel and Jordan neighboring countries are probably much higher than they are in Gaza however the uh during generalized insecurity as you seen in other countries the virus does spread and when immunization rates go down even down to their 80s then the risk gets that much harder so I think getting this under control inside Gaza is extremely important uh obviously first and foremost for the children inside Gaza and we already know that polio is present because the child has even been semi paralyzed and if there's been one child who's affected then we can be sure there are others who who are just stating the virus so already now I think it is a little bit too late even if you're talking about zero paralysis from polio but this is why I'm a little bit disappointed that we have to wait till the 1st of February I don't see why we cannot start this tonight or tomorrow considering that for the last few days people have been announcing very proudly that so many vaccines have been supplied and everyone is ready and everyone is just waiting so why wait till the 1st of September okay we'll have to leave it there thank you so much Dr mes capill thanks for joining us from Geneva thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from algera
