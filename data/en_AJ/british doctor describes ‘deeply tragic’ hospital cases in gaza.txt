okay we're joined Now by Dr Nick Maynard he's a consultant surgeon who recently volunteered for an emergency medical mission in Gaza with the British charity Medical Aid for Palestinians he joins me live from the United Nations Headquarters thank you so much for your time on Al jazer you've described your trip to Gaza back in January as the single worst experience in your 36 medical career can you tell us what you saw yes thank you for asking me I've been going into Gaza for nearly 15 years and I thought I would be used bit I I'd be prepared for what I was going to see when I went into Gaza on boxing day but what I saw at alaxa hospital was the single worst series of cases I've ever seen in my career as a doctor um appalling clinical situations we found ourselves in uh great lack of resources but most of all the most appalling injuries predominantly on children and women and and I spent most of the two weeks operating on severe explosive injuries to the chest and the abdomen and the majority of the patients I operated on were women and I saw some severely injured children as well yeah can you expand on that what was the hardest part of your experience when you look back I think seeing some of the appallingly injured children in particular I spent some time in the emergency room at alax hospital as well and saw some very small children with terrible Burns multiple traumatic amputations um and no real room to deal with these tragic cases the the resources were very limited on some days we had no morphe no strong pain to give these patients and I remember seeing one small child who had terrible Burns to her face so bad that you could see the bones of her face and she clearly had no chance of surviving um and was going to die but we had no pain relief to give her so Not only was she certainly going to die but she couldn't die peacefully she died in agony uh there was nowhere peaceful for her to go she was ended up lying on the floor of the emergency department and this was one case but we saw multiple cases like that and they were deeply deeply tragic I believe you also started seeing some malnutrition cases back then yeah so this was back in sort of around the new year and we the pediatricians in alaxa hospital we're seeing two or three cases of quaia cor which is the most severe form of protein malnutrition you see and and it it sort of CED up images of the famines we sometimes saw in Africa years ago where where these potbellied children with with severe malnutrition and that they were appearing at alaxa hospital back over the new year and on the surgical Wards we saw patients who were malnourished and there are so many problems with infections in the hospitals there that virtually every patient who ends up having an injury and having surgery gets a bad infection and of course when you've got severe infections it accelerates the process of malnutrition so we ended up seeing some patients severely malnourish and of course we've heard in the last few days about the uh the the the the the the the man-made famine should we call it that's now existing in Gaza and that the malnutrition problems are getting ever worse and you have this terrible cycle of of of sepsis infection malnutrition and they exacerbate each other so this is a a profoundly severe Health Care problem and I think the numbers of patients we're going to see from these excess deaths due to n nutrition will dwarf the figures currently being quoted for deaths from the trauma of about 30,000 I think we we greatly fear those figures are going to be well in excess of 100,000 and as you were saying you have been visiting Gaza for many years to teach surgery since 2010 I believe what did you make of the state of the medical facilities in this latest visit uh I mean they're they're they're grow I mean incredibly challenging I think even working in the healthc care section in Gaza in in in quieter times pre October the 7th were very challenging so we always have to deal with lack of resources um often uh electricity cuts um a and having to make do with with very limited equipment but those challenges have been dwarfed by what we're seeing now um I I spent every day operating out there we often ran out of surgical gloves so you had to sometimes wash gloves between operations I've mentioned already the lack of morphine we had many days when there's no pain relief to give to patients often no antibiotics the surgical instruments we were using were very lacking so we had to make do with with not so much the wrong instruments but very different in in instruments there were sometimes no blood products on one day we had no running water in the operating theaters so we couldn't scrub up properly we had to use alcohol gel to try and clean our hands we sometimes had no sterile dressings we had no sterile drapes for the patient in the operating theater so EX extremely challenging circumstances and of course for the post option of care they went to Wards which were appallingly overcrowded often there were no beds to put the patients in so they were lying on the floor the health care the health information system had completely collapsed so it was extremely difficult finding patients on the ward to see how they were the next day so many patients were were not being followed up properly so the challenges were were worse than I could possibly have imagined and Doctor the Israeli narrative when it comes to targeting hospitals is that they are targeting Hamas operatives who are hiding inside these hospitals given what you've seen do you think the damage and the violence on the people of Gaza in those hospitals is Justified not not at all and of course this is the narrative being pedal by uh the the Israelis I I have I've been going to Gaza for many years as you mentioned I have never seen any Hamas militans in any hospital I've worked in um I know shifa Hospital extremely well I've never seen any Hamas militants there more importantly during my two weeks stay at alaxa hospital I I had access to every single part of the hospital I visited every part of the hospital regularly and I've seen no Hammer militants at all so and and of course the Israeli Defense Force have provided no credible evidence to support those claims perhaps as a final thing to say about this I I have many friends and colleagues who are doctors and nurses in Gaza and I've known them for many many years I've worked with them they've been in these hospitals day in day out since October the 7th I've been talking to them regularly and quite apart from my own experiences in alaxa they all report never having seen any Hamas militants in any of these Hospitals now of course I can't comment about what my might be happening in any tunnels underneath but certainly I have seen no evidence of any Hammer military in the hospitals and as I said I think the evidence being put forward by the Israelis to support those claims is not remotely credible Dr Nick mayard consultant surgeon who recently volunteered in Gaza many thanks for your
