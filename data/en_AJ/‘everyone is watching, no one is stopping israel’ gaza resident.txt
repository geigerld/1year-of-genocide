for children born in Gaza Israeli occupation and Wars have been unsparing and Relentless let's take a look now at what an average 16-year-old has endured in their lifetime at Birth an Israeli Land Air and sea blockade was affected has affected every aspect of his or her life from food to health and education at the age of two the child would have lived through 23 days of devastating air and ground attacks nearly 1,400 Palestinians were killed during Israel's uh Israel's operation castled 320 of them were children in 2012 when the child was 5 years old they would have survived an 8-day assault that killed more than 80 people most of them women and children at age seven the child would have endured a 50-day Israeli Onslaught at least 2310 Palestinians were killed in 2014 551 of them children as a young teen teenager he or she would have witnessed the aftermath of Israeli attacks that lasted 11 days 260 Palestinians were killed then 67 were children and now Another War on Gaza this one far worse than any other at age 16 today an average Palestinian child is living through what's been described as genocide 60 days of war in which more than 16,24 people have been killed more than 7,112 of them children now Israel has flattened gaza's once thriving towns and cities one of the world's most densely populated areas has been reduced to Rubble here's a look at the extent of the devastation more than 60% of all the buildings and homes across the Gaza Strip have been damaged Israel has dropped thousands of tons of bombs on Gaza today the strip is almost uninhabitable about 1.9 million Palestinians that's more than 85% of gaza's population ation have been uprooted from their homes due to Israeli bombardment and forced to to Evac and forced to leave with evacuation orders more than a million Palestinians have been Sheltering in schools and un facilities but they too have come under attack at least 69 schools have been destroyed in the war so far only nine of gaza's 35 hospitals are functioning and only partially with tens of thousands of injuries caused by Israeli attacks and a rapid spread of infe and diseases in overcrowded shelters Gaza is now staring at a health catastrophe well nla shawa is a Gaza resident who recently fled to Egypt she's with us live now from Cairo and what on Earth is it like to be looking in from Egypt at all that is happening in the place that you come from the place that you call home yeah uh it's the difficult to describe it honestly except that U it's extremely hard and it's very painful and uh at times I feel like um maybe it's just better to die simply die there back home but that thought of having kids and having that option that opportunity to to leave was also present in that moment when we decided to leave and it's uh it's just very hard and gets harder every day tell us your story tell us how you left how you came to be where you are uh me and my husband and my daughters we never thought of leaving we never considered uh anything like that we never thought that this would be become any kind of reality we have been living in Gaza all our lives we have been witnessing all kinds of situations and events 2021 the before everything every every single escalation or War the last time this time was a few days after after after it started uh we received people at home uh who were displaced from uh from Gaza City and we hosted them at our house in Gaza we live in Gaza City in the western part of the city and um a few days after we had to evacuate for one night for since about 12: or 1:00 a.m. until 7 in the morning because of bombing across the street bombing of a building a residential building we left in just five minutes the house we all ran in the street we went to a restaurant nearby we stayed till the next day came back there were some damages of the uh windows and doors and the entrance and all the glass was was broken Etc then we stayed for a bit longer for another couple of days actually with other friends and family who were displaced with us then we had that or order that came that we all should evacuate Gaza City we left on October 13 very early to Central Gaza uh to a place that that our family owns in central Gaza we became 60 people into our time we stayed there we had hardly mattresses to sleep on we were living by the day and uh we were able to get water every day or every other day we were rationalizing everything Some Nights the kids would not have uh dinner or or lunch uh some days we would simply keep remaining of uh of of the food of the rice or of uh of the uh beans uh for for later to reduce the quantities that we consume now it's even worse from what I hear from those who we we left unfortunately I slept with my daughter in the car for the entire month and my husband slept outside along with other three four men other four five people were sleeping in their cars as well and the rest were inside because it was not a real house or a big house like everyone was tacked next to each other there were 60 20 of them children and now my friends are telling me and sending me pictures oh they are on the sand they are intents on the sand in the street in the open air with this weather with their children with no way to find the bathroom with with no with no enough food with just one or two items that they can consume or find the situation is is so horrible many of my friends were injured they have small kids and they were injured and a friend tell tells me just yesterday that his sons were injured and they were treated just by people who they know not even properly inside the hospital and they cannot have any kind of medicine to prevent inflammation for the injuries trying to just clean the WB as appalling as Unthinkable as conditions are now Wars do eventually end you must imagine a better time will come do you I don't sadly I don't why not it all feels like it's ending because you see everything uh is happening now the death the brutality the the how ugly it is um and it's not changing the the world is watching and uh there seemed to be some agreement to what's going on I think um it's very clear looking at the entire picture all around us everyone is watching no one is stopping Israel so well now it's a joint project we fervently wish you and your family the best and very much hope and wish that you are able to return to Gaza thank you for speaking to us to thank you well let's now let's now talk to Abdul wahab hammad who is from North Gaza he's been forced to relocate three times since the start of the war first to the center of Gaza then to Khan Yunis and now to Rafa he joins us on the phone uh from there thank you so much for speaking to us uh this has been an extraordinary Journey for you you can't possibly have imagined such a thing would happen to you and happen in the space of two months um thank you for having me on today uh indeed and in the face of this Relentless conflict in Gaza since October the 7th my family and I residing in the Border area of zimmo in the northern part of Gaza we experienced unrelenting cycle displacement and loss indeed I've witnessed the hard wrenching impact on my family and other families as well who were forced to evacuate multiple times navigating the journey from the north to the South under a constant threat arriving in the centr Gaza in the C of Gaza we dispersed into various homes for safety contending with random Shilling eventually we had also to evacuate one more time this time to kanun which was declared as a safe heaven as a safe Zone uh by the IDF a couple of weeks ago uh now the IDF and the military notices declar unit as a compat Zone promoting a proing another evacuation to support safe areas this recent evacuation orders from the IDF have not only uh shattered the illusion of designated safe areas but also intensify the challenges faced by the by the people in Gaza life has has be become a constant struggle for safety with the idea of dictating our movements uh the struggle intensified with with the new challenges with challenges of severe water scarcity and extreme food shortages in now in RA in a very tely heavily populated refugee camp basic necessities like food and water are scar diseases are spreading particularly in schools uh despite these circumstances uh uh we we we uh we uh we hope uh that this will end one day it's a nightmare that we we never never have imagined such and I think the right to safety and basic necessities has been compromised during this major escalation of military hostilities leaving us as gazans in a state of vulnerabilities thank you let me ask you I mean you have moved as we said there successively from your home in the center of Gaza down to kanun now you're in far you've effectively reached the furthest point in the south of the Gaza Strip that you can go where where where might you go next if the attacks follow you all the way down there there are talk of people trying to break through the border into the Sinai I mean what would you do if you found that there was nowhere else to go well as I previously said this recent evacuation orders has become elusive for for Palestinians living in Gaza nowh safe in Gaza with the areas of civilians the heavily Den the areas of civilians are being under attack uh we don't know what's coming next and to be honest the conflict has not only reshaped the physical landscape of Gaza but also has eroded the foundational human values uh that should unite us uh in in times of difficulties and adversity uh this must end and and the international might ble actually to the world and to the International Community is to seize the aggression against the civilians in Gaza the question of how life has transformed during the war me to emphasize the ethical framework and the international commitment to humanit to humanitarian values despite the moral Decay resulting from the ongoing conflict what happens in Gaza here is a genocide uh it's really a genocide it's an ethnic cleansing it's not acceptable uh it's against International humanitarian LW and it's it goes beyond whatever whatsoever we we and whatever we could have imagined yes thank you okay Abdul wahab hammad from the north of Gaza at the moment Sheltering with his family all the way down in the south in rafar our thoughts are with you and our thanks to you for speaking to us
