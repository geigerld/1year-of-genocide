Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to defy domestic and international pressure to sign a ceasefire deal with Hamas in Gaza there have been Mass protests in Israel triggered by the recovery of six captives found dead in Gaza on Saturday Netanyahu has asked for forgiveness but insists the war will continue heidis zo Castro reports thousands of Israelis took to the street for a second day pushing past police lines and converging near the home of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem many blaming his delay in signing a ceasefire deal for the discovery of six more dead captives in Gaza the government of Israel is a threat to the world peace for the first time since Mass protests and a labor strike broke out following Saturday's news of the Dead captives n yahu addressed the country I told the family and I will say it again tonight I apologize and ask for your forgiveness because we couldn't bring them back alive we were close close but we failed let me say this again tonight Israel will not remain silent on this massacre Hamas will pay the price a very high price protesters say Netanyahu is prioritizing military gain over the return of captives pointing to his continued insistence that Israel maintain control of the Philadelphia Corridor as part of the ceasefire deal deal that's a non-starter for Hamas and a reason us-led negotiations have been stalled for weeks US President Joe Biden said he was close to presenting a final proposal but that the Israeli Prime Minister hasn't been doing enough to move the deal forward Mr President do you think it's time for prime minister Netanyahu to do more on this issue do you think he's doing enough no according to the Israeli Health Ministry the six captives found over the weekend were shot at close range one or two days before their bodies were discovered a Hamas military spokesman says netanyahu's delay in signing a ceasefire and prisoner exchange deal made him responsible for the deaths and that the Israeli Prime Minister's insistence on freeing the captives using military pressure would mean more returning home in coffins as 23-year-old Israeli American HH Goldberg Poland was buried in Jerusalem the aunt of another young Israeli taken captive in Gaza said she feared for him the same fate we were crying the all morning because it was like it's so frightening the feeling that in one minute things can change and people can die and we know we hope that he's really alive and we can save him Israel believes 101 captives remain in Gaza including 35 who are thought to be dead Heidi Jo Castro Al jazer okay well now speak to Elan baruk who's the chairperson of policy working group that's an Israeli advocacy team focusing on policy issues based on the two State Paradigm he formerly served as Israel's ambassador to South Africa welcome back to Al jazer sir so um during the Press briefing that Netanyahu gave um just about less than 24 hours ago he argued uh for what he said was the Strategic imperative to keep Israeli troops stationed along the Philadelphia Corridor in Gaza what does this tell you about netanyahu's plans for Gaza well the horrific events on October 7 last year and are a waterers shed uh for us Israelis for the Netanyahu government for the Palestinians and for the region at large and nothing that um took place before um is uh relevant anymore for the future Netanyahu um Beyond his position as prime minister of Israel he is also a strategist of the right-wing and his Coalition extreme right-wing partners that are actually uh bo uh applying pressure on him and putting their partnership in his Coalition at stake and they believe that Israel is entitled and indeed should for its security maintain control over the entire Territory between the River Jordan and the coastline of the Mediterranean now departing from Philadelphia Corridor was argued and disputed already in 2005 when Israel left the territory uh in the context of the disengagement when uh shaon was prime minister and uh it was always a question if uh in Israel in the Israeli discourse if we should have left the Gaza street right or not and if you combine that with what's happening right now in the occupied West Bank I mean our reporter was reporting of all the raids and obviously the arrests and the killings that have been going on we heard from the Israeli foreign minister last week who said that we need to address the what he called the threat in the occupied West Bank the same way as we deal with Gaza including the temporary evacuation of civilians I mean what is the ultimate objective here then the the future of the West Bank and the Israeli presence in it depends on who controls the Jordan Valley if Israel is pushed by the International Community to leave the Jordan Valley the right wing in Israel believes Israel then becomes critically vulnerable to uh attacks from the East through Jordan and uh insisting on Philadelphia is actually preparing the the foreground for a battle of Israel to maintain control indefinitely of the Jordan Valley and I want to remind you and the listeners um the international court of justice was requested by the general assembly to advise on the legality of occupation and in a large majority of Judges it concluded that it is not a legitimate because of the time Factor because it is indefinite and Netanyahu and his government they want to prove that um presence of Israel in the occupied territories is a legitimate necessity for the defense of Israel and the Philadelphia Corridor provides Israel with an opportunity to uh argue for this case so if that is the ultimate aim then and Netanyahu is planning on staying in the Philadelphia corriddor I mean Hamas said look this is a non-starter for us where does this all leave than any potential for a ceasefire uh solution at the same time we heard from the US President Joe Biden who said that uh we're close he said the US is in fact very close to presenting a ceasefire proposal I mean what does this all mean yes the um Netanyahu finds himself er er attacked in a pins movement so to speak between the Israeli public who wants to see the hostages freed alive and the Americans who are saying no you have not done enough and here in Netanyahu realizes that with all the patience the Americans are um manifesting and I can tell you that the people on my side are very impatient and frustrated with the American Administration the American Administration should have pushed Israel into action a long time ago way before we were moving into Rafa and the Philadelphia Corridor but now the situation is that the Americans are showing a a level of impatience with Israel in their polite language while the demonstrators are intensifying and I can tell you from firsthand because I am there every evening and uh it is a it is a very strong message that is being sent from uh the public at large in Israel on that but I want to tell you that we in our policy working group for the last decade we told the International Community our interlocutors listen the situation is is is uh not going to stay for for long it will change between Israel and and Palestine it will change either by force by violence or by International pressure for years and years and years the International Community the Americans included sat on the fence on the sidelines and waited for the two parties to sort out the out the issues and I think it is high time now that the International Community will move in and Kat is a player here right and uh and uh create a process by which the this the our conflict is um relaunched into a peace process with a settlement at the end of it okay Elan B thank you so much for speaking to us from West Jerusalem thank you make sure to
