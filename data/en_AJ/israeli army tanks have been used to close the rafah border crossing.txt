Jeremy kinck is president at refugees International he's a former official at within the Obama Administration working on humanitarian assistance and joins us now from Washington DC good to have you with us sir uh on the program I mean you've come across situations like war and conflict Aid is always required by innocent populations caught in the crossfire before we talk about Gaza during your time in the Obama Administration what's the nearest example of sort of the genocid like conditions seeing in Gaza that you had to experience and deal with well we faced conflict and uh you know violent obstruction of Aid efforts in a range of places we you know we saw this with our partners in Syria um you know a lot of I think the the the battle damage patterns that are visible in in Gaza today look a lot like what Assad did to Aleppo for example um similar uh tactics of obstructing Aid um in the war in Yemen uh you know so there are absolutely precedents for what we're seeing I think what is one of the things that's unique about Gaza is seeing the convergence of a lot of those different difficulties all coming together to make it one of the most challenging environments for delivering Aid in in recent memory I mean you know how the system works from within conflict erupts politicians react when do they call the Aid workers in for that meeting or are you already in there listening to how this situation develops well there have been Aid groups operating in Gaza for you know for for decades and many of the eight organizations that have been have been working there have long-standing operations in Gaza and have been forced to significantly scale those back as a result of the the difficulties of accessing the the territory now during the the conflict and as a result of the well documented obstruction by the Israeli military just trying to get an idea of the behind the scenes chitchat I mean obviously you're not privy to what's going on right now but we sort of want to try and get the methodology of how the system works I mean obviously that there is an ongoing scenario in Gaza right now that we've been seeing for seven months and was wondering how how far and how quickly you know us a for example would get involved Samantha powerheads that right now at the moment I was wondering you know where would she come into that conversation uh and how how quickly or how soon has she been involved in that do you think uh so the role that usaid would play Within the US government deliberations is typically to you know provide some of the ground truth of conditions to talk about you know they are a channel for relaying a lot of what they are hearing and seeing from their humanitarian Partners so you know what what is the ground truth that their partners are relaying about the difficulties they're facing about the conditions that they are finding um there have been some indications there was a leaked document uh a few weeks ago that usaid had sent forward to the state department in the White House in which they cataloged much of the obstruction that they've been seeing from the Israeli government that that was part of this process uh by the US government of assessing whether Israel's conduct has been in line with international law um you know usaid's findings that were reported in that leaked document indicate that at least you know they don't they don't see Israel's Behavior as compliant with that but ultimately that decision is one for President Biden and he will take usaid's advice in kind of in stride along with other parts of the government okay so let's talk about what's going on with Rafer at the moment we have now it seems Israelis in charge of the border crossing km Abu Salam is closed this is now a dire situation isn't it for any Aid agency both within Gaza and outside of it trying to work out how they can try and help in any shape or form yeah it's it's really tragic uh things had been improving very modestly since the strike on the world Central Kitchen Convoy um the Israeli government had shown a bit more flexibility on allowing Aid access to the north there had been more food getting into the north uh there had been slightly more Aid getting into Gaza generally over the past few weeks this obviously puts a very abrupt halt to almost all of that um it means things are now moving again in the wrong direction both the uh km Shalom and the Rafa cross have been closed for the last few days and obviously if there is a full offensive operation in Rafa which the the Israeli government has been promising for some time that would risk the collapse of what remains of the famine relief operation no Aid by land but the US has invested in this pier at Ash DOD thinking that Aid might be able to come in via the sea but if Israel has a veto on what comes into the Gaza Strip that's also a futile exercise as well isn't it certainly for the US I wouldn't quite say futile but definitely it falls short of what is needed I mean you know the Israel inspection regime has been excessive and arbitrary and has blocked a lot of standard humanitarian critically and standard humanitarian items from getting in so you know one example of that is water purification tabs in every crisis that I've where I've worked where you have a crisis of access to Queen water which is very much the case in Gaza right now because so much of the water infrastructure has either been turned off or destroyed uh over the course of the war you would then distribute water purification tablets to households so that they can take a bucket take dirty water and then use those tabs to purify it those tabs contain chlorine that's a standard you know standard for for purifying water but because they contain chlorine the Israeli government has blocked them in inspections and it's going to one small but I thinkt telling and indicative example of how excessive the inspections have been and how much that that is hampering the the effort Jeremy it's really good to get your Insight thank you very much uh for your perspective Jeremy conik there from refugees International uh joining us in Washington DC thank you
