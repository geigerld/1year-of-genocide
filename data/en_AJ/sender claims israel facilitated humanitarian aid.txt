thank you Madame President members of the Court it is an honor to appear before you today on behalf of the state of Israel it falls to me to address the condition of risk of irreparable harm and urgency this third condition is of course dependent on the two preceding ones Professor Shaw and Miss rajuan have already shown that the provisions relied upon by the applicant do not afford even Prima fasi a basis on which this Court's Jurisdiction could be founded they also showed that the rights asserted by the applicant cannot be regarded as plausible it follows that the irreparable consequences cannot in the present case be caused by the alleged disregard of rights under the genocide convention again this is not at all to say that the humanitarian situation arising from the present armed conflict is not grave civilians have been severely affected by the hostilities instigated by Hamas its systematic strategy of Prosecuting war from under and within the civilian population exposes civilians to Great risk and it has brought about great suffering Israel has done and is doing a great deal to alleviate this suffering in very challenging circumstances in this regard the factual account provided by the applicant is once again entirely one-sided the application and request run no less than 84 pages but they make hardly any mention of the extraordinary efforts undertaken by Israel and by a host of other states and international actors to improve the humanitarian situation we again heard virtually nothing from the applicant on this issue yesterday but this is a critical factor in the request before you as Miss rajuan has shown it frustrates any attempt to establish the necessary special intent for genocide it also Bears upon the third condition established in your case law Madame President members of the Court we know from your case law that the power of the court to indicate provisional measures will be exercised only in exceptional circumstances there needs to be as you have said a real and imminent risk that irreparable prejudice will be caused to the rights claimed before the Court gives its final decision your order in the Myanmar case in which the genocide convention was also invoked suggests that the adoption and I quote of concrete measures aimed specifically in recognizing and ensuring the right end of quote of the group in question to exist would mean that irreparable harm and urgency cannot be established precisely such concrete measures have been taken by Israel which has been facilitating the provision of more and more humanitarian assistance for people in need throughout the Gaza Strip these steps have not only been increasing so as to meet the developing situation on the ground they are continuously undertaken specifically in order to prevent harm to the civilian population these efforts have had an impact just last week for example with the assistance of the world food program a dozen bakeries reopened with the capacity to produce more than 2 million breads a day the world food program has said the delivery of flour salt sugar and yeast continues so as to enable more bakeries to reopen increasing accessibility and affordability for thousands of families and since the applicant mentioned yesterday the number of trucks entering Gaza each day before and after the war the accurate average number for trucks specifically carrying food is 70 trucks a day before the war and 109 trucks a day over the last two weeks all this information may be found in your judge's folder access to water has also been a priority as with Food Supplies there is no restriction on the amount of water that may enter Gaza Israel continues to supply its own water to Gaza by two pipelines it facilitates the delivery of bottled water in large quantities and it repairs and indeed expands water infrastructure that has been damaged by the fighting an additional water pipe bringing water into Southern Gaza from Egypt began operating a few weeks ago access to medical supplies and services is also growing Israel has so far facilitated the establishment of four field hospitals and two floating hospitals the establishment of two more hospitals is underway isra is is facilitating the entry of Medical Teams into Gaza as also vaccinations including in cooperation with UNICEF ill and wounded persons are being evacuated through the Rafa border crossing to Egypt the United Arab Emirates turkey Qatar and Jordan tents and winter equipment are being distributed as well the constant delivery of fuel and cooking gas is also facilitated according to official data again in your judges folders from a December the amount of fuel entering Gaza has doubled and currently stands at 180,000 lers a day this is a target amount requested by the UN itself since 21 December the amount of cooking gas entering Gaza has also doubled now standing at an average of 90 tons per day details of this kind concerning the various ongoing humanitarian efforts are updated every single day on a designated English website of Kat the unit in the ministry of Defense in charge of monitoring the humanitarian situation when pressing needs are identified Solutions are soon coordinated a great effort is indeed invested in eliminating bottlenecks so as to improve the entrance and distribution of Aid not withstanding Hamas constantly stealing it as you have heard a joint operations room involving Israel Egypt the United States and the UN operates daily to solve in real time logistical difficulties Israel also coordinates with various un agencies and the icrc to address their own needs on 15 December Israel decided to open its Crossing at km Shalom with the express intention to improve and upgrade the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians in Gaza that part of the government's decision is in your judge's folder as well this has eased congestion at the Rafa Crossing and helped facilitate the provision of Greater amounts of Aid Israel facilitates air routes as well for parach shuting Aid directly into Gaza facilitating a maritime Corridor is currently being considered with other states Madame President members of the court again these are just some examples but they show that Israel no doubt meets the legal test of concrete measures aimed specifically at recognizing and ensuring the rights of the Palestinian civilians in Gaza to exist it has been the daily work of numerous Israeli officials of various agen genes to ensure that these and other steps are effectively carried out at a time when they and their families are themselves under constant attack a determination that the multilateral large scale humanitarian effort is lacking or that scaling up access of humanitarian relief to Gaza would be of no avail as the applicant would have you believe should not be made lightly Madame President members of the Court two additional elements warrant your careful attention they too suggest that the condition of urgency is not as easily met as the applicant would have you believe First the scope and intensity of the hostilities has been decreasing Israel's defense minister said last week that Israeli forces would be shifting from the intense maneuvering phase of the war toward and I quote different types of Special Operations this statement made in an interview to International media is found a tab 16a of the volume submitted this week on 8 January the spokesperson for the Israeli military confirmed that the Israeli campaign had already started a transition to fewer ground troops and fewer air strikes the war shifted a stage he said as you will see in tab 16b of the volume he spoke of a new and less intense phase of fighting he specifically mentioned that Israel will continue to reduce the number of troops in Gaza five brigades consisting of thousands of soldiers have already been withdrawn from the territory second the UN Security Council has only recently adopted a resolution for the specific purpose of alleviating the situation by resolution 2720 of 22 December which is found at tab 16 C of the volume the council demanded the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages as well as the delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale directly to the Palestinian civilian population throughout the Gaza Strip more specifically still the council requested the Secretary General to appoint a senior coordinator in order to establish a un mechanism for accelerating the provision of humanitarian relief Consignments to Gaza contrary to what we heard yesterday this resolution does not and I quote remain unimplemented close quote a senior coordinator has been appointed and indeed began her work the council remains actively seized of the matter Israel for its part is is already working with the senior coordinator and it has just this week coordinated the entrance of a un delegation into Northern Gaza in order to evaluate the situation and map the needs for a future return of Palestinian civilians I recall in this connection that in the agnc case the court found that it was not necessary to indicate provisional measures where the government in question showed willingness to act in accordance with the recommendations of the security Council concerning the matter before the court all these recent developments indicate that the facts as they presently exist do not call for awarding interim relief they also suggest that the difference between the present case and earlier cases that have come before for you are very clear finally the lack of urgency within the meaning of the Court's case law is further demonstrated by assurances provided before you today by Israel's co-agents they could not be clearer in stating that Israel remains bound at all times by its International legal obligations needless to say this includes Israel's obligations as a state party to the genocide convention the applicant will have this court say that it cannot take the word of a state that would be not only unfortunate it would also be contrary to the law on unilateral Declarations of States unsurprisingly your consistent case law suggests that assurances of the kind offered by Israel May well render the indication of provisional measures are necessary Madame President members of the Court the conclusion is that the condition of irreparable prejudice and urgency cannot be met it is Israel and its citizens who would risk irreparable harm if the requests of South Africa were to be granted Madame President distinguished members of the court that concludes my statement I thank you for your kind attention
