another massacre in Gaza Israeli strikes two days in a row kill more than a 100 people at the jabalia refugee camp the UN is calling the region a living hell Israel has now targeted hospitals refugee camps and mosques what will it take to launch a war crimes investigation this is Inside [Music] hello and welcome to the program I'm de abuga so for a second consecutive day Israeli forces launched an air strike on jabalia that's the largest refugee camp in Gaza more than a 100 people have been killed in two days of bombardment as the total number of Palestinians killed in Gaza since October the 7th near as 8,800 the UN is calling the Reg of living hell that do Palestinians deal with unprecedented death destruction and deprivation rights groups are demanding Israel be investigated for war crimes for targeting civilian areas but it's not clear if that will be possible given Israel's backing by the United States and other Western Powers we'll discuss this and The Wider conflict with our guests in a moment first this update from Victoria gatenby on the situation in Gaza a second Israeli strike on the jabalia refugee camp less than 24 hours after an attack killed more than a 100 people on Tuesday six bombs dropped by Israeli war planes on Palestinian homes resulted in this scene of Carnage one witness described it as feeling like the end of the world with no excavators heavy machinery or rescue equipment survivors tried to recover people with their bare hands the injured were taken to the nearby Indonesian Hospital which was already overwhelmed with patients a large number of injured have come to us after the huge explosion That Shook the entire jabalia refugee camp hundreds of injuries hundreds of dead they were just in their homes they were targeted while they were in their homes the UN has called Israel's seege and destruction of Gaza a humanitarian catastrophe for its 2.3 million people there's lack of food water medicine electricity and fuel Israeli air strikes have also directly hit gaza's hospitals including its only cancer facility and areas around the AL coulds hospital it's illegal to attack hospitals under International humanitarian law the Geneva Convention stipulate that medical staff and transport must be protected regardless of the actions of one side so for example using hospitals for military purposes um the other side must comply with International humanitarian rules on the conduct of hostilities and that as I said does extend special protection to Medical units which must be protected and respected at all times the international criminal court recently confirmed that it has jurisdiction to investigate possible war crimes in the occupied Palestinian territories even though Israel is not a signatory to the Rome statute which governs the court Human Rights Watch a leading human rights organization has urged the IC to issue a formal statement on the escalating situation between Israel and Hamas it says a warning by the court could deter war crimes during the conflict Victoria gonb for Inside Story we can now bring in our guests joining us from the Canadian city of London on in Ontario is Michael link he's a former special reporter for the human rights situation in the Palestinian territories occupied since 19 1967 in rala in the occupied West Bank we have n a former spokeswoman for the Palestinian task force on public diplomacy and in London in the United Kingdom Donatella rera who's a senior crisis response adviser with Amnesty International thanks for your time with us on Inside Story on Al jazer Michael link um we saw the images the refugee camp being targeted for a second time by the Israelis killing hundreds being described as a massacre by some people now the fundamental rule of International humanitarian law and conflict is that all parties must distinguish at all times between combatants and civilians is that what we're seeing here probably most likely not um it's hard to understand how we are now at a death hole of around 8,800 Palestinians in uh in Gaza the vast majority of them being um civilians uh and not see this as potential war crimes and amnesty has has called for war crimes investigations Human Rights Watch has called for war crimes investigations keep in mind that uh it may or may not be deliberate targeting of civilians but uh even if it's Reckless or indiscriminate that that amounts to a war crime um and uh international law puts very strict um restrictions on on what uh militaries can do with respect to this um even if people haven't left North Gaza uh as many of thousands have not done um Israel must uh after the warning that Israel has given um Israel must continue to distinguish at all times between combatants and civilians and if a air strike or a tank strike is going to cause disproportionate uh C uh civilian casualties that it cannot do that and there seems to be no um no evidence that Israel has taken that kind of Distinction and that kind of legal thinking into account okay let's bring in uh Donatella from amnesty uh so do you think that this is amnesty has been calling for war crimes investigation um tell us tell us why and what what amnesty has seen and do you think that this strike on the two strikes in fact on jabalia refugee camp are going to lead to a war crimes investigation well I don't know what they will lead to because obviously as an investigator I investigate what has happened and I'm not uh I'm not able to predict what's going to happen in the future but this is yet another strike and there have been many uh since the 7th of October as indeed there have been many in the previous years but since this new escalation there have been many strikes that should be investigated as war crimes this is these are the latest um clearly a situation where so many civilians are including thousands of children uh have killed and many more have been have been killed and many more have been injured in strikes that are being carried out in very densely populated areas where the Israeli authorities and the Israeli Army know full well that there are many many civilians regardless of the leaflets that they've dropped on entire area which is also not something that can be considered an effective warning because warnings must be specific and precise in both geographically and in terms of time and this is not the case but the authorities and the army of Israel knew that there were many civilians um thousands and thousands of civilians in in jabalia refugee camp as there are indeed in Gaza City and elsewhere um and and to have carried out a strike which is that enormous um using um weapons with a wide impact area it is known in advance there could be no doubt in the minds of those who carried out the attacks and of those who ordered the attack that there was an extremely high likelihood a virtual certainty that large numbers of civilians would be killed and injured therefore the requirement of proportionality and of Distinction uh do not appear to have been met um in this case as in many other cases and and the civilians are you know clearly continuing to to pay the price okay and I see you nodding along with what Donatella had to say what are your thoughts on the jabalia refugee camp strike and particularly this issue of proportionality which we've heard uh being brought up I mean how how how do you see uh the proportionality playing out in the context of what's happening in Gaza after the October 7th attacks well yeah thank you for having me Dar I I would uh remind the viewers of statements made by senior Israeli officials uh political and Military uh at the beginning of this uh assault which is that uh they you know several of them said we are more interested in destruction than accuracy we will turn Gaza into a city of tents we will eliminate everything in Gaza these are statements made by high officials in the Israeli government and Military and I think what we're seeing right now in jabalia in theat and all across the Gaza Strip is a very accurate translation of that of those Declarations of intent and I would also add that uh the Gaza Strip is very heavily monitored and surveilled by Israel Israel knows it literally has the phone number of every person in Gaza and a recent example of that was your own reporter yumna Sayad when the Israeli Army uh uh started increasing the bombardment in her neighborhood in Gaza City they called up her husband um spelled out his entire name uh first and last name and they knew exactly which apartment he lived in and they asked him to leave even though of course the whole neighborhood was under bombardment and it was um there was no safe route to take but what I'm trying to say is that uh there there are no mistakes here as far as I'm concerned Israel knows who lives uh in in these neighborhoods it knows how many children and women uh will be uh um um victimized by these massive massive attacks on very densely populated poor areas especially when we're talking about a refugee camp like jabalia um and it does not care and the reason why it doesn't care is because it has enjoyed uh the political uh protection of countries like the United States and others including members of the ICC like the UK and Germany and others it there's an entrenched culture of impunity they know they can get away with it because they've gotten away with it in the past this is not the first time Israel has been accused of war crimes of course the these are proportions we haven't seen in decades but really what we're seeing is Israel taking full advantage of the fact that it feels that it is above the law above accountability above even reproach and that Palestinian lives have been deemed Expendable right by Major International Powers regardless of what they say about humanitarian assistance which really brings Hollow at this point Michael link the director of the New York office of the high commission for human rights has resigned I'm sure you're aware and he said that the world is bearing witness to a textbook case of genocide from your experience as a former un special reporter is this a case of genocide building this has the qu the possible makings of uh of a of a genocide genocide of course is a very high standard uh to to meet an international law which includes intent to try to eliminate in whole or in part uh a uh a people um and we we know um side has been pointed to with respect to uh Rwanda with respect to um myamar and the ringa um these are not easy uh stances to be able to make but increasingly uh we're hearing very respected voices in international diplomacy and international law saying that we have the makings of a case on genocide here indeed I just listened to an interview earlier on today by Luis Okuma who was the first prosecutor of the international criminal court where he said use the word genocide as um as a u a possibility and uh with respect to the facts on the ground and what you need is not only evidence of uh the factual evidence of of uh people being eliminated in large numbers um and we already are at 8,800 uh deaths um but the uh but the intent by the uh by the rulers of those who are generating the the conflict and uh as has been mentioned we have uh repeated statements by uh senior military political uh leaders in Israel which uh discuss it as if the entire population of 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza is guilty uh over what happened on October 7th and that Gaza needs to be eliminated Gaza needs to be and to be entirely depopulated okay let's bring in Donatella to tell us whether amnesty has seen any evidence that backs up this claim by uh the director of the New York office at the high commission for human rights where he's saying this is almost it's a genocide it's a case of genocide building I mean obviously as the previous speaker uh has said the um the threshold and and the legal analysis um when it comes to making determination on on genocide is is is lengthy and complex and uh right now um at Amnesty International were focused on investigating what are very serious and very obvious uh violations of international humanitarian law uh which are extremely extremely uh grave um indiscriminate can you tell us what some of those violations yeah can you tell us what some of those violations have been from either side in fact um well clearly we've seen um attacks that violate the uh um this the proportionality uh requirement the fact that indiscriminate attacks have been carried out that violate the principle of distinctions these are cornerstones of international humanitarian law uh We've also seen clear deliberate attacks on civilians from the Palestinian armed groups that went into Israel and deliberately attacks um civilians um these are all uh crimes that violate International humanitarian law that should be investigated as as war crimes um very uh very obviously uh we're also seeing uh on the part of um of Israel the deliberate restriction on the entry of humanitarian Aid and goods which are absolutely necessary for the survival of the civilian population um fuel being perhaps the most obvious because no fuel has been allowed into Gaza fuel is necessary to produce electricity to keep hospital equipment functioning life saving equipment function in in hospitals as well as um purifying water at the moment people in Gaza don't have clean water to drink um you know and then of course there is everything else uh food and and medicines in general these are items that can never ever um be restricted there should be unfettered entry of medicines food um and and all that is necessary for the civilian population to survive uh and and I would also add that these restrictions are not uh a new imposition on the part of Israel since the 7th of October but they have been going on for 16 years so again if if if one is looking at um deliberate action taken to impose Collective punishment which is another very uh serious violation of international humanitarian law uh Collective punishment on the civilian population of Gaza um you know that there is clear evidence of that the the forcible displacement uh that we're you know we've seen uh demanding that the entire population of North Gaza you know one of the most densely territories densely populated territories in the world being asked at a day notice to move South no knowing that actually the place where the civilian population of of Northern Gaza has been asked to move to is not safe either because bombardments um have been increased uh in the past uh two weeks uh you know since the population of the north has been asked to move South um so yeah people civilians families have no way of knowing what they could possibly do to protect themselves to protect their children um and and so all of these are are violations of international humanitarian law and they should all be investigated a war as war crimes okay n i mean a lot of the the violations that have just been listed by uh Donatella from amnesty are not new we've seen them before uh nothing moves on the international front when it comes to the prosecution of these war crimes at organizations like the international criminal court for example I mean how how do you think that war crimes can be actually prosecuted what needs to be done what sort of avenues are there for accountability realistically well I mean the only Avenues of accountability are the legal accountability at least are are known and I know that they're being pursued but more to your question I think that one encouraging sign that we're seeing on the streets of capitals around the world is that people uh young voters um in uh uh countries around Europe and in the United States are Marching In Their hundreds of thousands they are angry and rightly so they are outraged at the complete uh disconnect between the principles they stand for and the and the uh positions of their government and I believe that part of the accountability that we all hope to see is um uh you know in the medium and long term the these voters holding their officials accountable for callousness for a lack of responsibility and for complete complicity in in in some cases with what's going on right now in Gaza but also more broadly with the m maintaining uh and entrenching this uh system of occupation of colonization dispossession um and ethnic cleansing if I mean if you take a look at what the world has allowed to happen for all these decades in the West Bank they've allowed settlers to decide where Palestinians can live where they can uh uh build their homes and then they decide who lives who dies who's detained who's not who's labeled a good guy and who's labeled a terrorist even if they're award-winning human rights Advocates and in Gaza the world has allowed for far too many years Israel the occupier to lock up an entire population uh of more than two million people half of them children deprive them of the most essential uh uh uh requirements of Life have a say on who can get medical treatment or not um and they've managed that they've allowed it to happen and that is what needs to change and I think in many ways what we need is a change of the of that thinking before we can really hope for accountability at the legal or political level Michael link but what about the uh n was just talking about the complicity uh what about the complicity of other governments of other countries like the United States like the United Kingdom which was referenced in the letter of the uh the gentleman who who resigned the director of the New human rights he said this that the US and the UK are are being complicit and what's unfolding in Gaza do you think that we would see Western leaders ever being held account for their complicity or or is that just simply too difficult not in the near future I'm I'm afraid to say and uh when we talk about international law um it is indeed the moral standard that we that uh Nations promis to each other and to their citizens that they will uphold but in order for international law to be uh to be effective it needs to be combined with International resolve and that has not happened here um Western Nations as as many have pointed out not over the last four weeks have been uh explicit with respect to their denunciations of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea um as violations of international law yet refus to hold the same standards that they themselves actually have voted for in un Security Council resolutions as well as in UN General Assembly resolutions with respect to Israel's many violations of international law including annexation including uh settlements which are a war crime under the under the Rome statute including its refusal to apply the laws of occupation under the Fourth Geneva Convention I may want to remind your audience but this is not the first time we've been uh here with with respect to Israel and Gaza and the allegation of war crimes after Israel's assaults on 20089 on Gaza after 2014 and after the assaults with respect to the great March of return in 2018 on each of those three occasions the uh Human Rights Council of the United Nations in Geneva appointed an independent Commission of inquiry and each of those three commissions of inquiry said that there were great likelihood that Israel had committed war crimes during each of those three occasions it also said that it considered Hamas had likely committed war crimes during the first two of those occasions and in each of the three reports it said we have a desperate lack of accountability I think in the Goldstone report of 2009 they use the term a Justice crisis in the occupied Palestinian territory uh I'm sad to say this as a former special rapur and as an international human rights lawyer that in the Middle East particularly when it comes to Palestine international law is closer to power than it is to Justice okay just very briefly Michael what is the point then of of international law if Israel can choose to ignore it over and over because it is it is it is our one common language of of a more moral compass throughout this world um uh in a world that's divided by Race by class by religion um and by geography and ethnicity it is the one common uh uh human created um institution that sets the moral standards by which we judge each other and okay um I would I would never say Do not abandon or be cynical about it I would say push harder all right Donatella i' just like to get your take on on a recent report by am an investigation has found that the Israeli Army indiscriminately and therefore unlawfully used white phosphorus in the south of Lebanon on the 16th of October can you tell us about that and and what you're calling uh on to happen next um yes I mean we and is it only the south of Lebanon forgive me because we've seen the pictures of Gaza as well where it appears to be the white phosphorus is being used yes and we had also published on that um after those incidents so we were able to verify use of um U white phosphorus both in Gaza and in South uh Lebanon uh through uh a variety of means we we we saw the Munitions uh being um with the forces that were located both in the in the southern border of Israel close to Gaza and and in the north close to Lebanon um we saw videos that we were able to geolocate and and verify showing um why passor being air bursted over Gaza over the port and over the zun neighborhood again densely populated areas and we were able to investigate the strikes in um um inia and uh and andash Shaban Mari in in South Lebanon um which also injured civilians we've not received reports of civilians being um harmed uh in in the using Gaza but we have in in the case of Lebanon white phosphorus is not a banned munition it can be used on the battlefields in areas where there aren't civilians the manner in which was used both in Gaza and in and in Lebanon um are um areas where there are civilians and therefore it was using intervention uh okay I would just add one more point and that perhaps what's difference this time is that we have the international criminal court uh prosecutor who has made a statement um at the Rafa border uh saying that his office is looking into both uh into both um attacks committed by Israel and I'm glad you bring up Karim Khan because on that on that final on that final thought I'll bring in N are you optimistic that Karim Khan will will uh move quickly and open an investigations uh on what's Happening new and will it make a difference I'm cautiously optimistic Karim Khan has not so far really done much to gain the confidence of Palestinians and many in the international human rights uh sphere he has been dubiously uh um absent uh from from any kind of interaction or statements regarding several clear uh violations of of Palestinian rights and international law now and in the past his statement while a bit murky uh uh gives us some hope but I think he needs to be pushed and he needs to be held to account and he needs to understand that the world is watching and that the integrity and standing of the institution uh uh to which he answers to is on the line if he fails and if he uh reaffirms suspicions that he is not exactly balanced and that the Justice he wants to deliver might not be blind uh then he really jeopardizes that whole institution of international accountability I hope that those skepticisms that skepticism is wrong and I hope that he can deliver something to the victims who still have some faith in that International System all right we'll have to leave it there thank
