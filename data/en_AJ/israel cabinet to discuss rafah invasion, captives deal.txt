Israel's war cabinet is expected to reconvene later on Sunday to discuss an offensive on Rafa the evacuation of civilians will be on the agenda the cabinet met on Saturday to discuss sending negotiators to Qatar for ceasefire talks following a meeting in Paris last week let's speak to H salut she's in occupied East Jerusalem for us H what are we expecting to come out of this latest War cabinet meeting we do know that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is going to present his staff and ministers with a plan that's a dual action plan one for Israel's ground Invasion into daah and two an evacuation plan for the nearly 1 and a half million Palestinians who are seeking refuge in gaza's southern most city now something else that's going to be on the agenda is the potential captives deal remember there is an Israeli delegation that has been been meeting with negotiators but the Israeli Prime Minister has said himself that there is still no deal inside meaning there's no confirmation that a deal is actually imminent additionally when we're talking about Rafa the Prime Minister while speaking to American Media has said that if there is a deal the ground Invasion would be delayed if there is not a deal the ground Invasion would happen sooner but that no matter what the outcome would be around a deal that Israel's ground invasion inaa despite all of the international criticisms and condemnation was going to take place because he says that is the only way to achieve a total victory over Hamas and if we look at the negotiations for a deal we are hearing that the Israelis are going to be sending a delegation to Doha this coming week do we know anything about that delegation who might be in it we don't yet know the makeup of the delegation that the Israelis will be sending to Doha but we do know that the team that just returned from Paris with what they're calling an outline for a framework included the head of Israel's mosad and the head of Israel's Shin Bet these are the external and internal security agencies respectively so they came back with what they say was something a little bit tangible and they actually convened Israel's war cabinet on Saturday night on the phone to discuss these plans according to reports within Israeli media we're looking at a time line of a 6 week pause in the fighting around 40 Israeli captives to be released and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails also to be released but there are still a lot of gaps to be filled there are still a lot of sticking points like who the Israeli captives will be who would be released who the Palestinian prisoners that would be released are so there's still a lot of information that's up in the air but again there are no indications that a deal is in sight and the Israeli Prime Minister has said himself that even though these negotiations are ongoing it's not an indicator that both sides are seemingly willing to give up more concessions he says that hamas's demands are inconceivable and that they need to take a step back on what they are demanding but again it's a little bit too soon to say if there is a deal just yet okay ham H the bring there from occupied East Jerusalem thanks hamda
