well let's bring in Omar shaid he is the Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch and he's joining us live from Chicago thank you very much for your time Mr shaid I believe that you could hear that interview with Dr Malla Lati in shiffer hospital what do you make of what is happening in gaza's largest hospital it's just unfathomable to be seeing a situation in which gaza's hospitals are under such sustained systematic assault hospitals have special protections under International humanitarian law doctors patients nurses ambulances must be protected and allowed to do their work under all circumstances I can't imagine the situation that doctors are under given the number of injuries they're dealing with operating without fuel so without electricity uh without water without medical supplies you know you're having a situation in these hospitals now were you know bodies of patients um who have died as a result of the uh Israeli blockade are not able to be properly buried um these are all acts that are unlawful under International humanitarian law to impose Collective punishment on the civilian population to block life-saving Aid unlawful strikes on hospitals all raise significant concern and and and there's really grave concern might happen and hours ahead absolutely not just not permitted under international law but our indeed war crimes under international law we heard from the Israeli military spokesperson uh on Saturday night and he said that hospitals in Gaza are legitimate targets and that Hamas has made them legitimate targets because they carry out operations from these hospitals from these medical facilities your organization has recently said that you have not been able to corroborate Israel's claims that Hamas uses these hospitals that's correct the Israel government has put forward no evidence that would justify stripping hospitals of the special protections they have under International humanitarian law and even if the Israeli government's evidence was accurate and again we haven't seen evidence that would support that International humanitarian law also only allows attacking hospitals if room is made for safe evacuation and the reality here is there is no safe place to go in Gaza and no reliably secure way to get anywhere so that means that even if one accepts the Israeli government's evidence as face value it wouldn't justify attacking a hospital because of the need to protect patients doctors and others and that's that's I know something that Human Rights Watch has also said no evidence put forward would justify depriving hospitals ambulances of their protected status absolutely and I think it's again worth noting that um even if you evacuate people and even if you can meet the high threshold to attack hospitals on International humanitarian law hospitals cannot be a free fire zone the people who are not able or choose not to flee retain the protections of international humanitarian law against disproportionate indiscriminate attacks and again it's important to note that the risk of disproportion attacks are heightened at hospitals because even a relatively minor attack could life altering uh consequences for the treatment of patients all these things put together point a very Grim picture unlawful attacks weeks without electricity without food without U ma medical supplies lives are being lost by the minute and the world really needs to act to prevent further Mass atrocities that is the Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch omad Shakir joining us live from Chicago thank you very much for your on this we appreciate it thank you
