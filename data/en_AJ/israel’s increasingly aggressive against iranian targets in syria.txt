now Israeli air strikes in Northern Syria have killed at least 37 people including military personnel the attacks targeted the city of Aleppo they followed similar strikes on the capital Damascus which wounded at least two people now the Israeli military has previously acknowledged strikes in Syria targeting armed groups backed by Iran let's get the very latest now on this from Zen our correspondent in the Lebanese Capital Beirut who joins us now uh we talked about the escalation uh in violence between Israel and Lebanon on on Thursday Zay we're seeing an escalation too in Syria what's going on well Syrian State media is reporting overnight strikes around the northern city of Aleppo Syrian State media blaming Israel saying that a number of civilians and military personnel were killed State media did not reveal what the target was but Syrian activists on the ground are reporting that a weapons Depot uh was hit and they're also reporting that up to 37 people were killed uh Syrian soldiers but as well as Hezbollah fighters from the Lebanese armed group The Lebanese armed group has a military presence in Syria and some of their Fighters have been killed in recent months now in the past few days we've seen almost consecutive Israeli strikes in Syria whether in Aleppo Damascus or dezur in eastern Syria um Syria Israel really are widely hitting uh Syria Iranian targets and Iranian link Targets in Syria in recent months we're seeing this marked increase in attacks and of course uh the past few days Zena have seen strikes in various parts of the the country I mean what's what's the bigger picture in terms of Israel's strategy here well for years now Israel's strategy has been and they've declared this numerous times they want to prevent Iran from military entrenching itself in Syria Iran or its allies because Syria borders Israel they consider this a security threat but as of late they have a much more aggressive posture um more attacks they're even being less restrained when it comes to casualties they're going after members of Iran's revolutionary guards in fact a member of the Revolutionary guard was killed in these strikes a few days ago in in their aour um so this is Israel's stated aim it is to degrade and weaken Iran in Syria and they're doing the same in Lebanon uh they're going after Iran's Ally hasbalah which opened the front against Israeli forces to help Palestinians in Gaza last October and since then we have seen targeted killings against Hezbollah Fighters and commanders in fact just a short while ago we're getting reports of a a car being being targeted in in southern Lebanon and they have been hitting what they're calling military compounds homes more often than not their homes because Hezbollah is a Guerilla Force um and they've been hitting weapons Depot in eastern Lebanon very close to the Syria border so Israel's strategy is to prevent Syria be becoming an Iranian base or a rear base for Hezbollah or a transit route for weapons to reach Lebanon uh from Iran so this escalation not just in Lebanon but in neighboring Syria as well Zod there for us in Beirut thank you
