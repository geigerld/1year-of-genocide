barari he's a professor of international Affairs at katar University Hassan thank you for joining us again this us veto for the Palestinian bid another Palestinian bid it feels like it comes low in a shifting International landscape where we are actually seeing more and more countries in favor of of recognizing Palestine as a full member yeah it is obvious that the majority of states around the world came to the realization that probably the only way for solving or resolving the Arab Israeli conflict is by empowering the Palestinian and giving them a state and it seems that only the United State who is not really on board and they actually uh making the case that this would this should come after negotiation problem here that when when you say this you give the Israelis the the right to veto any outcome because the Israelis have not been really forthcoming when it come when it comes to giving the Palestinians their own right to self-determination uh so yes as you said from the G ago there's more people more countries around the World realize that the Palestinians should be uh see should be um given their independence and should be admitted to the United Nation as a full member not as an observer well we'll see where those conversations go I do also want to ask you about Rafa obviously the US has been pretty vocal about what they view would be a mistake in Rafa in recent weeks they now having these conversations with the Israelis how much influence and leverage does Washington have right now on what Israel decides in the South well prior to the Iranian attack on Israel the Americans seem to me having more probably the leverage to influence na uh but now with with with the attack I think this has eased and nowo feel that you know his country was the victim uh and now he has the right to continue whatever he wanted to do uh his argument to the Americans and to everyone else that the total Victory will not be achieved without moving into Rafa the problem here is that what are you going to do with the humanitarian dimension of the conflict how many people you going to kill uh how many civilians going to be displaced and all these questions are actually uh being debated with with the American but it seems to me that the Americans have been moving slowly but surely toward ano's decision to move into Rafa well if Netanyahu is now feeling emboldened he he's still saying to the us that they will try to protect civilians we're hearing from our correspondent about vague plans for evacuations we still don't know where people would even be Evac too we're talking about 1.5 million people is is something of that scale even possible given what's already happened in Gaza I I don't see this as happening in in a safe way uh I think what the Israel is trying to do is to give the impression uh that they they're they care about the civilian but they don't you know you know given the the toll and more than 34,000 people were killed and maybe 880,000 people were injured 80% of the houses were demolished so they really not qualified morally to talk about this in indeed what they interested is just you know it's a smoke screen behind this it conceals what the Israelis are trying to do is to dismantle Hamas and to achieve a votal um total victory at any cost well so let me ask you then about the US perspective on this because they're saying they share this objective of defeating Hamas and Rafa but they do believe it's possible to do that while protecting civilians what are the Americans proposing some kind of limited special ops kind of mission well I think all these statements coming from Biden's Administration are performative I mean they are just you know playing to the ears of the Americans because there are a lot of critiques in America about how Biden's uh administration's um Administration have has has U um supported Israel so we is trying to assure them that America is still cares about humanitarian aspect but at the same time you know he's playing into the hand of Nano Nano has been good at manipulating the American Administration to his own and he's moving slowly but surely and the Americans who were like saying no to invading or now say yes but you know and and this is you know when you give the Israelis yes but it means you know this is like a green light well another critical part of the humanitarian picture here is obviously that Rafa is the primary entry point for land Crossings of Aid into the Gaza Strip for the whole Gaza Strip at the moment we we've seen the Israelis in in recent weeks open I should put that in ambass of commer open another Crossing in the north where we're seeing very little Aid come through I've been wondering whether that's been preparation for some kind of rougher offensive and and what the broader impact on Aid a huge land offensive in the South would would be well I think this is part of the Israeli propaganda that they car that they care about the Palestinians because you know the Americans who were like criticizing Israel for not allowing for the aid to come into into Gaza and now with the American mean just um last night they were talking about the Improvement in the humanitarian aspect but you know the Israelis they really don't care about the Palestinian they see them as human they see them as subhuman you know given the way they refer to them as amalik and also the minister of defense or talking about them as even animals human animals they call them but you know they want to um uh they want the International Community to um be assured that Israel is taking care of the aid but you know at the same time we know that the Israelis were trying actually to kick the Palestinians and expel expel them so uh starvation is one of the one of the weapons used by the Israelis and effectively a ground defensive in Rafa would pretty much cut off the only path in for Aid as would make it really tough for the Palestinians Hassan barari thank you for joining us again on the aler news now
