while the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is about to hold a news conference in Tel Aviv as we've been reporting he's been trying to secure a ceasefire agreement with Israel following a proposal by Hamas let's listen ining hostages home um I've met with families of the hostages multiple times uh during prior visits as well as in Washington and I expect to see them again tomorrow the sheer Agony not knowing the fate of your loved one um it's almost unimaginable and I know that that pain is almost unbearable so we have been intensely focused from day one on getting the hostages all the hostages back with their families where they belong and we will keep that Focus until we get them back uh we had an opportunity today to discuss with the Israeli government the response that Hamas sent last night to the proposal that the United States cutter and Egypt had put together uh to bring the remaining hostages home and extend the humanitarian pause um what I can tell you about these discussions is that while there are some clear non-starters in hamas's response uh we do think it creates space for agreement to be reached and we will work at that that relentlessly until we get there uh we had uh extensive discussions with the Prime Minister and National Security leaders on the status of the military campaign uh to defeat Hamas and on the progress toward achieving the fundamental objective of ensuring that October 7th never happens again at the same time we're continuing to work closely with Israel and Lebanon on diplomatic efforts to deescalate tensions on Israel's northern border so that amilies can return to their homes both in Northern Israel and in southern Lebanon and live in peace and security we also discussed the imperative of maximizing civilian protection and humanitarian Aid to address the ongoing suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza nearly two million people have been displaced from their homes hundreds of thousands are experiencing acute hunger most have lost someone that they love and day after day more people are killed on all of my previous visits here and pretty much every day in between we have pressed Israel in concrete ways to strengthen civilian protection to get more assistance to those who need it and over the past four months Israel has taken to do just that starting the flow of Aid doubling it during the first pause for hos releases opening the North and South corridors in Gaza so that people could move out of immediate Harm's Way through these corridors with four hours pause every day 3 hours notice opening Kem Shalom starting the flow of assistance from Jordan establishing deconfliction mechanisms for humanitarian sites as a result today more assistance than ever is moving into Gaza from more places than it many times since October 7th as the largest donor of humanitarian Aid to the Palestinians the United States has helped provide much of that assistance including funding 990,000 metric tons of flour delivered from ashot Port that's enough to provide bread for 1.4 million people for the next five months uh a un team began its mission to the north to assess conditions for the civilians who are still there as well as what needs to be done to allow displacement Palestinians to return back home to the north and yet as I said to the Prime Minister and to other Israeli officials today the daily toll that its military operations continue to take on in innocent civilians remains too high in our discussions today highlighted some key steps that Israel should take to ensure that more Aid reaches more people in Gaza Israel should open AR res so do assistance can flow to Northern Gaza where as I said hundreds of thousands of people are struggling to survive under dire conditions it should expedite the flow of humanitarian assistance from Jordan it should strengthen deconfliction and improve coordination with the humanitarian providers and Israel must ensure that the delivery of life-saving assistance to Gaza is not blocked for any reason by anyone we urge Israel to do more to help civilians knowing full well that it faces an enemy that would never hold itself to those standards an enemy that cynically embeds itself among men women and children and fires Rockets from hospitals from schools from mosques from residential buildings an enemy whose leaders surround themselves with hostages an enemy that has declared publicly its goal to kill as many innocent and civilians as he can simply because they're Jews and to wipe Israel off the map that's why we've made clear that Israel is fully justified in confronting Hamas and other terrorist organizations and that's why the United States has done more than any other country to support Israel's right to ensure that October 7th never happens again Israelis were dehumanized in the most horrific way on October 7th the hostages have been dehumanized every day since but that cannot be a license to dehumanize others the overwhelming majority of people in Gaza had nothing to do with the attacks of October 7th and the families in Gaza whose survival depends on deliveries of aid from Israel are just like our families their mothers and fathers Sons and Daughters want to earn a decent living send their kids to school have a normal life that's who they are that's what they want and we cannot we must not lose sight of that we cannot we must not lose sight of our common Humanity we remain determined as well to pursue a diplomatic path to a just and Lasting peace and security for all in the region and notably for Israel and that diplomatic path continues to come into ever sharper Focus as I travel throughout the region and talk to all of our friends and partners an Israel that's fully integrated into the region with normal relations with key countries including Saudi Arabia with firm guarantees for its security alongside a concrete time bound irreversible path to a Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel with the necessary security assurances over the course of this trip we discussed both the substance and sequence of steps that all would need to take to make this path real that includes steps by the Palestinian Authority to reform and Revitalize itself and I reaffirmed the imperative of those steps in my meeting today with president abas Chief among them improving governance increasing accountability to the Palestinian people reforms that the Palestinian Authority has committed to make in a recently announced reform package and that we urge it to implement swiftly now we can see so many of the actors in the region lining up to move down the path that I just described but some are not some are trying to sabotage that path Iran and its proxies continue to escalate and expand the cycle of violence that we all want to break we'll continue to defend our people will continue to defend our interests in the face of such attacks not to fuel escalation but to prevent it finally in my discussions today with the Prime Minister and Senior officials I also raised our profound concerns about actions and rhetoric including from government officials that inflame tensions that undercut International support and place greater strains on Israel's security the people of Israel have sacrificed enormously to forge this nation and to defend it they'll Tim decide the right path to take and whether they're ready to make difficult choices necessary to realize vision of the long elusive Prospect of true peace and true security as a true friend of Israel as the country that has always been first to its side whether that was May 14th 1948 or October 7th 2023 we will always offer our best advice on the choices before this country especially the ones that matter the most thank you happy to take some questions the first question goes to zolan K young with the New York Times uh thank you Mr secretary for the question uh just have a couple for you here um uh I know that you said there's still room for agreement in terms of the uh negotiations over the release of hostages uh but the Prime Minister after you spoke with him uh pretty bluntly dismissed hamas's response um describing it even as ludicrous I just want to clarify is this response or these negotiations uh DOA at this point um and what's specifically did the Prime Minister uh object to in that response uh also the Prime Minister shortly after you met with him uh made clear that Israeli troops will be moving deeper into Rafa uh will the United States simply stand by um as this action is pursued um even with 1 million Palestinians more than a million Palestinians uh being held are in Rafa seemingly with nowhere to go uh and if I may Congress is now moving ahead with a bill that would pair Aid for Ukraine with aid for Israel would the administration endorse any potential package that once again prohibits UNR funding thank you that's impressive now I'm I'm taking it that that includes the questions of all of your colleagues as well is that right I I don't think so couldn't do that to them all right um starting with the with the first part look as I said um we've looked very carefully at what came back from Hamas and there are clearly non-starters in uh in what it uh what it's put forward um but we also see space in uh what came back uh to pursue negotiations to see if we can get to uh to an agreement and that's what we intend to do um and I'm not going to speak for uh Israel or anyone else involved but uh again we we we believe the space is there and we believe that we should pursue it um with regard to Rafa look as I said uh before Israel has the responsibility has the obligation to do everything possible to ensure that civilians are protected uh and that they get the assistance they need in the course of this conflict um any military campaign military operation that Israel undertakes needs to put civilians first and foremost in mind um and I suggested again some ways to do that um and that's especially true in the case of Rafa where there are somewhere between 1.2 and 1.4 million people many of them displaced from other parts of U of Gaza so uh we want to make sure again that in anything that's uh that's done in any military operations the situation for civilians is first and foremost in mind and that the necessary steps are taken to make sure that they're protected and they have the assistance they need you suggested some ways to do that well I just went through I just went through a number of things that uh we urge Israel to do now on the uh building on what it's already done in terms of both humanitarian assistance and civilian protection um and as I said with in the case of of RAF itself uh that's extremely important because it has such a dense population including many people who've been displaced from other parts of of Gaza um and on uh on unra look the we were deeply concerned by the allegations that were made about the participation or involvement of some of its employees in the in October 7th and it's imperative that as the UN has said it's doing that there be a thorough inv investigation that there be clear accountability and that there be clear measures put in place to make sure that um this can't happen again this the Personnel working for it uh were not in any way involved in terrorism or the events of October 7th um we know that the work that under performs the functions that it performs have to be preserved because uh so many lives are depending on it uh and so going forward we're going to look to the actions that are taken um and as I said it's imperative the functions be preserved it sounds like the administration then would potentially support an aid package that still prohibited funding for un I'm not going to get ahead of our views on hypothetical pieces of legislation although there was already an aid package that the the administration endorsed that prohibited that funding I'll I'll uh I'll leave that to the next time thanks thank you Mr secretary for the next question guil tamry with Channel 13 Mr secretary thank you for the opportunity guil tamari Channel 13 it seems to be that the entire Biden Doctrine Visa Israel a future Palestinian state
