we begin in central Gaza where an Israeli air strike in De albala has killed at least several Aid workers most of them foreign Nationals while they were members of world Central Kitchen a group that's coordinating Aid deliveries transported by ship from Cyprus citizens of Australia the UK and Poland were among the dead Australia's prime minister says he expects full accountability while the US was called for Swift investigation the Israeli Army says it's reviewing the incident at the highest levels Australia expects full accountability for the deaths of Aid workers uh which is completely unacceptable uh Aid workers and those doing humanitarian work and indeed all innocent civilians need to be provided with protection Australia has had a very clear position of supporting a sustainable ceasefire of calling for it for some period of time uh we certainly have already contacted uh the Israeli government directly uh we are contacting the Israeli Ambassador uh to uh ask uh for uh accountability here uh the truth is that that this is beyond uh Beyond any reasonable circumstances someone going about providing Aid and humanitarian assist assistant uh should lose their life and the world Central Kitchen has responded to that attack saying we are aware of reports that members of the team have been killed in an IDF attack while working to support our humanitarian food delivery efforts in Gaza this is a tragedy humanitarian Aid workers and civilians should never be a Target ever earlier we spoke to Al jazer HRI who was at the al- AXA hospital where victims were taken she met the world Central Kitchen staff just hours before the attack on Monday we know that there are five a workers working with the world Central Kitchen a Palestinian a Polish British and Australian and the fourth uh uh body is unrecognizable because it was severely uh injured but according to the world Central Kitchen employees that we met in alaka hospital they told us that he is an international uh uh worker also H they were on their way back from uh the eight uh Convoy uh the eight ships that um uh reach the Gaza Strip from Cypress uh earlier today and they were on their way back to the to their guest house in ra and they were targeted uh with their armored vehicles uh near uh balah on AR Rashid Street the main uh street that we mobilized through from uh the North to the southern area of the G strip I remember when I talked to one of the aid workers today I was asking them what were they waiting for because they were near Gazza in the southern site and they said they were waiting for the green light to enter um to the Northern Area and to cross W gizza and uh uh to go to the port that they built so there's something uh un understandable we don't know how uh they were targeted we know that they have been all of the international uh organizations have been uh closely um uh coordinating with the Israeli forces but this um incident is horrifying and there are hundreds of other Aid Workers International Aid workers currently working with providing aid for Palestinians providing on helping um Palestinians uh like providing them with Aid with protection and their displacement and now the question is what is going to happen with the other Foreigner and international Aid workers in the godship let's bring in Ben sa now he's a un special rapporter on human rights and counterterrorism he joins us live from Sydney welcome to the program what do you make of this incident that has killed at least seven Aid workers in including a Palestinian and international Aid workers too it's a human tragedy but of course it could well also be a violation of international humanitarian law under which Israel has a duty not to deliberately Target uh humanitarian relief workers or their convoys or their or their relief uh Consignments uh it also has a wider duty to ensure the safety of humanitarian workers in a conflict Zone to ensure their freedom of movement uh and to coordinate with them so that these kinds of tragedies uh never happen you mention international law there I mean where would this foot in in terms of what could be considered to be a war crime well under International humanitarian law if there's a deliberate targeting of any civilian including humanitarian relief workers that's a war crime uh if there's a a targeting of a a military objective which causes uh excessive civilian casualties uh in the area that would be a war crime or if it's an indiscriminate attack uh so an attack was launched uh with a kind of recklessness or carelessness as to whether military and surrounding civilians would be uh would be harmed uh obviously given the humanitarian crisis in Gaza uh the the free passage of humanitarian relief is absolutely essential and just like last week the international court of justice ordered Israel to open more land Crossings precisely because over a million Palestinians in Gaza are currently facing catastrophic levels of hunger according to the United Nations uh the Israel has also been uh previously uh trying to shut down unoa one of the largest humanitarian actors in Gaza uh numerous unoa employees have been killed it's not just foreigners of course because most of the humanitarian relief is provided by Palestinians themselves who live in Gaza so this is a an acute problem which has been ongoing for the past five or six months and a full investigation and accountability is warranted as you say not just foreigners I mean not withstanding the 30 more than 32,000 Palestinians killed in all of this many foreign Nationals were killed in this particular attack does that put more pressure on countries to for example perhaps reconsider arms deals to Israel well the death of any civilian in this conflict when it is unlawful is a violation of international law and potentially a war crime and we should care equally about all of those lives uh now unfortunately it is a a fact of life that uh some countries and some medeia organizations will only be interested or will be more interested in the story if it involves Nationals from their own countries uh we should nonetheless let's use that as an opportunity to bring greater pressure to bear on those foreign governments who are still cooperating with Israel uh in its violations of international law in Gaza we know that the United States and Germany for example are the two largest arms exporters to Israel continuing to export weapons even though under International humanitarian law uh doing so is illegal where there is a clear risk that those weapons would be used uh in violations of international humanitarian law B Israel uh itself uh that risk is is very clear a Dutch appeals court uh not so long ago found that there was a clear risk of Dutch arms exports being used in Israeli violations in Gaza uh for the same reason under the Geneva conventions under the genocide convention uh there's a duty to uh halt These Arms exports immediately also a duty to Halt the sharing of military intelligence which some states like the US and the UK are still providing to Israel without sufficient guarantees or safeguards that that information will not be used in the commission of violations of international law in Gaza so how does a country like Australia for example react to this I mean it stance on Israel's action seems to have evolved over the past few months so the Australian prime minister of course has called Already upon Israel for a full investig ation of this this incident and to hold any perpetrators accountable that of course is the is is absolutely the right message to send the problem of course is that Israel is notorious for not independently and impartially investigating violations by its own forces and even more notorious for almost never holding accountable any of its Personnel who have been credibly alleged to have committed war crimes or other serious violations of international law this is a kind of impunity which has been going on for many many decades it's not just the current conflict it extends to previous conflicts uh whether in Gaza or Lebanon or or or in the West Bank uh it it extends to strikes in neighboring territories like Syria of the kind we've seen again this week without any clear justification under international law so I think it is something of a vain hope to expect Israel uh to seriously and credibly investigate its own people and hold them accountable this is exactly why the international criminal court has been forced to investigate Israel because the international criminal court will only get involved and will only investigate a situation in a country if that country's own authorities have failed to genuinely investigate and hold accountable their own people B we leave it there we very much appreciate your time thank thank you thank you
