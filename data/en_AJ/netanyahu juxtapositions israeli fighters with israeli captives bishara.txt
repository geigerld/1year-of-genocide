of the headlines from this is that Israel or at least this prime minister is not interested right now in negotiations I think he basically rejected everything uh that America's allies friends and detractors have been proposing um in recent weeks I think um you could say Sammy that uh finally after four months of wobbling in his tone not in his position because there's nothing new that's been said today but clearly in terms of tone I think the the the Israeli Prime Minister have finally found his voice and his voice of course is obnoxious abrasive and confident this was not the case the past few months now this is the wartime leader speaking and he's speaking in terms that have absolutely nothing to do with negotiations he is talking about heroism he's talking about victory about prevailing and clearly he's talking about a decisive defeat eliminating Hamas and so on and so forth now to convince his audience and his audience is the Israeli public whose eyes today are directed towards T Aviv where a good number of segment of the Israeli public is is demonstrating with the families of the captives and he said something very important he said it before but once again he's saying it with a new tone he's saying you are attacking me with the uh requests and the demands of the families of the captives of the captives requests and demands I am responding to you with the calls and the demands of the soldiers who died in this war and their families and their lives that should not be or should not have gone for nothing I'm talking talking to you about the thousands of soldiers who were injured and they couldn't have been injured for nothing so he's basically Jaa positioning two segments of the Israeli Society those who fought and those who were held captives he's also jxa positioning his own Coalition of 64 members of the 120 Israeli Parliament who which he's holding on to dearly in as far as concern the American position is not important International attempts at dictating to Israel what it true and and how it should recognize a Palestinian state is not acceptable the Netanyahu that's abrasive confidence and obnoxious is claiming that America that came to his Aid America that allowed him to be a prime minister when he is today and to claim to be a wartime leader he America should not be listened to it Israel will take the money it will take the arms but it rejects the advice believe it or not the the the leader of this little whatever you want to call it country thinks in terms of egality with the United States he says I don't interfere in your Internal Affairs don't interfere in ours is another way of of looking at this that this is a man who's feeling the heat from some of the domestic pressure now as we see those protests in places like Tel Aviv grow oh yes absolutely this Nano once again I need to underline these things because this is Netanyahu that we've known over the years the past 25 30 years this is the obnoxious abrasive confident Netanyahu that will not accept dictates from the street from the opposition and the last the last question that he posted to the Press which prob I think it went you know when none of us understood what he's talking about I think he's basically trying to build up some conspiracy theory that there are invisible hands that are trying to destabilize his government I'm not sure if he's going to start signaling anyone in the United States or elsewhere but clearly there are now increasing voices even in the United States that wants him removed that want to see a new elections in Israel because for a lot of people especially in this region in the Middle East that think the main obstacle to peace is Netanyahu not Hanah it's leud that's governing in Israel not Hamas it's Israel not Gaza this is the obstacle to peace all right thanks so much Maran bishar well while prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was speaking two separate protests have been taking place in Tel Aviv one group is calling for him to step down the other is demanding the release of all captives being held in Gaza let's go live now to hamda Salud she joins us from Tel Aviv and I understand hamda as he was speaking there were some scuffles going on tell us what was happening there as you can see behind me the anti-government demonstration in full force this is the first time since the beginning of the war that the anti-government protest movement has come out in full force like this you can see police mounted on Horseback here and these trucks that have been placed by Israeli police and that's in order to prevent the demonstrators from going all the way down this road to our left here and blocking the isone highway that's something that the anti-government protest movement was doing constantly in the year of 2023 leading up to the war now simultaneously just across the street you have a rally to bring back the captives at some point this evening those two demonstrations will come together into one massive protest against the Israeli government's policy that has seen not bringing back the captives the Israeli Prime Minister speaking tonight addressing the issue but when you talk to Israelis Here In This Crowd they'll tell you that time has simply run out 134 days have gone by and the family members have not not seen their loved ones so on top of the that protest you have anti-government demonstrations here in Tel Aviv Israelis showing up in the thousands Sammy all right thanks so much H well manim Klein is
