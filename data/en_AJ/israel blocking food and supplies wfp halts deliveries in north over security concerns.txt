we're going to start in the Gaza Strip where Israel's blocking of food Aid and humanitarian supplies is forcing starvation on hundreds of thousands of Palestinians long cues of children in the north of Gaza in particular are desperate for anything to eat Aid agencies including the Palestine red cresant and the un's world food program report people having starved to death the wfp has recently paused a deliveries to the north as it can't safely deliver Aid in southern Gaza the Israeli military is again targeting the city of Rafa more than 1.5 million Palestinians who've been forced out from other areas are Sheltering there bodies have been piling up at the al- naar hospital at least 25 people have been killed as a result of Israeli strikes on Rafa and k yunas eight children are among the dead in my lap lies Kinsey she was a year and six months old I was at my in-laws with my wife and daughter we had tea and I played with my daughter and hour after I left I heard air strikes on the news they said there was an air strike in the house I ran back only to find my daughter my wife my in-laws many members of the family killed okay we're going to talk to Hy mm who's live for us in Rafa in southern Gaza let's talk to us first of all about the the world food program saying that it's pausing food deliveries to Northern Gaza and of course other Aid is being blocked as well tell us what's been happening it's well the decision of the world food program came at a very difficult time such dire times for Palestinians inside the northern part of Gaza City where for the past few weeks and in fact since the beginning of the the war having been able to get food supplies the vast majority of humanitarian trucks haven't been able to reach to the northern part of the strip just leaving about 600,000 of people hungry and facing famine at all level we're talking about but Extreme shortage of of all necessities and basic supplies and drinking all contaminated water as the majority of the water available is not suitable for human consumption but right now and just within the past couple weeks a famine signs started to become more visible as people resorted to eating plants wild plants and and animals feed just to sustain themselves in the face of This calamity the decision by the world food program just cuts a Lifeline that people were hoping it was going to be delivered for them so they are able to uh to face these challenges imposed by the ongoing uh genocidal War just within the past couple of days we we looked at a video where people surrounding a truck filled with flower bags and just trying to get their hands on whatever they're able to get just for so they are able to bake bread and provide for their families this famine is hitting the northern part of the Gaza Strip very hard particularly when we talk about young children who are in need of these necessities and basic food supplies in nutrients for their growth and also another vulnerable group uh people with health complications as well as women who are breastfeeding or a pregnant are in need of basic supplies food if this is going on we're going to see start seeing people dying in the northern part not only from the bombs but also from the famine that is spreads like fire now uh of course we're still talking about ongoing strikes on the resident of Gaza tell us what's been happening in the last few hours yes it's been very interesting timing almost hours after the UN Security Council failed to pass a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire we seen intense bombing campaign taking place in the Central Area city of kanun and over over crowded Rafa City and just overnight attacks the Israeli military it pushed about 30 tanks in a bulldozer with a coverage of attack drones and F16 all the way to Al maasi area masasi evacuation Zone where thousands of people literally have been evacuating and Sheltering in this area as they were told by the Israeli military since the beginning of the war if they want to avoid being bombed in the northern Gaza they should move to this area found himself and is still in a state of panic and shock that this is happening or this happened to them in a very area that they were told it is safe the isra military took over the coastal Road cutting off the central area from the southern part of the Gaza Strip in the Central Area more residential homes and about one car that was targeted by missile drones leaving more than 45 people killed and tens of other injuries reported to Ala hospital here in raah City overnight attack killed five members of One family Sheltering in a residential home in Al Jan district and just within the past couple hours a car was targeting the eastern part of RA and we've seen this pattern happening almost every area takes turn in the the bombing that continues to destroy much of the residential buildings the infrastructure but more profoundly the trauma that is caused to people who are seeking shelters in these areas Hy thank you very much indeed Han mahm talking to us from Rafa in southern Gaza
