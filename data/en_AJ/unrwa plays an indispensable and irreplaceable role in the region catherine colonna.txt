we're taking you live to the UN so um people are waiting for uh the former French Minister Katherine Colona to speak on the findings of an independent uh report that has been commissioned by the UN on the uh allegations that um unwa members are linked to Hamas in some way and were linked to the October the 7th attacks and that is the uh un uh Secretary General spokesperson Stefan Jer standing on stage alongside uh the former French Minister they're about to start shall we listen in yeah let's listen in can speak in French between us without any Witnesses hearing uh good afternoon uh everyone thank you for thank you for being here it's a pleasure to be back in New York uh two months after my my first visit here on speaking to you uh two months ago at the very beginning of the mission as you know the Secretary General has established the independent review in February to assess I like to quote whether inra is doing everything in his power to ensure neutrality and to respond to allegations of serious breaches when they are made the review was also asked to make recommendations if necessary this followed s allegations about uh the uh possible involvement of some inra individuals in the 7th of October terrorist attacks on Israel so I'd like to be very clear on this these allegations are under investigation by the oios internal uh overside Services it is separate Mission and it is not in our mandate let me quickly explain how we've uh worked for the last uh nine weeks it was short time frame we have extensively analyzed the mechanisms and procedures um in place within in we have uh traveled including in the region uh we traveled to Tel Aviv Shalem Kamala Aman we met with official as well as with the UN agencies and NGS we visited the uh Shu fat refugee camps in Jerusalem East run by inra and we visited uh in's headquarters in Haman all in all I think we've had conversations and meetings with over 200 people uh throughout the review including both of course local and international uh staff of course but not only and I think I've spoken with representatives of 47 countries and organizations so the first thing I'd like to say is that I would like to personally thank all those who have given me their time uh support information and I've been so patient for answering on many questions and quite often we came back uh to the same context to to have further details and I want you to know that we've received a very good cooperation elsewhere everywhere uh from every single interested party and this is important for you to know and of course this was highly appreciated of course I would like to thank the three uh research institutes who worked uh with us they uh had a thorough research and that was immensely uh useful now when uh we come to substance I would like to say first that inra plays an indispensable and irreplaceable role in the region and this must be said clearly let's start from that in the absence of a political solution we know it provides life-saving humanitarian Aid and essential services to the population and of course as as we speak uh in this critical time inra has a vital role in the humanitarian response in Gaza overall the findings of the review are that inra is in place a very significant number of mechanisms and procedures to ensure compliance with the humanitarian principle of neutral actually probably have a more developed system than other un organizations or agencies uh which is a necessity considering the very difficult environment complex and difficult situation in which they operate and uh the uniqueness of their mission there's always room for improvement and some issues related to neutrality persist this is why this mission was created and among some um events I could U quote for examples instances of uh staff publicly taking signs host countries textbooks that could uh sometimes content uh contain some uh well problematic content we we'll go further in the report with that as well as politicized Union making it did happen um operational descriptions or or making threats against the management I'm presenting this report and we have the report I think it's public uh as we speak I'm presenting the report as the chair and I have identified eight critical areas to ensure compliance within rise neutrality principles let me go briefly through the eight areas if I may and then uh I'll take your questions one is engagement with donos enhancing interactions between inra and is donos is imperative to um Foster trust and to and to strengthen partnership I've heard it from so many states at the very beginning of the mission and it must be add obviously but Frankly Speaking I think this is not too difficult by just increasing the interactions so recommendations will include increasing donor updates on uh the finances on the budget on the structure of the budget uh on neutrality allegations or breaches when they occur two governance inra as a unique Mission I repeat but as a very uh interesting structure they do not have an executive board they have an advisory commission and the advisory commission provides advice so inra would benefit from stronger governance structures in support of uh its leadership and of of what the management tries to pursue as a strategic line and stopping um here just for a while you hear me saying this several times this morning or this afternoon weather I would like to stress that the International Community has a responsibility in helping and supporting inra in addressing neutrality issues globally speaking in its Mission including in helping the agency to address these difficult challenges it face sometimes it is a shared responsibility we have recommendations for governance without changing the Mandate it is what it is and the structure is what it is I recommend the advisory commission to meet more regularly maybe at a higher level uh sometimes uh at the UN headquarters uh here in New York or Geneva why not at the level of permanent reps um I recommend to have neutrality as a stanging issue on its agenda is it an issue yes the that's what we're here for they don't discuss about it and I recommend create a dedicated working group for neutrality to address this question three management internal oversight capacities or structures and I be quite direct uh here it is a critical area where there are major gaps unra has undertaken um huge and Comm efforts to to to reform uh its system and these uh initiatives should be further expanded we have the uh oversight and internal Services we have the ethics office they could be in power with uh greater a greater role also very clearly there needs to be more senior International staff in field positions in each of the five fields of operations you know inra is just tiny percentage of international staff less than 1% actually and the rest is um local employees which is quite natural because it delivers services directly to the population so nurses are you know local uh teachers are local uh workers are local nevertheless they're missing maybe this management structure that is needed if we want to see uh other side being being being um reinforced in addition to that we've noted that um some political influence sometimes is exercised on decision related to projects and it shouldn't be the case this is posing a significant risk this is not respecting neutrality so it is crucial also to address this side of the question four neutrality of stuff it is not news that you faces challenges due to the politization of its staff not all of them but some of them and usually the higher go to to uh the positions of influence the more you'll see that this is again affecting its neutrality so it is crucial to reform prevention strategies and monitoring strategy the staff should better respect staff regulations and rules they have accepted those rules when entering they've signed they should respect those rues and the uh agency should give the appropriate response to potential breaches uh it is also needed so coming to our recommendations some and these are just a few examples include regularly sharing the list of employees digitalized with uh some details of the employees with host countries and with Israel it works well in some countries less with Israel in the past uh years it could it could have been better but in the very recent times this has affected of course by the U Global atmosphere so H countries and Israel will need to provide screening results and evidence if there's any red flag on on a person we recommend that the agency also vet uh staff when promoted now each time you reach a certain level of responsibility you must be uh cleared also they have a whistleblower uh system which is good because when you see something you can report it it could and should be strengthened five neutrality of installations again um not so much uh braging new here that uh it did happen that sometimes inise installations have been used for uh misus whether I should say for political or military purposes uh by various groups you know not um thinking of one only here you know various parties various groups and this is undermining the neutrality of the insulation it should not happen preventive measures enhance monitoring of the stations transpant reporting or necessary steps to address this issue effectively so there should be more inspections an inspection looking at a larger scope you know looking Beyond uh the un uh logo looking Beyond uh posters and and and various uh signs um looking a little bit further we know it's needed the agency could uh does it but could expand the uh Community awareness campaigns that they do on the civilian nature of these installations they are civilian installations they are in ra installation they should be respected and protected six neutrality of Education let me first say that U the role of Ina is so highly important there inra as a system that is crucial indispensable to several hundreds of thousands of children in the region however it has been reported for many years uh not to say decades that some schools may have been utilized to spread political views violating neutrality principles not respecting un values not respecting UNESCO standards you will find additional material in the report and though has made considerable progress uh in in the past few years to mitigate the risk address to uh some content promoting hate or uh inciting violence uh in the textbooks in the classroom it now needs now needs to implement a zero tolerance policy seven you're almost there neutrality of self Union uh uh over the years political factions have used U inas staff unit system to to to pressure inas leadership uh to use um influence um sometimes causing uh a repeat operational disruptions and this is not the role of Staff unions staff unions should represent the staff uh they're not quite representative by the way uh even if a judge only by the gender uh balance you know 50% of the staff is women or 50% of them is men and the other half is women uh when you go up to the top there's only one woman representative at the top level um 18 men we know this is one of the most sensitive issues with all the uh inflence attached to that um it it needs to be addressed with the full support of the advisory commission and of member states very recently the commissioner General um pushed for a reform of the system it was not supported by the advisory commission you know you I cannot be alone facing this issue without getting support from Member state in the first place of the advisory commission so recommendations will be quite clear hoping to help making it through they include reforming the 99 90 statute of the Union of area staff of inra dating 1990 should be updated and it should be aligned with the UN staff Union statute we also uh think an independent entity should vet uh every staff union representative eight and we're opening a door towards a broader scope Beyond uh what we will achieve now enhanced Partnerships while respecting fully the Mandate the Mandate is what it is by the 1949 resolution and actually specifically in line with this resolution cooperation with other un organizations and agencies is needed it is there uh it has already been engaged however uh especially considering the the the current crisis in Gaza and in full respect of the Mandate of the uh agency I repeat some additional measures could be considered to help inra deliver life- saving assistance to those in need so I will uh end there there are some 50 recommendations in the report I just uh mentioned a few and I'm confident that implementing these recommendations will help inra fulfill its mandate and restore confidence when needed I presented the the fightings and the recommendations of the report to the Secretary General on Friday during our meeting it was kind enough to call uh our work important and decisive for which I'm very grateful and this morning he issued a a statement saying that he accepted the recommendation this is a a very important decision and a very important step the Secretary General endorses the recommendations and so it is now up to the commission General to take this forward and to provide a a clear plan on how the agency will follow up on these recommendations and one last note because I want to repeat that I strongly believe that member states the international communities house countries also need to help inra Implement these reforms so it better fulfills this mandate it is a shared responsibility obviously thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaer
