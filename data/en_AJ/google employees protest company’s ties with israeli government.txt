now Google employees have staged Sittin to protest against the tech Giants business with Israeli government protesters rallied in the company's offices in New York and California Google and rival Tech firm Amazon reportedly signed a $1.2 billion contract with Israeli government back in 2021 the project Nimbus deal is said to provide cloud computing infrastructure and services to the Israeli government not only uh is the lack of transparency concerning but just the context uh of which the contract is being taken place in we know that the genocide in GZA is one of the or is the first AI power genocide so we find that big Tech is at the Forefront uh of kind of like streamlining this genocide uh against Palestinians so let's bring in ramish shasan he's a professor at the UCLA Department of information studies he joins us live from Los Angeles ramish good to have you with us so tell us briefly what exactly is Project and why is the project so controversial that even Google employees as we just saw there are now protesting about how it's being used with the Israelis as the war in Gaza continues yeah so project Nimbus is a is a is a contract that Google and to a lesser extent Amazon web services signed with the Israeli government uh for $1.2 billion back in 2021 and as as um the person who was interviewed in your story indicated there's actually a shocking lack of transparency around exactly what this project covers outside of providing interoperable comprehensive cloud computing which is essentially systems of data storage data management and sharing data for the Israeli government which uh of course is likely to extend to the Israeli Defense Forces so it's it's a project that recog it's it's a project that marks and and and and and sort of highlights uh the direct connections that big technology companies in the United States have not only to with the so-called military-industrial complex but to directly aiding and embedding um the Israeli government at a very very uh a very difficult time yeah and that's an interesting point you make because the recent International court of justice ruling compelled Israel to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza could then big tech companies be held responsible if it's found that their AI software helped Israel to Target Palestinian civilians in Gaza mean could they be held uh complicit to genocide absolutely because we know that these AI systems are actually um have a number of false positives associated with them that's there's a reporting that came out just in the last couple weeks on this so the Israelis are actually using big Tech American big Tech corporate AI software to predict targets and pro the probability that the target is where they think that that the that they will um you know engage in in a sort of a violent act right so basically the the way this is working is Corporate American big Tech is actually aligned with many of the Israeli militaries actions in these particular ways and the fact that AI systems are being used uh indicates that there's a lack of regard um by the Israeli State and the IDF and obviously connected to this uh big tech companies in the false positives meaning that they know and everybody knows these AI systems will make mistakes right so that there will be wrongful deaths and wrongful assassin as we've seen with so many civilian people in Gaza they're basically complicit in such in the sense that they they are signing contracts with uh this state ramish so do we know then if if Google and to a less extent Amazon are selling this kind of Technology uh to other countries or militaries and once they sell it do they have any control over how it's used right I mean that's that's very dependent on the specific agreements that any big tech company will have with another state and and mind you this is not merely issue involving Google and Amazon the company Palante here uh headed by Peter teal who's a supporter of the former president Trump um is a company that's been using many of its military predic it's been using prediction software with other states um project Nimbus is at least you know as I mentioned earlier it's quite notable for its lack of transparency right um so we don't really know if you know sort of equivalents of this are happening with this particular set of Partnerships for all data interoperability for all cloud computing for other foreign States but certainly one can imagine that that is something that could happen or is happening uh ramish just a final thought to you are we now then in a world where big Tech uh is selling this kind of controversial AI technology to the highest bidder in a very unregulated Market space that even governments are are powerless to police and if so what needs to be done yeah as you allude to it's a much much larger issue almost everything in our lives is turned into Data that data is being harvested by private corporations it can be bought and sold it was bought and sold in the case of examples like Cambridge analytica so we know that basically our data these ways of of of mon of quantifying different aspects of our lives are being bought and sold in transacted and largely are being transacted uh in relation to Big Tech platforms we also know in the AI space we're talking about a very limited set of actors something of an oligopoly both in the US and China just a few actors that are using our data without compensating us potentially to for all sorts of aims whether they're advertising oriented aims or in this case uh PR potential surveillance assassination types of Aim so what really needs to be done is every single corporate driven technology must be regulated to ensure that it's audited that there's disclosure and that we are very clear about what data virus is being used by whom and for what purposes and the rights are returned to people accordingly and there's plenty of ways for big tech companies to continue to be the wealthiest companies in the whole world and in the history of the world uh while still maintaining our rights over our own data because they're expressive of our own lives as people ramish shasan really good to get your thoughts and your analysis there ramish thank you very much for talking to us thank you appreciate it make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
