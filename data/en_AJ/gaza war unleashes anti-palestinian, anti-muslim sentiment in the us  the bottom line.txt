hi I'm Steve Clemens and I have a question has the war in Gaza Unleashed a new wave of bigotry and hate in America let's get to the bottom line as Israel's war in Gaza rages on with no end in sight everything that happens over there is affecting people over here emotions are running High among followers of all major religions Muslims and many Christians since a sizable portion of Palestinians are Christian are rallying for the cause of Palestine and many Jews are rallying for the cause of Israel now both sides are reporting a rise of racism here in the us and we're not just talking about cases of intimidation and harassment one week into the war a six-year-old Palestinian American boy was allegedly murdered by his landlord in Chicago and an elderly Jewish man was knocked over and allegedly killed during protests and counter-protests in California in Vermont three Palestinian college students were shot as they were walking down the street wearing a Palestinian cfia like this one and speaking in Arabic so are these isolated incidents or a rising Trend across the us today I'm talking with nihad Awad the executive director of the Council on American Islamic relations the nation's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization based here in Washington NAD thank you for joining us and these are tough times and I just want to get right into the meat of things um I don't know you you you walked into a Hornets yest or you threw a hornets nest uh with your comments that you were glad to see the siege of Gaza uh ended on October 7th the white house uh Deputy press secretary Andrew Bates of the New York Times said uh we condemn these shocking anti-semitic statements in their strongest terms what are your reactions to the White House and what were you trying to say well I'm shocked that the White House M construed uh my statement and uh um labeled me the way way they labeled me unjustly um and um without without any justification that's not what I said I never said that actually if they saw the video if they saw my speech they would not have uttered the word they did so for that I I asked the White House to reconsider their position and here what I said what I said is The Siege on Gaza is illegal and the Palestinians deserve Freedom they deserve the same freedom that we are applauding uh for the people of Ukraine and other people who are under occupation or oppressed there should be nothing strange about this um I always said and I continue to say that I will fight anti-Semitism in the same way and the same strength and vigor I fight islamophobia because both phenomenons are evil and those communities both the Jewish community and Muslim Community are targeted because of their faith by extremists and usually by white extremist uh and and we have been fighting this for three decades together so anyone who doubts this will be really misrepresenting my position and what I stand for I never uh meant and I never said actually that I support uh the violence against civilian people uh both Israelis and Palestinians any any attack on any civilian and innocent people is Attack on all of us in fact as a Muslim I believe hurt hurting and harming civilians is antithetical to my belief as a Muslim my values and also my position as as a Palestinian as Muslim and also as a leader of the largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization what I meant by that statement is there's an illegal blockade on the people of Gaza for 17 years the people of Gaza 2.3 million people are not allowed to move to leave uh that strip they cannot go and seek education they cannot go and seek medical help they cannot uh live their lives normally like anyone else on this planet why the Palestinians should be the exception that they should live in an open airp prison without having the right to be free so when I say I was happy I meant that regular Palestinian residents walked free in the land that was ethnically cleansed he had has there ever been a moment where you saw the divisions exploding on college campuses exploding we learning even among the White House staff inside companies of people on both sides of the line that are that are not that are feeling pain but using this moment to move their agendas has there been any time like this in your past this is the worst time I've I've ever seen uh both in communities and on campus uh people should have the right to freely Express their views no matter how how much you disagree with them in a civil society in a peaceful uh environment where we are equal under the law we can exchange views and colleges universities and schools should be a safe place for learning exchanging ideas and even debating ideas but to silence people because of their views is antithetical to democracy and should not be allowed to take place as we have seen students have been silenced have been suspended student organizations have been deactivated and cancelled and this is a a serious attack on Americans right to freely Express themselves the right to have an assembly and and and speak through to power it's an American tradition to silence people who oppose the government our government in its approach to this flawed foreign policy is is is harmful to our democracy uh the more conversation the more debates we have the more enlightened we'll be and hopefully we will be equipped to be a force for good to establish peace and prevent conflicts and oppression from taking place as we have seen Steve what what I have seen also this is a new phenomenon young Jewish Americans are are are rising and speaking up their minds in protest of the Israeli government and its aparte nature they are protesting the White House's approach to what's taking place uh against Gaza and these voices are new and fresh when I when I say new they're not like very very new but they have been really transforming themselves and reading researching exchanging views with other people and they have taken a stand there are so many Americans who are learning more about what's taking place against uh uh the Palestinians both in the West Bank and Gaza and they are taking a stance in fact 66% of the American public believe that this government our government should call for a permanent ceasefire however unfortunately only 7% of members of Congress are heing the call so you know question to members of Congress why are why aren't you listening to the American public I mean they elected you they paid for your salaries no other group of people why don't you heit the call and end this uh genocide that's taking place against the Palestinian people on some college campuses we had a very dramatic hearing uh in congress with three presidents of us universities MIT Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania and since that hearing some of these University presidents have walked back their defense of speech in the sense that they were asked if uh people are calling for a genocide against Jews what would they do about that and these uh University presidents said they have a standard of free speech that has to tolerate that and so I'm interested in whether we need to have a better debate about what constructive and fair and civil debate that's maybe deeply felt is or whether we have to from your perspective tolerate those that are calling for a genocide of Jews which I find outrageous of course we we should take a very very firm and clear stands against any call even for violence against innocent people let alone a genocide against people because of who they are I mean this is abhorent but also this is what Israel is doing to the Palestinian people Steve what what's new is more Americans are learning about what's going on and they are taking a stance and I think the biggest fear Israel has is an informed American public and that's why the Israeli propaganda machine is just working hard day in and day out you know with all the sophistication but their narrative is falling apart in front of the images of children being uh bodies of children being pulled from the rubble of houses of residential buildings you know um families being wiped out um the total Destruction the the the the the the blockade preventing the Palestinians even to have water electricity fuel in this brutal weather now in Gaza half of the the the population are are homeless basically now so people are are seeing this and there is no censorship if the mainstream media decided not to show those images Amica the American people are smarter than that they are there on social media and they see the reality on the ground and they are taking a stand and you know so uh but that should not be misconstrued with the right of people to live free and also to push back against the Israeli genocidal policy I mean if there's any pressure it should be against this Administration that has given the green light for the state of Israel to do what it did in violation of all International laws and and Universal values and even America's claims to be the the the beacon of freedom and and the champ champion of Human Rights especially this Administration who claimed that it will Center Human Rights in its foreign policy agenda we don't see any of that we see total dehumanization of the Palestinians we we see dismissing dismissal of their suffering and we see that they are giving Israel no red lines and now this Administration they feel the pressure and the abandonment of the Arab and American Muslim communities uh um support for for Biden and that's why we started to see a shift in tone not because the you know all of a sudden they care about the Palestinians and the tall death tall and the injured and so on but now they started to feel that you know their their their their approval rating is dropping especially among Young Americans who see that this is a genocide taking place with the support Armament and let me ask you about that let me ask you about the collapse of that support in Youth and if you pull um Muslim Americans today their support for president Biden has uh eroded quite significantly as well my question to you when they say we're not going to support Joe Biden in 2024 the alternative if things go the way they look today is Donald Trump do they really believe that Donald Trump will be better in this equation than Joe Biden people should not scare the those who are angry with this Administration about the alternative in fact this Administration should be terrified uh from their own behavior from their decision and break away from their own base and correct and have a shift in their policy before it's too late is your is it your sense that the power of the American Muslim and Arab Community is going to have greater Traction in this election than I mean I just am trying to understand the political footprint the political sway this community has what is your sense of it absolutely Steve uh Michigan uh uh you have a sizable Community they are swing voters they are the ones who basically decide this where would the state go uh you know for for for which candidate and they have done it numerous times uh Georgia uh the former president was looking for about 12,000 votes the Muslim Community has more than 60,000 votes right uh Wisconsin There's a SI Muslim Community Ohio excuse me even in Florida uh Nevada there are sizable Muslim communities that is organized including Arizona and this Muslim Community is now fired up uh so if this President is serious about not losing them maybe it's not too late for him to reconsider uh so yes they they are very motivated they are organizing and uh they do not have a short memory and they will not be emotional in their approach uh to do the responsible thing but they want to let this Administration and anyone who has taken the community for granted that they should think twice before they keep thinking the way they are now niad I am appalled by what I've read are some horrific um anti-semitic attacks and also Islamic phobic attacks I'm I'm am appalled by some behaviors that have been out there about people expressing views that I would consider constructive not flamb boying or outrageous losing their job jobs um essentially being quote unquote cancelled on both sides of this equation candidly and and I'm interested in the many requests my understanding is that care has received over 2,000 requests for assistance and as you have dived down in these can you give us a quick snapshot and it's probably not fair to give it a snap quick snapshot but of what these people are feeling inside the United States in their communities in their workplaces in their schools what's going on what's the temperature from the first week of October until October 2nd which is almost like a um let's say uh this period of time uh we have received uh 2,171 you mean December 2nd yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah yeah until December 2nd we've received the uh 2,171 complaints and requests for help and that's like uh 17 22% uh covering the same two months of last year uh so it is it is a skyrocketing and significant increase in the cases and this is unprecedented these cases 34% of them represent uh stifling and suppressing uh free speech with on college campuses in universities and schools uh you know uh disbanding uh School organizations from expressing support of the Palestinians or even expressing uh opposition to the Israeli policies or even this Administration and that's really it should be a red flag for all Americans when they see this significant attack on Free Speech uh for for Americans to express themselves 22% uh represent uh complaints from employment so many people lost their their jobs they were fired or their uh job offers have been rescinded um CEOs of uh uh corporations weaponized islamophobia and and and and anti Palestinian Feelings by sending emails uh we stand with Israel uh uh so that really created one-sided uh position on on what's taking place in Palestine a completely unfair and created a hostile work environment for for tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of of employees um and some of them tested these statements and they have been fired uh without any justification we have seen about 177% of these uh 2,171 related to hate crimes and hate speech we have seen the case of Wadi fi the six-year-old Palestinian in suburb Chicago uh who was stabbed to death 26 times and his mother was stabbed 12 times she survived um we've seen in ber Burlington uh um Vermont the three Palestinian students who were shot um and injured uh one of them is now paralyzed from the neck down we've seen many complaints like this one many incidents and this is very terrifying and and Steve this is not unrelated or disconnected with what's taking place in in in the West Bank uh today uh the the dehumanization of the Palestinians is completely related to the attacks on the Palestinian community in the United States because you have so many elected officials and media so you're talking about settlers the settlers in the West Bank attacking Palestinian residents in the West Bank yeah yeah but also but also here uh so many elected officials uh and and and and commentators uh you know have have dehumanized the Palestinians and they have been just ifying what's taking place in in in you know against Gaza and that is connected to the impact of islamophobia and anti Palestinian sentiment in this country so so this is this is really making American Muslims and Palestinians and even Pro Palestine supporters in in this country unsafe uh unprotected and it's a very dangerous environment nead I have watched you over many years um be attacked and yet you still still call for constructive dialogue you're willing to sit down with people but you know as the uh uh president of Harvard said regrettably you know she she felt sorry for what she had said words matter what is your experience I want to ask this very carefully we're at War there are people on both sides the Israeli side those victims uh family members of those attacked the nation on October 7th and now just so many uh in Palestine as they've seen as you said children women others killed that are innocent of this conflict what is your advice to people in a time of rage and frustration and anger about words and how you get from this moment to the other side where you hopefully get to something that will eventually have to sort this out and get to a different moment and equilibrium that hopefully has more Justice baked in into it for the Palestinians but what is your advice on words I think uh people should be mindful of the humanity of each other eventually we are brothers and sisters in human we are equal in the eyes of God and we should be equal in the eyes of each other and we have to treat each other with dignity and respect we should not allow any sense of superiority false sense of superiority to become policy and behavior and to inflict suffering and pain on other people just because they don't believe The Way We Believe or their culture is different or their language is different or their background is different if we fail to align ourselves with universal values of dignity and respect for all and justice for all we will be dehumanizing other people and dehumanization is the first step towards genocide Jews have gone through this experience in Europe in many places and the Palestinians are going through this now in Palestine we need political leaders not to exploit the Visions no matter how legitimate or illegitimate to pass their political agenda such as Netanyahu who's been tried and accused of corruption and overthrowing uh the the legal system in Israel right the moment this this war is done he might be arrested and he will lose his job we want our Administration to be responsible God Bless America with strength with resources we should use these resources not to divide people not to establish colonies and reinforce colonies we have to use these resources that God blessed us with it and the American people who gave us their hard earned money in terms of taxpayers we should trust uh or be we are usted with these resources we should use them to establish peace and equality among people we should not reinforce occupations and upar tide and we should stop dehumanizing the the Palestinian people we should bring Israelis and Palestinians to the same table and ask them to reconcile their narratives and sit for a genuine peace because everyone wants to live in peace but you cannot live in peace if your neighbor is not in peace and if you look at at at your neighbor as a subhuman and you can exploit them and you can subjugate them just because you think that somehow you are promised something that was never promised to you I mean we have to decouple conflicts from religious dogma and just be serious human beings and treat people people with dignity and respect even if it hurts us to give power and influence because that's what Humanity requires us to do well Awad co-founder and executive director of the Council on American Islamic relations I really appreciate you joining us today thank you thank you so what's the bottom line Palestine and Israel have ripped open deep fissures between communities inside the United States businesses universities media organizations even the White House and the Pentagon they're all divided over narratives they bring to the crisis islamophobia is surging and so is anti-Semitism these are emotional and complicated issues and we're seeing some folks become Vigilantes trying to curtail the rights and the speech of others While others are using America's Free Speech standard to utter outrageous and irresponsible claims and aspirations there's just no neat way out of this the sad truth is that we're seeing so Much Death and destruction in Gaza and it will be a long time before conditions move to a more constructive tone and conversation we're just a long way from that moment in my view and sadly that's the bottom line
