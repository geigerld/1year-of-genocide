we were at the hospital as usual we never left at all we never even thought of quitting on our patients and the injured people 4 days ago we were taken by surprise when the Israeli military besieged the hospital they would not allow anyone inside we stayed to care for the lives of our patients we had 14 patients who we continued to give Medical Care to then today at 3:00 the Israeli Army forced nearly all of us from the hospital the patients remained inside with four medical staff and two paramedics to care for them all of us have been ordered to leave the hospital and keep walking towards West Gaza we are walking till we reach a safe area and to find shelter we want to reach a safe place and to shelter the medical staff who remained at Al ala hospital since October 7th until now they never left and now their homes are destroyed and they have nowhere to go we have sent several appeals to the W to the Red Cross and to our partners with Doctors Without Borders to intervene to protect the patients they all promis to intervene and to talk to the occupation forces to prevent targeting the hospital the patients and not to Target the medical staff but I haven't seen anything done from here from this street I appeal to all International organizations and all medical related officials especially the wh calling upon them to intervene to protect what remains of the hospital the patients in the hospital and the medical staff who refuse to leave and continue to care for those patients make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
