well let's bring in now Sophie or Sophie is supposed to enlist in the Israeli Army but is refusing to do so she joins us from parades Hannah in Israel good to have you with us so first of all let me ask you why did you take the decision that to refuse to enlist well I made the decision to refuse Before the War I made that decision because I refused to take part in the idf's violent policies of Oppression and apartheid and to be part of this endless cycle of Bloodshed I choose to refuse because there is no military solution to a political problem and now with the war that has become more apparent than ever and so my refusal is more important to me than ever and I choose to refuse in a very public way in hope to reach the Israeli Society especially young people to show them that refusing is an option and that peace is an option the only option because there are 7even million Palestinians here and 7 million Israeli Jews here and no one is going anywhere are you worried about how receptive the public will be to your message given the militarization of society given the push to the right that's going on uh indeed Israeli Society is an extremely militaristic one and refusing is absolutely not an accepted thing and I am called The Traitor a self-hating Jew I get wishes for me to be raped or killed and since the war started it has gotten worse there has been a shift to the right and the right was already strong and there also was been a repression of activists in the radical left especially H Palestinians with Israeli citizenship but also Israeli Jews so I am worried but it's worth it because even if only one person is going to hear my words and they will make them think then it's worth it and I'm willing to to endure the consequences of that given everything you've just said and the sort of calls that you're facing it must take a lot of conviction to take the position you've taken How concerned are you about the prospect of facing almost an endless cycle of Court appearances and jail terms right that's what you could be looking at uh I am concerned of course it's a scary experience H but I do have the support of the MV Network which also supports stal mnik that was just sent to prison and they accompany us on this process and it does help a lot but of course it's scary and we I don't know how much time and it can be different now with the war because the political sphere in Israel has changed and gone in a dramatic shift uh to the right but as I said before I'm concerned but it is worth it and I stand with my decisions and my morals all the way well since your decision of course that a war has started and there have been reports by multiple Israeli as well as international human rights groups been statements by un experts 36 in fact on November the 16th talking about a genocide in the making going on has that strengthened your resolve that this is not something you want to be associated with and how is how is that playing out with others and definitely for me the war has only made my decision I may made me more sure in my decision and the war in Gaza is horrible it causes horrible destruction and death and it can never be justified the same way that the massacre on October 7th can never be justified and it's unrelenting and it leads us nowhere but in to most people in Israel the war changed them in the opposite direction and there has been a shift to the right and young people in Israel in general H in contrast to the rest of the world tend to be more right-wing so it hasn't really made other people not want to associate themselves with it and it's why I want to refuse to show them that there are reasons to not want to be associated with the IDF and with that war Sophie how much of the war do Israelis actually see how much of the civilian suffering do they see I think that Israelis know the least about what's going on in Gaza in the entire world H the media in Israel does not show uh this civilian the civilian damage and deaths and destruction uh which the the IDF in general tries to present itself a lot of the time as the most moral army in the world um you can see it on social media because there are Israeli soldiers that post proudly videos from Gaza horrible videos so it can be seen but most people won't see it in mainstream media and also don't want to see it because people want to feel that they are in the right and that they are supporting a a right cause and that it's only self-defense and that they don't have a choice so definitely don't see a lot of it okay thank you so much sopy all for taking the time to come and talk with us appreciate it
