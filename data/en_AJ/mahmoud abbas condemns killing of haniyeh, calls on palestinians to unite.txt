statement now from the Palestinian president mmud Abbas he's released a statement online saying he strongly condemns the assassination uh as a cowardly act and a dangerous development he also called on Palestinians to unite and be patient and steadfast in the face of Israeli occupation Al jaer nuro joins us live again from rala that's in the occupied West Bank so no we've got that response um from the Palestinian president marad Abbas tell us a bit more about what he's been saying uh and and and the official PA response yes well the Palestinian president uh wasting no time to issue that statement calling this a cowardly act a political assassination and also treating uh isma Han as a senior um National political figure not just as a senior figure or the head of the Hamas political Wing we heard those same uh sentiments echoed by the Secretary General of the pl's executive committee hin and we also heard from all Palestinian factions declaring a general strike across the occupied uh West Bank this is a moment uh where you know all political differences are set aside and Palestinians who've seen and experienced political assassinations in the past decades know very well that uh targeting or singaling out one faction does not mean that anyone is immune and they've seen that uh work out you know play out uh throughout the past decade so a moment a very somber moment very um sad moment for Palestinians the public opinion here views is Han as a very prominent very influential political figure one that represents a you know a a front a different front from the more acquiescent the more willing to talk a um and perhaps even you know be subjected to outside dictates the expectation of course is that this attack this assassination would give rise and would strengthen the more Hardline positions in Palestinian politics Palestinians see that Israel has a zero some approach to the events going on right now and to the war in Gaza they are not just targeting military figures in Gaza they're targeting the head of the Hamas movement someone who's known to be a purely political figure someone who's known to be pragmatic willing to talk trying to open Pathways to dialogue around the world uh visiting various capitals we've already heard from the foreign Ministry of turkey and uh Russia commenting about this uh assassination so that gives you an idea of the kind of Engagement is Han had on the world stage as well yeah no and it's important um you talking about the issue of Palestinian Unity at this at this specific moment abas talking about Palestinians coming together putting political differences aside for now anyway I mean so so how significant is his death then and what does this mean then for Palestinian Unity given those divisions that you've talked about between Hamas and fat well it would present an opportunity uh one might dare say for Palestinian factions to find a different path forward we know that over the past 17 years Palestinian factions have failed to uh put aside their differences to reach a Unity agreement and to unify their political system there was a recent attempt in Beijing uh a declaration was issued about the need to form a consensus government and to work towards um holding elections and and renewing the Palestinian political system uh once the war on Gaza is over but there was very little expectation that that declaration would be translated into action this assassin might give all all actors an opportunity to kind of move forward and rise to the occasion uh uh if you will of course everybody has to wait for the mechanisms within Hamas to kick uh uh to come into play to replace uh through their own mechanisms is hania the head of the political the polit bureau the political wing of the movement uh but certainly an opportunity for a different path forward no let me get a final thought from you um because I think this kind of encompasses all of what we've been talking about all morning I mean despite the political differences does this do you think Harden the resolve of Palestinians across the occupied territories Gaza and the West Bank yes you know one of the ironies of the Palestinian of Palestinian politics is that politicians are fractured public opinion and the public wider public isn't there is consensus among Palestinians that the Only Way Forward is Unity that the only way forward is to defend against what Palestinians view as an existential Threat by Israel by way of either genocide direct genocide in Gaza or ethnic cleansing and land grab here in the occupied West backck and c and certainly the barring of the right of return for Palestinians in Exile so um that's why I was talking about an opportunity for politicians to kind of redeem themselves and join the and file of Palestinian public opinion that wants to see a unified political system you know in confrontation uh or in defense uh uh for of Palestinian existence and and in defiance of the Israeli agenda that seems to only want absolute surrender from Palestinians rather than dialogue or a political solution at this point all right nor de live for us there uh in rala in the occupied West Bank
