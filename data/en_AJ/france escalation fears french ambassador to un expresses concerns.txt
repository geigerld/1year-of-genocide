this crisis in Gaza started almost 3 months ago October 7 and we have managed until now not to resolve the crisis but at least to avoid a spill over uh in the region when the West Bank and Lebanon and uh this is what we need to continue to do on day one president mcon Frome Minister Kona worked very hard tirelessly to convince Regional stakeholders to avoid Reg conflagration uh linked to the crisis in Gaza and to a certain extent we manag to succeed and to get there so uh you mentioned the events in Beirut earlier today uh France will continue to encourage all sides to avoid escalations and uh and to focus on the situation in Gaza to make sure that we can have a progress on the ground uh sustainable cation of hostilities resumption of talks humanitarian relief release of all hostages etc etc those assassinations that took place in Beirut are they a breach of the UN Charter is this a breach of lebanon's sovereignty and territorial Integrity well uh I don't have to comment on that I think it remains unclear uh what we need to do again is to avoid uh spillover effect uh we need to avoid uh conflict between Israel and Lebanon uh we need to make sure that the situation in the southern part of leanon remains calm we need to make sure that unifil which is the UN pko which is deployed there since 1978 can fulfill its mandate and uh and nobody needs a new front in this region of course you're talking about escalation we've got escalation potentially in other places as well look at what's going on in the Red Sea I believe you're now calling a security council meeting in in the coming hours on that how worried is France particularly now as we know there's a there's an Iranian warship that's now patrolling the area well uh we are very concerned with the situation in the Red Sea France had joined the condemnation of these attacks on on day one uh as you rightly said James the security Council will discuss this issue tomorrow afternoon uh 300 p.m. in this chamber and uh we need to do whatever it takes to secure Maritime safety it's essential I think nobody wants to see so escalation in the Red Sea and uh uh the r is uh absolutely uh vital for transportation of goods people energy uh humanitarian Goods Etc so I think we uh need to secure Maritime safety in the Red Sea and everywhere let's get to Gaza itself where there's this dire humanitarian situation where so many people have been killed more than 20,000 half of those are children France has control of the security Council in terms of being the president for the next month are you going to push for another resolution and do you see any change in the US position because the US of course are the ones blocking this with their veto well uh we need to see progress uh on on this file of course uh the humanitarian situations remains absolutely dire the security Council adopted two resolution on humanitarian dimension of this crisis and uh to be honest with you implementation of this resolution is not there the needs remains and uh and of course uh it's good to see the security Council addressing the humanit situation in Gaza but we need to do more than addressing the symptoms of this crisis and this is why France has been urging all Security Council Members to support a sustainable session of hos fa ities in Gaza uh because this is what we need for the people for humanitarian access what we need above all is a a full protection of civilians okay well let me let me press you on that there isn't protection of civilians right now is Israel acting illegally in France's view in what it's doing now because South Africa is taking it to the international court of justice in the hay under the genocide convention do you agree with that action for example what uh we recognize is the right of Israel to defend itself uh everybody should remember that on October 6 the situation in Gaza was Cal and amas decided to attack Israel to kill 1,200 Jews to rape women in a monstrous manner Crim but has its response being legitimate self-defense or is or is are these war crimes yeah uh what is uh legitimate is to make sure that you're not the victim anymore from terrorist attack it has been a terrorist attack and Hamas has acted as a terrorist movement and Israel has a right to defend itself to make sure that its people are safe that this kind of terrorist attack do not happen again so my point is that everything which has to do with self-defense and avoiding repetition of these attacks is an view acceptable and legitimate what should be avoided what is not acceptable is a violation of the Geneva conventions and uh violation of the law of the war of international humanitarian law so going after the fighters from Hamas is okay of course going after civilians women children Elders is not it's clear there should be a clear distinctions make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
