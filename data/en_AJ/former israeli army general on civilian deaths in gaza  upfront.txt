General Yakov Amador thank you so much for joining me on up front thank you very much for inviting me uh after the October 7th attacks Israel launched a devastating counter offensive in Gaza uh it caused unprecedented levels of Destruction and of course civilian deaths now one of the great concerns from the International Community from Human Rights organizations and indeed from other nations has been that Israel has not followed the rules of War particularly this question of proportionality right now uh for every uh Hamas Soldier killed there have been at least two civilians in Gaza killed does that seem like an acceptable ratio no it's not acceptable and this is why we think that Hamas is making a um crimes crimes against humanity by fighting within uh civilian population something that not not allowed by the international law the fact that Hamas is using human shield women children and old people to defend itself by fighting from their houses and from their streets and don't let these people to go out of the area of the battlefield no question that it is a a crime against humanity and Hamas should be punished and even more than that we gave the population time uh to leave the area and we designated safe heavens and Hamas block the way to those safe Heavens so by that push the civilians into the battlefield so you're saying that Israel's killing of Palestinian civilians is a war crime committed by Hamas and not by Israel I mean you're you're basing that argument if I understand you correctly on the idea that Hamas is using human Shields now first that has not been proven by any human rights organization in fact even if what you're saying is true that doesn't absorb you of your responsibility to avoid killing civilian targets you can't just say Well they're hiding among civilians so we're going to kill civilians and you can't just say well it's hamas's fault okay uh first of all uh as you know and everyone can can see we found the Hamas operational centers and the hospitals in Gaza so if this is not a human shield don't know what human shield is we have pictures of Hamas that has not been that has not that hasn't been proven sir no I I don't I I my friends well it so I don't need your approvement um wait wait you haven't offered the world you you haven't offered the world any proof I want you to finish your answer but I just want to be clear for the audience's benefit that under international law uh to to to change the status of a hospital to a to a military Target the burden of proof is on Israel to demonstrate that it is a Hamas command CER it's not enough to say there's a Hamas fighter there it's not enough to say there's a few members of homas to change the status you got to prove that and you can't just say take my word for it I just for clarity sake where's the evidence who's who who's who's who has who has proven this please let me answer the answer we found under the hospitals Center of command of of Hamas and if you want pictures you can ask the spokesman of the IDE we sent you many of them we found weapon systems under the hospital and we know for sure that at least one hospit was killed in the hospital by Hamas um people the it's not the only Hospital under which there are Commander commands and control headquarters of Hamas we have pictures of Hamas people going with children around them so we can we cannot kill them if you want the picture I will send you and the fact and please and the fact you don't don't I I I'm not I know that you will not show it know your your network you will not show it anyhow um and the fact that we are killing civilians what is the alternative that we will not kill any civilian and we cannot fight Hamas because Hamas is is fighting from behind the the civilians so the alternative not to kill civilians meaning the meaning the Practical meaning of it is not to to kill Hamas it to let Hamas to rule the Gaza Street after this uh Declaration of more and atrocities and primitive and Barbarian action which was done by Hamas and you tell me General because they're hiding so nicely behind civilians and you cannot kill civilians so they will be immune uh we are not buying the logic and we will continue to destroy Hamas and if the payment will be paid by the civilians of Gaza they can apply to Hamas Hamas is there Hamas was elected by them and they can apply to Hamas and ask Hamas to fight to to stop the the wi by the way if they surrender immediately we will not kill any civilian uh 44% little more than 44% of the Palestinian people uh voted for Hamas as a plurality in 2006 about half of the Palestinian population right now is under 18 meaning that most people in Gaza absolutely did not vote for Hamas that's also just factually incorrect uh your vision of security rests upon a military strategy that as you've just described will inevitably kill citizens civilians and will lead to the destruction of more uh monuments more cultural sites more parts of Civil Society if all of this happens do you not worry that it will only ferment more resistance more violence more people who have antipathy towards the Israeli government I mean there are security and terrorism experts who actually caution this say that Israel's widespread killing of Palestinian civilians increases the risk of violent attacks against isra Israelis how do you respond to These Warnings that what you're doing that Israel's bombardment of Gaza will actually make Israel less secure I see that you don't don't remember the situation before the sth of October before the first sth of October there was a ceasefire Israel didn't to take Gaza Israel gave many uh people from Gaza to come to walk in Israel is gave um economic help to go into Gaza not many people but sure you don't let me to ask the question but I can't allow you to say things that aren't true less than 1% of the of the of the gazin population had work permits what was the number of of Gins who could work in Israel I'll give you the number 18,000 people right there are 2.2 million people in Gaza that's not a large number most people in Gaza cannot leave or cannot enter or leave did they say huge I I I never said you percentage I said Israel try to help to promote the economy of Gaza by letting 1% of people come in okay go ahead please finish did you finish the statistics which is not true what's what's children are not going to children are not going to walk in Israel women are are not going to go to go to to walk in Israel the the the only man after the age of 24 or 30 so with all the resp your statistic please please correct your statistic I I do not have connection to the reality but let me answer stop me again and again that's because you You' once again said respectfully sir you've once again said something that's untrue factually but I'll allow you to continue no well it's true I didn't say it's a high percent I say 18,000 people from Gaza went out every day to walk in his this is a number if it's you say that it is too little maybe should we give more people to walk in Israel without the atrocities and the violation of the ceasefire byas probably today we had with 25,000 I don't know probably because that was the intention of Israel to give more workers to go out of Gaza and to walk in Israel and we gave all the permission to Qatar and other countries to bring money to G and the Palestinian Authority sent money to Gaza because our interest was to promote the economy of Gaza because people believed in Israel huge mistake that Hamas has some responsibility for the people of Gaza and by promoting the economy well pushing away the plan of Hamas to attack Israel we made a mistake Hamas did didn't care about his people Hamas initiated the war in Israel declare a war and by butchering thousands civilians women babies and ring women as well so we decided that it is not an option anymore we don't have any obligation towards Gaza around relating to the civilian life of these people they can apply to Hamas we gave them all the opportunities uh Hamas decided to initiate a war against Israel Hamas will pay the price okay again I I wanted you to finish before I I offer this correction under international law Israel actually does have a responsib ability and a duty to the gazan citizens do you disagree with that yes I disagree because we are not conquering Gaza we took 2006 all the Israelis out of Gaza no one soldier in Gaza no one civilian in Gaza n no Israeli who control who controls the border of Gaza who who controls the border of Gaza Egypt you talking you're talking about the Rafa border what I'm saying is is that is that Israel controls or border basically is Israel has redeployed its troops in 2006 from inside of Gaza to the periphery of Gaza Israel controls what goes into Gaza and what comes out of Gaza Israel controls the population registry Israel controls the the the the the flow of people and the flow of money Israel controls Gaza by land air and sea is anything that I just said untrue yes which part everything that you said is not is not true Israel does not control the population registry of of of Gaza no isra doesn't control the flow of goods in and out of Gaza no Israel does not have any military presence on the border of of Gaza between Israel and Gaza but not between Gaza and Egypt they can move through Egypt whenever they want whatever they want they can bring okay you're you're you're go can go it's very easy you car you take a car you go through Rafa you go to Cairo and you take the plan and you go to Europe we don't stop them okay sir I think the International Community will be surprised when they hear your word saying that Israel does not control again the the the the borders the population registry the electromagnetic sphere every part of Gaza but that that's up for the International Community to side when they watch this interview uh let let me take you don't it's a fact on if someone from Gaza wants to go out they can go to Rafa if the Egyptians will let him I don't know the Egyptians we let them but it's not in Israel it's not in Israel respectfully sir a STW man no one is disputing that Egypt has control over the Rafa border what was that issue here was whether or not in 2006 Israel left Gaza or whether they simply redeployed their troops in such a way that they still control again the flow of goods the flow of people the the the the electromagnetic sphere the population registry every part of of Gaz and life is still functionally controlled and occupied by Israel which is why the International Community international law suggests that Israel still maintains effective control over Gaza but we can agree to disagree I I I want to move on to another question here if Israel does succeed in its aim of dismantling if Israel does succeed in its aim of dismantling or as prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said eliminating Hamas what will happen next in Gaza first of all I think that you don't give your audience the real situation um on the ground the real situation on the ground that Israel does not control what's coming in and out from Egypt into the Gaza Street the border between Gaza and Egypt is controlled by Egypt not by Israel only respect but Egypt doesn't occupy Egypt doesn't OCC Egypt doesn't occupy Gaza Egypt hasn't had control of Gaza in five decades we don't occupy Gaza as well we don't control anything inside Gaza we are not in Gaza if you see a situation of 500 kilometer of tunnels under Gaza if we were in I mean ridiculous story you tell here you you believe that we would have allow Hamas to build its military capability if you wear in Gaza it's license with all the respect again I'm not disputing that you're in Gaza I'm asserting that you redeploy troops from from in Gaza in 2005 at the end of the year to the border and and you control it effectively by controlling what goes in and out so I agree with you that you're not in Gaza the point is it's an effective control by how you manage the perimeter but again we can agree to disagree on that the world can make its own determination this is this is an empirical matter no no we are not controlling the perimeter of Gaza when it is coming to the border between Gaza and Egypt we are controlling the border between Israel and Gaza but not between Gaza and Egypt sir if we were to pull out a map you will understand that the majority of you you you will understand that the bulk of the border is is not with Rafa is not with Egypt the bulk of the border that gazin engaged is where with Israel that's number one and number two Egypt does not assert military and governmental control over Gaza not in five decades so again to pretend that somehow you're not responsible for what happens to Gaza when you continue to maintain effective control as per every human rights organization as per international law we see that this is an obvious fact and you seem to be denying it but we don't have to agree on this fact I'd like to move on so that I can get an answer to my question which was no I don't want to move on no I I'm not going to move on sir I sir sir sir I because you are lying no you are lying you know you know that is fine sir sir sir let's move on to another question I don't move to another question fine you don't have sir I respect that sir me the B between Israel and Gaza is not control Egypt and Gaza I understand you made your point Sir Sir you made your point sir you've made your point if you're saying that you're not willing to move on unless I agree with you that Israel doesn't control Gaza then we can't continue because that's not a fact and I won't and I I refuse to acknowledge something that's not true is is not control Gaza isra is not you've made your point are you willing to move to another question or do you want to are you willing to move to another question yes okay you just admit that Israel is not control God then you get your own okay well I'm not okay sir okay sir so sir understood so sir I'm not going to admit that Israel doesn't control Gaza so I'm going to thank you for your time and I appreciate you joining us on up front have a good
