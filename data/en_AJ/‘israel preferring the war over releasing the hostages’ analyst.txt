thousands of protesters have gathered in Tel Aviv to express their anger at the Israeli government and to demand the removal of prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu family members of those killed on October the 7th also attended they blame the government for security failures ahead of the attack by Hamas activists gathered under a large sign that read bring them home referring to captives held in Gaza Bernard Smith was at the demonstration relatives and Friends of supporters of the captives in Gaza are here every night but on a Saturday night it's the main one and this is the 12th Shabbat as Israelis call it that they've had to do this now of course last Saturday all the hope and the talk was about the prospects for a possible ceasefire we know we were talking about how uh caty American and Israeli officials had met on one side how representatives from Hamas have met Egyptian security officials uh in Cairo and how there was a suggestion that Israel was offering a onewe ceasefire in return for about 40 captives particularly women the elderly and the sick and how Hamas was demanding a complete ceasefire a cessation of all hostilities before they would go any further well it's gone pretty quiet since then we've not heard much in recent days and there is enormous frustration from the relatives and the friends here we people have been talking about how they want them released now we've had one former uh Army Admiral in the Navy saying that we should propose a prisoner release that Hamas will not turn down every day is a nightmare for the captives and of course the psychological fear that their relatives or friends are dying in Gaza at least six captives have been reported dead this week there's no proof of their death but those are the reports coming from Gaz and it scares people well Gideon Levy is a columnist at the newspaper haret joins us now live from Tel Aviv good to have you with us let's start with the spike in the casualty toll and the death toll of Israeli soldiers in Gaza what kind of impact is that having on public opinion there it is growing but it doesn't have yet an impact on the support of the vast majority of Israelis in continuing this War uh when we speak about the culties I I cannot prevent saying something personal in this weekend there were 600 Palestinian killed in Gaza so 13 soldiers is a hell of a price for Israel but let's not lose proportion 600 people in Gaza in this weekend is a big number indeed Gideon we've seen protesters out on the streets in Israel the pressure no doubt is building on netan how long do you think it can last you see Sami the pressure is less than it seems from the outside I'm quite surprised that the pressure until now is limited we are after a year of a protest against Netanyahu and in those times it was much much bigger and stronger and more vocal and more influential there is a certain pressure concerning only one issue releasing the hostages all the rest is untouched I mean obviously the sacrifice of Gaza doesn't anybody in Israel but even losing soldiers which is so horrible for every family and every every individual is not a leverage right now for a growing process not yet no a protest going protest not yet the operation hasn't been able to release captives so far the only captives who have been released were done through a deal what's your overall analysis of the military operation is it failing to achieve its military objectives I never s so Sami from the beginning I thought that first of all Israel has to make a choice has to have its priorities either crashing Hamas will it mean whatever it means or releasing the hostages you cannot have them both and Israel misled the people the government the Army as if both are going hand to hand but that's not the case we are reaching a point in which it's very clear that Israel is preferring now continuing the war over releasing the hostages and this must be sa it's a very Cru choice but Gideon when we talk about crushing Hamas or releasing the captives they've achieved neither so far right they achieved very little for sure relatively to the price that it's being paid that was paid in terms of human lives destruction hatred out Israel all over the world I mean those all things will be counted after the war and evaluated after the war and the price is so heavy and the achievements so far are so done where do you think overall this strategy will lead will it lead to a situation where Israel will be for forced because of eventual buildup of external International pressure to end this campaign in Gaza without having released the captives without having destroyed Hamas and having lost a lot of global support but first of all Sami I don't see this pressure working until now because there is not a real pressure as long as the Americans are letting Israel continue the war and they are letting Israel continueing the war there is not a meaningful pressure over Israel yes the Americans pay their lip service in terms of try to kill as little civilians as you can very nice very human very liberal but Israel is continuing obviously totally ignoring this advice from the White House and I don't see a pressure when it will turn into a real pressure Israel will have to stop and very clear that this stage is not too far but the question s what comes next okay Israel will stop the the the fighting and then what Israel will withdraw from the Gaza Strip and leave it to become a Somalia who is going to replace the Israeli Army nobody in Israel has answers for this what do you make of the suggestions that Israel is working on establishing a buffer zone there has been discussion about that does that necessitate Israel leaving behind troops along the eastern and northern border of Gaza it's unbelievable how Israel never learns anything I mean we had this buffer zone for years in Lebanon in southern Lebanon it didn't help anything and and and it brought us to more and more Wars the problem in Gaza is that all Gaza is so narrow that that if you cut now a buff Zone what will be left for the 2.3 million people to leave and do we really believe that we will be more protected with a buffer zone after we build this this unbelievable barrier for billions of dollars which was supposed to guarantee Total Security to Israel nothing will guarantee security buffer zone another barrier under this the surface behind the surface above the Surface by the end of the day we have to get to any kind of a political settlement if not we will continue from war to war thank you very much G and leave for your thoughts on that thank you
