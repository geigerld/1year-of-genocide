a federal appeals court in California is hearing a lawsuit filed by a group of activists which accuses Joe Biden and his administration of complicity in Israel's genocide in Gaza now panel of Judges will hear arguments from Palestinian human rights groups who say Biden along with his secretaries of state and defense have failed to prevent the war and are providing support to Israel this case was dismissed in January but judges are now hearing an appeal against that earlier decision well for more on all of this Rob joins us now from outside the court in San Francisco Rob can you just outline exactly what this case is actually all about and what the arguments are on both sides here right well the this case goes back some months and was argued before a lower court in January at that time the uh plaintiffs representing uh several human rights organizations and Palestinian legal uh organizations argu that the United States and particularly President Biden secretary of state blinkin Secretary of Defense a Austin uh Austin were in violation of various us laws and treaties that prohibited the aiding and abetting genocide the judge in that case heard the uh the arguments and later issued a ruling saying that while he found that there was uh a factual basis for the claims of genocide and ab betting genocide on behalf of the on the part of the United States government uh he could not uh accept the case for jurisdictional reasons that is that there is a uh Doctrine in American legal law saying that judges cannot um uh counterman political Decisions by the executive branch and he said that this cons was considered a a political decision the uh plaintiffs then appealed that to the uh uh ninth circuit uh court of appeals here in San Francisco where they argued today uh that this was not in fact a political decision in the sense of whether a certain political uh or foreign policy matter was correct or incorrect or wise or unwise but rather that this was a matter simply of law that there is a law and are international treaties that the United States is pledged to adhere to and that the courts do in fact have a role in enforcing uh the law and so the judges uh did seem somewhat skeptical of this one judge saying well you were asking us basically to interfere in every aspect of US military uh uh operations overseas and what weapons can be used uh and sent to allies Etc uh but the the judges having heard all of this they've retired now they'll probably issue a a um a ruling but probably the close the the soonest they would would be a week or two I'd like to introduce now one of the uh people involved in this in in this this is Ahmed Abu F Ahmed please stand right here uh thank you very much you you represent Al Haw which is a Palestinian legal and human rights organization um if you could recap what the uh arguments are before the US Judiciary here uh on behalf of uh a case that making a case that that genocide is being committed in the US is implicit complicit no absolutely as as you said the our case Bas basically says that the uh Biden Administration specifically three defendants President Biden secary of State Lincoln and Secretary of Defense Austin are complicit in this genocide and uh are uh failing their duty to prevent genocide from taking place so there are two uh um issues that are at stake here us complicity and it's failure to prevent the genocide that is taking place uh this is the uh appeal hearing in the previous hearing um I think it was a historical moment for the first time we have the Palestinian people narrating their own struggle drawing on their experiences of NBA on what their grandparents experienced in 1948 being ethnically cleansed from their ancestoral land and their indigenous uh uh land for the first time also we heard from the Palestinians themselves not only about the Palestinians so I think the importance of this case is that the Palestinian have been speaking directly to the American people through their Democratic institutions through their Judiciary narrating what they're uh uh going through so for the first time um um we hear from the Palestinians not only about them which I think it's one of the many sins of us uh uh policy towards uh Palestine and Israel that always listens to what the Israelis are saying and it's it's always a distorted uh uh Virgin of of reality and now yes yes excuse me for interrupting you but I wanted to before our time is up uh you also have a a close personal stake or connection or tragedy yourself involved in this in so far as you have relatives in Gaza who have lost their lives can you tell us a little about that yes so I I I was born and raised in Gaza I spent the first 25 years uh of my life in Gaza um uh since the beginning of this genocide I lost over 82 members of of my family that's that also was part of my testimony so I was involved in this case as a representative of alhak one of the organizations that took this place to court but also as a legal expert and as an individual that suffered harm from uh uh this genocide and I think the the first hearing um um was very uh promising the the the judge heard all the testimonies allowed all the testimonies but unfortunately ruled uh um against dismissed the case based on the BL uh Doctrine which you just mentioned that the Judiciary cannot tell the executive branch how to decide on matters of foreign policy while this is true what we're saying here that the Judiciary should we're not asking the Judiciary to decide on a for policy matter but on a legal matter the US Administration is in violation of its International legal obligations under the genocide convention but also in violations of uh US law So what at stake now and I think the importance of this case is what does this system entail here in the US we we've always heard that the US system and the US democracy is built on this idea of chicks and bances if the Judiciary cannot hold the executive branch uh um accountable when they're violating International and us laws then what does that mean for the whole system so I think this is a challenge to American democracy thank you very much we'll have to leave it there Ahmed Abu Abu from alhak in the Palestinian human rights organization so as I mentioned the uh decision of this court this uh appeals court will probably not come immediately but we will be monitoring the uh case as it proceeds through the US system and unprecedented as uh Mr Abu F said an unprecedented opportunity for Palestinians to give their own testimony in the US courts back to you okay thanks so much Rob for all of that that's Rob Reynolds for us outside the courton San Francisco make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
