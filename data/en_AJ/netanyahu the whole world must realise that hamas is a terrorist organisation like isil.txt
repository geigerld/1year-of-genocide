should remain United at the level of the national Unity government and the people as well and I would like to extend all thanks to the members of the opposition who Contin to make maximum effort at the time before I thank all the families and all volunteers I would like also to thank each and every single Citizen and I thank all the people of Israel for coming together around one goal demonstrating bravery resolve and fortitude we are all in this battle one United Israel my fellow members of the KET we have many questions that was that were raised 10 days ago we started to implement some of the decisions handed down now we are focused on one goal to unite our ranks and March forward that's why we require resolve and fortitude simply for the reason that this Triumph needs time we must win we must Prevail we must Darkness what they went what what they wish to see is to annihilate the state of Israel they wish to bring the Middle East to the Dark Ages to the age of barbar the day of backwardness and barbarianism however as I said we should remain United around this goal to maintain the state of Israel we have witnessed many atrocities within the towns and villages in the Gaza envelope we also witnessed the young men and women who were slaughtered while celebrating the whole world must realize that is a terrorist organization just like Isis and as we United together against Isis we must come together to crush Hamas it is our war and if we are not United on the front this danger will reach to you I have also a message to Iran and and hasah do not test our will do not make the same mistake simply for the reason that the price you will pay this time will be much more higher the US president said it to you in English don't do it and I am telling you in Hebrew Beware of the state of Israel the state of Israel EX all thanks and appreciation to the United States President Biden the United Kingdom France and other world States Who Rose to our support members of kinet we are carrying out all the preparations for the war in the South and across the country we also will allow the delivery Aid to reach gas act we are united behind our soldiers security Personnel rescue crews I met with them in person they are brave Heroes is epitomizing the spirit of bravery and fortitude our soldiers are ready and they will continue to be so until we Crush our enemies totally and completely yesterday I met with the relatives of the kidnapped Israelis we sat for hours and I listened to them to all their stories I also listened to the audio recording more than one uh daughter was telling her mother to save her life we are committed before all those families to bring home our brothers and sisters the children who are Hamas you cannot imagine these feelings are Indescribable I visited one of the towns to the south of our there I visited one of the premises one of the homes had an exit the militants climbed through and killed those who were hiding I can imagine the feelings of horror these children have experienced our hearts go out to the families of the soldiers the families of the missing and the families of the injured how painful it is the pain is profound and in contrast our bravery and courage is more robust since the establishment of our state many attempts were made to wipe it out we have paid a price not paid by any people in the world in addition many CS were cried out for our Annihilation yet the difference today is that we have a very robust State Mighty Army and and United people with fortitude and this is what we are going to achieve we entered this war and we will Triumph we cannot stop until we achieve emphatic Triumph Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressing the winter session of the Israeli nesset the parliament which has just started uh Netanyahu was speaking there after the Israeli president Isaac kog he said the conditions for Israel's success is Unity he was talking about of course what he says is Israel's success in its war in Gaza he said we should remain United in the National Unity government but also we should remain United uh uh um across uh all of Israel with the people of Israel he also had a message to Iran saying do not test our will the price you will pay this time will be higher and uh that um the Israeli plans for Gaza will continue Tam kmud from the Doha Institute of Graduate Studies is here with us on aler to discuss this and all the other developments today in this Gaza war that Israel started some 10 days ago what did you make of what we heard from Netanyahu he insisted a lot on the word Unity because this has something this is something that's been lacking in Israel in the last few months but they've seemed to have come together after these recent events the attacks on um the attacks by Hamas on Israel question though is how long will will this Unity within Israel last that's a very good question fly I think it it all depends on the on what's coming for Gaza on the on the future and the conduct of the military operation in the Gaza Strip this is this is a prime minister who tries to project leadership in a time of Crisis stresses on Unity but of course he inhered a very problematic political Legacy a very differenz Society in Israel polarized society and of course that's the only message now he can deliver as a prime minister to his uh Parliament to the keset but also it's an indication I think that Lincoln's visit might not have achieved any concrete results on bringing ceasefire the fact that he's yes he's firm and he's threatening left and right again and he's saying we have the US support we have France's support the UK support and he's he's still threatening so this is a very defined prime minister and and the tone is is a war tone he's he's a he wants War so he's he's not I I I I don't see any shift or change in his discourse or even any softening of of of the war language and the war tone and that's that's worrying yeah but how I mean I and I see what what you're saying and I hear what you're saying but it's also difficult to see how he can back away from all that the language he had a week ago when the Hamas Hamas attack happened he has to deliver something to the Israeli people in in his view I imagine unfortunately I think yes is I mean military wise Israel I mean has all the intentions to go inside the G now you'll have different scenarios uh it all depends on the scale the scale of this operation uh if they go one kilo or five kilos or 10 kilos or re occup reoccupy the entire strip I I I really I don't know what's the scale of the operation but but he's he he's always a master tactic he's a he's he's a master politician he can always play with the language now he promised there will be a land in cursion land Invasion to the Gaza Strip yes they might go inside but not achieve any of the big goals but he can but what are the goals we don't even know what the goals are they've talked about eliminating Hamas completely which a lot of people have said is not achievable what are are the goals in Israeli Israeli eyes Israel's government eyes what would constitute and I hate to use this term what would constitute a mission accomplished for Israel okay let's imagine this scenario and that's for me a worst case scenario Israel invades the entire Gaza Strip destroys demolishes everything and then the moment it withdraws a Hamas fighter comes from one of the tunnels on the ground carrying a Palestinian flag with a clashing C would this be a victory to Israel so I don't know that's one scenario if they insist on achieving the declared goals they have so far insisted on for me that means one scenario it's the Israeli Army reoccupying the entire step and staying there for some long time and this is it's it's something I don't want to think even about its consequences it's going to be a a nightmare for Palestinians indeed thank you very much t for the moment Tam Kam
