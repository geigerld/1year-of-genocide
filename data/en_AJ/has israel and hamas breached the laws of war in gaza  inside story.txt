have the laws of war been breached in Gaza the killing of civilians and Collective punishment raises concerns as Israel bombs the strip so who will hold those responsible to account this is inside story hello there I'm James Bay Israel's devastating air strikes and blockade of Gaza after the surprise attack by Hamas have led to both sides being accused of violating International humanitarian law a un commission says it's collecting evidence of war crimes allegedly committed by Israel and Hamas Israel says it's observing international law the international criminal court can launch an investigation to determine whether casualties in Gaza and Israel are a violation but Israel doesn't recognize the ic's jurisdiction for nine consecutive days Gaza has shaken under Relentless Israeli strikes entire neighborhoods have been turned to Rubble after Israel dropped thousands of bombs these indiscriminate attacks on civilians violate article 25 of the hay conventions since Hamas killed 1,300 Israelis during its military offensive nearly 10 days ago the Israeli military has imposed a total Siege on Gaza The Enclave was already under a Land Air and sea blockade for 16 years Palestinians and Aid workers say a lack of food medicine Fuel and basic supplies has made the situation there catastrophic under the Fourth Geneva Convention Israel as the occupying power is prohibited from deporting or transferring part of the population from the land it occupies but last week Israel issued an ultimatum for 1.1 million Palestinians in the northern part of The Enclave to leave their homes we'll go to our panel of guests in a moment but first SE vson has this report from the ha with thousands of Civilian death and the situation in Gaza escalating calls for international Justice are growing and all eyes are here now on the international criminal court in the Haag but so far the a IC has not met any formal announcement that it will step up its investigation into possible war crimes committed by Israel or Hamas in 2021 the IC decided that it has jurisdiction over the occupied Palestinian territories even though Israel doesn't recognize the international criminal court numerous cases have been filed since then including the killing of Al jazer reporter Shireen Abu Akay who was killed by Israeli soldiers in 2022 but so far no progress has been announced let alone arrest warrants issued this is in contrast with what happened after Russia invaded Ukraine five days Days Later the prosecutor announced that he will start a former investigation and since then an arrest warrant against President Vladimir Putin has been issued a full blockade of Gaza is considered a war crime and possible genocide according to international law experts the ICC has denied or request for an interview step fasm for Inside Story in the [Music] hake let's bring in our guests in London we have Jeffrey Robertson founder of Dy Street chamber and former president of the war crimes Court in Sierra Leo Jeffrey was appointed by the UN as distinguished jurist member on its Justice Council in hia we have San Zahir human rights lawyer and legal adviser for the Civil Society Coalition for emergency and Arab society and in New York we have Mark galasco he's military adviser of the Dutch NGO pxs for Peace Mark was in Gaza during the operation cast LED that was the Israeli War in 2009 to investigate the conduct of War he also in instructs war crimes investigators at The Institute of international criminal investigations thank you all of you for joining us I want to start with you Jeffrey because the rules of law we hear all these terms IHL International humanitarian law loac La of arm conflict there's a Latin phrase just in Bellow and there's a thing that everyone I think has heard of but no one really quite understands all the details the Geneva conventions I'm going to ask you Jeffrey to start our conversation off give us the 90c verion what are the rules of of war the rules of law are not rules of war the rules of War have been with us for hundreds of years don't kill civilians don't kill don't rush to trial or execute enemies without Fair trial all don't kill a prisoner who surrenders they been rules of law for centuries in 1999 in what is called the Rome statute the rules of law were put in Fairly straightforward English they banned The Taking of hostages they banned the use of starvation as a tactic which seems to be going on now in Gaza they protected at all times civilians unless they got messed up in the war so they are the rules of War fairly clear je Jeffrey just just to be clear are these binding on every country and every armed group they are binding on countries that signed up to the international criminal court and that's 123 countries but they are not binding on Russia which commits war crimes every few hours in Ukraine they are not binding on America which refuses to sign uh in the fear that one day an American Soldier may be prosecuted in the ha and they are not binding on Israel which of course refuses to sign so they have uh a defect in that although we can say uh that Israel for example Russia is committing clearly committing a war crime Mr Putin is committing one clearly of aggression by invading Ukraine uh the problem of taking anyone to court and punishing them for that criminality and indeed that barbaric criminality when it comes to bombing civilians uh is limited and only if Mr Putin or some Air Force Commander who's bombed a a civilian residence is captured in Sweden or in Europe somewhere is there any Prospect of putting them on trial so you can say that war crimes have a catch as catch can quality about them only if you catch a war criminal outside his country that will protect him uh can war crimes be punished so San if I can come to you as we move to the specific region of the world we're talking about Israel and Palestine this very very long conflict there's an important thing I think before we talked about the details we' heard the background from Jeffrey on on the rules of War but Israel is seen legally as the occupying power what does that mean uh this means that since 1967 Israel is a abided by uh several obligations based on international law and the law of occupation which uh one of the most important and basic a regulation of them is basically to protect the civilians and to make distinction between civilians and combatants now in 2005 we all know that Israel disengaged from the Gaza Strip but it's still a a had an obligations based on IHL because of the fact that it imposed uh severe blockade since a few months after castled in 2007 and until today so Israel has obligations Israel is obligated to to protect civilians uh it is obligated to not to attack and not to violate all the articles that is that are included and anchored not only in the Rome statute but also in the Geneva conventions and in the heg regulation which put the basically the obligation on Israel not only to not hurt civilians but also not to uh uh attack infrastructures that give services for civilians such as electricity water fuel and when you look at the history from especially from the since the blockade was imposed until until now basically uh we see that Israel has controlled uh all these basic services and humanit on a on a very humanitarian minimum humanitarian level and even the Israeli Supreme Court in petitions that reached the Israeli Supreme Court to Supply uh more uh electricity more fuel to enable the freedom of movement in and out from Gaza even to the West Bank and not only in and out of Gaza a abroad we saw that the intervention by the Supreme Court was very very limited which also itself said that despite the disengagement Israel still have some minimum obligations based on IHL which let me bring in let me bring in Mark now if you if you if you may um Mark you have a different perspective on this you were in 2009 you were in Gaza you a war crimes investigator you're a former military officer before we talk about the specifics of what's happened in the last 10 days how easy or difficult is your work from a afar I would assume that the fact we now have social media we have so much more video and photo evidence that helps you a great deal well first let me just open by saying that we had pxs for peace are concerned with the civilian populations of both Israel and Gaza whether those are Israelis that are currently in Gaza as captives or if they're Palestinians or Israelis that are currently Under Fire on either side of the Border indeed social media has now become a part of the conflict and conflicts as we've seen not only in uh in the Israel Gaza situation but also looking at things such as Ukraine uh it one would think uh would assist in would assist war crimes investigators but in fact the preponderance of disinformation makes it very difficult you know I look to Belling cat for example which is an open- Source investigating organization in the United Kingdom and also air wars which is another NGO there uh that does open- Source investigations to try to determine whether or not civilians have been killed in conflicts and their work has been greatly Complicated by this preponderance of misinformation and disinformation but let's make make it very clear that both Hamas and Israel have positive obligations under international law the Geneva conventions to protect civilians whether they are in air strikes in the way that the air strikes are planned and conducted or if they are uh allowing Palestinians to flee uh to protect the Palestinians on the ground within Gaza these are obligations under international law and all parties are responsible for that Jeff let me take you now to the specific events of the last 10 days and first to October the 7th a carefully planned audacious attack by Hamas killed over 1,400 Israelis about 120 captives have been taken to Gaza are these war crimes yes clearly they are they are obscene examples of war crimes of killing civilians and capturing them and holding them as hostage this is an ongoing War crime and it gives Israel a right of self-defense to pursue them to capture them to put them on trial uh but there are limits obviously to that right in the time of an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth that you find in the Bible is long gone that seems to be in part the Israeli reaction and it's a wrong unethical reaction by so Jeffrey when you when you when you when you hear this Complete Siege blocking um all the electricity and water although they're allowing a little bit of water now back to south of Gaza Fu F fuel food medicine do you see that as collective punishment and is collective punishment in itself is that a war crime it is a war crime I could give you the there is a section of the Rome statute which precisely defines uh what our attempts at starvation at the end of the day uh is the war crime and the cutting off of crucial civilian supplies to keep civilians alive is a war crime the transporting of civilians outside the country is also a war crime at little noticed but it's there and it covers the American supported attempt to put the the a million or so gazans uh throw them out of the country by the small aperture in Egypt uh they that amounts to transporting a civilian population outside the state so uh yes there are a number of crimes that are in Prospect although it may be that America Mr blinken and Egypt and others are attempting to uh persuade the Israelis not to pursue it so we haven't got to the stage uh yet but we may in the next couple of days of criminal Behavior by way of starving uh the population or uh extraa the population out of their territory and in into the deserts of Egypt which seems to be one of the plans Mark um you are clearly watching what is going on in terms of the military um efforts by Israel you were there in 2009 this though is the deadliest Gaza War so far in fact 6,000 bombs in six days that's the last time the Israeli military published a statistic that's more than the number used by the US in its entire battle in against isil in raqa in Syria it's more used in six days than the US used in Afghanistan in a single year now does that give you the view that this is probably a war crime that they that they are just reigning bombs on the civilian population well look the uh obligation to protect civilians in conflict is a clear one and uh really the mark of a professional military is its ability to protect civilians while it is conducting offensive operations and if the Israeli Defense Forces believe that uh the laws of armed conflict at International humanitarian law is holding them back from their offensive operations then perhaps it shows that they do not uh concern themselves as much with the protection of civilians and the stopping of Civilian harm than they should look I I worked in the Pentagon during uh the Iraq War in 2003 and participated in many many dozens if not hundreds of air strikes and you have to understand the amount of work that goes into that into planning identifying and validating your target you once you have the target identified you also have to conduct a legal analysis the lawyers have to look at each individual Target and determine whether you can uh strike it with distinction meaning that you're going to hit a military object and not a civilian object and also proportionally all right so that the Damage Done whatever ever that damage may be is not so widespread that the civilian harm outweighs whatever military gain that you're going to get additionally militaries also conduct what's called a collateral damage estimation in which they try to ascertain how many civilians are going to be killed in each strike they do this beforehand this is a maab calculus that is all put together prior to each individual strike now when we look at the pace of operations in Gaza 6,000 air strikes in six days that's a thousand a day that is an incredibly High number of strikes for such a tiny area in in fact it's it's some you know somewhat akin to what the US military was doing in Iraq for the entire country during the Iraq War in 2003 now we're talking about a small postage damp so it does raise the question and concerns of whether or not the Israeli military is taking all feasible precautions to protect civilians in the air strikes and the air strikes have continued saan and as Jeffrey mentioned earlier on during this they've asked the population of the biggest Urban connation with in Gaza although it is a Hu hugely densely populated all all of the strip but the Gaza City and the north 1.1 million people initially in just 24 hours to move I mean is this a war crime I think that based on the international uh and the IHL Norms it clearly is amounted as a war crime because the most two important things I think this time uh with Israel's war on Gaza rather than when we were examining it in in the war during August 2014 are two most important things first of all the intent and the willingful of uh Israel and what its intent is in terms of the intention of what to destroy how to destroy what kind of uh uh a commands to give to civilians in Gaza where to move and also the results the massiveness of the killing of innocent people like just take the number uh not just about the 6,000 missile we are talking about uh eight days or nine days uh since October with at least 2,700 being killed in Gaza while more than 1,000 people who were women and children and we saw the attack on civilians when they were told to evacuate uh a South southbound so and when we see that there are at least 55 families that were killed in total all the family members so the massiveness and the intent and when we learn about when when we read and hear the intentions of Israeli officials of the minister of defense on how they are dealing these all of these are indicators in examining uh uh that the components of a war crime or even uh genocide because uh these uh articles in the Rome statute they are very clear they have very clear components other than examining the coll damage and distinct distinction distinc thing between civilians and and in combatants uh the Willing fullness and the intent are very much important to examine and unfortunately the responses and the statements from what we see and he together with the result like even un officials uh which I would like to refer to like Mrs Franchesca alanz who is the UN special repertoire on the occupied territories said that the massive killing of innocent is the thing that should be examined here to compare with the with the with the with the people that were killed or with the total number so far 2,700 while in more than one month or it was 50 days the attack on a Gaza in or operation on Gaza in August 2014 there were Jeffrey Jeffrey Jeffrey go on go on Jeffrey the evid is clear that war crimes have been committed we just see the statistics the numbers we can see on television children's bodies being brought out there is no question that war crimes are being committed if it's genocide that's an open question although there has to be genocidal intent and that's difficult to prove uh it could be that Israel will claim that it is going into Gaza to release those who are being held hostage or Jeffrey disarm Jeff Jeffrey on this evacuation order if you if I may just to be clear in international law because I think this is important if the Israeli military is about to intervene the sick the elderly the children those that can't move Israel will say they gave warning but it does it under international law does Israel still have an obligation to protect those people it's not a defense in international law to give warning what you are doing is transporting or ordering uh by way of backing up your order with guns rockets and airplanes you are forcing a civilian population out of the country you are forcing them first of all South and then through a Bol that may be a humanitarian Corridor if Mr blink succeeds or may not maybe closed so there's no way but the force is to leave your country and camp in the desert as refugees and that certainly uh is a war crime and many children many people who've got no connection with Hamas so although Israel has the right of self-defense that is not uh a right a license to kill or do anything other than conduct yourself with due regard to humanitarian principles Mark Mark if I could bring Mark in now as a war crimes investigator when you hear 24 Health Facilities including six hospitals damaged at least 23 ambulances targeted un sites 23 sites of the the UN agency that deals with the Palestinians damaged by air strikes are those things you'd be investigating as well well absolutely you know all of these issues I'd be investigating to to to speak to the law on uh the displacement of the population and and giving effective warning article 57 of uh of of AP1 additional protocol one of 1977 is fairly clear it says to militaries that you should give you should give warning if at all possible the Israelis have have given warning they've in fact given some fairly specific warnings to the population the question is are those realistic uh can the population take them but but more importantly even if Israel does provide warning it does not then make it a free fire zone right they still have to take all the precautions that they would be taking even had they not provided that warning so it doesn't let me bring in soan because we're coming to the end of our our discussion and I do want to talk about accountability because we've had had already four previous Gaza Wars 2008 2009 2012 2014 2021 there were allegations in of war crimes in all of them and no one ever went to court did they yeah that's correct and you know sorry Mark this is for S this is for San San go ahead please sorry yeah well well we we human rights organizations have since uh 2000 and since castled calling for investigating war crimes and we know all what happened with the commission of inquiry LED back then by Mr goldone Goldstone and but on the other hand we know that Palestine uh signed the Rome statute and gave the entitlement to investigate only after uh June 20 or sorry July 2014 so even if we want to call for investigating war crimes it should be by the ICC investigated only of Acts that have been conducted from that date and I think that the development of the recent recent from a year and a half ago from the ICC that it does have jurisdiction to investigate war crimes in all Palestinian territory occupied Palestinian territory including the including East Jerusalem then yes there should be a very clear call to investigate these crimes I think that with what we are seeing today a time has come to act on opening on get having a decision and opening war crimes of the killing of innocent and especially women and children saan thank you very much thank you very much to all of our panel today Jeffrey Robinson salans are here
