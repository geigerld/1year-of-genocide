we begin with breaking news from Gaza where Israeli forces are carrying out a raid on gaza's largest hospital alifa the director of Health says he's heard gunfire and the movement of Israeli tanks inside the complex earlier a doctor told alaz an Israeli air strike had hit the fourth floor of the main building well days of air strikes have crippled alifa which is situated in Gaza City in the north more than 3,000 patients medical staff and displaced Palestinians are Sheltering in the complex Dr Ahmed Malala is inside alifa hospital he shared what he's been experiencing there overnight really more and more titer it's really horrible here it has been continuous bombing and firing uh since the last let me say 5 hours almost the Israelis uh tanks are moving towards the shifa hospital I've seen two tanks getting in the gate the main gate the Eastern Gate of shifa hospital and they were inside shifa hospital and we keep hearing the tanks moving within the area of shifa Hospital the bombing have been really really aggressive over the last few many hours with continuous uh shooting you know all over the place all over the areas you can know you don't know from where exactly sometimes you hear from the East the from the south or from the West so it's totally like surrounding the hospital and keeps firing continuously with all kinds of you know to the hospital the Israelis have called the hospital Administration around an hour ago saying that they are uh getting in the hospital and they are about to get inside the buildings and to investigate and to try to check each building one by one and each room within the hospital and they advis the people they asked them not to look through the windows or the doors and that everyone might be at risk if they doesn't do anything so uh and then they said nothing about the way of doing this they said nothing about the mechanism of getting in uh the the the weird thing that since they ask about this thing nothing has happened at least in our building I can tell you and then the uh you the the bombing and the shooting you can hear it in ground didn't stop at all sometimes it's really really very very dense so uh so again the hospital is full of patients have around 700 patients we have civilians within the hospital Sheltering there are families with kids with ladies and we have the medical stuff so imagine how scary is that to everyone here within the hospital TK Abu AUM is live for us now in kanun in the south of the Gaza Strip T what's the very latest you're hearing about the Israeli raid on alifa Hospital yes uh the Israeli occupation forces had turned up to shifat hospital and managed to uh get into the buildings of this medical complex after a series of rounds of fighting between them and the Palestinian fighters in the streets and the buildings of Gaza Strip now the Israeli Special Forces manag to right now to stand in front of the Gate of asifa hospital and even they get into the main buildings searching for more military infrastructure as they have claimed since the early beginning of this round of fighting now the maneuvering troops uh and the Israel artillery tanks are stationed in inside and even in the yards of the hospital and they have also open gun fires and the yards of the hospital as there the hospital is overwhelmed with patients medical workers and even the uh displaced people there are more than around uh 30,000 uh Palestinians who are residing inside the hospital now the Israeli uh forces are really saying that they are carrying out a precise military uh operation inside the asifa hospital based on accurate Military Intelligence information about the targets that they are wanting to eliminate but meanwhile according to the director of Gaza hospitals no pullet had been shot against Israeli troops from the Isa Hospital which give a clear sign that the ISA hospital is clear and empty of militants and the Israeli forces are now searching inside the buildings of hospitals looking for further targets as the hospital is overwhelmed with patients who are in deep need for uh humanitarian and even medical support uh in the current moment so uh this attack on a shifa hospital uh is a clear violation and according to the principles of international knoww and also the different uh Palestinian factions have called The International Community to send delegations in order to check their reality on the ground and of the Palestinian Ministry of Health inside the territory also said that the uh the situation on the in the shifat hospital is catastrophic and they are appealing for the International Community to stop what is happening on the ground as the patients life inside this medical complex are in on the edge of collapse as there is no any safe passage out to be delivered to the southern areas of the territory T Israel claims to be targeting Hamas but there's never been any evidence provided of a Hamas presence at hospitals yes always uh Israel had used this protext in order to attack different targets as they had as they had previously uh set since the early beginning of this fighting they are talking about destruction of residential neighborhoods are claiming that they are centers for operation or or command rooms that operat for the Palestinian Fighters meanwhile they are now inside the shifa hospital and even throughout the previous rounds of fighting that erupted between them and even with with the Palestinian Fighters they did not manage to prove any evidence that really can uh can condemn the use of uh this medical complex for military purposes and these allegations have been met by a wave of refugial and even uh a disapproval by the Palestinian faction and even the Palestinian Ministry of Health which denied all of this accusation and recommended the International Community to be a responsibility regarding what is happening right now on the ground in a shifa hospital T thanks very much for that update well for more on this now let's speak to Sarah kyat joining us live now from rala Sarah we understand that Israeli forces have released a statement they are they've confirmed uh the current operation that's under way um they also said that it's only happening in a certain part of alifer Hospital of course if you remember we've covered this extensively how that hospital is a huge uh one with multiple buildings they're saying that they're only working on a precise area they said this is all based on their own intelligence and that action was is was not intended to harm patients medical staff and citizens they also uh confirmed that um some of their Medical Teams they said um are Arabic speakers that have specific training to prepare they said for this complex and sensitive uh environment well of course what we've been hearing from uh the head of the hospital paints a very different picture we also of course heard from the Palestinian Authority Health Minister um who has said that they're requesting International protection for all of those that are in the hospitals seeking treatment um that that includes doctors health workers and of course civilians and displaced people because we know there's around 7,000 of them that took Refuge after the Israeli military itself had warned uh people in the north to move to the South so many of those are taking Refuge uh there they also uh called for the protection of all of those people in that hospital under international law and that they had already reached uh the Red Cross but uh according to the health Ministry for the Palestinian Authority they said that um the the Red Cross couldn't really uh do much given uh the circumstances and of course we've also heard from Hamas as well condemning this and saying that the US is also complicit in uh this and in any deaths that are carried out against uh those civilians that are H up now in that uh Hospital uh because it said that the US gave the green light to that this is an extraordinary de velopment that we're seeing folding out in front of us never really seen anything uh like this and of course uh speaking aler is speaking to uh the head of that hospital confirming um that there is uh nothing uh that is harboring Hamas that there is no command center as per Israeli forces the reason uh the green card they said that allowed them to go in according to the Israeli forces is that there is a command center effectively what they've called as the Hamas Pentagon um now the forces also did add the Israeli forces um the military spokesman uh Daniel hagari said that they are also there to look for those hostages so perhaps based on their intelligence they believe that those are being held captive uh may be held there of course more than 240 uh people are still held in Gaza right now Sarat thank you in rala for us there
