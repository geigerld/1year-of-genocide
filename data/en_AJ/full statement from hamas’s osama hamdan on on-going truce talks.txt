you can go to Osama hamon he's a senior spokesperson for Hamas he's joining us on the line from Beirut thank you very much indeed for being with us can you tell us what if anything has been agreed by Hamas well thank you for having me I I have to say that we are still negotiating And discussing the all all the the points with the mediators the karies and the Egyptians and it's clear that we are moving forward there's some good points uh there's some real uh uh reaction from the other side but till now we are still talking about the main issue which is the complete ceasefire and complete withdrawal from Gaza we hope to find some good and positive answers today if that happened we will go through uh uh this to uh declare uh a positive uh answer if I may say that one of the key elements has also been the Benjamin netanyahu's stated aim of sending the Israeli military into Rafa whether or not a ceasefire is signed or what is your position in that what's your understanding um of that and have there been any guarantees given about preventing that from happening well uh through the talks there was uh some uh guarantees that this will not take place if there was a ceasefire but unfortunately uh there was a clear statement from uh n saying that regardless to what may happen if there was a ceasefire or not he will continue the attack against that means there will be no ceas fire and that means the the the attack will be continued which is against what we are discussing at least we we we want to know exactly what does it mean his statement and the reaction from the mediators U our understanding that any achievement for a c far means that there will be no more attack against Gaza any place in Gaza including and if I understand what you're saying correctly sir the the distance between what you of what Hamas is hoping for out of these negotiations and what Benjamin Netanyahu intends for Gaza and in particular Rafa is very wide and yet you seem optimistic that there can be some movement forward can you give us an indication of where you think there is some there is some room for negotiation to close that Gap well in fact we we are negotiating for more than three months and um each time we are making uh uh uh some uh forward steps but we didn't achieve uh what what really we want uh which is a complete ceas and withdrawal from gazda but I believe we can't talk about either optimistic or pessimistic we have to talk about the real position of the United States because that is the main issue which will affect the position of the Israelis and mainly NY if the United States Administration have said clearly to Netanyahu enough is enough you have to do this and that I I assure you that will happen so let's say the the the the one who is supposed to answer the questions now the Americans and no one else if they decide that this must stop it will happen this is what we are about now and I think the mediators our brothers in Egypt and K they are doing a good job they are doing their best to achieve that this is why we are still hoping to achieve the main goal a complete ceas fire and withdrawal from G um I I want to put a scenario to you if the US was prepared to give a guarantee that the Israeli military was not going to go into Rafa at under any circumstances would that be enough of a guarantee for you to sign this SE or the at least the initial stage of this ceasefire agreement when the guarantee is important uh and if that was given that will give a good bush bush for the the the negotiations but also we need clear steps to be uh uh decided and written in the paper which we will all agree on so the uh guarantees are needed but we also Al we need a clear statements which clarify the position and uh the commitments of each side because as we all know Israelis are trying every time to get out of their commitments so the guarantees are not enough it's important but it's not only the needed thing we need guarantees and we need also clear commitments can I clarify with you sir the the the the way the the logistics of what is playing out here are we talking about an aim to to get a a final permanent agreement on uh a long-term ceasefire or are we talking about the initial stage of several stages working towards an eventual permanent ceasefire well what we are talking about is uh a complete Arrangements we are not talking just about the first stage we are talking about an enragement including the three St stages and a longterm C fire and that was clear uh in our position from day number one uh Anthony blinkin the US Secretary of State said in his recent visit to Israel that the the pressure was on Hamas to accept this any sort of ceasefire agreement though certainly the one that Israel had put forward um by making concessions should you choose to do so in the negotiations later on today do you feel that takes the pressure off Hamas and places it back with Israel well it's clear that like what Mr Brink have said most of the time the pressure was on Hamas and I believe now they understand well that the one who's undermining the process all the time was n himself so they need to make a real pressure on the Israeli side because he is the occupier he's the the attacker he's the killer he is the the side who is doing the genocide in Gaza more pressure NY will make us close to make the needed Arrangements I believe that if Mr Blinn spent some few more hours in in in t Aviv he will achieve the needed Arrangement rather than talking about the Shon ham uh one final question sir I want to ask you in terms of what you the time scale that you're talking about in your assessment how close is Hamas and Israel to reaching a deal that will eventually see the fighting stop in Gaza well I have to say we need to hear one sentence from uh the mediators as a commitment from Israel a complete ceasefire complete withdrawal from Gazza rebuilding uh Gaza if that happened with I have to add also with a fair prisoner exchange if that if that was a commitment from Israel I think we will achieve directly the needed Arrangements and Senior spokesperson for hamus we appreciate it thank you very much
