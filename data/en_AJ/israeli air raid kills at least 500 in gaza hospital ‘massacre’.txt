there's been widespread shock and international condemnation after Israel launched an air strike on a hospital in Gaza killing hundreds of Palestinians it's the worst single attack since the start of Israel's assault on the besieged Strip on the 7th of October following an incursion by Hamas into Southern Israel that killed 1300 people Tuesday's air strike targeted the al- alhi Baptist Hospital in central Gaza at least 500 people are confirmed dead and it's believed thousands of civilians were inside the hospital at the time of the attack some were patients whilst many were seeking Shelter From the Israeli bombardment earlier in the day at least six Palestinians were killed in another attack on a un run School Dimitri medvedenko has the latest bodies in the hundreds scattered across the backyard of a hospital a scene many have described as a massacre the result of a deadly air strike my son that you can see here on my phone my wife just told me he died he was sitting with us and all of a sudden he disappeared hundreds of families were Sheltering in the territory of the Al Ali Baptist Hospital displaced people looking for shelter after their homes were destroyed in 11 days of non-stop bombardment we were told the Red Cross asked the hospital to let the civilians in which it did and suddenly rockets and missiles started falling on all the civilians who were there including women and children who had their bodies dismembered no one was spared hospitals are protected by the first Geneva Convention it states that medical personnel and Facilities cannot be attacked under any circumstances if they strike a hospital that means they have no limitations they've given the green light to execute all all Palestinians it means they can shoot us here as well less than an hour before the air strike Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said civilian safety in Gaza is the responsibility of Hamas they're committing a double War crime attacking civilians hiding behind civilians as human Shields the entire world should condemn it and should support Israel in its just War this strike comes just hours after a un protected school was hit killing at least six people as Israel's blockade of Gaza continues its 2.2 million residents remain trapped with no certain safe place to hide from Israel's attacks Demitri medeno Al jazer Mustafa bouti is Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative he says the attack on the hospital is a deliberate War crime and amounts to genocide these people have committed another Massacre against the Palestinian people yeah but they attack the hospital I mean this is unaccept not only unacceptable it's so Savage Nobody Does that attacking hospitals and attacking a hospital where people are taking Refuge from the places they were bombarded by Israelis and forced to leave out trying to find some safe passage in the hospital or near the hospital they this means there is no safe place for Palestinians but this is more than that this massacre in one hit of the Israeli jet fighters they've killed people almost the same number of the people who were killed in Sabra and chatila in that famous Massacre this is more than the people who were killed maybe in thein during the famous massacre in 1948 so we are seeing the same kind of pattern of committing massacres against Palestinians trying to ethnically cleanse them out of gazastrip this is a genoci side that is committed in front of the whole world and an attack on a hospital on a place which should be safe nobody in Wars even attack hospitals in any other country in the world these war criminals are doing it and my beig question is to the world leaders who are rushing to Israel one after the other to the chancellor of Germany to the prime minister of Britain to Mr Biden the president of the United States will they condemn this Israeli Massacre
