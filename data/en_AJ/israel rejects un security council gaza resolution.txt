United Nations security Council has voted in favor of a humanitarian pause in Israel's war on Gaza 15 member Council called for Urgent and extended pauses to allow Aid access the Royal chalins joins us live now from occupied East Jerusalem so a vote for a pause but what's been the Israeli reaction to this well look I've got two quotes here from Israeli official which I think tell you all you really need to know about how Israel as a you know as a government feels about this we have one from the Ambassador Israel's ambassador to the UN uh that's gillad erdan who says that the resolution is disconnected from reality and will have no meaning in practice he says Israel is according to international law anyway while the Hamas terrorists will not read the resolution at all and will not act on it now the Ministry of Foreign Affairs says that there is no room for a prolonged humanitarian trues as long as 239 abductees are in the hands of Hamas terrorists we expect the security Council to unequivocally condemn Hamas and address the need to create a different security reality in Gaza so clearly the Israelis are not going to abide by this un Security Council resolution they feel that it will hands the initiative to Hamas and that the resolution is lopsided anyway and doesn't address the things that Israel wants to see uh addressed Israel has form in uh ignoring Security Council resolutions it has done so in the past just two examples in 2016 Netanyahu ignored a un Security Council resolution that called for a stop of uh illegal settlements activity uh in the West Bank and in 2009 in a previous flare up of of Gaza violence uh the then pres prime minister of Israel ignored un Security Council resolution again calling for immediate ceasefires what's notable about this Security Council resolution is the lack of vetos there were no vetos from the permanent members uh no veto from the United States no veto from the UK no veto from Russia they all obstain so this resolution passed through and that essentially means that the US allowed it to pass through it didn't Scupper it it didn't sabotage it and that I think points to an important point which is really that the the biggest check on Israeli activity uh military activity at least is not the UN Security Council it's not the UN resolutions it's the United States and what the United States thinks uh Israel should and shouldn't be doing and that's what we should really be looking for I think next is how much pressure the US is putting on Israel to dial things down Rory thanks very much for that
