hamas's armed Wings says Israel is stalling on a deal to release captives the Kasam Bri Brigade say it's ready to release up to 70 women and children but in exchange of once a 5day truce and the release of Palestinian prisoners and the entry of humanitarian Aid the enemy has requested the release of 100 women and children held captive in Gaza we told the mediators that we are asking for a five-day truce in which we will release 50 women and children and this number might actually go up to 70 because the captives are being held by several factions and groups this truth is to include a ceasefire as well as the approval of Entry of humanitarian and relief assistance to all our people in the Gaza Strip however the enemy is still stalling and evading this responsibility and the enemy is still ignoring not just the innocent lives of Palestinian civilians they are also Al ignoring their own detained people Sarah kyat sent us this update on the situation from occupied East Jerusalem well the Israeli government uh hasn't really been speaking about a 5-day ceasefire which is what uh Hamas has been pushing for it also hasn't confirmed whether it would consider an exchange of those that are being held captive with prisoners which is what Hamas wants it wants children and women released from Israeli detention but what we do know is that overnight it had commented uh saying that it's uh been in touch with the family of uh the Israeli soldier that was held captive by Hamas and a video was released of her last night Hamas says that she was killed but no comment on that part of the video uh from the Israeli authorities now in terms of the families those of that are being held captive or those are being held missing they are very concerned they said that they've been calling on the government for many days to stop uh the uh air strikes worried that their family members would be killed um and a news like that will be incredibly concerning for the relatives of those being held captive they said that they would uh really try to get the government to push for a possible ceasefire in whatever capacity that means as long as it ensures bringing those that are held in Gaza back home there's worry there's concern and still nothing from the government just yet on what the situation is in terms of a possible ceasefire a 5-day uh truth which was what Hamas is asking for in return uh of those uh that are being uh held captive and that's the latest on that we are yet to hear more from the Israeli government Al jazer occupi Jerusalem
