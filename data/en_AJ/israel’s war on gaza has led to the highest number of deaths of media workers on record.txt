journalists working in areas of armed conflict are protected under International humanitarian law just like civilians but Israel has been accused of violating those rules repeatedly Palestinian journalists say Israel is trying to kill the messenger and silence the story now a new report by a Palestinian prisoner society says journalists are being arrested as well as killed Israeli forces have detained 80 Palestinian journalists since October both in Gaza and the occupied West Bank 49 are in Israeli custody including four female media workers a report by the committee to protect journalists last year said Israel is one of the world's leading jailers of journalists joining the ranks of countries such as China Russia and Iran and Israel's war Gaza has also been the worst on record for the number of deaths of media workers 147 journalists and media workers have been killed by Israeli forces in 8 months well let's now speak to daud kutab who a Palestinian journalist and Free Press Advocate who's joining us from Jordan's capital Aman thank you very much for being with us let's start with the arrest first 80 journalists arrested since October by Israel why under what pretext and what have they been charged with well the problem is the Israelis don't have a a recognition of Palestinian journ state for them all Palestinians are the same and for many they're all terrorists so there is no specific statue for journalists they don't give them press cards they don't recognize them and as we saw with sharak they have no problems in shooting and killing them with the Palestinian journalists being arrested in Gaza no bank they are arrested as part of the administrative detention orders which is an arrest without trial without charge they're just held without any legal basis except the based on 1945 emergency laws and so we have about 3,900 Palestinians today Behind Bars without a charge they're kind of like the hostages in Gaza they're held without charge without a trial and um the journalists are not recognized as journalists that's the biggest problem plus the Israelis have not allowed any International journalist to enter Gaza and that's a huge problem because every war in the world we've seen International journalists being able to cover it except Gaza Gaza has not allowed any external journalist and only journalists who are covering it are Palestinians who being shot and killed and as he said arrested yeah and and Palestinian journalists as we know have always faced very difficult circumstances even before the October 7th attacks how much worse has it gotten since for them oh it as as you said it is the worst country now in the world in the way they deal with journalists and the way they kill arrest and harass journalists and we know that also media Outlets are being pressured to to kind of tow the Israeli line but on the Palestinian side the journalists are treated exactly like everybody else they don't accept the law of the law the humanitarian law which is the law of the war that states that journalists should be immune from any attacks and so on and so we've seen over 130 journalists in Gaza being killed in addition to Shak American journalist until this moment we have not seen a single report about Israel investigating this and if there was an American journalist killed anywhere in the world we would see a lot more pressure on Israel to come up with the facts so we have a problem in that Israel is trying to hide the facts and trying to Kill the Messenger and and so how do we solve this problem how do we make sure that there is Justice for these more than a 100 journalists and media workers who've been killed during this conflict well I think we have to work on a number of levels International media organizations must keep pressuring Israel but also we have to work on the Israeli uh Syndicate I think International syndicates should either boycott or ensure that the Israeli Syndicate issues a statement every time a Palestinian is arrested harassed or or or killed and unless the Israeli Syndicate stands up for Palestinian rights like their fellow journalists I think people should boycott the Israeli Syndicate until they actually act in a proper way and protecting fellow journalist so we have to work on the international level and also I think we need to boycott the Israeli journalist Association thank you for speaking to us and and sharing your uh insight and uh experience dwood kutab Palestinian journalist and a free press Advocate joining us there from Aman thank you very much for your time welcome make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
