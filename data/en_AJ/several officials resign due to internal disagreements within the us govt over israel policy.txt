now internal disagreements within the US government over how the administration is dealing with Israel's actions in Gaza has led to a steady stream of resignations at least seven officials have resigned since October last week a senior State Department official quit over a report that denied Israel has been blocking Aid to Gaza here are some of the findings of the reports the report found the Israeli government has been actively involved in encouraging protests and attacks on Aid convoys a do dou umented Israeli strikes on coordinated humanitarian movements inside Gaza and also found inconsistent rejections of humanitarian supplies and a lack of clarity on how cargo is checked yet that same report notes it does not currently assessed the Israeli government is prohibiting or otherwise restricting the transport or delivery of us humanitarian assistance while Stacy Gilbert is the former State Department employee who resigned over that report she was a senior civil military adviser at the Bureau of population refugees and migration at the US state department and is joining us live on Al jaer from Baltimore in Maryland Cy thank you so much for being with us on Al jaer so you resigned after 20 years in the state department can you explain to us first what led to your decision and just how difficult a decision it was for you um so we were tasked by the White House in early February to write a report assessing countries two things countries compliance with International humanitarian law also known as the law of war or the Geneva conventions and their willingness to facilitate humanitarian assistance Israel was not the only country but as you can imagine it was the country that generated the most debate um within within um the subject matter experts who were drafting the report um at some point myself and a few other subject matter experts were removed from the report it was moved up to a higher level and I read the report when it was released on May 10th and um it was the first time actually that I'm aware of that we admitted that Israel is using Us weapons in violation of international humanitarian law but it was also very Stark that it said Israel is not blocking humanitarian assistance right and I know that's not true I know others know that's not true and that was the reason I decided to resign I I I will ask you about what the report says a little bit more I just wanted to know if it was specifically working on this report that led to your resignation or was it perhaps an accumulation of concerns that you've had it it's definitely an accumulation of concerns but I was in a unique position having been working on this report um it was I can't recall in my many years working in the US government seeing anything so so obviously wrong that everyone agrees is wrong and yet that was what we submitted as a report to Congress all right but it was it was an accumulation a lot of frustration okay I I just want to pay you a sound bite of vid vidan Patel the state department spokesman who was asked directly at a press conference about your resignation and here is what he had to say we stand by uh the National Security memorandum uh 20 report uh we are not an Administration or a department that uh twists the facts and um allegations uh that we have are are unfounded uh but uh this is as any report and as any process um that is undertaken in a policymaking process these processes are deliberative and they involve inputs from people um at a variety of uh seniority uh and expert levels so you heard there the state department spokesman saying that they stand by this report what is your reaction to that and how is the initial report that you worked on different from the final report that was released the conclusion of the subject matter experts who work in humanitarian assistance not only in the state department but also usaid and the organizations on the ground in Gaza is absolutely unanimous that Israel is blocking humanitarian assistance and has been which is why Gaza is why there's famine why why the hospitals have been bonded it's it is so patently clear that that is what's happening and my understanding is lawyers perhaps drafted that that conclusion why why is the state department not being honest then about the situation in your view by if the determination is that any any partner country is blocking humanitarian assistance a country that is also receiving our weapons assistance there is another consequence a consequence under us law that triggers a s a cessation of our security assistants so I think they're very very worried about making a determination that makes that triggers those kind of consequences Stacy you're one of several uh officials who have resigned in in recent weeks and months over the US administration's support for the war on Gaza do you get a sense that this is having these resignation are having an impact in any way are they making a difference is the administration at some point going to be listening to experts like yourself I will say I was able to leave because I know others feel the same as I do and I know they will continue to to change the policy to to make our to be more honest in our assessments I know they will continue to do that work on the inside I made the determine based on my position that my voice would be better heard outside the government because they knew very well what what the humanitarian experts thought and it that that it's not just an opinion there is quantifiable data and that was overruled for a very legalistic interpretation the Biden Administration has now presented this plan to end the war on Gaza so far the Israelis haven't accepted it what what should the US be doing now Stacy in your view you have experience working in this Administration what what do you think is the right thing to do to end this war now I think I think it's been very clear from the very beginning our ability to influence Israel is negligible and continuing to do the same things that that have clearly not resulted in much good up to now it it's time to end that we need to leverage we need to use the tools that we have to leverage better behavior and I think that's in ceasing the weapons trans fers um but we need to do it it's not just for for Israel and and we need to end the conflict but we also need to adhere to our own law I am concerned that in putting out this report we are skewing the facts um to the detriment of our own law our own policy and the consequence of that in Gaza is is disastrous it also it so profoundly affects our policy in so many other places around the world um it's very difficult to tell Russia to stop bombing civilian facilities in Ukraine when we see the same thing happening by by Israel in Gaza Stacy thank you so much for talking to us and sharing your experience with us on Al jazer Stacy Gilbert former State Department official who resigned recently thank you very much for
