s from reporting inside Israel so ham seeing live pictures there of huge crowds on the streets pray to us everywhere remind us why we're seeing this on just such a scale well this is in fact the largest protest in a single place in Israel's history organizers say 500,000 people are in the streets of Tel Aviv and 250,000 others are spread across the country including West Jerusalem Kaa and Rishon leion which is near Tel Aviv but let's get to the reason why these demonstrations are happening in the first place this is nearly a week of consecutive protests after the Israeli Army announced that they had recovered the bodies of six Israeli captives from a tunnel in southern Gaza a week ago and that didn't bode well with the Israeli public because according to Israeli military intelligence those captives were alive just a few days before their bodies were recovered and according to leaks within Israeli media and on the record statements from Hamas officials some of those captives were actually going to be released in the first phase of a ceasefire deal that never happened so now families of captives are saying that this is netanyahu's fault that he has blood on his hands and he's the main impediment for why there hasn't been a ceasefire deal just yet this demonstration in fact is the largest in Israel's history in one single place and it just goes to show you the level of frustration that the family members of captives the Israeli public and the movement of the demonstrations is facing 11 months into the war so widespread protest at how Benjamin Netanyahu has handled this War uh are these protests are these huge crowds on the streets likely to force net netanyahu's hand at [Music] all well look it's certainly an interesting question because Netanyahu has seemingly been unfaith in whatever pressure comes his way whether that has been domestic or International he said that he's still going to prosecute the war however he sees fit and he said that he has red lines when it comes to a ceasefire deal and prisoner exchange that would see the release of the remaining captives but he says he has incredibly tough red lines but he blames Hamas for adding new conditions when in fact leaks in Israeli media from Anonymous officials say that Netanyahu is the one with the increasingly tough stance that he is the one that is continuously adding conditions and the Americans are saying that if they want if both sides want a deal there's going to have to be major concessions concessions that Netanyahu says he is not willing to compromise on you also have to remember that he is in the most right-wing government in Israel's history a coalition of members of the far right who are known Ultra nationalists who say that Netanyahu is in fact not being Tough Enough when it comes to the war on Gaza saying that they would Bolt the government if there was a deal that they considered unfavorable to Israel so there are a lot of moving Parts here but nonetheless these large Crowds Are surely to make some sort of Mark in Israel's history but it's not really known exactly how it's going to make an impact on Israel's government all right hamda thanks for that ham salute reporting there thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
