let's take you to a press conference with Hamas hamdan speaking there in Beirut let's listen in approximately 60,000 people have been killed 70% of whom are children and women more 42,000 injured in the West Bank as well 2602 people were killed during the same period these Martyrs are not M numbers every martyr has a human story with a hope with a dream with a dream of living in a dignified life just like any other human being in their Homeland however this naasty occupation killed these Souls killed these dreams brutally and in a barbaric fashion this this will be a condemnation on this regime and all those who kept silent on all those who supported that regime against our people we pray to Allah the almighty to accept and Bless The Souls of the martyrs and to heal those injured and we greet and salute our people who are standing fast who have not left their home who are standing fast on their land denying and rejecting all plans of displacement as plotted by the zionists and marketed by the by by the um US Secretary of State the Jew as he claims We Salute alasam brigades and the brigades of all the Palestinian resistants in Gaza and the West Bank who are writing the annals of an epic victory of our people defending our people's right right defending our people's sacred sides and land and in every moment they are they are making the enemy sustain injuries and losses and making Gaza a symmetry for such an aggressor and we support we support our youth who are revolting in the West Bank who are engaging with the forces of the occupation we salute the supporters of our people in Gaza in Lebanon in Yemen and in Iraq and today we I commence my word of the plans of the of the Nazi occupation the horrible massacres of the occupation against our unarmed civilian people and the bombardment that raise entire neighborhoods to the ground since the aggression on on Gaza destroying houses infrastructure including hospitals and schools that uh and even in and even International institutions with International Flags this is just to hide the numbers of their losses trying to hide the hits sustained by the by the enemy from Al from alasam brigades this heroism by our people is this massacre is under the sponsorship of American uh government using ammunition and smart ammunition um supplied by the US to this regime and it's continuously supplied to isra which makes the American Administration and the President Biden the respons possbility of such massacres and defies any claim that this Administration or this country and their claim that they sponsor democracy and human rights these Nazi massacr are not limited to the Gaza Strip they continue to be perpetrated across all the cities of the West Bank and his camps and in Jerusalem as well this enemy is waging a barbaric brutal war against our people across all the occupied lands these massacr will not break our will and such massacr will not allow the Nazi occupation to meet their objectives these people our people who are writing the annals of an epic and a legendary battle telling the story of AO people defending their land and their sacred lands despite despite all the American claims there are no safe zones in Gaza Strip as the occupation Army is claiming the occupation has transformed all the lands of Gaza into an open war zone for their machine for their War Ma targeting men women and every living moving thing in the yesterday was the for the 67th anniversary of canun Massacre that was committed in 1956 which was during the aggression launched by Israel France and the UK France that is teaching us lessons about freedom and on those on that year 520 Martyrs were killed and today this Nazi enemy is relieving the same Massacre against our unarmed civilians the children and grandchildren of those people who were killed in the earlier massaka this enemy that knows nothing but the language of massacres and displacing people or annihilation of the entire people however this objective did not materialize and will not be achieved as our enemy has failed in rooting us out from our land as they promised here we reiterate our warning from all attempts and all plots that are in sync with this Israeli uh plot to displace our people from the Gaza Strip under whatever pretext the these all are plots and Zionist plots and American plots on the account of our of the blood of our people and every anyone who is involved in such plots and plans no matter how good intentions they say they are Partners in such a crime a crime of genocide and displacement and here very confidently we say that the goals of netania and his army are unattainable and what Netanyahu is doing is just a revenge and a thirst for blood this is not a sign of Victory but rather a sign of defeat and the fall of his government and to be convicted and persecuted as a war criminal the real objective of Netanyahu and his military is to eliminate the Palestinian people and kill the issue and kill the cause and to decide this conflict and this is an impossibility and if there is any other Satan or any evil other than him after 60 days of War Netanyahu and his military couldn't achieve a single military nor political Victory it's a dream that will never come true to him nor to his military no matter how long the war would last we are well prepared over 75 years this enemy has never claimed Victory against our people our people have always been unresisting and therefore they can never win against Hamas and they can never claim victory against our Palestinian people and here I would like to confirm that Netanyahu and his War staff are sinking deeper and deeper in the swamp of Gaza they all couldn't liberate a single captive except according to our terms and here we reiterate that there is no negotiation no swab without seizing and stopping the aggression against our people and against Gaza and here we hold Netanyahu for responsibility for the lives of the Israeli and Zionist captives as he have foiled and hindered the swab deal as he resumed his attack against Gaza they are under the threat of being killed by the bombardments of netanyahu's War Machine and it now has become clear to us that Netanyahu doesn't care about these captives doesn't care about their families and he doesn't care about their lives we would like to reiterate to the Nazi occupation government that the that the Ala mosque will continue to remain a purely Islamic mosque and they will never have sovereignty over that mosque and will say to the people of the temple that extreme group to violate and desecrate Al AA MOS we still that Al AA flood will not stop and will continue until you are defeated and swept away from our land from our sacred sides as as to the continued humanitarian suffering the occupation didn't suffice with um within human massacres our enemy continues to perpetrate the crime of salv against more than 2 million Palestinians by their Siege and not allowing humanitarian Aid those who didn't die by bombardments are dying because of starvation and anyone who hinders the access of Aid into Gaza is a partner in such a crime against our people and shall bear the responsibility of the Reps of such a crime not allowing all requirements for basic human life including water wells bakeries hospitals electricity generators and shelters we are warning that the number of Martyrs will increase due to thirst and famine which is warning of a humanitarian catastrophe therefore we call upon the Arab and Muslim nations to Bear their human itarian and ethical responsibilities it's the right of our people to live free and dignified life without without Siege without bombardment without aggression and without threat no Israeli will feel safe if our people didn't enjoy the [Music] same we are it's an increasing number of massacr against civilian with the increased number of killed and injured among the displaced in shelter zones we reiterate our call to the following we call upon the honor and the wh to assume their humanitarian and ethical responsibilities to continue supplying our people in Gaza with a humanitarian Aid and not to seed to the demands and terms and conditions of the occupation actually we can't understand the position of onor responding and heing the demands of the occupation against their mandate we also call upon International humanitarian and medical organization to intensify their access to all areas of Gaza and Aid the residence of Gaza with all humanitarian Aid we call also upon all Arab and Muslim countries to move seriously and immediately to break such a Siege against Gaza and to open humanitarian uh corridors and to open all hospitals across all Gaza with all medical disciplines and Supply the Gaza Strip with fuel medicine water and food third in this long series of lies of the Israelis and the Americans the American admin rtion with the statements of their officials continues to to adopt the the Zionist narrative without verifying or vitting any of such information latest is the statement of the National Security advisor of the United States that the that the occupations Army does not Target civilians in Gaza this is a lie a blatant lie it's uh More than 70% of 16,000 Murs are women and children and definitely in their eyes they are not civilians you can expect what would be the advice and the Council of such National ad security advisor and what would the decisions of such Administration would look like based on his advice the claims and the lies of the zionists claiming that some of their women have been raped actually this is to to cover an underscore that the human treatment of our Fighters with these individuals such scenes have have Disturbed the Nazi regime they have tried desperately to dehumanize our people we say that these false claims are in their imagination of extreme Zionist individuals that allows that that allows the the Zionist soldiers allow the Zionist soldiers to rape the woman of others and and this is and this is this is supported by this individual who's the military Rabbi in the Israeli Defense Forces who allowed and permitted sanction to the soldiers to rape njw women saying that when we are intended that the Torah has allowed us to satisfy the soldiers needs for women and it is permissible to engage in sexual activity with women during war against their will and this is another Rabbi rayon Loven talkes talks about permitting but rather the need to kill to to kill children in the war being to theultimate victim this child will grow up and kill because the ideology that child will grow up with is even worse than the ideology of his father that's the reason why the Torah in the book of Deuteronomy 20 verse 16 says rules of War do not allow anyone to remain alive nothing no mercy furthermore the book of Deuteronomy chap 25: 19 completely erase any memory of which means men women and children says do not have the right to exist these are the doctrine of their rabbis and their clergymen and here I ask when blinking the Secretary of State who identifies himself as a Jew does he listen to such words when he deals with the Palestinian issue permitting the killing of children and allowing the RAB of women as the rabbi of the Zionist Army breaches we call upon all media Outlets all around the world to continue covering the suffering of our people in Gaza STP and the heinous crimes perpetrated against them which expresses the true nature of this Zionist entity and to work with all professionality and objectivity to reveal the lies of the Zionist discourse and on such an act and such bias uh to the Zionist uh discourse could constitutes a partnership in this crime the some Western media outst continue to uh perpetrate lies serves only the agendas of the occupation will not save them from persecution before the law we call them to rectify their mistakes and to retract such an approach that would that would that would question their accountability and can hold them accountable legally in conclusion we reiterate our call to the people of our and and Muslim nations to escalate all sorts of demonstrations and vigils across all plazas in rejection of the occupations war against our people and to uncover their crimes and I would like like to confirm here that this movement in addition to the action of the resistance in the field and our people standing fast on their land this will limit the window the time window of this aggression we also would like to to appreciate the efforts by the countries that have received our injured uh citizens to support them and we we welcome all support to continue our resistance on our land and foil all attempts for displacement the systematic violations and heinous crimes perpetrated against our prisoners in the in the prisons of the occupation we demand on all humanitarian organization and Inter or International organizations to exert pressure on the occupation to allow visitation to such prisoners and deny B's enjoyment and pleasuring himself visiting the prisons simply to to to please himself by watching them suffer we would like to hail and salute the Alazar position um and an announce announcing um granting Palestinian students scholarships to at alazhar University and we call upon alazhar IM to lead a movement of Scholars across the entire nation to break the siege against Gaza and allow humanitarian Aid across the RAF Crossen and we call upon the scholars to adopt such an idea and make it a reality on the ground following the Hadith of the prophet no muslim can sleep with his stomach full while his neighbor is starving in conclusion we pray Allah the almighty to heal the injured this is a Jihad it's either Victory or martydom and thank you very much if you have any questions you have announc from Lebanon General conscription some people describe this a breach of Lebanon s and many voices call for hisbah not to be involved in this war what we hope for before any comment it's good that you ask this question and I and I would like not to be involved in the Lebanese Internal Affairs our policy is clear in this regard we have maintain such a policy and we will continue to maintain such policy our relations with Lebanon is we is with all components of the Lebanese structure political and social what we have called for is a cultural ideological to to attract the Palestinian youth rather than being misled by other ideologies that that is not in sync with our cuse against the occupation our people who have been displaced from their land 75 years ago and who have carried this cause for 75 years leading the resistance we will not accept we would we will not accept that our youth and our children be IDE ideologized in other directions and in light in light of the heroic resistance of our people we have called to attract such people culturally socially and politically that aims to engage our youth our young in a national project to meet our dreams and our aspirations for Liberation and return to the land this is the call and I hope no one would exaggerate this we are confirming it again in this Karim Khan's visit to Israel of the international criminal court and what about the prisoner swap as for exchange of prisoners I have said we will not talk about swab without stopping the war and the and the aggression against Gaza our partners they have exerted efforts but the occupation has foiled such a deal today Netanyahu just hit the LA the last nail um in this deal he said Netanyahu claimed or announced that not all the prisoners would be able to come back talking about the prisoners afterwards we hope that this will stop we have our prisoners in the occupations prisons if you want to talk about your captives let's talk about prison the question about Karim Khan it's unfortunate his statement talking about only the Israeli side talking about some moral support to the families of the Palestinian prisoners doesn't call for releasing them doesn't take a decisive stand um um uh before the crime that is taking place before his eyes talking about something imaginary like and untrue claims and he talks only about what happened on the 7th of October forgetting what happened since 7th of October until now I believe his credibility is undermined and draws a question mark whether the court is playing a political role supporting the occupation rather than a legal role that criminalizes crimes uh war crimes and crimes against humanity threat of assassination first of all this is very rude if a prime minister of a particular country announces that they will commit terrorist acts in other countries imagine another he State talking in such a manner what kind of a campaign you can imagine the kind of campaign that will be waged against them that's why there is a question to be asked to the entire world why everyone is shamefully silent one if the prime Min the Israeli Prime Minister is T tasking the relevant agency to commit crimes in other countries the other issue is that such threats will not change our political positions will not influence our decisions will not push us to retreat we are holding fast and strongly with our rights to continue our resistance operations of our resistance will continue until we achieve our national goals and objectives this battle is not the Battle of Hamas this is a battle of the Palestinian people for the sake of Gaza Jerusalem Gaza and the West Bank and for the return of the refugees back to Palestine personally speaking about any Hamas leader all Hamas leaders are potential Martyrs however Hamas project is a project of Victory and we have written the annals of such of such um a story that will end in Jerusalem if Netanyahu is threatening some of these leaders will walk into the alaka mosque does does alasan brigades have 17 Israeli soldiers we will not talk about the numbers of soldiers this is something of alasam brigades leaderships they can talk in details about this and it's not the right time yet to talk about this thank you the has failed to root us out from our land the goals of Netanyahu and his army are unobtainable what we are seeing is simply blood lust the words there of AMA hamdan the senior member of Hamas speaking at that press conference in Beirut he went on to say after 60 days of war nanyo and his military have failed to achieve a single military or political goal
