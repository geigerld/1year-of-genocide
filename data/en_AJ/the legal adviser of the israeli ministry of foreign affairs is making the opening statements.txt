we are taking you live to the international court of justice in the ha where Israel is defending itself against accusations of genocide let's listen inal obligation rapael genci he the world recognized that the existing legal Lex was simply inqu capture the devastating evil that the Holocaust Unleashed the applicant has now sought to invoke this term in the context of Israel's conduct in a war it did not start and did not want a war in which Israel is defending itself against Hamas Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other terrorist organizations whose brutality knows no bounds the civilian suffering in this war like in all wars is tragic it is heartbreaking the harsh realities of the current hostilities are made especially agonizing for civilians given hamas's reprehensible strategy of seeking to maximize civilian harm to both Israelis and Palestinians even as Israel seeks to minimize it but as this court has already made clear the genocide convention was not designed to address the brutal impact of intensive hostilities on the civilian population even when the use of force raises quote very serious issues of international law and involves un enormous suffering and continuing loss of life end quote the convention was set apart to address a malevolent crime of the most exceptional severity we live at a time when words are cheap in an age of social media and identity Politics the temptation to reach for the most outrageous term to vilify and demonize has become for many irresistible but if there is a place where words should still matter where truth should still matter it is surely a court of law the applicant has regrettably put before the court a profoundly distorted factual and legal picture the entirety of its case hinges on a deliberately curated decontextualized and manipulative description of the reality of current hostilities South Africa purports to come to this court in the lofty position of a guardian of of the interest of humanity but in delegitimizing Israel's 75e existence in its opening presentation yesterday that broad commitment to humanity rang Hollow and in its sweeping counterfactual description of the Israeli Palestinian conflict it seemed to erase both Jewish history and any Palestinian agency or responsibility indeed the delegitimization of Israel since its very establishment in 1948 in the applicant submissions sounded barely distinguishable from hamas's own rejectionist rhetoric it is unsurprising therefore that in the applicant's telling both hamas's responsibility for the situation in Gaza and the Very Humanity of its Israeli victims are removed from view the attempt to weaponize the term genocide against Israel in the present context does more than tell the court a grossly distorted story and it does more than empty the word of its unique force and special meaning it subverts the object and purpose of the convention itself with ramifications for all states seeking to defend themselves against those who demonstrate total disdain for life and for the law Madam president members of the court on Saturday October 7th a Jewish religious holiday thousands of Kamas and other militants breached Israeli Sovereign territory by sea land and air invading over 20 Israeli communities bases and the site of a music festival what proceeded under the cover of thousands of rockets fired indiscriminately into Israel was the wholesale Massacre mutilation rape and Abduction of as many citizens as the terrorists could find before Israel's forces repelled them openly displaying Elation they tortured children in front of parents and parents in front of children burned people including infants alive and systematically raped and mutilated scores of women men and children all told some 12200 people were butchered that day more than 5,500 maimed and some 240 hostages abducted including infants entire families persons with disabilities and Holocaust Survivors some of whom have since been executed many of whom have been tortured sexually abused and starved in captivity representatives of the hostages families are in this courtroom today and we acknowledge their presence and their boundless suffering we know of the brutality of October 7th not only from the harrowing testimonies of the survivors the unmistakable proof of Carnage and sadism left behind and the forensic evidence taken at the scene we know it because the asants proudly filmed and broadcast their barbarism the events of that day are all but ignored in the applicant submissions but we are compelled to share with the court some fraction of its horror the largest calculated mass murder of Jews in a single day since the Holocaust we do so not because these acts however sadistic and systematic release Israel of its obligations to uphold the law as it defends its citizens and territory that is unquestionable we do so because it is impossible to understand the armed conflict in Gaza without appreciating the nature of the threat that Israel is facing and the brutality and lawlessness of the Armed Force confronting it in the volume of materials submitted to members of the court access has been provided to a portion of the raw footage for separate screening but I am obliged to put before the court today some small fragment of the scenes of unfathomable cruelty that took place in hundreds of locations on that horrible day Johnny simantov a wheat farmer and his wife Tamar an act activist for women's rights lived in kibutz near Oz when the rocket fire started they hid in the safe room with their four-year-old son om and their six-year-old Twins arbel and shakar during their Rampage Kamas militant set fire to their house Johnny texted his sister Renee they're here they're burning us we suffocating the whole family was burned alive to ashes making DNA identification especially difficult a survivor of the Nova Music Festival Massacre testified to police to witnessing a Kamas militant brutally raping a young woman as another militant cut off her breast and toyed with it a second militant then raped her again shooting her in the head while still inside her in one video recorded by a home surveillance system a Kamas militant throws a grenade into a safe room where a father and his two sons have rushed to hide the father is killed the two sons are injured and bleeding as a militant pulls them into the living room one child can be heard screaming to his brother why am I alive I can't see anything they're going to kill us the militant casually opens the fridge takes out a bottle and drinks and then there is this recording from as stated none of these atrocities absolve Israel of its obligations under the law but they do enable the court to appreciate Three core aspects of the present proceedings which the applicant has obscured from view first that if there have been acts that make be characterized as genocidal then they have been perpetrated against Israel if there is a concern about the obligations of States under the genocide convention then it is in relation to their responsibilities to act against hamas's proudly declared agenda of annihilation which is not a secret and is not in doubt the annihilationist language of hamas's chapter is repeated regularly by its leaders with the goal in the words of one member of hamas's political Bureau of the cleansing of Palestine of the filth of the Jews it is expressed no less chillingly in the words of senioras member razi hammad to Lebanese television on October 24th 2023 who refers to the October 7th attacks what Hamas calls the acts of flag as follows in the continuation of this interview Kamas is asked kamad is asked does that mean the annihilation of Israel yes of course he says the existence of Israel is illogical and then he says nobody should blame us for the things we do on October 7th October 10th October 1 millionth everything we do is Justified end quote given that on October 7th before any military response by Israel South Africa issued an official statement blaming Israel for quote the recent conation essentially blaming Israel for the murder of its own citizens one wonders whether the applicant agrees second it is in response to the slaughter of October 7th which Kamas openly vows to repeat and to the ongoing attacks against it from Gaza that Israel has the inherent right to take all legitimate measures to defend its citizens and secure the release of the hostages this right is also not in doubt it has been acknowledged by States across the world astonishingly the court has been requested to indicate a provisional measure calling on Israel to suspend its military operations but this amounts to an attempt to deny Israel its ability to meet its obligations to the defense of its citizens to the hostages and to over 110,000 internally displaced Israelis unable to safely return to their homes the applicant in its submissions to the court makes almost no mention of the ongoing humanitarian suffering of Israel's citizens at the hands of Hamas and treat the hostages still held in captivity as barely an afterthought but is there a reason these people on your screen are Unworthy of Hamas is not a party to these proceedings the applicant by its request seeks to thwart Israel's inherent right to defend itself to let Hamas not just get away with its murder literally but render Israel defenseless as Hamas continues to commit it yesterday Council for the applicant made the astonishing claim that Israel was Den denied this right and as a matter of fact should not be able to protect itself from hamas's attacks but allow me to draw attention to these words written by Professor vaugh low quote the source of the attack whether a state or non-state actor is irrelevant to the existence of the right to Defense Force may be used to avert a threat because no one and no state is obliged by law passively to suffer the delivery of an attack Israel agrees with these words as I suspect with any sovereign state if the claim of the applicant now is that in the armed conflict between Israel and Hamas Israel must be denied the ability to defend its citizens then the Absurd upshot of South Africa's argument is this under the guise of the allegation against Israel of genocide this court is asked to call for an end to operations against the ongoing attacks of an organization that pursues an actual genocidal agenda an organization that has violated every past ceasefire and used it to rearm and plan new atrocities an organization that declares its unequivocal resolve to advance its genocidal plans that is an unconscionable request and it is respectfully submitted that it cannot stand third the court is informed of the events of October 7th because if there are any provisional measures that should appropriately be indicated here they are indeed with respect to South Africa it is a matter of public record that South Africa enjoys close relations with Hamas despite its formal recognition as a terrorist organization by numerous States across the world these relations have continued unabated even after the October 7th atrocities South Africa has long hosted and celebrated its ties with Kamas figures including a senior Kamas delegation that incredibly visited the country for a quote solidarity Gathering just weeks after the massacre in justifying instituting proceedings South Africa makes much of its obligations under the genocide convention it seems fitting then that it be instructed to comply with those obligations itself to end its own language of delegitimization of Israel's existence end its support for Hamas and use its influence with this organization so that Hamas permanently ends its campaign of genocidal Terror and releases the hostages Madam president members of the Court the hostilities between Israel and Hamas have exacted a terrible toll on both Israelis and Palestinians but any genuine effort to understand the cause of this toll must take account of the horrendous reality created by Hamas within the Gaza Strip when Israel withdrew all its soldiers and civilians from Gaza in 200 2005 it left a coastal area with the potential to become a political and economic success story hamas's violent Takeover in 2007 changed all that over the past 16 years of its rule Hamas has smuggled countless weapons into Gaza and has diverted billions in international Aid not to build schools hospitals or shelters to protect its population from the dangers of the attacks it launched against Israel Over many years but rather to turn massive swaths of the civilian infrastructure into perhaps the most sophisticated terrorist stronghold in the history of urban Warfare remarkably Council for the applicant described the suffering in Gaza as unparalleled and unprecedented as if they are unaware of the utter Devastation rought in wars that have raged just in recent Years Around the World sadly the civilian suffering in Warfare is not unique to Gaza what is actually unparalleled and unprecedented is the degree to which Hamas has entrenched itself within the civilian population and made Palestinian civilian suffering an integral part of its strategy Hamas has systematically and unlawfully embedded its military operations militants and assets throughout Gaza within and beneath densely populated civilian areas it has built an extensive Warren of underground tunnels for its leaders and Fighters sever several hundred miles in length throughout the strip with thousands of access points and terrorist hubs located in homes mosques un facilities schools and perhaps most shockingly hospitals this is not an occasional tactic it is an integrated pre-planned extensive and abhorent method of warfare purposely and methodically murdering civilians firing Rockets indiscriminately systematically using civilians sensitive sites and civilian objects as Shields stealing and hoarding humanitarian supplies allowing those under its control to suffer so that it can fuel its Fighters and terrorist campaign the appalling suffering of civilians both Israeli and Palestinian is first and foremost the result of this despicable strategy the horrible cost of Hamas not only failing to protect its civilians but actively sacrificing them for its own propaganda and Military benefit and if Hamas abandons this strategy releases the hos ages lays down its arms the hostilities and suffering would end Madame President members of the Court there are many distortions in the applicant submission to the court but as shall be demonstrated by Council there is one that overshadows them all in the applicant's telling it is almost as if there is no intensive armed conflict taking place between two parties at all No Grave threat to Israel and its citizens only an Israeli assault on Gaza the court is told of widespread damage to buildings but it is not told for example how many thousands of those buildings were destroyed because they were booby trapped by Hamas how many became legitimate targets because of the strategy of using civilian objects and protected sites for military purposes how many many buildings were struck by over 2,000 indiscriminate terrorist rockets that misfired and landed in Gaza itself the court is told of over 23,000 casualties as the applicant repeats as many have unverified statistics provided by Kamas itself hardly a reliable source every civilian casualty in this conflict is a human tragedy that demands our compassion but the court is not told how many thousands of casualties are in fact militants how many were killed by Kamas fire how many were civilians taking direct part in hostilities and just how many are the result of legitimate and proportionate use of force against military targets even if tragic and the court is also told of the dire human itarian situation in Gaza but it is not told of hamas's practice of stealing and hoarding Aid it is not told of the extensive Israeli efforts to mitigate civilian harm of the humanitarian initiatives being undertaken to enable the flow of supplies and provide medical attention to the wounded the applicant purports to describe the reality in Gaza but it is as if Hamas and its total contempt for cilian life just do not exist as a direct cause of that reality Hamas is widely estimated to have over 30,000 Fighters and is known to bring miners no older than 15 or 16 into its ranks they are coming for us but in South Africa's telling they have all but disappeared there are no explosives in mosques and schools and children's bedrooms no ambulances used to transport Fighters no tunnels and terrorist hubs under sensitive sites no Fighters dressed as civilians no Comm commandeering of Aid trucks no firing from civilian homes un facilities and even safe zones there is only Israel acting in Gaza the applicant is essentially asking the court to substitute the lens of armed conflict between a state and a lawless terrorist organization with the lens of a So-Cal genocide of a State against a civilian population but it is not offering the court a lens it is offering it a blindfold Madame President members of the Court the nightmarish environment created by Hamas has been concealed by the applicant but it is the environment in which Israel is compelled to operate Israel is committed as it must be to comply with the law but it does so in the face of hamas's utter contempt for law it is committed as it must be to Humanity but it does so in the face of hamas's utter in humanity as will be presented by Council these commitments are a matter of of Express government policy military directives and procedures they are also an expression of Israel's core values and as shall also be shown they are matched by genuine measures on the ground to mitigate civilian harm under the unprecedented and excruciating conditions of warfare created by Kamas it is plainly inconceivable under the terms set by this very court that a state conducting itself in this way in these circumstances may be said to be engaged in genocide not even Prima fasi the key component of genocide the intention to destroy a people in whole or in part is totally lacking what Israel seeks by operating in Gaza is not to destroy a people but to protect the people its people who are under attack on Multi multiple fronts and to do so in accordance with the law even as it faces a heartless enemy determined to use that very commitment against it as will be detailed by Council Israel's lawful AIMS in Gaza have been clearly and repeatedly articulated by its prime minister its defense minister and all members of the war cabinet as the Prime Minister reiterated yet yet again this week Israel is fighting Hamas terrorists not the population Israel aims to ensure that Gaza can never again be used as a Launchpad for terrorism as the Prime Minister reaffirms Israel seeks neither to permanently occupy Gaza or to displace its civilian population it wants to create a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike where both can live in peace Thrive and prosper and where the Palestinian people have all the power to govern themselves but not the capacity to threaten Israel if there is a threat to that Vision if there is a humanitarian threat to the Palestinian civilians of Gaza it stems primarily from the fact that they have lived under the control of a genocidal terrorist organization that has total disregard for their life and well-being that organization Hamas and its sponsors seek to deny Israel Palestinians and Arab states across the region the ability to advance a common future of Peace coexistence security and prosperity Israel is in a war of defense against Hamas not against the Palestinian people to ensure that they do not succeed in these circumstances there can hardly be a charge more false and more malevolent than the allegation against Israel of genocide the applicant has regrettably engaged in a transparent attempt to abuse the convention's compulsory jurisdiction mechanism and in particular the provisional measures phase of proceedings to bring under the purview of the Court matters over which in truth it lacks jurisdiction Madam president members of the Court the genocide convention was a solemn promise made to the Jewish people and to All Peoples of never again the applicant in effect invites the court to betray that promise if the term genocide can be so diminished in the way that it Advocates if provisional measures can be triggered in the way that it suggests the convention becomes an agre press's Charter it will reward indeed encourage the terrorists Who hide behind civilians at the expense of the states seeking to defend against them to maintain the Integrity of the genocide convention to maintain its promise and the Court's own role as its Guardian it is respectfully submitted that the application and request should be dismissed for what they are a liel designed to deny Israel the right to defend itself according to the law from the unprecedented Terrorist on Onslaught it continues to face and to free the 1036 hostages Hamas still holds I thank you for your kind attention may I ask Madame President that you call Professor Shaw to the podium
