it's just gone 11 GMT that's 100 p.m. in Gaza and despite International condemnation Israel is intensifying its assault on the Palestinian territory air strikes have killed hundreds of civilians in the last 24 hours ground forces are pushing deeper into the strip Israeli tanks have been seen on the main road linking northern and southern Gaza new footage shows one of them firing at a car which was trying to get to safety three people were killed in the incident in a moment we'll have the latest live from Gaza but first this report by Assad be Israeli tanks on the main artillery Road in Gaza apparently splitting the strip between North and South a journalist captures the moment a car is targeted the tank is there in mitar Junction and I told the people but no one wants to believe it is there I told them the tank is there and it is fire in other people from the seaside have seen this tank I don't want to talk too much as I am downloading the video now the tank has targeted a car and a bus and there was a bulldozer next to the tank Israel says it's expanding its Grand operation it claims to have killed dozens of Fighters overnight elsewhere in Gaza hospitals are a potential Target for Israel thousands of displaced Palestinians are staying in and around the AL Goods Hospital the Palestinian red Cresent society says Israeli military had told them to evacuate the hospital but that's impossible and some raids are being conducted just 50 m the hospital is overflowing and its staff and services are running Beyond capacity when this young girl wakes up she will have to be told her family was killed in an Israeli attack for now it's Hospital staff who must watch over her he's older than Israel's history shouts this man referring to the country and its establishment fear and panic spread at this Turkish Palestinian friendship hospital after Israeli bomb strike nearby there's no rest bite no comfort and nowhere safe for Palestinians in Gaza and the threat of tanks on the streets of the strip means the worst is still not over Assad bag Al jazer well let's take a look now at where the Israeli forces have been seen in Gaza tanks have approached the outskirts of the eastern part of Gaza City they were seen on Salah Aline Street and that's the main road linking northern and southern Gaza 3 kilometers from the border fence let speak to aler is hany Mahmud he joins us from Kan yunes inside the Gaza Strip so first of all hany just give us an update on what your hearing about this expanded ground [Music] operation this well within the past two hours or so uh the Israeli military has started the expansion process of of the military operations and and War on Gaza in addition to uh coverage of of heavy uh air strikes and mass bombardment of both the northern part and Gaza City mainly concentrated in D to in these two areas a a line of Tanks just uh started moving from the Eastern side of the of the the southern Eastern side of Gaza City namely the uh area of where a line of Tanks start pushing uh toward the uh the West uh right into Salah Street uh this is the one of the main roads uh in Gaza in addition to the Coastline that's connecting the northern part of Gaza with the central part and the southern part of the Gaza Strip and then continue pushing uh those tanks uh in further uh West uh closer to uh Nim Junction that is the uh the point that is uh literally connecting uh all parts of the Gaza Strip North uh and and South uh together with doing so uh the Israeli tanks that are still uh position in that area they're cutting uh the roads between the North and the South where people are unable to uh reach Gaza or the northern part uh and and and not being able to reach the southern part if they're coming from the Gaza Strip uh which makes it difficult for for people who are still trying to evacuate uh only to find themselves caught and a trapped in what is going to be a closed military uh Zone as some people out of fear ex supressed that the coming hours this area will be a military uh a closed area Okay hany Mahmud joining us there from Southern Gaza Han unes thanks very much hany let's now speak to safat Al calut he joins us also from inside the Gaza Strip closer to where those Israeli ground operations are ongoing so safwat tell us what you can see and hear from there uh I'm staying now in Al zaa neighborhood which is five more or less 5 kilometers from the uh the ongoing clashes between the Palestinian fighting groups and the Israeli tanks who entered the Gaza Gaza City today we can see uh PS of smokes coming up from uh from that area which is called narim by the way it's south of Gaza City itself and as far as we learned from our sources and that closer to that area uh that Israeli tanks now are stationing in uh in the southern part of Gaza City and they are stationing in an agricultural area after raising all the trees in that neighborhood the kasan brigades the military wing of hanas send us different statements about the clashes taking place in that area every now and then we can hear explosions from where we are and we are still uh waiting our for further related news but we we learn that the the Israeli tanks are not advancing towards the West which is the the second uh uh way or the second road that link Gaza City with the RIS of the Gaza Strip and in case if they manage to control that road the coastal Road it it will mean that Gaza will be totally divided from the southern uh or the central area under the rest of the Gaza Strip until now still severe clashes taking place between the fighting groups and the Israeli tanks who are stationing there and not advancing towards the West which is towards the sea and so what does that mean for the communication between people living in these different areas that appear to be being divided by the is Israeli military lot lots of people by the way uh they have been receiving calls from the Israeli ID asking them to leave again the the Gaza City and the Gaza STP but from Witnesses who uh who tried to cross from Gaza City towards the central area and and then to the South the Israeli tanks they opened the fires and tanks towards the people who were trying to flee from Gaza City towards the South okay safat alut bringing us the situation there from inside Gaza for the moment thanks very much safwat
