join hany Mahmud who's outside Al AXA Hospital in darl Bala that's in central Gaza hany despite Israel's claims of tactical pauses in some areas of Southern Gaza attacks are continuing bring us up to speed with what's been happening in the last few hours yes PA well we're starting to see this tactical pause as an extension to all the misleading contradictory and confusing narrative by the military there's F the fact that there is no tactical pause there is no l up in the attacks no slowing down any signs of it across the G whenever possible the Israel military continues to strike across the strip and to further causing civilian casualties and creating more tragedies for entire families and this is I want to insist on this point the pattern that we're seeing so far is entire families being obliterated inside residential homes and when I see that we're talking about uh three generation in one in one residential home and the pattern of these attacks have been happening repeatedly we were just in the middle of a crowd here at the loxa hospital outside the emergency department near the morg of the hospital where remaining family members the crowd get together those who survived the attacks those who were injured in the overnight attacks of Refuge Camp they were here at the hospital paying respect performing the last uh the last prayer as you can see from the frame these are the scenes of from the hospital the crying the crying mothers right here who just said goodbye to family members who were taking outside the hospital all the way to the graveyard overnight attacks on two overnight attacks on two residential buildings on refugee camps and a third one at Al refugee camp resulted in the murder of 17 people at least with more people is still under the rebeles we were told by paramedics and civil defense the crew member the the attack was relentless and brutal it destroyed the entire Residential Building there's still more people under the rebels and the reason we're seeing this High number of casualties because the vast majority of people are displaced and they end up living together in like in in large number in small spaces that is uh that are available right now at the the central area so every residential home is packed with many civilians and children and women who are unfortunately becoming the uh the falling casualties of these unpredictable falling bombs on residential home 17 people so far confirmed dead with at least 35 of critically injured between alaka hospital and Al hospital that's where they were transferred and uh uh and the the the tragedy of the hospital is that it doesn't have enough uh a med sufficient medical staff medical supplies to help uh save lives and help those who uh have been in injured uh in those attacks meanwhile the every once in a while we hear this constant artillery at the eastern part of the strip and this has been going on since uh as far as we recall the the week one week one of this genocidal war is part of what Israeli military is conducting the creation of a buffer zone that is already shrinking the size of the Gaza Strip yeah and more more people arriving as we saw there at the hospital alaka hospital where you are honey because of these l air strikes on Central Gaza uh the the so-called tactical pause that Israel announced on on Sunday well this was meant to allow some Aid into the Gaza Strip do we know how much of it has gone in in the last few days only less than a trickle amount of Aid we since the the the the announcement of this contradictory tactical pause that hasn't been confirmed so far either by this really or the political level uh we're talking about four trucks four commercial trucks have been allowed into the Gaza trip but as of yesterday as law enforcement Personnel were trying to secure more of these trucks commercial trucks or Aid trucks coming into Gaza they were shut out that reports of many of them were injured during the attack see these sort of attacks on Aid workers on law enforcement securing the delivery of AIDS on Aid Seekers are making the work of Aid workers quite difficult on the ground the United Nations and honor particularly has raised this concern multiple times about the lack of safety the zero safety guarantee for Aid workers and that been went on for quite some time the coat that's the Israeli security agency that accused hwa that it has a logistically problem and it held onor responsible for the inability to deliver aid while at the same time from what we're seeing and documented on the ground is the constant attacks on food distribution points that happen in the past Aid workers Aid Seekers are the real reasons that are hindering the delivery of Aid of an already broken Aid mechanism since the beginning of this genocidal War thank you very much honey for the update that's Al jazer Hy Mahmud live there in darl Bala in central Gaza make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaaz
