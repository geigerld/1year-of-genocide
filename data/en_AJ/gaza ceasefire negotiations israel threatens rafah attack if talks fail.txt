mediators are trying to reach a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas Israel says if the group rejects its latest offer it'll go ahead with a ground invasion of Rafa where more than 1 and a half million Palestinians are Sheltering Let's uh cross over to East occupied East Jerusalem Berner Smith is standing by for us there Bernard where are these ceasefire talks right now sah we know that Hamas has said it will send a delegation to Cairo on Monday and that Del delegation will discuss the ceasefire proposal it was presented by katar and Egypt as well as Israel's response and we know that Hamas said on Friday that it had received Israel's response to this ceasefire proposal and was studying it since then Hamas has released videos showing Proof of Life of three of the captives in the last uh few days stepping up the pressure on the Israeli government headed by Benjamin Netanyahu but we know that previous ceasefire talks have floundered because of the failure to bridge the gap between the two sides that Gap being that Hamas is insisting on an end to the war and a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and Israel has only ever been offering a temporary ceasefire in return for the release of about 130 odd captives and more humanitarian Aid getting in to Gaza Israel refusing to fully withdraw because it hasn't yet achieved its objectives according to Benjamin Netanyahu and that is the destruction of Hamas the destruction of its ability to attack Israel so while the Israeli government might be trying to put pressure on the Palestinians the Israeli government itself is under pressure not just uh from the US and various uh Global capitals trying to make sure that it doesn't go into Rafa but also pressure from another Direction within the Israeli cabinet itself prime minister Netanyahu really does have his hands full yeah well he's under enormous pressure from different sides of his cabinet really from the far right we've had uh bezel smotrich the Finance Minister saying that if uh Netanyahu agrees to Egypt's proposals that would constitute a humiliating defeat we though don't know what those Egyptian proposals are and also itar benav another far at Minister saying that if Netanyahu agrees to whatever these proposals are it would lead to the dissolution of the government but then from a member of his War cabin at the center right Benny Gans he says an invasion or an operation in Rafa is important but the return of hostages is more important there have been regular protests in Israel against Netanyahu accusing him of prolonging the war because if he ends the war then that will lead to elections ultimately and his own Reckoning at The Ballot Box so accusations he's prolonging the war and not considering the hostages while there's enormous pressure from the far right to go into Rafa regardless of what might happen to those hostages Bernard Smith there for us in occupied East Jerusalem thank you let's make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
