I am Marwa Abu Zaida. I am 32 years old. This man was almost, I mean, almost lying on the ground. It means something simple. The person holding her. I arrived at the hospital when they put me on the ground. I saw my brother crying. I saw my father while they were giving him first aid and checking on him for the bleeding that was occurring.  There was bleeding inside their ears and they were talking in pieces, but I don’t know to whom. I know that they all went, but I don’t know to whom. I still feel the fire, of course, and in pain. I even caught the paramedic’s hands in the ambulance. Amana. I do anything. He tells me, “My sister is there.” We have arrived as far as I have arrived.  I tell them, while you are in the ambulance, you want to call me, please call me, please let me know, I died, I caught the nurse, my death was honesty, my death, they are telling me that sometimes you were absent, but you were calling for your children to be absent. I don’t know what you are talking about, but most of them are about your children, but I don’t remember, and I don’t part with my legs. It was the first time I woke up and saw her.  I'll tell you when I woke up, but I was asking about my mother the most. I told you, this year was the most important thing, and they used to tell me about her Eid. The last thing came. I held my aunt's hand and told her: Listen, aunt, I swear to God, I don't sleep, I swear I don't do anything. My mother is done, she died. She started screaming.  And I came out and wanted them to love me. If they didn't love me, they would have taken my leg with them. Then I included my leg. I included the jinn. But what is the fault of the children? I mean, I don't understand. They deserve the missile. I mean, the first thing is if his excuse was, for example, October 7, or that they, for example, grabbed a weapon. They didn't kidnap a soldier. They didn't grab a weapon.
