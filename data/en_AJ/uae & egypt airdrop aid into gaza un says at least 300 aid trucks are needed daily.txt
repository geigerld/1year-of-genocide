let's focus back on the aid crisis uh in Gaza we can speak now to Jesse Marx who's a senior advocate for the Middle East at refugees International joins us live from Washington DC Jesse so a drops are happening Maritime supplies look set to come in but is it going to be enough we've heard 300 trucks a day of Aid are needed for the north of Gaza alone you the Israeli authorities have argued including front of the icj that they have facilitated um and they have allowed some levels of but as we can see against kind of a clear pattern of wider obstruction of Aid deliveries we have not seen sufficient amounts get in and when we have seen the Israelis attempt to provide smaller amounts of Aid outside of the UN we saw the Carnage that occurred just last week now the pursuit of more complicated and Last Resort Aid responses like airdrops like Maritime corridors further point to a level of culpability you know functionally these things are not sustainable air drops are typically The Last Resort way to deliver Aid and these are only used when there is no other option uh they're logistically challenging and they're expensive and only allow a small amount of Aid in the end meanwhile a maritime Corridor is not going to be a silver bullet think about the scale of desperation and destruction in the north that until now has gone unabated we have issues of truck availability I spoke to someone on the ground yesterday who noted that an absent of trucks is going to make it very challenging to actually move aid from the the coastline into the areas where it is critically needed across the North and this further raises questions about the ongoing closure and limitations of the borders in the South we have in the north Carney and Aras that remain closed you can easily move large amounts of Aid through those by land from the ashad port and Northern and Northern Gaza and in Israel and in the South we still have Rafa and Karam Shalom which until now are effectively blocked up all right so Aid drops insufficient Maritime Logistics difficult getting aid from Port to where they needed what's the solution open more borders we we have seen that when there is Will and when there is capability both of which are on the table right now you can move up to 500 trucks a day the Aid System into Gaza is not new there was a Aid corridor from Jordan that has been going on for nearly two decades but after October 7th that situation became increasingly more complex with more blocks now to that point the jordanians are having to move trucks without scanners in certain cases across the border or in some cases by fery across from aaba through Egypt like the system has become so complex and the number of arbitrary impediments on the table have made it such that you know a truck which might normally prior to the war take just a couple of hours to drive might take multiple days so fundamentally the Israelis have to facilitate more Aid this requires the White House is going to have to put more pressure you can pursue more complicated Concepts like Maritime corridors and aird drops but fundamentally the ground route is still the most viable How concerned are you that if a ceasefire is not agreed and it's stalled right now and that the situation is just going to spiral into one of yet more tragedy and horror for those in Gaza we thought we saw the worst case in December when they were attempting to negotiate the last ceas fire the situation has become infinitely worse we are already seeing famine and pockets of famine pop up around Gaza we've already seen the first uh casualties as a result of malnutrition and dehydration among children the situation is already at its worst and it will continue to slip you know there were experts at John Hopkins University uh just flag recently that we're expecting a worse casualty event the potential of an additional 70,000 casualties by August if things continue to move without any kind of peace or even slow down in the conflict but now we're contending with a potential Invasion into Rafa we're looking at 1.5 million people who are already starving suffering from overcrowded conditions lack of medical access and without a feasible means to deliver and surge large amounts of Aid to them we're looking at a mass casualty event in the coming months and now your team traveled to Egypt Jordan to enter Israel and Gaza uh in January I think it was wasn't it so tell us just very briefly what you found in terms of when you you spoke to those uh who've fled the fighting and also those involved in in the aid uh provisioning certainly I mean our our research painted a very different picture than what the Israelis painted at the icj right we saw routine and arbitrary denial of basic humanitarian Goods in one case we spoke with an NGO who told us because they couldn't deliver P tent poles they were forced to send in plastic tarp and duct tape and told recipients on the other side to dig through the rebel to find metal bars like that level of of control over items uh that in any other crisis would be perceived as acceptable just to provide people a level of shelter we also saw a highly complicated Israeli inspection and approval process that lacked any sense of clear and consistent instructions on top of all of this inside of Gaza we spoke with a number of people both in the UN and ngos and Palestinians themselves who saw frequent denials of basic humanitarian movements it was increasingly challenging for the UN to leave their warehouses and provide Aid North of the Gaza line into the north where even going back two months we saw severe levels of starvation and we've seen those slip even wor worse since and across the board you know NGS told us they are scared people who deliver Aid themselves are incapable of delivering Aid because of how the conduct of this war has been fought okay you know this is what Jesse I'm sorry to interrupt there but we are going to have to move on do you appreciate it it's very clear the situation is Beyond crisis point I do appreciate your perspective Jesse Mars from refugees International thank you thank you
