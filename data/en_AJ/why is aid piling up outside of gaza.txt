now a huge obstacle to getting humanitarian Aid into Gaza are the Border checks Israel insists on making before trucks are allowed to enter supplies arrive in Egypt on cargo ships at Port s or by plane at alar airport a trucks due to enter Gaz are then checked by Israeli authorities at nanza then crossed back to Egypt where they head to the Rafa crossing the last time any truck was allowed through uh toafa was February the 4th or they go to the Israeli controlled Karam Abu Salem Crossing for inspection and enter from that before the War Began around 500 trucks a day would cross into Gaza through Karam Abu Salam almost none are getting through now theam heads the Gaza Emergency Response Team for the aid group anera he's in rala and joins us now live good to have you with us uh on the program as we just heard you know Aid agency say the aid is there waiting to go in the Israelis say that they're allowing more Aid in and with no way for Al jazer to independently verify what's going on at the Crossing points which have been closed by the Israelis it's hard to understand uh where the hold up is sure thank you for having me uh as Matthew was mentioning The Crossings are really the impediment to getting eight in we're now 260 days into this war more than eight and a half months into the war so the the situation on the ground has been become desperate and the chaos is ensuing and both now the North and the South in Gaza since the operations uh in Rafa began early May so the amount of food and other Aid entering into Gaza is insufficient to meet the soaring needs uh what was before a challenging situation has become now even more desperate and almost impossible to deliver Aid on the ground so let's talk about let's just let me just jump in there and talk about the logistics here because we know what the problems are certainly from our correspondents that are within Gaza in terms of your knowledge how many Aid trucks do you estimate from your point of view waiting to go in from the official seven cross ings that are available to Gaza but in theory there are only three potentially working so so from our experience as an era we've had almost 80 trucks enter into Gaza recently uh what's needed is as the numbers have been mentioned more than 500 uh a day uh and this requires a lot of coordination uh to get in so with the delays of inspection with the delays of approvals from the Israeli side does not allow a to get in uh we do need a permanent service fire to uh happen in Gaza for the recovery to begin uh we need to also open up all the access points in so the trucks are not getting in the aid is piling piling up at zakim at Kum abum as well as jot Pier which is is open but also inaccessible the biggest thing is security uh there is no security for our staff to to to go in and uh deliver the aid uh as well as even delivering to the people people are desperately need it I'll talk about Security in a moment I just want to touch on something you just mentioned a moment ago we'll unpick this slowly is the delicate negotiations that you've discussed I know that Matthew also speaks to me on talk to Al jaaz about this in much more depth but can you explain to our viewers the amount of or the variety of the delicacy um of of the negotiations that you have to participate in to get that Aid in I mean what are those negotiations with the Israelis and how delicate are they sure I'm happy to to to describe that so to to get Aid in it requires pre-coordination at multiple levels okay you have the kath level who have to approve the aid that gets into Gaza then you have the CLA that has to give you the approval in terms of the movements within Gaza okay all this has to happen within a matter of days which means that all Aid is going to be uh will be delayed because the the approval NE necessary is needed prior to um so for that to happen all this has to happen in within 24 40 hours and and maybe also canel at the last minute for security reasons by the Israeli authorities so again what's what's lacking is not only the the the aid in the type of Aid that's being allowed in for example proteins meat chicken uh for you know this past holiday we had we could not get any meat into for the holid all day season and as you know is about Distributing and and delivering me to the people uh same thing with you know Frozen or refrigerated Goods that has not been allowed to to enter in if it does enter it gets looted on the way so this is the security aspect so you have the security issue you have the security issue but then you also have a prioritization of the type of loads you could get approved as you say perishable items most probably now have to in your mind would they come down the pecking order and that you would decide to maybe send in items be they um long-term food items or even medicines that would not be perishable on the rottin and and the weight at the Crossing points yes so so this requires very uh you know strong and strict uh coordination with Israeli authorities now I will say that when it comes to the medicines and the personal items they do come through but not at the speed at which they must be uh delivered but the problem is not that the aid reaches at the Crossing points is getting that Aid into Gaza itself this is where the difficulty lies so the aid can be at The Crossings uh but to get our trucks to reach Kum or zakim is very difficult which means that a is going to will be probably destroyed uh given the uh delays uh that require to coordinate the pickup and as well as not only that being looted on the way from or zakim now uh to Gaza so there's multiple challenges uh in this whole logistical process and it's literally imagine you're you're trying to deliver Aid piece by piece into Gaza when when the when the pipe is so small so that pipe has to widen uh for the aid to get delivered otherwise the people on on the ground are going to suffer and they're suffering already the north already you're seeing instances ofation deaths because of this indeed Mr G I think we generally have a very detailed uh picture of what's going on across the strip it's also good to get your Insight as to the difficulties that you face as an aid group thanks very much for your time and thanks for joining us thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get
