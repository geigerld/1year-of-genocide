now the UK government has announced it's suspending 30 of its 350 licenses to export arms to Israel from 2022 to June last year the UK sent nearly $75 million worth of weapons to Israel roughly 25 million was for aircraft including helicopters and drones and the licenses being suspended include components for unmanned drones and F-16 fighter jets sales of Naval systems and targeting equipment have also been halted but the UK foreign secretary David Lamy says this is not a blanket ban and only affects weapons that could be used in serious breach of international humanitarian law we have with us Luciano zakara who's joining us here in the studio who's an associate professor of Gulf politics at Qatar University welcome back to aljazera so I've been digging into this and it looks like this is only 10% of the UK's arms exports to Israel that have now been suspended and particularly what's most important is that the F35 jet components from the UK uh which is crucial for Israel which is being used in the war on Gaza is not being suspended so is this move by the UK anything more than symbolic at this point it is a little bit more than symbolic but not as uh has it doesn't have practical effects in the continuation of the war but this is signal that the UK is really concerned about how the arms are are used to violate the international law and can give um ideas to other countries that they are the main suppliers of uh of Israel which is United States and Germany of course the amount of of money $75 million in 3 years is not a significant amount so Israel will not be affected in in terms of the continuation of the war in gasa because of because of that but uh but it's targeting something that has to do with uh the the the war in gasa or how some aspect of the war are conducted in gasa and also in confrontation with do you think that other countries are going to uh follow suit at this point and look let's think about the US in particular because you mentioned the US um why is Biden not using that arms leverage on Israel at this point I mean my guest a moment ago was saying that the US is running out of patience with Israel but the US does have that leverage and according to an Israeli official an Air Force official who was speaking to the hrat newspaper he said without us Aid Israel couldn't fight Gaza Beyond a few months exactly we know this is the very beginning of the war every time that Biden warn uh Netanyahu we don't want 30,000 more people kill we don't want you to enter into Rafa we know you etc etc and he used to some extent this pressure that delayed one week uh the delivery of guns but nothing happened so everything has been a Blu from the the Biden side and so far I mean he was before worried about the campaign the political electoral campaign now he's not worried anymore he wants to finish his term with something that is not a continuation of the war but he doesn't have the elements to do so he doesn't have uh the will to pressure Netanyahu using the only arm that he has and this the most powerful arm which is uh stop the delivery of arm so far if he didn't do it in 11 months we cannot expect him to do it before the end of his term so I don't think this will happen anytime soon our understanding is that there are obstacles remaining to any uh potential ceasefire but Biden uh spoke on Monday and he said that the US is very close to presenting a final proposal that would lead to the release of Israeli captives in Gaza what does this final proposal look like to you I mean is it any different from the one that was endorsed by the US uh back in May then endorsed by a un Security Council resolution on June the 10th as first Biden cannot get uh Netanyahu to reduce this expectation about keeping forces in the Philadelphia Corridor in and trops that they are cutting gasa in two I don't think there will be any breakout in in negotiations so H the fact that he said that Nan is not doing enough or he said simply no he's not doing enough h means that he could pressure a little bit more on that sense but thenan made it very clear that this is not negotiable at all so what else can be acceptable for Hamas if they keep saying that the military presence will remain there and will prevent or or will scan everybody that is moving from the south to the north as is have been discussed in the last two round of of conversation so I don't see how we can see that um optimism of of Biden nowadays okay thank you so much for your analysis make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
