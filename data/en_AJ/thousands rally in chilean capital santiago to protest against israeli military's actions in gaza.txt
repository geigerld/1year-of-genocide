to South America now where Chileans have been gathering in their thousands in the capital Santiago to raise money for Palestinians Under Siege in Gaza our Latin America editor LCA Newman has more what you see here is part of the largest Palestinian Community outside of the Middle East this is Chile and here there are thousands of people gathered people with and without Palestinian roots to show their solidarity with the people of Gaza particularly and the occupied West Bank they are also calling for Independence for a ceasefire and for peace in that part of the world violence can't be justified for any end or by anyone but in this case it's important to support our people I may not have been born in Palestine but my roots are there this is at least the third such demonstration of solidarity in Chile Where the Palestinian Community is very influential but it's not just Palestinians or descendants of Palestinian Ians who are here we have Lebanese relatives and my heart is with the Palestinians I think it's fair to say that the Chilean population in general is horrified at what is happening in Gaza and also at what happened to Israelis after Hamas attacked a few weeks ago the generations that will survive this will grow up with hatred this massacre has to end it has to end the artists here are donating their time for this fundraiser and the proceeds of all this will go to help the hospitals or what's left of them in Gaza and in the occupied territories Luc alaz Santiago Chile
