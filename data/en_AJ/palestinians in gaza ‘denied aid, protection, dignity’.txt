for more on the humanitarian situation in Gaza we're now joined by James Elder who spokesman for Unicef the United Nations Children's Fund he is live from darala in central Gaza Mr Elder thank you very much for being with us you were last in Gaza six weeks ago I understand how would you compare the situation now and then in terms of the humanitarian crisis how much more desperate is it for the people of Gaza oh F it's dire it should surprise no one that it is this much worse because again in the last 6 weeks every single day we've had the bombardments the drones the Relentless attacks the denials of Aid so it shouldn't surprise anyone but it should it should break our hearts and and a and a Spight on our Humanity that it's been allowed to get to this point we are now at a point where where yeah we're I'm outside a hospital again this is a wartime hospital as soon as I walked in fly as soon as I walked in I found a little boy Ali who 5 days ago was asleep in the family home uh when it was struck and the next thing he fell three floors and landed in rubble I met his mother two stories above she explained that two other siblings have been killed this has gone on for the last 6 weeks F this has gone on for 250 days now of course it's sweltering heat people say to me oh people must be used to that yes they are used to the Garin are used to the heat in their family home in their home with air conditioning in their home with ceiling fans Not in tense cram together in a breathless space um with 40° heat on Sand this is what people are they're being denied Aid they're being denied protection they're being denied dignity and whilst the last 3 days fly have been Sleepless because of the bombs and the drones it's 250 days for the civilians here so yes everyone here physically psychologically is somehow just holding on I I'll ask you a bit more about the impact of the war on children in just a moment but I just wanted to get uh to Aid as you mentioned Aid there how much of it has gone into Gaza in the last few days I understand you were part of a convoy of a trucks that were trying to get into the Gaza ship can you describe to us the process of that what it takes to get those a tracks into Gaza and how many have gone in in uh these past few days yeah it's a it's a very complicated process to get in because of the the restrictions uh uh put put on top of aid but we do it we know the paperwork we know uh the Hoops to jump through but it is very difficult to get Aid in for example in May humanitarian agents got in half as many trucks of Aid FY as in April half as many when we have this critical nutrition situation why was that the case that was the case because in May of course we had the Rafer offensive The Limited quote unquote limited offensive in Rafa that meant that led to the displacement of a million people so less Aid is coming in but it's not just getting it in it's when we get it in it's making sure we can get it across the Gaza Strip without Aid workers being killed more Aid workers have been killed in this war than any War any War since the Advent of the United Nations it's extraordinary it is an incredibly difficult place to work but Palestinians and foreigners are very brave on the front lines once you get it in if we look Val yes to Wednesday a few days ago it was a mission of Unicef we were taking a truck full of nutritional and medical supplies for 10,000 children nutrition and medical supplies for 10,000 children we had all the approvals we were going to Gaza City from da B and from here uh it's basically a 40 km round trip it took 13 hours and we spent eight of those around checkpoints arguing around paperwork was it a truck was it a van all sorts of he said she said the reality is this truck was then denied access so those 10,000 children did not get that Aid now UNICEF will go back again but it's not as easy as just returning the next day because of how dangerous this is a place to operate remembering Israel as the occupying power has the legal responsibility to facilitate that Aid we must have armored vehicles with convoys right UNICEF also does doeses sanitation we do water we do protection we need to be everywhere so that was denied but fly there is an even more bitter dark aspect to that mission as we stood on the coastal line there for hours and hours and hours I was watching fishermen I was watching Men just they were probably lawyers and engineers in a past life with a single fishing net each just trying to catch a few fish for their families suddenly tanks came from the from the very large Israeli checkpoint a tank sorry a tank came next thing two every all the fishermen fled as two fishermen fled they were shot they were shot on the beach I was with other un agencies doctors and paramedics they immediately rang authorities to get us permission to access these people in case there was a sign of life to immediately get them medical care that was denied that help was denied finally finally half an hour later as those men lay there those men who were no doubt someone's brother father son as they lay there the other fishermen their family their friends took body bags that we had and went down the beach and dra brought them up I saw them one man had been shot in the back another man who still had a fishing net around his foot was shot in the neck I know that because I saw that only because we bore witness to that these are not unique events on the Gaza Strip how incredibly sad James you talked about the children and meeting children who were injured uh in uh recent Israeli attacks in Dera where you are right now there is the impact of the war of course of children being killed they're being maned but there's also malnutrition which is spreading among children fast and and reaching devastating and and unprecedented levels across Gaza because as you mentioned of a lack of humanitarian Aid and the restrictions on Aid going into Gaza what impact is this having on the children now and what impact is it going to have on them in in the [Music] future oh the the impact on children whether it's night after night of bombardments or the idea that a teenage girl or a grandmother CU all day all day maybe to get a shower the idea that disease is taking root and yes we had stabiliz stabiliz stabilization centers F they are critical places for those children with some of the mo most lethal forms of malnutrition they closed during the raffer offensive so that's thousands of children who were getting the the the treatment they needed they're not getting the treatment they needed all of this all of this the bombardments last night I was in Rafa last night it was very intense from bombardments to Apache helicopters 24/7 no there's no way anyone slept I don't sleep I'm in a building how do you sleep in a tent amid that it all f it all comes back to a ceasefire and the more and more we see the more it seems that those people who have the decision-making power on a ceasefire seem so utterly disconnected to the suffering of everyday children here on the Gaza Strip James Elder thank you so much for talking to us thank you for joining us from Gaza James Elder is a spokesman for Unicef live there from darlala in central Gaza
