well it's just past 1700 GMT that is 8:00 P.M in Gaza where people of The besieged Enclave are once again blanketed in darkness for another night there's no electricity no water no food and no hope Israel continues its bombardment of heavily congested civilian areas throughout Gaza which has so far killed 3,785 Palestinians nearly 25% of homes in Gaza have been damaged and 59 healthc care facilities have been hit that's according to the United Nations meanwhile Regional and world leaders are using diplomatic channels in the hopes of bringing humanitarian Aid to the Region's more than two million people US President Joe Biden says around 20 trucks will be permitted to go into Gaza from the Rafa Crossing with Egypt on Friday but Aid organizations say that this is not enough and that there's no guarantee it will even be distributed rasul sah has more Palestinians trapped in Gaza find nowhere safe Israeli air strikes are hitting several areas across a densely populated region including its Southern Parts which Israel had declared safe we came from Gaza City they told us to come to the South so we came to the South we found that the strikes intensified in the South we stayed in a house in front of us were strikes and behind us strikes there's no safety there's nowhere safe in Gaza you have to be ready to die and just to stay in your house Israel told Palestinians to leave Northern Gaza and head to what were supposed to be safe zones in the South but KH yunes a city in southern Gaza where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had South shelter was among the places hit by Relentless Israeli air strikes families are shattered and buildings are reduced to Rubble this family has lost at least 13 members including children the devastating bombardments on khun came hours after Israel agreed to allow Egypt to deliver limited humanitarian Aid to Gaza many of gaza's 2.3 million residents have cut down to one meal a day and resorted to drinking dirty water as Israel cut off life-saving Essentials more than 100 trucks are waiting near the Rafa Crossing on the Egyptian side but it's not expected that Aid will enter Gaza safely the Rafa Crossing is the only way for a to enter the STP it has become a focus of the conflict between Israel and Hamas as the humanitarian Crisis get worse I came from isia and have been here at the Rafa border crossing for our Palestinian Brothers since the start of the war we are staying here for Palestinians we will not leave until the aid enters Palestine to Gaza the area near the Raa crin has been bombed twice by Israel since October 7 on Wednesday Israeli raids on residential buildings in Raa killed atlast 20 Palestinians millions of Palestinians in Gaza are now waiting for much needed humanitarian aid but it seems unlikely to raise Spirits in The besieged Enclave where Palestinians more than everything else are focused on Surviving Israel's air strikes Rus SAR Al jazer tar kabu AUM joins us live from Han Yunis in southern Gaza Tark that area has been under constant Israeli bombardment what can you tell us and what have you been seeing well another bloody night of uh Israeli ongoing strikes really uh continue claiming the life till this current moment for more than 300 Palestinian just only uh today uh the Israeli bombardment in the Gaza continu in every single corner of the besieged territory uh in khuna City only uh 37 Palestinians were uh killed by the Israeli ongoing strikes different areas were hit during the past hour including jabalia refugee camp this area is is very densely populated area and the strike was close to uh a United Nation Affiliated school which is full of displaced people who really evacuated from the Eastern areas of the Gaza Strip uh till this current moment um thousands and t t of thousands of Palestinians really evacuated the houses moving forward to the sou areas of the besieged uh territory while other people refused to evacuate the houses to remain inside the houses simply because they feel that there is no any safe shelter in the site the Gaza STP the majority of the Israeli uh victims of the majority of the Israeli attacks victims were young children and women uh today I've heard a very uh horrific story from one of the doctors saying that he was treating uh a Palestinian kid uh the Palestinian kid whispered in his ears and I going to be okay I the doctor uh tried to assure him that yeah you're going to be okay the doctor asked the kid why you are asking me that the kid answered because my mother is a blant and no one will take care of her after the death of the rest of my family members this is the current situation it's like the Gaza Strip well that's a that's a heartbreaking story of course that you're bringing us um what are people saying about the aid the aid that is supposed to come into Gaza tomorrow Friday we're talking about 20 trucks for 2 million people people inside the Gaza Strip after 13 days of fighting they really become really exhausted and tired they waiting for inh humanitarian Aid in order to mitigate the current crisis that they are experiencing uh 20 Trucks Only are not yet enough to provide humanitarian aid for more than 2.3 million Palestinians who are residing inside a very uh small area uh in the besieged uh territory uh more meanwhile there are hundreds of trucks still in the Egyptian site waiting for further permissions in order to flow into the Gaza Strip yet only the shelters that are affiliated to the United Nations are full of residents who were displaced from their houses according to the United Nations more than 400,000 Palestinians are residing in schools Affiliated to the uh honor generally so 20 trucks won't be really enough and still Limited in order to uh mitigate the humanitarian crisis that is deteriorating day after day due to the Israeli ongoing closer of borders and the prevention of in of inessential items for the besieged territory T Abu Zoom
