and as we've been reporting Hezbollah Fighters have shelled territory under Israeli occupation with mortar strikes Israel has fired artillery following that shabal Farms is situated along the border between Lebanon and Syria's Golden Heights which was occupied by Israel in 1967 Zur joins us now live from Southern Lebanon let's start with the location where hasah fired upon how significant is it that it chose the Shabah Farms rather than an area in the South along the border with Israel well yes hasbalah treading carefully trying to avoid a wider confrontation but sending a message to the Israelis that we are here we are ready uh to join the fight Shiba is a territory that is occupied by Israel seen by Lebanon as its own territory so Hezbollah saying that this is a legitimate fight but in its statement also saying that it is showing solidarity with the Palestinian people who are fighting the Israelis and a short while ago a high ranking Hezbollah official really made the group's position even clearer he said that we are not staying neutral in this conflict in his words today we sent a message through the attack that was carried out in Shiba and this Israel should understand this clearly and in its in his words Israel and the United States should stop this stupidity that was the word that they Ed Stop This stupidity or else the whole region will be involved in this war so basically saying that uh the equation that Hezbollah has established uh unifying the fronts of the different Lebanese armed groups as as well as Palestinian armed groups part of the so-called axis of resistance will come together and uh wage this this this war together so this is the message coming from Hezbollah at the moment there is a cautious calm along the border just behind me uh on top of that Hill is the Israeli position that was targeted in the early hours of the morning Zena what is the bottom line for many people who I'm sure have the question on their minds are we going to see a repeat of the 2006 W is this escalating in the south of Lebanon people are worried many Lebanese are worried because that was a devastating War more than a month in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah and that's why Hezbollah knows that it has domestic political opponents uh and many people here will say this country cannot afford a war the state is nearly uh bankrupt and there is a dire economic crisis now in its fourth year and there's also a political crisis where there is no president there is no functioning government uh there is a need for billions of dollars to revive the economy and many people believe that Hezbollah should not act on its own it should respect the state sovereignty it should not be the one who decides whether this country is at war or peace and many accuse the group of being an arm of Iran and implementing Iran's policy the group does not hide away of or shy away from the fact that it is it is backed by Iran and it receives funding from Iran so this is definitely um hezbollah's involvement in this war will definitely uh divide the society even further and deepen uh the political crisis in the country all right thank you so much well Nimrod gorin is joining us now from West Jerusalem he's a senior fellow for Israeli Affairs at the Middle East Institute good to have you with us so first of all how much of a failure how politically compromising is this for the Israeli government the Israeli discussion is still dealing with the security rather than with the political because we are experiencing a security event that is unprecedented in Israel history very different than previous escalations or Cycles with Warfare with g at this time it was not an evolving crisis out of any Israeli action it was out of the blue targeting civilians large losses still ongoing many being captive so I think the Israeli Focus now is in how to solve the current security situation and deal with the politics later you say out of the blue but let me read to you here a statement by the Secretary General of Amnesty International dated October the 7th where from what she's saying it doesn't seem out of the blue she references the need for the Israeli government to refrain from inciting violence tension in the occupied West Bank she calls for the root causes of the violence to be addressed and goes on to list the 16y yearlong illegal blockade on Gaza and ending other aspects of quote Israel's system of apartheid opposed on all Palestinians do you think that this might shift Israeli thinking somewhere to start thinking about dealing with the root causes I think those are different things because you know we know the Israel Palestinian conflict is longlasting and it has different attitudes towards it in different approaches there are different reports mentioning different situation but reality is bad reality is bad for the Palestinians under occupation it's bad for Israelis who do not enjoy peace with their neighbors and this is ongoing and we saw lots of escalation along the way and lots of efforts to resolve the conflict which usually did not succeed when I mention out of the blue I referring to the immediate situation prior to yesterday attack if you recall previous Cycles in Gaza usually there were either assassinations or Rockets toward the nearby vill in Gaza it was something that went on we have it may not have been very reported in all parts of the press but we have been covering uh incidents of Israeli actions in the alaka mamos compound which the Palestinians and Palestinian factions even in Gaza are warning that this is very provocative we've seen a rise in settler attacks which we've covered extensively has this do you think this is not in the Israeli public opinion is not part of the story of why these people are breaking out of 16 years of Siege and going on this kind of attack into into Israel what I'm saying is that this incident has happened even before remember before Ramadan of this year there were T in AA there were several rounds of escalation with the PJ butan Islamic Jihad based on similar issues so the core issues of the conflict is definitely there the practicalities of how this conflict is handled have been managed differently until what happened yesterday so this is why what is happening is is different okay the reality is there and we do not nobody's denying it but what is happening is very different than before and the type of action has been taken yesterday against Israeli civilians is a scope that never happens so there is ways to do the Warfare I think what we saw yesterday it is a reminds that cres all of those lines and enters a new reality again without denying the difficult situation isra and Palestinians are living at during the last decad actually given the large number of Israeli casualties so far do you think that this government this Israeli government is going to be under intense pressure now to make not only the very intense and and bloody air strikes which have cost a lot of Palestinian civilian lives but a ground defensive as well do do you kind of feel like there's no way out now for this Israeli government other than going with a ground offensive into Gaza I think it's difficult to anticipate and it's not necessarily that one solution will be taken over the other we do not know I think currently the the goal is to prevent the fighting to continue within Israeli territory there are still incidents ongoing within the Israeli borders I think there is a strong will to take action against the military wing of Hamas there is a willingness to prevent further escalation into other areas you know we spoke before about Leon in your report these are things that Israel is not interested in so I think that's what we'll see in the coming future whatever tactics will be used to achieve that I think it's difficult for us to anticipate if Israel does launch a ground offensive where does it go to next it doesn't really link to the ground offensive because the political or the Strategic goal of such a cycle of violence should be the same whatever tactic is being operated yes what the Prime Minister said is about taking a price from the Hamas and losing having to lose its military capacity that doesn't mean that this goal could be achieved only by one mean of action or the other so I would say the tactic that is being used is unrelated to the overall goal and these two things can be discussed in parallel has it been a surp has the capabilities of Hamas come as a surprise launching an attack like this by land by air and so on on yes what happened was a surprise you know there were discussions in the past seeing this as a scenario that Kamas would like to see happening so I think the sense of surprise is about the actual implementation of this scenario the ability it was made possible and happened so it's not only the surprise from Kamas it's also the surprise of how Isel was expected to be able to deal with such a situation and prevent it and this didn't happen and it does relate also to political discussions within Israel that happened throughout the last month about where the focus of this government was and whether it was on the right issues that served the best Israel is interest all right thank you very much for your analysis on that appreciate your time nimrod goren
