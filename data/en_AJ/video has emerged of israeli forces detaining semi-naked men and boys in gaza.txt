well Israeli forces are facing renewed criticism over their treatment of detainees after video emerged of Palestinians stripped to their underwear and rounded up in Gaza well for more on this let's go to sard haat who's live for us in Tel Aviv and sard this is another video of Palestinian men and boys being held prisoner being stripped of their clothes what has the reaction been like there yeah that's right as you said a humiliating once again for Palestinians that already feel that they are constantly humiliated even before uh this war on Gaza not only in Gaz but also in the occupied territories now in terms of this video this is the second one in the space of a few weeks a couple of weeks ago a video was released that caused International outrage there was an outpouring of anger towards uh seeing these videos showing Palestinian men young and old and clearly those that weren't able to walk easily because of their age being made and forced to sit down uh in just their underwear when they were questioned about the weather when one of the uh media channels International media channels asked them about you know the fact that it's all so cold at the moment um they said that the cold weather here is not as cold as anywhere else in the world and really um then said that this wasn't their material that they would ensure that videos like this wouldn't uh be filmed because this does uh uh any videos of uh prisoners of War does go against the international uh uh laws and Geneva Convention uh and they said they would ensure that this wouldn't happen again well of course another video has been released showing uh similar scenes this time in a football uh Stadium you can see there that they are made uh to uh stand there in rows with distance between them and the reason why the Israelis gave it last time why they had stripped them down to their underwear where is that they said it was to ensure that they didn't have explosives on them but there's a multitude of problems here not only as I was saying that it goes against International laws to film them in the first place or even take uh photos uh but also it's the fact that they treat the Palestinians as if all of them are Hamas so there is already a sense that uh those that are being treated this way are being treated as if they are criminals including uh children this is what happened last time and last time when the video was released you had Palestinians in Gaza recognizing some of those in those videos and saying this isn't even possible some of these were kids some of them were underage so that just shows you more video evidence there uh and it will be interesting to see whether it will receive any International reaction again okay thanks so much s s Hideout for us in Tel Aviv
