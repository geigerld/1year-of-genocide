and you're watching aljaz a reminder of our headlines this hour Hamas says Fierce fighting has been taking place in the Gaza Strip Israel's military has cut off the road between the city and deral Bala and Central Gaza dividing the territory into three more than 100 Palestinians have been killed in overnight Israeli strikes on Gaza and this brings the death toll since Saturday to more than 800 rescue workers in Rafa worked through the night rescuing dozens of people trapped under the rubble Israel's Army has been ordering people to head there for what it says is their own safety let's get more on the view from Israel now AKA Eldor joins us you're a contributor to the Israeli newspaper haret and you're joining us uh from Tel Aviv so look AKA my previous guest fears that Israel's endgame in Gaza is to force Palestinians out of the strip and now the Israeli paper Israel hyam reported a few days ago and in fact it was your paper haret that alerted me to to this that Netanyahu asked a loyalist a confidant for a plan to quote thin out the population of Gaza I we can't independently verify this this is reporting from Israel H but what do you make of that and does that line up with what you're seeing currently in Gaza uh well sir this is not a very new idea actually uh those people from the hardcore settlements in the West Bank not uh just the people who uh were moved out of Gaza uh one of their final status settlement included the transfer of the Palestinians both from the West Bank and from Gaza to Sinai they believe that uh Egypt uh will take the money and make those people run into uh Sinai this isn't old dream or if you like so fantasy of the Israelis who believe that a two-state solution can be exercised in Sinai so there will be greater Israel from the sea to the river and maybe a Palestinian State uh in in Sinai that uh from from where Israel has withdrawn uh right after we signed the peace agreement with Egypt but actually uh even netan let alone uh those uh zealots in the in the settlements uh they don't call the shots the uh solution of the settlement is in the hands of the president of the United States as you know secretary blinkin visited uh Israel and the the region four times he he participates permanently in the inner cabinets meetings and uh I I don't think that the Americans are even considering this kind of a solution since uh president AI made it clear to them and to netan that Egypt is not going to solve our problems this has been a red line this has been a red line expressed by the Americans that they don't want to see displacement of the Palestinian population you also point out that the the Egyptians have said categorically no Palestinians shouldn't be displaced but so you mentioned that you say the solution lies actually with the US president do you feel right now that the Israeli War cabinet is listening to the Americans uh yes and not only because of uh the very fact that America is holding the uh veto option the UN if not for the UN I believe that the security Council would um already take uh maybe even sanctions against Israel for committing war crimes and since it's obviously that the United States will not allow this the Security Council is very quiet the other thing is that uh the Americans are keep flying Israel with uh those uh heavy bombs and uh other ammunition that comes on a daily basis to Israel so uh the United States I think never had so much such a big leverage on Israel in the last 50 years since the yumo war but what do you see happening on the ground what do you see happening on the ground that gives you a sense that Israel is listening because we're reporting that 8 00 Palestinians have been killed in the last in the last few days it doesn't seem like Israel is being more careful uh to mitigate Palestinian civilian losses as the US has asked them to do yeah um I I think that uh Israel is running out of time the the question and now we go back to domestic politics in the United States President Biden has to look at his uh at the polls and see what is the mood in the in his own constituency among Democrats and so far they are willing to give Israel more time um I'm afraid that uh most of them are not watching El jazer so they don't really as well as the Israeli public and uh since Israeli journalists are not allowed into Gaza what they get from the Israeli media and from the American Media is footage about uh the hostages coming back about and and this is very important don't mean don't get me wrong uh harassment uh and uh what the United States really wants is to get eight to nine American uh hostages and uh uh among them Israeli soldiers who have dual citizenship dual passports there is a lot of PR now on the Israeli government on the uh hostages more than to stop the war the the Israeli mood is since the as your reporter just mentioned because of those stories horrible stories about sexual harassments and torture and uh dividing families the pressure on the government is even to stop the war and uh to go back back to the negotiation table and agree on a longer truce to allow a reunification of families to get the women out and the old men so uh I think that what we're going to see the next few days is more Israeli uh people okay yeah marching against the government okay AKA Eldar contributor to the Israeli newspaper RS pleasure to have you on the show this hour thank you very much thank you sir
