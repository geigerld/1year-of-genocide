Tam carut is an assistant professor of public policy at The doar Institute for Graduate Studies he's with me here in the studio welcome back I mean another day of devastating strikes I mean I think we need to pause here and really take stock of what we're looking at we've all seen things over the past month that we can't unsee um attacks on two unra schools the expulsion of hundreds of people from the AL shifer Hospital some of them so critically injured they literally have to be wheeled down the road in their hospital beds all the while the International Community are redundant they can't do anything and we're in this vacuum and Israel now seems to be ready to exploit that vacuum with a new phase of the conflict possibly n of course I mean Israel has a free hand to do whatever it wants in Gaza it has a green light from from Big Powers especially from the US from its Western allies so there is no surprise about about the current situation in Gaza and the the horrible massacres we're seeing and from the beginning Israeli official statements were clear about this they say Gaza North stage one then stage two it will be the the south of Gaza Etc so it's it's they're literally implementing what they have promised what they have the key goals of their of of this war on Gaza and the thing is now we just have seen a shift in in some International statements coming from the west from the US asking Israel to restrain its uh it's its uh its Force you know and and the way it's conducting its War but it it's just it's just talk there's nothing no real mechanisms to restrain Israel from from what it's from the crimes it's committing on Gaza so sadly I just I fear and I fear that it's it's going to get worse I mean for for gazans for Palestinians in Gaza and and and I fear that the transfer scenario is currently being under the making I mean emptying Gaza and the north from its residence almost 1.1 million pushing them to the south at the same time in parallel starting a military operation in the South around theunis area eventually the 2 million 2.3 million population of Gaza will be cornered in a small part of Gaza in the South near the Egyptian borders and what's next I mean it's it's going to be an explosion I mean an exodus and then Egypt and Arab countries should should start really worrying because Israel so far is creating all the conditions for a big transfer to happen at a sudden let's look at some of the evidence to suggest that Kan Unis is next we've heard from our correspondent on the ground saying people are already being told to leave Western carudas leaflets have being dropped by Israeli forces for for several uh days now this also from former Israeli Prime Minister edmer in a recent interview he said if you had asked me a few weeks ago I would have said KH yunice is the command center for Hamas that is the long held security opinion on Gaza I mean this whole idea that the north was the Strategic aim of the Israeli military just doesn't seem to be true at all the whole of the Gaza Strip seems to be the objetive of course I mean for them I mean this is their golden opportunity especially with the complicity of the International Community Arab countries are are not there up to the up to the massacres and the crimes happening to Gaza with their weak positions the positions they have taken their unability to to exercise any pressure on on their allies in the ways of International Community so for Israel I mean like yes why not I mean you follow Israeli media and what you hear from commentators politicians it's sick ing I mean it's it's they're they're they're very obvious and clear about the transfer plans some of them are even speaking or or talking about a post uh a postwar Gaza where they have building new settlements or new beaches whatever it's it's for I mean they talk about it publicly it's not a secret anymore and we should take everything that comes from from their people there on media and from the politicians very seriously especially that the International Community has Faith Palestinians and Israel still has an upper hand and a freehand to do whatever it wants in Gaza what are the consequences of further inaction by Regional players by Arab states in the region do you think it's it's it's going to spill over to their own countries I mean I mean Jordan Egypt I mean once let's I mean God forbids if they're done with Gaza and there is a transfer I mean how would this transform into in in in in Egypt you know Egypt's pos position you know I mean Egypt has a six years war war with Israel Over C liberating and for them also the the transfer scenario is a nightmare I mean especially in sa if it happens in sa so this could trigger a regional conflict with Egypt the jordanians are very nervous at the same time because once the Israelis are done with Gaza this right the radicalized Israeli Society is very clear about also transferring Palestinians and the West Bank so they could start another phase of this war you know so you never know it's like a it's like a snowball but if if it's not restrained now if there is no real pressure and political economic pressure on Israel and on on key Western arise to Arab countries I think the Israelis have an upper hand in in in doing whatever they want and that's a problem and we are the moment definitely not seeing anybody apply enough pressure to see the breaks put on by Israel tamama kud great to hear your analysis thank you my pleasure
