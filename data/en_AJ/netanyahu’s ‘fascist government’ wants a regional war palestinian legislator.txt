now breaking news this hour is the political leader of Hamas Ismael Hana has been assassinated in Iran he and one of his bodyguards were killed in a strike in tran State media say he was staying in a special residence for War veterans when the attack happened at about 2: a.m. local time Iran says it's investigating the killing and tamas says the assassination will not go unanswered well Palestinian Authority president mmud Abbas has released a statement saying he strongly condemns the assassination of Hamas leader is m Han as a cowardly act and a dangerous development he also called on Palestinians to unite and be patient and steadfast in the face of Israeli occupation bakti who is a politician and Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative he joins us uh on Skype from rala thanks very much for being with us on Al jazer on what is another remarkable day uh here first of all just how surprised were you when you first heard the news that is Hana was assassin uned in Iran of course it was a surprise that he was assassinated in Iran but it wasn't a surprised that Netanyahu could do such a crime I think what Israel did is a grave criminal cowardly political assassination something that nobody should accept but Netanyahu is clear here what you have in Israel now is a fascist government in every sense of the word and I think the rise of fascism in Israel is now trying to push the whole region into a global confrontation uh what Netanyahu did is a very clear indication that he wants a regional war and he wants even to drag to drag the United States into a confrontation with Iran not only with Palestinians so it's a grave grave development and what is most surprising is to hear a person like the Secretary of Defense from the United States Austin saying that United States will defend Israel they're allowing Israel to act as a criminal fascist attacking and killing people in Lebanon attacking and killing people in tahan attacking and killing Palestinians committing a terrible war crimes terrible war crimes like genocide and Collective punishment and yet they want to defend the criminal the aggressor the attacker that is really very serious and it shows that the United States has no wisdom whatsoever in responding to what Netanyahu is doing but I emphasize what you see today is really a rise of fashion in Israel you've seen what these fascists did in stim man the Israeli prison you've seen what they are doing now and in my opinion both Netanyahu and Galant and other Israeli leaders are trying to save their skin by expanding this confrontation expanding this war and uh because they want to save themselves well you're talking about the potential for Global confrontation and uh the escalation right now we've obviously heard from Iran supreme leader who says uh that it is Iran's Duty uh to avenge his death uh with hamas's armed Wing has said uh the his killing will have enormous consequences and Iran's revolutionary guard has just put out a statement saying it will be met with a harsh and painful response so what sort of response do you think we can expect from Iran I think Iran was put in a very difficult position because if it doesn't respond it would lose it would it will lose a lot of of its uh its uh status in the region so I am sure there will be a response uh and the question here is first of all will this Israeli assassination break the Palestinian resistance on the contrary it will strengthen it will it break Hamas on the opposite every assassination before has strengthened any resistance groups that was subjected to such atrocity uh but will this lead to Palestinian Unity that's what we hope for that's what we need now a Palestinian unified leadership a Palestinian unified leadership in front of this and of course Iran will have to respond and that's exactly what Netanyahu wants Netanyahu wants to expand this war wants to make it a regional confrontation and the only country in the world that can restrain now these fascists in Israel is the United States of America if it wants to do so if it doesn't then it's going to to be playing in a very dangerous game that could threaten the whole region yeah it's obviously still very early in the morning in the United States at this point in time what are you expecting what are you hoping to hear uh when uh the United States wakes up and we start getting more lines uh from the political players there if they still have any reason left they should condemn what Hamas what what Israel did they should condemn Israel for this assassination they should force Israel to accept a ceasefire agreement and start a process of deescalation but I am not sure they will do that I think they wouldn't unfortunately natany has been dragging Biden behind him during the last 10 months he has dragged Nat Biden and the American Administration not only in supporting his genocide but actually in participating in it and there will be horrifying consequences to that what is really surprising to me is where is the Strategic mind in United States if they get involved now in a confrontation with Iran in the Middle East which is exactly what Netanyahu has been dreaming about this is exactly what Netanyahu pushed for when he pushed the United States to cancel the agreement with Iran if they go in that direction what will happen to their position strategically worldwide I think it's a very dangerous situation but at the end of the day one has to understand and people have to understand that what Israel has done will not break the Palestinian resistance will not break the Palestinian people's will to achieve our freedom on the contrary what Israel has done has convinced every Palestinian man woman and child that our future our Liberation our freedom cannot happen without resisting this terrible occupation and resisting these terrible crimes that are committed against our people Mustafa as always we really do
