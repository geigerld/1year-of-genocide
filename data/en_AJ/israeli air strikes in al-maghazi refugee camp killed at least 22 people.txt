a frantic search for survivors Southern Gaza is now more densely populated than before with displaced Palestinians packed into areas where Israel says they will be safe from the air strikes a young boy is pulled from the rebel he's disorientated what's your name his Rescuers asked can you stand up they ask he tells Rescuers his family was at home with him they were sleeping their fate is unknown others are still trapped under the rubble Rescuers call out hoping anyone still alive will hear them and respond this is the harsh reality for Palestinians a lack of equipment and digging with their bare hands in the morning they assess the damage and are still search in this residential house was pounded by Israeli missiles all inside are innocent civilians there are no militants here this residential building was shelled by the Israeli war planes it housed about 90 persons the households together with more than 70 gin displaced from the north about 22 were confirmed killed the rest are still missing forcibly displaced the making makeshift shelters and sand there's a lack of food and water they make do with what they can we evacuated our homes with nothing the most challenging aspect is the cold I wear my husband's pants to keep warm and people gave us blankets we slept on the sand No Rest bite for Palestinians who have already been displaced several times Israel is targeting the camp with smoke bombs there's not a single place in Gaza that is safe there is simply nowhere to go as said B Al jazer let's go to our correspondent hany mmud he's joining us live from Southern Gaza he's in Rafa foras hany firstly tell us about these new evacuation orders the Israeli military has issued where is it telling people to go to this time yes well people have been ordered sharply uh with a threatening tone in the statement as of early our this morning residents of the northern part of Gaza City are ordered to evacuate uh their uh residential homes and the evacuation centers uh namely the hona designated shelters for evacuates uh to take Salah Road and go all the way to the city of darel balah now derah is a central part of Gaza Strip it's the middle area that separates the northern part and the southern part now this area have been effectively separated and cut off from the the rest of the the Gaza Strip with serious lack of food and and and water and and basic supplies it's becoming very very risky for people to stand there as they're running out of every Bas is there's actually a starvation going on in that area but people within the past two days were also told to evacuate the Eastern neighborhood of of Gaza uh City and the northern part namely jabal Fiji camp we have Shaya neighborhood zun neighborhood and other L populated neighborhood all the way directly to the western side of Gaza of the Gaza Strip but they found themselves under heavy bombardment and Relentless air strike people had no other chice but to flee to whatever facilities was still remaining in the area people in Gaza ran to a shifa hospital to seeking refuge and shter in its building and now what's going on people are told to go to the central part yeah it's certain safe as for weeks now for weeks we've seen the Israeli Army telling people to go further and further south Bala is not in the South and when they do make it to the South Rafa for where you are for example is completely overwhelmed by the number of people who've been displaced many times exactly and this is confirmed very consistent what we see on the ground there's the this war is taken multiple levels now there is the North and the Gaza destroyed completely entire every me been destroyed the central part is destroyed by starvation people have cut off from the rest of the strip with no access to anything and now Khan units is under heavy bombardment but ra City it's double there is bombardment going on Relentless air strike but people keeping keep pushed into Raa we talk about a population that went from 260,000 th000 people all the way to 1 million people in ra now it's running out of space running out of supplies and it's not safe that's the problem people are told it is safe to avoid getting bombed in the North and the and Gaz find them themselves under heavy bombardment there are evidence of this within the past weeks mainly this place and evacu got killed in the central part in kanun and City and ra City just within hours of their arrival and and that's why there is huge mistrust and and lack of of of of faith in the Israeli narrative and mainly people describe it as being vague contradictory and confusing for the most part the area they've been told to go to is under heavy bombardment once again they get killed in those safe area they're being killed if they move and they're being killed if they stay that is hanni Mahmud live for us in Rafa in southern Gaza
