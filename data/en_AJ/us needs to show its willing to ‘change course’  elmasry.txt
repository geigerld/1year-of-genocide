well joining us here on set is Muhammad masri he's a political analyst and also professor of media studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies hi again Muhammad um uh when you look at the Israeli delegation that's in Qatar attending the ceasefire talks do you think that they have enough of a mandate to be able to move the negotiations forward I don't think the issue is is the Mandate at all um I think the issue is what does Israel want uh out of this negotiation versus what Hamas wants out of this negotiation as we've been discussing Hamas wants permanent ceasefire they want an end to the violence in Gaza and Israel wants some assurance that it's going to be allowed to to continue that so the question is and has been for many weeks how do we reconcile those two diverging uh positions is it possible to say who's who's negotiating from a sort of a stronger position a position of strength well I would say that Israel's negotiating from a position of strength based on based on the fact that they're supported by the United States I mean the United States holds all the leverage they are the one entity that could end all this tomorrow with a with a phone call um but which has been unwilling to do so so if they have support from the United States and there isn't you know any sort of consequence for what um uh for what they're doing in Gaza then um they're free to either negotiate a deal that works for them right that meets their conditions or continue continue fighting much is being said about these divisions uh between Biden and Netanyahu are there enough to make a difference to to what's happening on the ground in Gaza well I think we have to keep a close eye on it I don't want to belittle some of the differences that we've seen emerge in recent weeks and and and how the US has sort of uh ramped up some of its rhetoric on uh Israel against Israel critical of Israel but I'm much more interested in what the United States is doing than what the United States is saying they are issuing these sort of U verbal slaps on the wrist from time time to time we've seen that from Biden from blinkin and from others in the US Administration but until the US actually shows that it's willing to change course until they're actually uh willing to demonstrate that they're going to implement this kind of Redline policy that they're going to for instance stop supplying Israel for weapons then I think it's just more of the same okay and and speaking of uh the weapon sales we we now hear from Canada that it's saying that it will hold future armed sales to Israel uh there was a non-binding vote that was held in the House of Commons how how significant of a development is this I think it's important I think what we have to remember is that while this is an Israeli genocide uh plausible genocide on Gaza and on the Palestinian people um it is one that is has been supported by Western governments like Canada and increasingly Western governments are becoming uh uncomfortable um having their reputations uh smeared by what is probably going to be ruled a genocide here in the next few years at the at the at the highest court in the world and so you're seeing countries now like Canada trying to distance themselves they want to be able to say well look we we took a stand at at a at a particular Point uh in time and so from that standpoint I think it's significant it also signals to Israel that um their time could be running out they don't have an unlimited supply of time to carry out this war okay Muhammad thank thank you so much or
