and speak to AR here is Sonia Gayo so Sonia this is one of the first large rallies under the new labor government that announced of course that it's stopping at least some arms deliveries to Israel nevertheless what is the message there at the rally well the message Remains the Same really there is a concerted sense of frustration that to those who've gathered here and Sly to the organizers that not much has changed yes even though the foreign secretary David Lamy uh announced the immediate suspension of 30 arms export licenses to Israel that's out of a total of 350 now this doesn't come anywhere near close to any sort of arms embargo and this was a point that the foreign secretary David Lamy stressed himself and it certainly doesn't come anywhere near the arms embargo that was put in in 1982 when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister and put an arms embargo and an oil embargo on Israel uh for its part in the war in the Lebanon war then but so this sense of frustration is very much being communicated here uh there perhaps wasn't a great sense of hope that there would be a dramatic shift as a new government came in but what the demonstrators and the organizers of the demonstrators are determined to do is to keep up the voice keep up their protest against the ongoing war in Gaza and to make sure that the UK government is fully aware of it and that they're not going to uh hinder this form of protest while they can Antonio this rally is also the first since that series of racially motivated riots in several towns and cities in the UK a few weeks ago has all of that been factored into the decision to go ahead with this [Music] March well suddenly the organizers have said that this is obviously a Palestinian solidarity March in terms of what's happening in G but they've also said it is a rallying call for the UK government to take islamophobia seriously now we have just seen in the UK we've seen a very tense summer in certain cities outside of London uh that have really struggled with this issue uh where there have been very uh tough anti-immigration and voices that have come out and rioted against the current UK policy now with that in mind you've had to sort of reconcile the fact that uh the riots had caused immense damage there was even a hotel in which Asylum Seekers had been staying in that was lit up in Flames by some of those riters so a very very tense situation indeed uh what the demonstrators are calling for here is for the government the Home Secretary and for the prime minister kissama to take those sentiment seriously and to underscore that islamophobia is still clear and present danger in the UK which does need to be resolved urgently okay Sonia many thanks for that Sonia goo in London make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
