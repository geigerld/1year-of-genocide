we have with us Al jazer senior political analyst Marwan bishara he's joining us from London I'm sure you heard what the um Israeli Prime Minister had to say just a few hours ago when he gave that press conference notable that he tried to portray um unity in that press conference along with his defense minister do you think that they're actually United Marwan I think they're United now because they feel that there's a common enemy Hamas and there is a there's a impossible mission uh which is the occupation of Gaza and the land Invasion and hence they need to uh project a united front but I think behind that facade there is some serious Division and uh we can sort of uh boil it down to three elements the personal one they hate each other's guts there is no love lost between these three men especially the two generals in Nano because briefly stabbed them both in the back he walked away and stabbed guns in the back when they formed a coalition 2020 and guns would never forget him for that and he fired his defense minister if you remember earlier in the year Galant and then he had to bring him back only under public and American pressure so these three people hate each other second there's there is political difference between them they think he holds the ultimate responsibility for the failure because of his joining with fanatical ministers fanatical parties that really drove Israel to the to the extreme right the fanatical fascist right they believe the military does have responsibility but the ultimate responsibility lies with him and his Reckless politics three I think they disagreed on the end game in Gaza the two generals believe it has to be simply one of breaking hamas's military capabilities and administrative presence in Gaza nanyo and his fanatical allies in the government believe they need to occupy Gaza assassinate all Hamas leaders and end Hamas andate Hamas as an idea the general General thing this is not doable you cannot fight an idea or a party or an organization with tanks and artillery that this is something that's done much later down the road for the time being they believe it's about a military mission right so then what does this mean what does this mean for the people of Gaza and and the unfolding War yes um I think that's why I sensed from Netanyahu when he said our our mission is to defeat Hamas militarily I think that means he's embracing the General's idea and America's idea of what the war is about what the end game is because America has warned again and again occupation is a big mistake and Secretary State blinkin told the Israelis that they need to apply their strategies to their endgame and that again occupation and ending Hamas period is not a good uh you know idea as it were and so now for the time being as you would say they are united on crushing whatever they can Crush in terms of Hamas presence in Gaza militarily and administratively and that means continued bombing and that means probably an invasion how partial or how comprehensive it remains to be seen they did not address it we don't know exactly what it is Galant is speaking about actually occupying Gaza and imposing a security regime the Americans think that's a mistake I think we are 20 days in and they are trying to make up their minds as they go along because this is an impossible mission they kept telling us for 25 minutes in their propaganda that this is a long and painful War because they are preparing the Israeli public for that and uh Marwan just away from the Israeli politics for a moment you saw the protests take place right around the world um today and over the past couple of days do you think that these protests have any impact at all on the governments and their positions they do uh but not a direct one they do in terms of changing the international mood because eventually the isra the Israeli government cannot launch this war all on its own and if you heard uh president not president prime minister an who lie basically lie about the fact that all of these uh heads of States congratulated him they probably you know supported him and whatever and gave him unconditional support even but even even that now is weighing because we've seen the British uh abstain yesterday in the vot in the United Nations General Assembly we saw the French vote in favor of uh of the humanitarian truth so I think we've seen slowly but surely the public opinion changing and the leaders needed to start distance distancing themselves bit by bit from the uh apocalyptical plan that Netanyahu is hoping to achieve in Gaza and perhaps widening the war against Iran because if you heard him again clearly today he was saying that Iran is not just Patron but it's partner of Hamas in this October 7 operation and hence he's actually signaling Iran as the one that's standing behind Hamas today and hence it needs to be taken care of this kind of apocalyptical scenario would probably Drive the West into another Regional like 2003 that would be disastrous for for everyone that's why today in London for example I mean it was exactly a reminder of the kind of atmosphere that we saw prior to the 2003 war against Iraq no one in the west wants to repeat that kind of disaster with that kind of a blowback 20 years of war that basically live to Nowhere all right thank you so much mam bishar for that analysis from London thank you
