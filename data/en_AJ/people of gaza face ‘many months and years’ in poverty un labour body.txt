now Palestinians in Gaza are in the middle of a humanitarian catastrophe of Epic Proportions that's according to the international labor organization the UN agency says the effect of Israel's war uh on the lives and livelihoods across the occupied Palestinian territories is unlike anything seen before the ILO says 192,000 Palestinians in Gaza have lost their jobs since October that is about 66% of total employment in the strip the Ripple effects of Israel's Onslaught on Gaza are being felt across the occupied West Bank about a third of the labor force is now unemployed the highest rate in decades the ILO saying at least 276,000 jobs or 32% of employment opportunities are simply gone in total nearly half a million Palestinians have lost their jobs across the occupied territories that means the loss of more than $20 million in Daily wages well Peter raker is Deputy Regional director for Arab states at the international uh labor organization uh thanks very much uh for being with us he joins us from Geneva um so this a pretty sobering St set of Statistics there but I want to ask you specifically about the effect this has in the occupied West Bank which is in another part of the occupied territories far from from Gaza talk to us a little bit about the KnockOn effect of the uh uh war in Gaza and how is that how that is leading to the loss of jobs for Palestinians in the West Bank certainly thank you for having me look it's uh it's clear that in Gaza as you mentioned right two-thirds of jobs have been wiped out but there's an immediate knock on effect also on the West Bank we've seen the West Bank also massive loss of jobs estimates are that onethird of jobs have been lost there and that's for a number of reasons it's restrictions of movement it's a massive drop in consumption people don't have money to spend because there's no wages being paid private sector but also those working in the public sector have lost or not gotten their whole wages further is of course knock on effect because there's also been lots of workers expelled from Israel so in the West Bank itself there's a massive impact on jobs lost it also means that overall in Palestine on a daily basis $2.5 million of income of wages are not being paid and of course this things were pretty bad uh for for Palestinians before uh this conflict began weren't they I think the labor market in Palestine West Bank and also Gaza was already very depressed before the crisis in Gaza unemployed was skyh high because the years of the blockade so indeed we started from a very very difficult situation already now has really been compounded and of course the net effect will be many people be in poverty for possibly many months of years to come because of this crisis and what do you Fe might happen the longer this goes on basically many people in Gaza and also West Bank will have no income no wages nobody's going to pay them any money they're going to have to rely increasingly International assistance unfortunately the authorities have no public uh financing to provide social assistance so it's going to have to come from the outside that's also the difficult situation because as we know globally many crisis are raging and the chances of Palestine receiving International aided needs are not necessarily very high the only hope would be that eventually there's going to be a settlement a peace settlement there will be humanitarian and then from on there there might be a reconstruction effort and reconstruction could be helping people to get back into jobs and income hopefully as soon as possible people need it desperately right now indeed good to talk to you Peter raker from The International labor organization in Geneva thanks very much thank you very much
