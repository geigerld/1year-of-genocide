Al jaer has reached out to the Israeli Army for comment on that video we haven't received a response yet joining us on set is Muhammad alasi he's a political analyst and professor of media studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies thanks very much indeed for being with us now the Israeli military we've seen over the last several months regularly releases its own body cam film to show the way that its operations are progressing in Gaza how surprising is it that we are seeing Israeli body cam video which clearly shows the Israeli military an extremely bad light well given what we've seen over the last few months it's not all that surprising because the israelies have done this repeatedly actually the New York Times did an investigation that they published a few weeks ago uh where they looked at about 50 uh of these videos that Israeli soldiers themselves posted to Tik Tok and other social media sites and they're they're posting themselves or recording themselves I should say uh vandalizing shops and classrooms they're recording themselves doing what what an international law is called an unlawful destruction where they're just destroying uh civilian uh infrastructure seemingly for play uh they're often times mocking Palestinians where they're sipping cocktails or smoking hookah pipes while they are detonating you know putting their fingers on the The Detonator button to blow up a residential building and a whole host of other uh things that international law experts would say are clear war crimes so given that larger backdrop that larger context I can't say that I'm shocked to see this video especially given that we know that there's a genocide case ongoing right now um Israel is going to be taken to trial uh and at that hearing um South Africa presented or cited six separate uh video so I imagine that this video will be will be presented as well going forward I want to draw in your experience in terms of your background a professor of media studies given the circumstances is it surprising that this video is able to get onto social media so easily given that one would imagine any military in the world with body cams particularly one would imagine have some sort of secure system for checking that video before it goes anywhere make sure that it can't be leaked it's surprising is it not that actually this stuff is appearing at all from that standpoint it is surprising right because as you said Israel you'd think would be uh U sort of exercising more control but C clearly soldiers are are just a lot in many is posting these videos themselves right and so some of it may be U sort of difficult to control when you consider how many soldiers are in and out and on the ground in in Gaza now um I think what we have to remember is that Israel is losing the public relations War right there was a survey done um not long ago that showed that in 42 of 43 countries Israel's uh favorability rating had gone down and I think these videos that are posted to social media that people are accessing on Tik Tok and Instagram and other sites are one reason why in fact their their favorability rating went down 18 a half points in just three months which is a massive massive drop I think Israel knows that now your guess is as good as mine as to why they're not doing more given that they know that they're losing the public relations uh War to sort of censor this or ensure that this sort of content doesn't make it out onto the internet just very briefly I want to ask you you refer back to the the the South African case of genocide that was brought before the international court of justice and in part it drew on video evidence that had been gathered um in the event that there are cases brought at the international criminal court with regard to individuals committing war crimes just briefly what's the legal status of videos like that and can they be used to bring cases and like that I'm not an international law expert uh but my understanding is that uh they can and I think that uh you'll see uh in the coming uh years uh individual uh soldiers be be called to account uh for things that they've that they've posted and as as I said some of the content is is quite quite disturbing uh quite uh shocking uh but maybe not totally surprising given what we've seen that this is a pattern and given that there is a sort of War frenzy inside of the state of Israel we have to remember that again according to the the the opinion polling data the overwhelming majority of Israelis are fully behind this war even though they're not uh behind the prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu they do support the war effort they feel that uh the government is is using just the right amount of force in Gaza or not enough Force that's 982 98.2% of Israelis 83% of Israelis say they would like Gaza to be ethnically cleansed they they want the gazin to be forced uh uh out of uh Gaza and about 68% of gazin don't want Aid to reach gazen women children and men so in this context this war War frenzy um this is where you're seeing some of these soldiers acting out and and certainly in what they think is in the in the Israeli public interest Muhammad Al musri we appreciate it thank you very much indeed thanks well thousands of people have taken to the Streets of London in a national demonstration calling for a ceasefire in Gaza 2 well protesters have gathered at High Park Corner in the Center of London they've marched through the British Capital to the United States embassy it's the fifth major Pro Palestine demonstration in London so far this year Harry Fett's in London at that protest so this is a weekly event Harry what are people telling you well yes it is it's it's certainly in these in terms of these very big protests it's a bit less than weekly but uh it is one of the another very big one after the last one we saw a couple of weeks weeks ago the organizers here saying uh up to 250,000 people again hard for us to uh certify that but certainly it's in its many tens of thousands people have been streaming past us here for more than an hour and a half now uh close to the American Embassy here south of the river 10s it's also the first protest such as this since the remarks by Rishi sunak and Prim Minister on the steps of 10 Downing Street in which he talked about extremism he talked about mob r threat to democracy calling on police to more actively police these demonstrations as opposed to manage them a lot of the speeches from the stage a lot of the people we've spoken to have referenced that in terms of adding to their desire to be out here really in defiance of that as well as of course Marching for the cause of Palestinians in Gaza I'm joined by one of the protesters here Margie Manfield thank you very much for stopping to talk to us why are you here today I'm here because children are being killed and children are being starved and a mother and a grandmother and it's not right they should stop killing children children deserve to be free they deserve to have equal rights and dignity their homes are being destroyed their schools are being destroyed their universities are being destroyed this is so peaceful the the marches are so peaceful they're Multicultural there's people with babies toddlers children dogs uh old people like me there's people in their hundreds and thousands and are here to say we're not terrorists we want Justice we want there to be equality for everybody and what did you make of of the remarks from the Prime Minister and some of the other messaging we've been getting from government about no-o areas for Jewish people and all the rest of it I I think that is incorrect I think the his statement was incorrect I think it's divisive and deliberately divisive it's to to say calling to stop killing children is making people frightened why is it making people frightened it should make them want to come out as well and say stop killing children we are hearing one slogan right now from The River To The Sea which many Jews do find offensive I mean but people we've spoken to here say that it doesn't mean what what some think it means so cry for Liberation just as the slave songs of the 19th century like Sweet Chariot that they sing at rugby matches that's based on a slave song it's it's about Liberation for everybody and they should be free and why is that offensive when Lut which is the Israeli main political party their Charter has the reverse of that that that statement it says from the sea to the river there will be no Palestine it will all be Israelis so why is it offensive to say people that were there indigenous why they can't have a nation state as well why don't they have equal rights okay Mai thank you very much we didn't get to it but Marie's also uh half Scottish half Palestinian her mother uh fled uh historic Palestine uh in 1948 so uh just one of the many faces of this March that we've seen today one other point to mention uh the police the Metropolitan Police in its statement said it would police this March uh according to the law not according to to uh what some people may wish were the law Harry thank you very much indeed Harry fet in London
