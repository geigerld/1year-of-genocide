a war of words between the United Nations and Israel is escalating with the Israeli Ambassador calling for the resignation of Secretary General Antonio gueras after a speech on Tuesday gueras spoke to the media earlier saying that he wished to set the record straight and he criticized those that who claimed he had Justified attacks by Hamas I am shocked by the misrepresentations by some of my statement yesterday in the security Council as if as if I was justifying acts of Terror by amas this is false it was the opposite Kristen salumi is at the United Nations in New York can you tell us where this is coming from and why guer feels the need to set the record straight in his words right well yesterday during the security council meeting on the situation in the Middle East uh gutes in his remarks did as you just heard uh talk about the situation in the Middle East uh he said in those remarks that what is happening in Gaza didn't happen in a vacuum or sorry what Hamas did and what is happening in the Middle East uh didn't happen in a vacuum that the Palestinians have been subjected to 56 years of occupation that prompted a very very angry response from the Israeli delegation uh foreign minister Eli Cohen cancelled his visit with the Secretary General that was scheduled for later in the day the Israeli Ambassador said that the Secretary General should resign and that Israel was going to cancel uh visas for diplomats including Martin Griffith uh the chief humanitarian under Secretary General here at the United Nations who is um in the region he's been in Egypt and was scheduled to go to Israel uh they're saying they're not going to give him a visa to come to the country because of these remarks uh which they said seem to uh justify uh hamas's Terror attacks uh which as you just heard the Secretary General vehemently denied and I can tell you I was in uh the here listening to his remarks he did very much condemn The Taking of uh civilians the attacks on civilians and so forth um but it was those uh remarks that prompted this angry reaction from the Israeli delegations I should also point out that the UN hasn't confirmed uh whether or not Martin Griffith is still planning to travel if the Visa has in fact been canceled or where where things stand but that was the threat that was made by the uh Israeli team Kristen this is a remarkable uh what's been happening between the UN Secretary General and Israel over the last 24 hours we're thank you very much for that reporting we're going to go to Alan Fischer who is joining us now from occupied East Jerusalem for the Israeli side of this Alan uh I suppose the question is number one explain Israel's reaction to What Guera said and what they're doing me all right it looks like uh we're GNA work on the audio on that and bring Alan Fischer in with us just momentarily we definitely need the other side of the version of the other version the other side of the story the Israeli side um I want to bring in Sultan Barakat you're a professor of public policy at hammad bin Khalifa University the speech we heard from the UN Secretary General and anonio gajer about an hour yeah about an hour ago now it was a two-minute speech and he felt the need to set the record straight he said no I'm I'm I'm not justifying terrorism that is absolutely not what I'm doing have you ever seen a un Secretary General do anything like that or have to do anything like that well un secretary generals are very experienced diplomats and they're always they have to weigh their words very very carefully and I think gues in particular is is very very uh knowledgeable and you know he's as old as the state of Israel and this man before taking o over as a Secretary General in 2016 he served almost for 10 years as the head of the United Nation Refugee agency so he understands the meaning of his Wars The Suffering that people go through and so on and before that as you know he was the prime minister of Portugal for a number of years so he's not a lightweight politician who doesn't know what he's saying he's saying it because not only him he believes it but he speaks on behalf of an organization the United Nations has more repur working on Palestine than anywhere else in the world he must have a piece of paper on his desk related to Palestine I would suspect every single day so he knows what is going on so when he says we have to place this into context and not rush into pretending as if things have happened on the sth again that's where this all started is because yesterday his speech at the UN um at the United Nations he said the Hamas attacks did not happen in a vacuum that's the quote that really sparked Israel's anger well what it did to me I think it highlighted The Bullying nature of the state of Israel you know this uh the the state Secretary or the foreign secretary for for Israel reacted almost immediately in that meeting and called for his resignation only Israel can afford to do this no other state before has been able to call for the resignation of the Secretary General in this immediate uh way uh it the now the call for withdrawing visas Etc this is going back to the days of Al Bashir in Sudan you know this is very very authoritarian regimes actions towards the united nation of course Israel what's what's the play for Israel here because if you start talking about not granting visas to un High diplomats if you start saying that the UN Secretary General you're accusing them of justifying terrorism Etc um are they trying to discredit the UN because at the same time in parallel to this we're seeing the UN trying to come up with common language that would perhaps uh call for a a pause in Israel's bombardment of Gaza and presumably Israel wants none of take it of course discrediting the UN is at the center of this strategy I think at this moment because uh the only thing that protects the Palestinians right today is the legal side on the ground they're occupied the Israelis are expanding the settlements are expanding they're winning they're taking everything the only thing that's standing between them and creating a Jewish only state in Palestine is the the legality of the legal resolutions that have been passed by the UN and Israel is not new to this they've been trying to disc to to disc discredit the UN for a long long time and they will continue uh one important point to not is the UN does not designate Hamas as a terrorist organization the US does the EU does even maybe Saudi Arabia does but not the United Nations so as far as he's concerned he's not talking about uh a terrorist organization that has undertaken terror act of Terror inside Israel nevertheless he did refer to the terrorizing effect of the attack Hamas undertook uh into Israel so it's it's quite complex and I think this is the last or the most important issue that Israel wants to attack now is the legality of the situation they hope that as a result of this war there will be new nations Gathering talks about about a new reality and uh a move away from the status quo that exists at the moment using again the UN corridors but uh based on their choice and their own Arrangement Sultan Barakat thank you very much for that I want to go back now to uh Alan Fischer uh Allan is in occupied East Jerusalem so following the row with the UN there's a diplomatic row between turke and Israel Allan tell us more about that one well the relations between turkey and and Israel were getting better but they've been FR since around 2010 when a flotilla of ships tried to break uh the blockade around Gaza and a number of turkey citizens were killed as I say things were getting better but then just in the last few hours right erdogan from Tura the Turkish president said that Hamas was not a terrorist organization that it's fighting for its land and there had been plans for him to visit Israel he said now there will be no visit H and Israel took advantage of turkey's good intentions well there's been a response from the Israeli foreign minister uh Ministry from that in in the last couple of hours they have said that they reject uh what T erdogan has said described Hamas as a Despicable terrorist organization and he said Turkish should attempts to pretend uh do not change the horrors that the world has seen uh just as those relations were getting better it seems that they are now hold below the waterline and things between ankor and the government in Israel are perhaps the lowest point they've been since that event way back in 2010 Ellen Fischer reporting there from occupied East Jerusalem thank you very much
