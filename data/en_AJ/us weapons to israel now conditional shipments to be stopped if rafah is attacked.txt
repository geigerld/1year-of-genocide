VI President Joe Biden says he's going to stop the supply of weapons to Israel if it launches an allout attack on Rafa now for weeks Washington has been pressuring Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to send forces into the city Heidi Joe Castro reports from Washington DC it's it's just wrong the US president said for the first time in an interview with us media on Wednesday that US military aid to Israel will be conditioned on the Israeli military's actions and acknowledged that us weapons are being used to kill civilians in Gaza civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs they go into Rafa I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafa I've made it clear to BB in the war cabinet they're not going to get our support if in fact they go on these population centers the major shift in position from Joe Biden who has previously pledged unconditional support for Israel was foreshadowed by a recent delay in providing us bombs to Israel the US defense secretary told a senate panel the delivery was paused due to concerns about Israel's plans to invade Rafa Israel shouldn't launch a a major attack in arfa without accounting for uh and protecting the civilians that are in that battle space uh and and again as we have uh assessed the situation uh we paused one shipment of high high uh uh payload uh Munitions Biden has faced increased ing pressure from protesters who have demonstrated ins solidarity with Palestinians across American college campuses and in Chicago where he made a campaign stop on Wednesday Biden has also faced calls from Progressive members of his own party to end Israel's unconditional military aid Congressional leaders offered a muted response to the delayed arm shipment I uh believe that Israel and America have an ironclad relationship and I uh have faith in what the Biden Administration is doing I continue to express my concern to the administration that the delay of shipment of weapons to Israel is just another way of trying to tell an ally how to conduct the war Biden says the US will still provide Israel with defensive weapons and the US defense secretary says the US Israeli Alliance remains Ironclad but a major ground invasion of Rafa would be seen by the us as a red line and Biden says Israel Crossing it would be quote just wrong Heidi Joe Castro Al jazer Washington well prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has shut down Al jaz's operations so our correspondents are now reporting from outside Israel muhamad Jam jum is joining us from the Jordanian Capital Aman so but let's talk first of all uh more about this Threat by Joe Biden to block weapons if there is any action in Rafa what's the Israeli response to that so so far so Rob we've not yet heard anything official from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but we are seeing a lot of quotes attributed to Anonymous defense officials members of the security establishment in Israel they are appearing in Israeli Publications and media Outlets the last few hours and these officials are expressing a lot of concern about what this means going forward they're concerned about how this might affect Israel's preparedness uh when it comes to the war in Gaza as well as conflicts on other fronts going forward also these defense officials are telling these Israeli media Outlets that they are worried about what this means about the state of the relationship between Israel and the United States uh some of these officials are saying that Israel's adversaries May perceive this particular crisis as an opportunity to undermine Israel uh then there are other defense officials that are saying that um some senior defense officials are telling counterparts in the government that the government really needs to start heeding the warnings of the Americans because they are very worried that this could be a major fracture in the relationship and they don't know quite what that means for Israel going forward now beyond that just in the past 10 minutes or so we are seeing that Israeli far right-wing national security minister itar bin gavier tweeted that Hamas loves Biden this clearly in response to that interview that Joe Biden gave and the decision to Halt weapon shipment if uh Israel were to continue going into ra beyond that you've had the head of the opposition in Israel yir lepid who has responded to that tweet by itar bin gav leid has said every Israeli is in danger if Netanyahu doesn't fire itar bin gavier today so clearly you can see that the right-wing in Israel far right-wing ministers they are very angry about Biden's decision and about the Hal of weapons the defense establishment is very concerned about what this means for the uh for Israel going forward and the relationship with the US and now you have members of the opposition who are Furious that itar bin gavier would tweet something so incendiary saying Hamas loves Biden indicating that essentially Hamas is very happy that Biden decided to stop weapon shipment to Israel and of course in the in the background to all of this Muhammad the talks are continuing in Cairo there's been a lot of speculation around these talks over the last uh few days um from your perspective or where you are what's the interpretation of where things lie with those well that's very much an open question at this hour obviously it continues to be a very complicated situation there are so many contradictory reports throughout the Israeli media media landscape and throughout uh other uh uh media landscapes in the region other reports um you have reports emanating out of Cairo that the gaps are narrowing you have reports in Israel saying that major gaps remain and that Israel continues to maintain that what has been presented to them as far as the proposal that Hamas has accepted that that crosses all the red lines when it comes to Israel look it is complicated uh the devil is very much in the details uh the CIA Chief William Burns was in Israel yesterday he met with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu he met with other members of the security establishment it's being reported in Israeli media that burns said to his counterparts that this should not be considered to be an end to the war that this should con be considered to be a pause to the war that it should be a positive development and that further actions can be negotiated after that um but when you look at articles emanating out of Israel especially when they're quoting right-wing politicians um they are saying that red lines very much still remain and there seems to be a lot of skepticism by members of the right-wing Coalition of the government that this can actually be achieved nonetheless Bill Burns uh is back in Cairo now the talks are continuing the Israeli delegation is in Cairo the Hamas delegation is in Cairo other delegations are in Cairo so we'll just have to wait and see as to how this developed going forward Rob Muhammad Jam jum in Aman Muhammad thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
