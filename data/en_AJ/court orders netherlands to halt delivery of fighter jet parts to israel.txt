well a Dutch court has ordered the government to stop delivering parts for F-35 fighter jets to Israel the court upheld an appeal made by human rights organizations which argued that supplying the parts contributed to Israel's alleged violations of international law the ruling requires the Netherlands to Cease the export and Transit of any parts destined for Israel within 7 Days the parts are American owned but they're stored in a Dutch warehouse and then exported onto several Partners well let's go straight to to our correspondent step vasson she joins us now on the phone from Amsterdam in the Netherlands step as we were just reporting this was an appeal court ruling after another Court allowed these exports to go ahead in December can you talk us through the significance of what's just taken place how much of a difference will this make well this is absolutely a landmark Verdict by the appeal court in the ha because this is the first time since the war in Gaza started that a country is now ordered by a court to stop sending weapons to Israel so in 30 minutes verdict the judge really said that Israel is there is a real risk of violating international law and humanitarian laws of war he dismissed all the arguments that the state the Dutch state had in uh saying that they need to send these F-35 spare parts to Israel uh talking about political reasons they're very close ties to the United States but also economic reasons but the judge dismissed all of it saying we have to look at the risk of where these spare parts are going to be used and he said what Israel is doing now in Gaza has really very high risk of violating uh these rules of Law and it's very clear that the f35s are used during this war he said so the Dutch state has to stop sending them within the next seven days so this is a very serious blow for the Dutch government because they did win the the case in the first Court uh and this case is of course filed by NGS by oxom no and other NOS but they kept on uh appealing so this is now yeah a land Landmark ruling uh and as you said this distribution center for the f-35s is based in the Netherlands they're going to be sent they send all these fighter jet planes to the Netherlands all the spare parts are collected there and they're going to be sent to uh all over Europe and also including Israel but that last country can't get these spers in the next seven days step I was um really noticing that the court statement was very specific it says that these parts were and I quote here used in serious violations of international humanitarian law could this set some kind of of precedent might we see other European countries following suit absolutely this I think the lawyer will definitely see this as a precedent and a jurisdiction for other countries uh to uh file similar cases we know of course Germany uh has a huge weapons deal with Israel most of the weapons in the in Europe are being sent from Germany well anyone any NGO anyone can send file a case against uh the state there as well and as can be done also in the United States and other countries as well so def definitely the NOS in the Netherlands and also the lawyers who have filed this case see this as a very important landmark and uh ruling with a very strong uh possibility of being a pres for other countries step vasson there were the latest for us on that ruling from the Netherlands thanks so much St
