I'm Tom um I'm from Israel and I've been living in Berlin for eight and a half years I am Saba I'm from Palestine Gaza and I live in Germany for one year and a half seba was pretty active since the War Began and then I contacted her um after meeting her in a dialogue group and I said I want to do something together our organization is called clean shelter what we do is fund raise to um Finance the construction of toilets and Tents in IDP camps in Gaza I never thought that in at this time of history that we will face this kind of hunger and like I couldn't imagine that people will be displaced I couldn't imagine that children would lose all of their families because we've really started small um and because I'm Israeli most of my networks are from Israelis so we have a lot of Israeli donate donations but we have donations actually from all over the world if there will be a rebuilding taking place and I'm sure there will be a rebuilding taking place we want to take uh part in this and make sure it's inclusive and make sure that it's reliable and accommodative because tents that we are constructing now is they're not going to last I have family and friends in Israel that I'm still really really worried about and uh hope for their safety um I also feel a lot of responsibility and also a lot of Shame about the war and in that respect I'm really happy for this project with seba and even for friendship I feel this is healing in many ways
