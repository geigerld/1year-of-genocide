let's now speak to Tamara Ali who's a spokesperson for the United Nations relief and works agency unra she's joining us from Aman in Jordan very good to have you with us Tamara I guess I want to get your thoughts first uh to the about these new provisional measures the by the icj uh requesting for Israel to increase Aid into Gaza ordering in fact Israel to increase Aid into Gaza you are all hopeful that the Israelis will comply we are doing all we can to ensure that uh the humanitarian assistance especially food and medical supplies are getting into Gaza at the scale that the current catastrophic humanitarian situation requires you I did hear in your report uh the reference to what the UN said about famine settling into Gaza we can speak about an entire population that is food insecure and half of that entire population so 1.1 million people having exhausted Their Food Supplies they have nothing in their tents because most of that population is displaced anyway we're hearing about infants dying of Mal nourishment and dehydration and we're also hearing about nursing mothers no longer producing milk baby formula is not easily available in Gaza and the water is often contaminated yeah we know about these needs and challenges which are immense of course what we want to know is how are you not able to prevent I mean to to deliver Aid to the people who need it in Gaza how is Israel preventing your organization unra from delivering this urgently needed Aid because they claimed uh that you haven't applied for Access for example about a week ago the Israeli authorities announced that they were no longer going to cooperate with un with the largest humanitarian agency currently in Gaza this for us is an impediment and a really official impediment official impediment to our ability to continue providing life saving food and medical supplies over the last week five of our requests to access the north of Gaza which is almost entirely sealed off with food assistance were denied by the Israeli government therefore we are finding that our operational Space is really shrinking however unra is still present in ra and as a reminder un has shelters in RAF where we distribute food and we want to continue being able to do that did the Israelis uh Tamara give you any explanation as to why they wouldn't uh Grant you access to Northern Gaza no explanation and we continue to ask and we continue to push and we continue to get support by donors by governments by private donors in including those who want to donate zakat to unra therefore we do have the infrastructure we do have the logistics and mostly we have so many trucks parked currently in Alish waiting to go in we have the staff 3,000 people we have the shelters over 100 so we can do it so we are advocating with the Israeli government and With Friends of the Israeli government to help us continue our work yeah some Aid has gone G in in the past few months through the the the border crossings but in recent weeks we've also seen a number of countries including the US Jordan Spain resort to airdrops of humanitarian Aid does that help at all is it effective on the ground any attempt to get food into Gaza is something that we highly welcome but we really want to confirm that the easiest and the safest and the most economical way is to use the land rout and the uh and the land Crossings and this is what we have been calling for since the beginning tonight today it is so much easier to get food in using if if different land Crossings open airdrops are symbolic and are a way to say we will bring food into Gaza against the odds but really getting the trucks that are already parked in alishan already packed into Gaza and trying to lighten the very cumbersome Inspection St inspection procedures by the israelies would be the easiest and the cheapest way for a to go in right but we've heard the Israeli body responsible for implementing the government's uh civilian policy in Gaza say that there is no limit to the amount of Aid that can enter Gaza is that the case talk to us about the these uh the process itself the average number of trucks that have gone into Gaza today in March either from ra or abim k Shalom is 155 trucks every day that is way below the minimum required 500 trucks to go in every day and therefore both the order of the icj but also the latest un security cancer resolution very clearly called for an increase at scale humanitarian food Medical Supply Access into Gaza we are very far from it thank you very much for talking to us Tamara Alvi spokesperson for un joining us there from Aman thank you for your time
