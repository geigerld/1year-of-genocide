Al jaer senior political analyst just to bring up a point that Bernard was making there Israel was saying that it doesn't deliberately Target journalists we got to remember of course that it was the aler offices in Gaza which I think also housed AP as well the offices of AP which were hit by a rocket fired by the Israeli military this is very important for us as journalists we're using this to illustrate the kind of pressures that journalists go through but nevertheless it's also indicative of the kind of of pressure that Ordinary People in Gaza Palestinians go through every day when they're facing the attacks by Israel absolutely and that's why uh we've seen uh such a high number of casualties among our colleagues family members because they are part and parcel of the fabric of the Palestinian Society but yes as you said we also seen the attack on on offices uh on installations you know because I think they do consider in in such context a journalist to be enemy combatants uh you know uh a journalist who tells the truth who reports the facts anyway uh about what is going on there is more dangerous uh to any genocidal government uh than any Hamas fighter uh because at the end of the day the human toll in Gaza uh needs to uh um you know rebound around the world what is happening in that part of the world and it's journalists you know we say journalists are the guarant of any democracy without journalists you know governments can transcend their um functions right in war it's even more so you know there is no there are no other guaran that a war is going according to humanitarian or international law other than journalists who else could be there who are the eyewitnesses who are The Observers who are the independent not takers who are the first draft historians of what goes on in a war zone but journalists except in this very particular case unlike you know journalists who hang out in Western capitals our journalists or journalists in in in war time take a lot of risks upon themselves and their families and hence they tend to pay the price now we've seen that here and and and since we keep talking about both Israel and the United States almost interchangeably we remember how our officers and how our colleagues were killed in Iraq 20 years ago during the American invasion of Iraq again our offices were destroyed our journalists were killed 20 years later our offices were destroyed couple of years ago in Gaza and our journalists are killed um so you know for for warmongers and and for for uh you know fight fighting governments as it were journalists uh do pose a danger because they tend to report the facts for those of you just joining us I want to just explain we're showing you pictures of wild ddu who is lying on that gurny there in a hospital in uh conun having received injuries to his upper arm we understand uh from shrapnel uh from an explosive dropped be believed by an Israeli drone in conun he was there covering a story near hia school with his cameraman uh Samir now we understand that Samir may still be at the school and the latest we've heard is that medical assistance has not got to him yet we believe from well that uh samir's injuries may be uh critical and of course there may also be other people who may have also been caught up in that uh that attack as well and they too will need medical assistance we're waiting to see are here what is happening with uh with them this is of course coming at a time when National Security adviser Jake Sullivan has been saying that uh the US is encouraging Israel to change its approach its military approach in Gaza to uh make the attacks less intense but from what we can see of course this was caused by just one Israeli drone that was uh aimed we believe uh at a school and yet that it's caused significant damage so the lessening of that intensity may not actually have as significant effect as people might hope it might have well certainly not on the short term nowadays I don't even trust it's going to be on the intermediate and long term clearly there are no signs from Jake Sullivan the National Security adviser uh press conference that he got any commitments from the Israeli government in fact every time an American official says something as if it looks like they mean it the Israeli official uh counters that by saying that's humbug you know we're not going to do this that or the other thing the American can say all they want and we will do what we must that's how it always ends up being but now that uh it's kind of coming together this uh this visit by the US National Security adviser as his predecessors I am coming to the conclusion that what the Americans are trying to do today about Gaza is beautify the genocide that's what they're trying to do they're trying to make the crimes look more attractive more digestable more acceptable by the International Community they've been asking Israel non-stop to buy them time to kind of e ease ease up on the bombings ease up on the killings of civilians ease up on the destruction of hospitals and places of Warships and so on so forth but the Israelis have been so sadistic in their uh war that it even irked you know everyday Joe as it were and Susan in the United States right so in some in some way or some fashion the Biden Administration is basically asking uh the Israeli government to help America look better to help it make the genocide look more acceptable more digestible but in the end of the day how how can you make an attack on a journalist look attractive how do you make the killing of a child look good you can't you simply can't and the Israelis keep on with their sadistic approach and not just in Gaza I'm going to give you another example quickly Rob in Janine after three days they've done a number of things they've killed a dozen people destroyed a dozen houses blew up in fact residential you know homes of people uh they've attacked uh places of worship but then they did something else they started broadcasting Israeli songs from the minates of the mosques why why why broadcast Israeli songs in Hebrew from the minates of mosques what does that where does that fit into the whatever stupid unacceptable debunked argument they're making about security where is that where does that lie but in a humiliating sadistic warmongering humiliation of the Palestinian people and that's in Janine that's not in Gaza so you can imagine there what I've termed earlier astology the the the the the approach of destroying Gaza completely in order to then build something Israeli or whatever ever it is new there and that requires first and foremost making sure that the word about Gaza does not reach the rest of the world so that's journalists also make sure that doctors are not there to give Aid to the injured make sure that there is no running water there is no food there is no electricity there's no communication when it's possible right there are no homes or shelters for people in this winter time to uh to find a place where they can spend the night for childrens and families and so on so forth so this is the situation where we are in where the Americans are basically urging the Israelis to beautify their genocide this also highlights another issue that we were talking about with the the uh representative from the International Federation of journalists that it is normally the case any government who would uh take military action against journalists in in a war zone anywhere in the world would say they have a choice to be there they can choose to leave this is not the case with the journalists in Gaza it's not the case with anybody in Gaza nobody can leave Gaza and you know to be honest I mean go ahead and convince to leave go ahead mean be my guest convince uh Sam Abu Daka to leave go ahead I mean you know I'm not going to stop anyone to stop them these people have dedicated their life to their profession and it's not an in just an industry they are not car sales people people they have been there for decades trying to tell the truth trying to report the facts about their people and they're not going to stop because there's a war it's exactly the contrary of that Rob because there is war that they going to stay and report if there was no war ah you know they might find their future elsewhere but because their people are under such uh repression under such bombing under such you know genocide that they need to be there to tell the world the story the human Story I mean that's our slogan right in Al jazer telling the human Story I mean but be that as it may right I mean they're there especially in this moment to tell the human story what is going on in Gaza this is their time to do their job so even if they do have the capacity to leave they wouldn't leave some of them have uh you know I mean Sharin abak had an American passport she could have left she didn't want to leave they want to do their Duty as we spoke earlier about w w is a very particular case right I mean I couldn't even myself I couldn't you know hold it uh when I heard about the death of so many of his close family members you know son and and and I know we're not going to repeat that but anyway all members of his close family members and he would rebound the next day and and to continue to do the job these people don't want to run away they want to face the truth in the face they want to face the Israeli War Machine in the face and they will continue to do their job and this not the first time I have been sitting unfortunately or fortunately in safety with you here on this on this platform over four Gaza Wars I've been lucky to be sitting here in safety but W and Company and Sam and all these other people have covered four Wars in Gaza in that time have covered the implications and the ramifications of 17 years of sage in that time while we were enjoying our industry the media industry they were paying the price and they insisted and each and every time to take the risk for their lives and their loved ones to do their job so these people should be appreciated not insulted for doing their jobs not humiliated not killed not injured not attacked and certainly not undermined by saying oh it's their fault you know they could have gone that's an insult to our and their injury it's an insult to our intelligence they are The Messengers they shouldn't be blamed the problem are the warmongers who are carrying a war of choice at this point in time there is no defense in occupied territory anyway and certainly this has been a war of Revenge a war of genocide against an entire people and it's been declared as such from the outset by saying there are no innocent in Gaza by the Israeli president by treating them like human Animal by the minister of defense and by saying we're going to go after them and their children and their animals by the Israeli Prime Minister this is a war that needs to be covered professionally by people who are sacrificing their Liv putting their and their loved ones life at stake and they should be respected they should be honored not undermined by warmongers in Israel I'm going to ask you I want to widen this out a little bit because we're one of the reasons that we're talking about Jake Sullivan is the fact that he's talking to Palestinian president mmud Abbas the US is very keen that the Palestinian authori should play some sort of role in governing Gaza whenever this conflict comes to an end given the fact that the level of Destruction the level of injury and death that we've seen in Gaza and in the West Bank whilst in the West Bank particularly the Palestinian Authority has been in charge how do you think people in Gaza would respond to the Palestinian Authority taking over responsibilities from Hamas quite reluctantly uh but until we get there there's a long way right I am no longer I'm no longer confident that this is going to be a matter of weeks or months it's clear from what we've seen the last 70 days 10 weeks that the the idea of the destruction of Hamas is not going to happen anytime in the foreseeable future this is a long conflict and we're going to be seeing the death and the and the destruction of so much more in Gaza moving forward and we're going to see how much ethnic cleansing we're going to see moving forward but be that as it may eventually people are going to have to rebuild their lives right and that's going to require commitment on the part of the International Community notably Arab countries European countries the United States I would say it should have been completely the responsibility of Israel to rebuild Gaza they destroyed it they should rebuild it and if they going to reoccupy it then it is within their responsibility their Duty as an occupying power to take care to make sure that people have shelter have food have electricity have water and so forth according to international law but the day after the day after as it were right the Palestinian Authority will only be credible and I think they would only commit to extending their rule to Gaza in cooperation with Hamas or in understanding with Hamas but also in understanding with the United States this could only be done within the framework of a apprehensive settlers we've read today in the New York Times by two former American officials that it is time that was the first line it is time for the Biden Administration to recognize the Palestinian state that could be an interesting beginning right this has always been thought of as the end well we've been in 30 years now since 1993 in a peace process that basically led to not just to nothing it led to exactly the opposite more settlements illegal settlements so on so more violence now we should need to start with with the end meaning the Biden Administration needs to walk the talk if it's in fact committed to a two-state solution it should join the rest of the International Community the more than 130 some countries that have already recognized Palestine by recognizing Palestine that will show that it's serious at least right at least about the Diplomatic solution so if the Biden Administration does recognize that it means the UK France German and others are going to follow soon which means that we will have a un Security Council resolution recognizing Israel and by the way I'm not an expert on us constitutional law according to the two officials and according to some US Supreme Court ruling President Biden can do that recognize the P without returning to Congress because that would have been a problem because Israel basically controls Congress Israel and its Lobby control Congress when it comes to Israel Palestine it both Congress basically for all you know matter but Biden as a president of the United States can recognize Palestine without going back to Congress that's an interesting you know turn of events in within what he can and cannot do so he doesn't have the excuse that I can't do that because I don't have the support of Congress in an election year that means he could also and I don't mean to be you know supporting his election campaign but certainly that will re rally the Democratic party behind him because let's all remember also that a majority of the public opinion in the United States have steadily over the past two three decades supported a two-state solution in Israel Palestine so this will have more benefit to Biden that will probably have for Palestine for the for the immediate future because even if he does recognize Palestine we know that the Israeli government remains obstinate about the fact of another sovereignty emerging between the river and the sea that will probably push for elections in Israel as we've seen in 19991 1992 when the American Administration pushed Israel into joining the peace process or be left out in the cold they had an election they elected isak Rabin isakin joined the peace process and so on and so forth right so I think we are at an inflection point now whereby unlike what we've seen from Jake Sullivan and his fake declarations about beautifying the genocide that's going on in Gaza the Biden administ Administration can take a serious commitment a serious step now to towards fulfilling its commitment to the Palestinian people and the Israeli people I should say because too many Israelis think that the only way Israel can maintain its so-called Jewish and Democratic character is by having a Palestinian state next door otherwise Israel palan will become eventually one state that is certainly not Jewish majority state but be that as it may clearly there is we are at an inflection point and if Biden is serious about the day after the day after and about the repairing the the the damage between in Gaza and between Gaza and the west bank and to have some kind of a horizon for people to look for and to bring some of the Arab Partners into the fold in order for them to support financially and otherwise the emergence of this new state then this could all create a new Dynamic forward but does the Biden Administration have the will to do that because if there is a will there is a way Maran thank you very much indeed Maran Bashar senior political analyst for Al jaer thank you
