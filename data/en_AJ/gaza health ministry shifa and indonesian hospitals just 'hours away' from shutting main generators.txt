gaza's Health Ministry says it's just hours away from the shutdown of its main generators at the alifa and Indonesian hospitals both facilities are treating those wounded in Israel's attack of the jabalia refugee camp they say lives that are at imminent risk include 42 babies on incubators 62 wounded in need of urgent care including those who require artificial ventilation there are also 650 patients with kidney failure well Ben JL is director of the Palestine solidarity campaign he joins us from London good to have you with us first of all we're seeing more and more images sadly coming in of mass civilian casualties in air strikes like the last two on jabalia refugee camp how is this impacting solidarity with the Palestinians in the West well I mean it is adding and I think um people are still processing the images we saw from jabalia yesterday before we heard news of what's happened today and I'm still stuck with the image that many of your viewers would have seen of the man searching amongst the rubble for his three children who were dead um we already have um a a strong solidarity movement in the UK that has mobilized up to half a million people onto the streets in demonstrations um they are fueled by um an immediate desire to see The Killing end that's translated into a call for a ceasefire um they recognize as well um they are unified in their recognition that the clock did not stop ticking ticking on October the 7th that if the killing is is going to stop we ultimately have to deal with the root causes which is Israel's system of military occupation and aparte but they are also fueled so if we look at the response in the UK they are fueled by anger a real growing anger uh at the response of our political leaders who still ref refuse to call for a ceasefire and we had the grotesque spectacle yesterday of the leader of the labor party who is like to be our next prime minister stating that he could not make a judgment on on whether Israel was committing war crimes or not because he would have to wait for the Judgment of lawyers um but then said he couldn't even answer the question whether he thought it was morally wrong because it wasn't for him to sit and immediately respond to what he was saying but of course we all know a few months ago uh when Russia was bombing Ukraine and killing civilians he was able to respond iMed immediately and say this is a war crime I can see civilians have being killed it's a war crime so there is a growing solidarity movement there are hundreds of thousands of people marching regularly and there are also other spontaneous demonstrations of solidarity including people sitting down in train stations um echoing the call for ceas by now and that's fueled as I say by an anger at the response of our polit political leaders who are making our government as it has been for decades complicit but now complicit in what more and more Scholars of crimes against humanity are calling a textbook case of genocide well how much how how effective are some of the campaigns that organizations like yours are launching particularly on Western leaders when as you rightly pointed out we're not hearing the same language that we heard for example a year ago of Ursula Von Delan the European commission president when she said on October the 19th quote yesterday we saw again Russia's targeted attacks against civilian infrastructure and she went on to say quote these are war crimes we're not seeing that kind of stance from Western leaders are we no and I think unfortunately none of that is new of course your viewers will know that I mean I I will speak specifically about the UK successive UK governments um have been complicit for many many years in failing to take action to address Israel's ongoing violations of international law you know through military occupation through the imposition of aparte they've been complicit in that this is very Stark at the moment because of the sheer level um and scale of horrific acts we are seeing such egregious violations of international law on a daily basis I was struck yesterday the head of Unicef said Gaza has become a graveyard for children it's a living hell for everyone else else and our leaders are standing by effectively saying well that's acceptable we won't call for a ceasefire Israel must be allowed to continue so the the answer to your question what's the effect of it it's not having an immediate effect in in changing uh the policy of government but it is putting huge pressure on them um again looking at the labor party which is of course the opposition party at the moment but is supposed to be a progressive party we have seen dozens of counselors so labor officials at a local level resigning we have seen senior people in the labor party criticizing the leadership's position and speaking out we have to keep up this pressure and we know that half a million people marching doesn't automatically change the position of political leaders but it does have a long-term impact in terms of bringing people into an understanding of the nature of the oppression of Palestinian of the Palestinian people and making them willing to take action my organization has 80 branches all across the UK we've already had requests in the last two weeks to set up another 10 to 15 branches so this is mobilizing people in unprecedented levels who are outraged of what they're saying and understand the simple morality of this that when they see the indiscriminate bombing of children they know that this is wrong and they do not accept the underpinning argument here that somehow this does not matter because it's Palestinian children they do not agree with the defense minister of Israel who says that the Palestinians are inhuman animals they are outraged at what they are saying and they want action all right we'll leave it there thanks so much Ben jaml
