here on the campus of Cal State University Los Angeles about 50 students have set up a Gaza solidarity encampment uh on the campus it's a bit smaller than some of the others but the students here said that they are very committed to what they're doing so far no uh efforts have been made by the school administration to uh set a deadline for the students to disperse and police have not been called in as elsewhere the students here are demanding divestment of the University from Israel as well as uh the uh divestment from any Us weapons makers now I spoke to a uh spokesperson for the students earlier asking her about what they thought about the uh remarks President Biden made earlier at a holocaust remembrance event denouncing what he called a rising tide of anti-Semitism and specifically mentioning student protests in that context Zionism does not equal Judaism and we really want want to make that very clear we are not anti-semitic we are here because we care about Palestinians and Palestinians are even Semitic so we are not anti-semitic and to villainize us this way is heartbreaking from our society the freedom later students held a rally on campus to repeat their demands and make their voices heard even louder the student protest movement across the country in solidarity with Gaza appears to still be going strong despite thousands of arrests and even as Israel apparently has begun its military operation against raava Rob Reynolds Al jazer Los Angeles make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
