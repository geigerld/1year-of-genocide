well we open with breaking news from Gaza City at least 70 Palestinians have been killed in a coldblooded massacre of Palestinian civilians by Israeli troops we understand more than 250 people were also injured many of them are in critical condition hundreds of hungry and starving Palestinians had come to collect food Aid when they were attacked by Israeli snipers and shelled by Israeli tanks civilians were left scrambling to then transport them to nearby host hital most of them are out of service we have come here to get our hands on some Aid I've been waiting here since noon yesterday at about 4:30 in the early morning trucks started to trickle in the Israelis just opened random Fire on us as if it was a trap once we approached the a trucks the Israeli tanks and warplanes started firing on us if this continues like this we do not want any Aid delivered at all every Convoy coming means another Massacre some of the injured we understand were taken to alifa hospital in Gaza City here's an account from one of the doctors there jadala ala there are really no words to describe the situation it reminds us of the dark scenes from the Baptist Hospital 4 months ago where 500 people were killed in one Israeli airstrike since the early hours of the morning the hospital has been flooded with dozens of dead bodies and hundreds of injured the majority of the victims suffered gunshot wounds and shrapnel in the head and upper parts of their bodies they were hit by direct artillery shelling drone missiles and gunfire all our operation rooms are full and all medical staff have been deployed above all we ran out of medical supplies and fuel necessary to operate the hospital we hope we will be able to provide any life-saving procedures to those victims all victims are in critical condition they're lying on the floor We Stand helpless amid the sharp shortage of supplies and stuff well let's speak to our correspondent on the ground hany Mahmud he joins me on the phone from Rafa in southern Gaza Hy what exactly do we know about what happened in Gaza City yes what we we followed this tragic story since midnight from one of the journalists on the ground who documented that people were arriving to an round the part better Rashid Road where people gathered in larger groups waiting for uh a trucks to arrive uh to G City and the northern partk mainly people have been grappling with famine and Fai with with starvation difficult living conditions within the past few weeks and trucks made it to the northern part people resorted to eating animal Fe and wild flag just to stay alive so as these people were Gathering just waiting for that heavy fire were opened at them and they were shot at by all kinds of of of military equipment available at that point from the naval forces ra Naval forces from uh from tanks and from Attack drones that were hovering as were described by one of the journalists on the ground as hovering as a very low level above people and also from armored vehicles that were within the inity of the area so far we're looking at a very tragic scene people who are not we're waiting for food0 people so reported those have already the way Hospital transferred on CS pulled by donkeys or by cars or by the the the very truck that carried the aid turned into an ambulance right now it's car it carried a bodies of injuries as well as those who have been killed and they transfer them to a shifa hospital according to an eyewitness right now on the road the cter road there are more bodies that haven't been collected haven't identified we are expecting the number within the are on the ground right on a Rashid road with no help available whatsoever given the fact that there are still drones in the in the areas and there also the the gun boats are firing at people who are getting closer uh to AI round terrible pictures that we're seeing there hanim Mahmud with all the latest for us from Rafa in southern Gaza and just to warn you that the pictures that we have been seeing um they've been bloodred we appreciate that they may be disturbing we understand and that's Al rashed Street in Gaza City where a massacre has taken place where people were collecting food Aid well in the meantime the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has condemned that attack calling it a heinous Massacre it says Israel Israeli forces killed in Cold Blood dozens of Palestinians as they waited for humanitarian Aid the ministry has called on the International Community to intervene urgently for a ceas fire let's bring in Zan BVI he joins me live now from rala in the occupied West Bank zann very strong call to action there from the PA that is correct there is no end to the extreme frustration that Palestinians and Palestinian leaders here in ramala have as they continue to watch one horrifying incident after another in Gaza strong condemnation once again for what is happening there for what has happened today uh we've seen yet another unprovoked and deliberate attack on once again targets who are civilians let's stop for a moment and really look at who it is that has been the recipient of these Israeli attacks of Israeli bullets these are people who are facing famine conditions medical standards being applied to the population in Gaza do say that starvation is happening many people hundreds of thousands of people more than half a million people living in Gaza at risk of real starvation so these people waiting in line for food clamoring for a trucks we've seen a gunfire opened on Palestinians living in Gaza in the past uh people have been injured people have been killed in and around Rafa trying to get aid but nothing at this scale nothing like this initial estimates say 70 some estimates say that that number as high as 150 killed hundreds more injured and the images coming out of there that we're seeing here are truly horrifying uh corpses of men and women being piled up on the back of lories that are meant to carry shipping containers covering the flatbed truck of these lores uh bloodied Aid food Aid boxes injuries to people's heads and torsos just bodies lining the streets there are no ambulances people are being moved on horses and Buggies uh by horse and Buggies they're being moved on backs so people are carrying people injured people to the hospitals where they can on their own backs so these are truly devastating and dire and desperate circumstances the PA foreign Ministry saying that it condemns in the strongest terms these heinous Massac committed by the Israeli forces and is once again calling on the International Community to intervene and carry out whatever it needs to do to implement a ceasefire now one thing that we've he heard from Palestinian leadership and Palestinians living here in the occupied West Bank over and over again is that there is a double standard being applied to this conflict they compare it to Ukraine and when we look back at how we covered Ukraine one incident comes to mind there was an attack by Russian forces on a breadline where nine people died and that that made headlines for days and weeks all over the world with investigations into exactly what was used and why and there was only a death toll of about nine people if you apply that standard to what has happened today to what has been going on for almost five months now then that should be enough to bring a ceasefire into place here but what Palestinians continue to say is that this is not a war in Europe that this is a war in Palestine and the standards here are applied very differently Zan BVI with the latest for us there from rala in the occupied West Bank thank you Zayn well let's now go to vill Marks he joins me from occupied East Jerusalem villm a has been so tightly restricted by the Israeli that we see these huge crowds gather to collect whatever they can when Aid does make it in what's the situation like now in terms of trucks actually crossing the border soia this has been obviously a hugely contentious issue for for many months almost since the start of this conflict we've had huge pressure from the International Community to try and increase the flow of Aid into the Gaza Strip particularly the last couple of months there's been a huge push to try and get more food Aid in particular up to the Northern parts of the strip that had been emptied somewhat during the earlier stages of the war the un uh have been talking about the fact that just in the last few weeks there's been a significant drop off in the amount of Aid entering into Gaza overall the world food program in particular for many weeks now has been talking about the risks to people in the North of Gaza who do not have enough access to food and the impact that could have both on their short and long-term Health they say one of the challenges inside Gaza is trying to coordinate safely to get trucks into areas that may be at the center of fighting in terms of the process of getting those tracks trucks into the strip though there's a lot of checks that go on inside Israeli territory before they pass into the strip that sometimes takes a huge amount of time the Israelis even objectively are not doing that full til tilt 7 days a week 24 hours a day that means there are bottlenecks that build up not all of the possible Crossings into Gaza are always open as well so there are ways that more raid could get in there there's clearly a lot of it waiting to go in and some of the consequences we're seeing in these awful images well we we know that there are these constraints and they're ongoing we've also seen seemingly systematic attacks on Aid infrastructure in the strip and that's the really difficult thing to say without the details of any specific incident we don't know whether this is deliberate targeting by Israeli forces on some of these sites clearly today's incident absolutely horrific in terms of the the number of casualties the number of injuries but at this stage Anastasia I think it's important to say we don't know quite what happened in this incident well we'll certainly be trying to answer some of those questions and bring you more on that as we get it for now villm marks there from occupied East Jerusalem thanks villm
