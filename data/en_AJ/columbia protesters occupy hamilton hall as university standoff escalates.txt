the human rights Chief vulat Turk says that he's troubled by measures taken to disperse protests against Israel's war on Gaza in universities across the United States dozens of protesters have barricaded themselves inside a building at Columbia University in New York the group has taken over Hamilton Hall which has a history of student takeovers including during the Vietnam war they infered a banner calling it Hines wall in memory of a six-year-old girl killed in Gaza it came ours after the university started suspending student demonstrators who defired an ultimatum to leave their encampments well in a moment we'll speak to shab bransi we'll have the latest from George Washington University in the US capital where he is but first let's speak to Christen salumi she joins us now from Columbia University in New York Where it All Began Kristen uh various universities and schools obviously joining the protest so what's happening where you are on Tuesday access to the Columbia University campus has been greatly restricted today after the Takeover of that building Hamilton Hall now only students who live on campus and essential faculty are being allowed there uh no media access in recent days there's been limited access for media During certain times to get on the campus but we're being told that no media will be allowed today uh due to safety conditions unless safety conditions on campus change that said I've been speaking with one of the student organizers of the encampment and he says that the mood on campus is quite calm in fact he uh estimates that there's actually more people in the encampment today than there were yesterday when the word came that the uh students would be suspended as of 2: p.m. if they did not uh evacuate their encampment that just brought out hundreds of supporters students and teachers surrounding the encampment uh protecting the encampment that continued throughout the day and into the evening when a separate group of students and I'm told by this organizer that this group who took over Hamilton Hall is a uh separate group from the encampment uh the there were people on board for for that they were protecting the space outside when that happened and if you see behind me uh this is the one gate that's opened and Hamilton Hall is the building uh behind me there's one Banner hanging out the window that says free Palestine as well as other uh banners on the other side of the building facing the campus so what's the police response been to all of this Kristen there is still a fairly heavy police presence outside of the campus you can see the barricades that were set up behind me those were put there by New York police officers uh yesterday there was a very very heavy police presence around the campus including Vans and the type of vehicles that would be used to take protesters to be processed were they arrested and this was fueling the rumors that there would be arrests if the students did not Evacuate the area it didn't happen in the end uh the police never did go on campus they're not on campus now they're just outside clearly the university does not want a repeat of what happened uh two weeks ago when they sent the NYPD onto the campus to arrest students that only outraged the student community and brought more supporters out and started this movement that we're seeing nationally at other campuses uh and if there's one thing that the faculty of the University agree on it is that they don't approve of the response that the administration took for its students the university Senate condemned the administration for calling in the NYPD so clearly uh the n the Administration has been reluctant to have a repeat of that but at the same time they're facing pressure from their trustees to get this under control before graduation in two weeks we'll continue to monitor with you what happens through the day at Columbia University fiston leave me there for us thank you well let's head over to the US capital now where sh bran is standing by George Washington University the past few days we've been uh seeing highly well attended protests uh calm and peaceful uh is it still like that sheab it's remarkably tranquil soell people are just having their breakfasts now the students there was a calisthetics just underway over behind one of those tents over there let's talk to one of the student organizers though Miriam um it is peaceful here is there any indication that that that's likely to change now though I mean we know that the authorities at GW George Washington University have been calling on the police to crack down but what's your sense now yeah so we're not sure exactly what's going to happen here um but what we do know is that um we're here fighting for our demands we're demanding that the university protect Pro Palestinian speech on campus that they drop all charges against organizers and organizations um who are fighting against genocide um that they disclose all Investments and endowments divest from all funds related to Israel and and all academic Partnerships with the Zionist state of Israel and all we know is that we're going to be here fighting for those demands until they're met and we're going to keep fighting I was going to say because term is actually ending today I think isn't it so you're going to stay for the foreseeable future though yes we will be staying we're not going anywhere until our demands are met we are staying now it's a contrast here though to the scenes we're seeing in other campuses around the country what's going through your mind though when you see the police cracking down in Austin or elsewhere with pepper spray and batons I mean what what do you make of all that yeah so um I you know nowhere is the police keeping us safe um what we've seen here is just an incredible full amount of community support the community is really showing up for each other we keep each other safe um and we know we cannot trust the police or the University or any other institution to do that for us right so I mean and yet the police say that they're they're going to they're not going to crack down so what I mean should we say should we conclude from that then then suddenly there's an outpouring of democratic values in the Metropolitan Police Department no I don't think that um that the concern with Optics um and removing peaceful protesters is saying anything about um uh you know how how uh liberal the cops are here um really it's just about it's an obstal issue um and you know we see gup uh gwpd um George Washington Police Department had asked um the Metropolitan Police Department to clear this encampment um and they had refused um so we are seeing that the university um is pushing for us to be removed because we are being disruptive um we have to be disruptive there's no business as usual during a genocide we've just had another statement from the White House again um characterizing the protest as anti-semitic President Biden it says condemns the use of the term inter father and the anti-semitic slogans that have been thrown around in the last few days I'm paraphrasing what do you make of that and there is this disconnect isn't there between what the White House is saying and in fact actually the Democratic party college students Association has just come out in favor of the protest there the leadership does seem rather isolated on this yeah so I think that um really the our demands are clear um and you know they have nothing to do with the Jewish people I as a Jew myself I feel more safe being Jewish here in this encampment than I do outside of this encampment and that is because everyone here believes in Collective Liberation for all people I know that I'm included in that um and just the conflation that we've been seeing between um what we're doing with our demands our anti-zionist demands um and anti-Semitism is a complete diversion tactic um to take the focus away from what's going on in Palestine um the genocide that we've been seeing for over 200 days um to the Palestinian people Mariam thank you thank you so much so yes all quiet here as as we said though not for want of trying on the part of the administrators so we will see how this how this does pan out as always these things can change so quickly sh there for us uh in Washington DC thank you make sure to
