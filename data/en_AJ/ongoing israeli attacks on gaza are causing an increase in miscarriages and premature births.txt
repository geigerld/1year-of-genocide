now some of the most vulnerable victims of Israel's war on Gaza are pregnant women and the continuing attacks are causing an increasing number of miscarriages and premature births the UN estimates that around 50,000 women in Gaza are pregnant and around 180 of them are reaching their due dates every day the Palestinian Ministry of Health says it's documented hundreds of miscarriages and premature births often in unsanitary conditions Palestinian doctors say malnutrition is also contributing to the miscarriages with mothers facing complications because they don't have enough to eat and are unable to reach Emergency Care let's speak to Dr Tanya Hajj Hassan about this she's a Pediatric Intensive Care doctor working with msf Doctors Without Borders and she's joining us from Aman Dr Tanya very good to have you again on Al jazer so a sharp increase in the number of miscarriages among pregnant women in Gaza an increase in the premature births why is this happening what is it like if you're a pregnant woman today in Gaza yeah thank you fully um so there's clear evidence that you end up with an increased race rate of miscarriage still birth pre-term birth and small for gestation or small for the age uh of the baby uh so baby's born too small for for their age in settings in humanitarian settings particularly conflict uh whether are under an enormous amount of stress and I can talk about that in a second and that compromises a lot of things including the blood supply to the baby the mother's health uh and ultimately how early the baby's delivered or whether the baby survives so babies are often uh born um Dead uh or die within the womb and the mother has a miscarriage uh or they're born too early too small and the consequences of a baby born too early too small are increased death after birth so increased Neal death chronic illness uh into childhood and even into adulthood including developmental delay so you end up with a reduced life expectancy in a lot of cases we know that the maternal and neonatal death rates are going to Skyrocket unfortunately gaza's Health Ministry has been unable to compile data for infant maternal mortality during the assault right but doctor Aid groups all say that miscarriages and still births have spiked they're talking about they're talking about hundreds of cases right now of these miscarriages the Gaza Health Ministry do you think this is just a tip of the iceberg and it could be many many more absolutely I mean there's no data from the north uh barely any from the middle middle areas of Gaza and in the South we know that the majority of women are not actually delivering in healthcare facilities there's one remaining small Hospital in the South that is uh providing most of the maternal care for a population of over 2 million and like I said 50,000 women who are expecting um and I you know I think the figure is close 140 150 women delivering day right um I can talk to a little bit bit about the Journey of pregnant women in Gaza from the stories that we've heard both from msf colleagues and other medical professionals in the Gaza Strip pregnant women are experiencing the same horrors of of of the all of the civilian in the Gaza Strip so they are fearing for their own lives they're fearing for the lives of their children they're being bombarded indiscriminately and we've had stories of pregnant women who've lost multiple members of their family including their their husband the father of their unborn child they're uh displaced right often living in a tent with no heat no access to clean water or food and a malnourished pregnant mother dehydrated mother is is a danger to her and her baby in all trimester ERS and then when it comes and and a lot of them are are being killed during pregnancy we've had numerous stories of what are called postpartum cesarian sections so cesarian sections that are done in a mother that has died right and we do them as fast as possible it's an emergency procedure to try and extract the baby and get oxygen into that baby before they die most of those will be unsuccessful and both the mother and the baby will succumb that it's just incredible what you're describing there Dr Tanya let me just ask you a little bit more about the miscarriages because of course many women around the world suffer miscarriages but to go through it in the context of a war is is just unimaginable what does this kind of traumatic crisis have um the impact of it have on the health of women their physical health of women in Gaza but also on their mental well-being in particular yeah you know fully I'm I'm at a loss for words I you know I get asked about specific types of trauma on specific individuals they're experiencing every possible type of trauma physical psychological like I you know I just received a message this morning from a colleague of mine who's a female doctor in Gaza and uh we were just joking around uh she's unmarried and uh she said you know I'm I'm thanking God right now that I don't have children being a mother in Gaza right now is uh Beyond imagination having to worry about yourself about about the health of your baby um and I think you know I would agree with that another colleague of ours a nurse uh early on uh had sent a message saying uh that essentially my hope is that if I get killed uh um sorry my hope is that I get killed with my children altogether so let me let me read you the exact message so um I really convey uh the horror of that this mother exper was experiencing yeah she said my hope is to die with all my children and not leave them and them not leave me I cannot live without them and I do not want to die and leave them here in this unjust world this is a nurse colleague and I think that's the sentiment that a lot of mothers are are carrying you know about two mothers are dying every are being killed every hour that's approxim 48 mothers per day there are 20,000 um uh um babies that have been born I mean about about 180 babies born today born into this into a life where they have no access uh consistent access to breast milk because the mothers are dehydrated and malnourished there's no formula there's a a shortage of diapers colleagues in Gaza have reached out you know when I asked ask them what do they need most just so we can try and coordinate Aid and and they say we need formula we need formula for the babies the babies are malnourished we need um yeah diapers we don't diapers it's really unimaginable what what these children and women are going through right now in Gaza Dr Tanya as always very good to talk to you thank you so much for sharing these experiences with us Dr Tanya Haan yeah thank you thank you for having me on I I just want to add one last thing you know we as humanitarian professionals are asked to come on and and describe this suffering over and over because people are calling this a humanitarian crisis a humanitarian crisis implies a humanitarian solution there is no safe humanitarian space right now in Gaza there's also no humanitarian solution for something that's so catastrophic right the only solution is a ceasefire and and then an immense amount of humanitarian Aid to relieve all the suffering that I and so many others continue to describe to you on this show thank you for giving us the space to do that I just want to ask everybody please amplify your voices put pressure our colleagues in Gaza are exhausted we cannot afford to be exhausted too the world needs to understand to stop now thank you so much dror Tanya thank you for joining us on Al jazer Tanya haassan a ped Pediatric Intensive Care doctor joining us here from Aman thanks fly
