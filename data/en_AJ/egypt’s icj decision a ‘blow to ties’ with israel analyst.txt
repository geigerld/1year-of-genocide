Egypt's government has announced it will now support the lawsuit filed by South Africa the international court of justice accusing Israel of genocide the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in light of the increasing severity and scope of Israeli aggressions against Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip we call on Israel to comply with its obligations as the occupying power and its implementation of the interim measures issued by the international court of justice we renew our call on the security Council and the influential International parties to immediately move to a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip well in January the icj ordered Israel to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza within that ruling was an order to prevent killing and serious bodily and mental harm to the Palestinian people measures must also be taken to prevent and punish the incitement of genocide allowing basic services and Aid into Gaza and to prevent the destruction of evidence of possible war crimes but since January rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have documented how Israel has still violated all those provisional measures Walia fary is a professor of political science at Long Island University she joins us live from Princeton in New Jersey a very warm welcome to you Dalia so Cairo has been as we've been saying a key mediator in this conflict so far what is Egypt's participation now of the icj alongside South Africa mean for legal proceedings there the world's highest quot so this is really an unprecedented moment in the history of the the modern day history between Egypt and Israel Egypt has been the most important mediator in the region the first Arab Nation to recognize and formalize ties with Israel in 1979 and here is this moment the symbolic moment where the Egyptian government puts its foot down on on four basic reasons and the first is the humanitarian one that you cited where the Ministry of Foreign Affairs says that the intervention currently comes in increasing severity and that Israel's actions in Gaza leading to the deaths of almost 40,000 individuals um violates International humanitarian law and the fourth con Geneva Convention um in terms of protecting civilians um they also talk and mention about the systemic practices against Palestinians that are leading to um starvation and the provisional measures that the I the icj had asked for that that would ensure humanitarian relief actually be instituted and so that's at the humanitarian level now this moment has deeper implications at the political level because Israel has not proved itself in the eyes of Egypt as a good faith NE negotiator it didn't sign on to the ceasefire agreement even though it had mentioned that it would um also for months Egyptian officials have stated that an Israeli invasion of Rafa would risk peace ties between the two countries so it's more so than the iscj r ruling it's also a blow to the ties between the two countries because Israel has violated they've they've actually seized the border and and they've taken tactical provisional authority over border I just want I just wonder given Israel's ability to ignore ignore those provisional measures that all important injunction that cease and desist order at the icj so far if they're able to do that given the pressure from South Africa surely they're able to continue doing that with Egypt in the mix as well but this is more symbolic because the ties between Egypt and all of the other countes that had signed on with South Africa are are different so Egypt would be the closest Ally sharing a border sharing a longstanding C Camp David agreement um but but also Israel did this one other thing to Egypt and violating security by seizing operational control of this border and um creating instability right on on on the border territory and so this violation is also to the international if you will status quo of stability and so besides violating the rights of the Palestinians it's also now violated several International agreements that have been held long held between Egypt and Israel given cairo's long and historical relationship with with the United States I wonder how much of a blessing possibly Washington has given to this move by Egypt it's unclear but we did see um secretary blink's statement today which has been the harshest towards Israel saying that any ground Invasion um would be not just a violation but there would be no guarantee of security of the Palestinians and so um today's statement from from Egypt actually signing on as well as secretary blinken um statement do indicate a a possible change however is Isel going to heed this we know that there are reports of 300 tanks that have entered Rafa already so it's not clear that any of this will lead to to a behavioral change yeah just talking specifically about Rafa so apparently the US will not withhold weapons unless there is evidence of a fullscale assault in Rafa but given of course that we've seen air strikes on a near daily basis we've seen uh dozens of people losing their life in in Rafa over the past few days I mean how consistent how coherent is this us position right now the the US position has been deeply problematic and inconsistent um we know that the reports from the hospitals that have been emptied and and that there have been not just violations of human rights but gross violations of human rights bodies found buried alive and and handcuffed to the back that the violations that we've seen today the world has not seen in decades and decades the world had not seen really since post in post in the post World War II era and so these violations that are coming to light as well as the blanket um elimination of media from the territory the the closing down of Al jaaz as well this is kind of what happens in darkness is worse than what happens in light and so again we don't know what will happen what we don't what we do know that's already been documented is these gross violations of human rights and of the Geneva Convention just putting this um lastly into a historical context because you mentioned those all important Camp David Accords back in 1979 normalizing relations defining the border between Israel and Egypt I just wonder whether all of this is the start of a great unraveling of that historical moment it it possibly is we're we're seeing the brink of of World War III possibly and and not to sound hyperbolic it's because For the First time we're watching for example Nations like the United States like the United Kingdom act in ways that are against their own National Security the Camp David was signed because of not just the security and sanctity of Israel but also to secure us interests in the region flyover rights over Sinai the Suez Canal counterterrorism cooperation and so is really in the best interest of the United States as well and here we see for the first time in recent modern history countries like the US acting against their own National Security interests and so as we continue down this path we don't heed the warnings perhaps we are entering into a myad where International Norms of rules based um International World Order are going to unravel and what we've seen in the past few months since January since South Africa brought this to the icj is that it is third world countries if you will who have been trying to uphold the rules-based world order in spite of the Western World great unraveling of the international World Order Dal of fari many
