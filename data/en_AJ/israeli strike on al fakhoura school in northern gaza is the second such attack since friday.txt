okay let's bring in Samuel Romani who's is an associate fellow with the Royal United Services Institute he joins us live from London a very warm welcome to you I wonder if we can reflect on what we've just heard there from my colleague Mike Hannah um so Joe Biden leader of the Free World is saying that Gaza in the West Bank should be reunited under a single governance structure it's all good and well you know Jumping the Shark or jumping the gun and setting out a vision for the future but what we've got right now is a bitter conflict raging on the ground with no end in do you think it was a wise decision for him to publish a statement like that well I think that basically the US is trying to distance itself from n's comments about the indefinite security presence which many particularly within his far Coalition like Ben gavier and others have interpreted as a reoccupation of Gaza like before 2005 and Biden wants to make it clear that that's not the US's position and other American officials have been doing the same thing we saw Brett mcer another senior American official say in the five NOS that he about the Gaza War one of them is no to occupation the Israelis have suggested all that needs to happen is for Hamas fighters to surrender and to hand over the captives or the war will continue meanwhile the kasan Brigade they gave a statement on Friday saying that they basically ready for a long war and then they've planned for all of this this sounds like a commitment from both of these belligerant to continue this conflict whatever the cost what are your thoughts well I think it's very likely that this war is going to continue for a long time time it was pretty telling in n's uh recent interview last weekend saying that you know he wouldn't rule out a war of even lasting longer than a year so this the Israelis are ined for the Long Haul because they want to destroy all of Hamas not just decapitate the Gaza City leadership but also the Hamas militants in their tunnels and the Alazan brigades Hamas know this is an existential War for them so they're going to keep fighting for as long as possible in that case how can you find a political root out of this when they're doesn't seem to be a single moderate voice involved well I may think that's extremely difficult I mean obviously on narrow issues like what Qatar is doing with regards to the relief of the hostages there could be some incremental progress and that might also translate into humanitarian puses the compromises that digital made earlier on in the conflict to reopen two of the three major water pipes and allow a little bit of fuel now maybe coming in through the rer crossing are the kinds of compromises we can expect but a grand bargain a solution a truce like we saw happen in 2009 or 2021 after a relatively short conflict is not really going to happen right now after more than a month of War of this um asymmetrical conflict how do you evaluate hamas's military capabilities do you think that they anticipated this respose well I mean Hamas before the war reportedly had about eight months of stockpiles of weapons that he could have and that included a lot of rockets which are very cheaply made $300 some of them made by constructing pipes together and they also have a great deal of motivation and uh they know that this war is existential for them so even though Hamas doesn't have that much in terms of technological sophistication it still can strike back also they got RPGs which seem to have damaged some Israeli artillery that's probably why the Israelis have asked for 75 light armored inry vehicles in the United States in their arms request package now we've been saying for a few days now that there are apparent signs of cracks uh in the United States certainly public opinion appears to be shifting possibly also views in the White House shifting also but given the US has just approved of 145 billion military aid package for Israel what could we really count as proof of any real change of policy US policy towards Israel well I mean I think that there's some internal criticism obviously of the US policy towards Israel we saw that with the 200 USD Department employees who expressed uh opposition to it and we've seen that also with some comments from figures like John Kirby because basically saying that Israel is not doing enough to kill to prevent civilians from being killed but those are in line with the past us responses for example even though George W Bush was so pro Israel in 2002 he spoke out against Israeli killings in the West Bank on one occasion so with more just slapping on the risk and chiding Israel and no sign of any kind of a strategic break between the US and Israel and that's why the arms package is going ahead us is still supporting Israel despite some reservations about the civilian cost associated with doing so so it is possible for the US to play the role of critical friend but maybe so far not critical enough Sam Romani from the Royal United Services Institute many thanks thank you very much
