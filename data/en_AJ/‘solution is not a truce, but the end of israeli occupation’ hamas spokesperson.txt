now Hamas has released a statement holding Israel and the Biden Administration responsible for the resumption of hostilities the group says it offered to hand over the bodies of an Israeli family and released the father to allow him to hold their funerals as well as hand over two other Israeli detainees Hamas says Israel refused to continue with the ceasefire agreement because it had already made the decision to resume fighting now earlier hamas's spokesman Osama hamon spoke to Al jazer about the end of the ceas it's the time now to make it and say it clearly the cause of the problem is the occupation the real solution is not to find temporary poses the real solution is to find mechanisms and ways to put an end to the occupation we uh have exerted efforts we will exert efforts even with the renewal of the aggression against our people we will do our best to face the aggression everyone is considering our efforts as resistants who are facing the aggression we have spent some good time to have conversation with all the mediators and we need to thank the efforts of Kat and Egypt in order to reach a formula to put an end to the aggression but but the aggression has stopped everything and the Zionist regime is rejecting everything because uh he doesn't want but as a resistance we will face the Israeli Zionist regime we will defend our people we will be open for any efforts that aims at putting an end to the aggression within the B benefits and the interests of our people let's bring in now Al jazer Sarah hyat who's in Tel Aviv for us so Sarah there was always of course the risk that this would happen the resumption of this war because prime minister Netanyahu had been adamant that the war would continue what are they saying about the resumption of this new phase of the conflict yeah there's so much to unpack here Folly but one thing that all of uh uh the Israeli uh uh government the war cabinet the Prime Minister anyone making these decisions they all agree on one thing that this had to be resumed and they'd been warning about this for a while actually saying that uh if Hamas hadn't provided for example the list that they had expected if there was any violations uh they would immediately uh resume uh the war and and in the words of some of those uh for example the defense minister that it would be ferocious um now they've blamed Hamas wholeheartedly on this uh for various reasons they said that they' violated uh the ceasefire by firing Rockets we know that these Rockets have been targeting uh the southern towns all morning uh and then also in a statement from the prime minister's office uh he said that it had not met its obligation to release all of the with women hostages today and has launched rocket attacks that I just mentioned earlier we have got official figures that have also been released by the Israel person who's in charge of keeping tabs on the captives it seems that 20 of those remaining are women in terms of the response from Hamas well they've said and they've told Al jazer that they provided it seems three lists or three options of names including uh the bodies of uh bibas the family which is a mother and her two children a four-year-old and a 10-month yearold and he was the youngest hostage they're saying that they were provid providing those on that list that they were happy to hand them over and also that they had offered to hand over their father so that he could be there and attend uh their burial this has never been verified by the Israelis they've maintained until last night when Daniel hagari the spokesman of the Israeli military had maintained uh that um it was unverified information whether they'd been killed in the first place and said that Hamas was using this as a propaganda uh Tool uh this seems to have been the sticking point that was dis us yesterday in Israeli media that they didn't want to have any bodies on that list of the 10 captives that would be uh release and it seems this has been one of the major sticking points so the main sticking point uh from the Israeli perspective is the the hand over of the bodies as you say of the bias family the the the mother and the child who were killed and the father was still alive on the list of prisoners how is that going to play out and how is the resumption of the war Sarah playing out with the the families of the captives for the families of the captives I mean we've been here now for the whole duration of this ceasefire and one thing they keep saying uh to us and one thing we keep seeing in terms of the rallies is that they want to ensure that all of the captives are brought back home when you're seeing videos of uh unifications between those that had been taken on October 7 being unified with their parents with their loved ones and those videos are being shared although there haven't actually been interviews with the ones that were held captive but their families are speaking and that's their priority they want to ensure all of them are returned it has come as a major shock I will say for the Israelis especially when it comes to the Bas family according to Hamas being killed by air strikes that was that this family theas family has been if you like the face of the campaign to bring them back so to hear such news from a couple of days ago and it being unverified until now that is a major major cause of concern for the families because they don't want those that are remaining which is now standing at more than 130 people to also uh be targeted or hit in these air strikes that are happening at the moment as we speak and that is one of the biggest concerns for them they want their families home they want them here and they want them safe Sarah thank you for the update Sarah H rat live for us there in Tel Aviv
