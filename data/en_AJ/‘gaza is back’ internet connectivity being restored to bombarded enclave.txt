okay let's speak now on the phone to safwat Al kalut our correspondent in Gaza some positive news at least with the return of telephone and internet communication stff what talk us through what the last 24 hours have been like look let me say the first that all of our neighbors here where we are displaced our work up and immediately they grab their phones and try to communicate with their families since most of the people here have been displaced from uh the north of the Gaza Strip as well as Gaza City to the southern area based on the Israeli War so uh the last 24 hours was uh let's say the hardest in the last uh three weeks of Israeli War and God since at least people cannot or could not communicate and ask about theirs following as as they have been used using to do following every Israeli air strike uh in Gaza uh internet and social media was the only way that people could communicate especially in different areas in the Gip and to communicate also with the with theirs who are who live abroad I because I have uh one of the rare people who could have some international SIM cards I have been receiving many calls and many messages from people living outside asking me to go and check if they if uh their families their relatives are still alive so that's now I'm I had a quick uh look on social media they describ uh the resumption of internet and the telecommunication or communication means as a thirsty man who found some water in the in uh the desert so this is the case in the Gaza Strip now the Israelis say they now have soldiers inside Gaza can you report on any on the ground fighting look the tonight was relatively quiet in comparison with previous night no and we cannot normally during any ground operation there is huge artillery coverage which we have not hit like yesterday for example but what what the Israelis have been trying is to create new ground uh facts by sending troops and creating new uh across the border bases but since uh we uh we have been receiving lots of uh messages and declarations by the fighting groups that they were able to uh uh to to confront with the Israelis and to send them back to inside the Israeli Israeli side of the Border still uh Kasam brigades they released a video for their Fighters firing an anti-tank uh cornate rocket uh which means that there are still uh clashes or confrontations taking place across the borders but still the strength of the fire tonight was is less than it was last night and safwat briefly if you can what is the latest humanitarian situation on the ground I mean we're looking at these desperate pictures of people trying to get uh relatives from out of rubble uh we know some Aid has been allowed through the rougher border crossing in recent days do you know how much has managed to reach those in need look this is like a trop in the ocean what have been entering in inside the Gaza there is lack of everything from the needle as they say until the you know the the essential uh medicines needed for for the surgery and for medical intervention in Gaza there is lack of water food medicine equipment now the minister of Health say they believe that there are still 1,000 300 Palestinians are stranded or stuck under the rubble most of them are dead and some of are still alive but they don't have the the the the needed machines to bring them out of the rubble either because the Israelis are Banning these heavy duty machines or because of the lack of uh fuel needed to even operating these machines so the hospitals are still conducting surgers without uh without uh anesthesia and uh yesterday passed by Sha Hospital you know uh the doctors they still suffer from um you know the minimum needs that they need to uh intervene and to help us or survive the the injuries they appealed Egypt to open the crossings ra Crossing urgently to send the injuries to the Egyptian side to get receive the proper treatment in the saai hospitals safat we really appreciate your reporting this difficult time safat Al Kut speaking to us there on the phone from G now if you're wondering what that sound is in the background that constant uh droning sound that is indeed Israeli drones uh flying constantly over Gaza that's the sound we're hearing in the background
