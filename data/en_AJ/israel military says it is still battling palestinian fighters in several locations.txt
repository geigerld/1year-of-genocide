let's recap the other big developments of the day besides the surg in Israeli deaths in the Gaza War Israel began shelling Gaza since early Dawn on Sunday many buildings were damaged in the strikes at least 330 Palestinians have been killed so far Israel has also deployed troops along the Lebanon border after hisbah shelled areas under its occupation Israel retaliated with artillery fire after three posts were hit in the Sheba Farms areas let's cross now to Al DA's senior political analyst Maran Bashar who joins us live now from Paris uh Maran you know the story all too well and it's ongoing tragedy for the Palestinians now Hamas assault has killed at least 600 Israelis so far we have more than uh 300 Palestinian dead it's hard to believe we're only not even 48 hours in we're just over 48 hours in what do you make of all this well first and foremost it's tragic as all wars are tragic mad our dad and in this case uh you know quite surreal uh because we've seen it repeat itself again and again leading to more of the same results uh in fact uh the two sides are locked in in some sort of a fatal dance with death uh now uh you know a good number of decades and uh clearly uh over the past two three or four years the Israelis have shown themselves to be uh you know quite indifferent in a totally new way uh to the Palestinian uh cause or to the Palestinian suffering or to the Palestinian demand for justice uh the past uh government or two in Israel uh have shown to be the most fanatic the most fascist in Israel's history and they certainly uh abandoned uh you know any diplomacy and clearly uh doubled down on repress ing the Palestinians uh doubl down on the their illegal settlements and clearly made the Palestinians invisible and what we've seen the last 24 hours are the Palestinians making themselves visible uh you know whatever means uh necessary as it were and some of their means of course uh have been terrorizing uh some of those towns in the southern part of Israel uh I think in so many ways and I think we really need to abandon some of the language has been used as cliches by now about this about this issue you know every once you know every time this happens you know a microphone is shoved in you know in front of someone asking to condemn and condemn and condemn let's all condemn you know whatever the Palestinian side the Israeli side but then what condone for what purpose because as the two sides are locked in in this uh nonsensical conflict something Gotta Give in the sense of ending what they call uh the root cause and there is a root cause because there's an occupation and there's an occupier and it's been going on for over 55 years everyone knows that in the world every Israeli knows that that but you wouldn't think so you wouldn't think so when you listen to the response of world leaders you know like Biden and the UK and so forth not to mention a lot of media around the world you know I've been talking about this cause and effect but nobody in those circles is talking about the cause they're just talking about the effect you no absolutely you are right 100% And this is the problem the problem is that there is certain hypocrisy in approaching these things and framing them in whichever way that is uh you know appeases one's partners and in the sense uh you know the same French people right who were engaged in the war in Algeria concluded long time ago that this sort of an occupation leads to only 1 million deaths and ends up in the withdrawal of French troops from Algeria and for the French 75% of their public opinion at the time deciding this was a really terrible war that France should not get involved in because it was a colonial war now everyone knows something similar happened in Northern irand something happened in Iraq more recently occupation and colonialism doesn't work occupation in the 21st century certainly is p the only one example today of uh such colonialism is Israel Palestine but you say most of not only officials journalists I would say in a certain lazy way approach this uh issue in a most cliche way frame it for me please anyone you know they need to frame it what is is this occupation or not because clearly there's an overwhelming understanding even consensus that there is an occupation so why don't we judge it as such then why don't we judge the wh scale violation of Human Rights and civil rights of of the occupation of because occation is a system of violence but they don't do that why because in this in their frame it's not the action that's being judged it's the actor so Palestinian Commandos are terrorists Israeli Commandos are liberators and Protectors of Israeli civilians so the language being used is really double standard the the the the the right of resistance is not accepted and yes as I said just earlier Hamas has you has terrorized terrorized the Israeli populations and you know other segments of Israel including its military in the southern part of Israel and I think Hamas should own up to it because the International Community has abandoned uh the Palestinian cause and international law has forgotten the Palestinians and their cause and now seems like number ofans abandoning international law M great to get your analysis appreciate that bashara there speaking to just there from Paris thank you
