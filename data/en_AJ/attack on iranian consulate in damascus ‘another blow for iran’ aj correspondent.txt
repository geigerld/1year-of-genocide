we begin with a developing story out of Syria an Israeli air strike has hit the Consular section of the Iranian Embassy in the capital Damascus at least five people have been killed among the dead is a senior commander of the Islamic revolutionary guard Corps several of the embassy's diplomats have also reportedly been killed in the attack Iran's foreign minister says the Israeli attack is a breach of all International conventions let's bring in our correspondent Zena hod she's joining us live from Beirut and Zena is Iran saying that a consular Annex was attacked by fighter jets what are you learning about this incident well no doubt this is a major escalation in Regional tensions both Syria and Iran are accusing Israel of targeting the Iranian Consulate in the heart of the Syrian Capital Damascus the pictures the videos emerging from Damascus show a building completely flattened this is a diplomatic Mission and diplomatic missions should be safe they should be immune according to international law so this is really akin to targeting a country on another country's soil now the Iranian ambassador to Syria says that he was in the next the adjacent building he survived the attack he's also saying and promising that Iran is going to respond in his words the response will be Swift and and harsh other Iranian officials on Twitter are saying that quote the Zionist regime entered a new phase in this war by attacking an embassy and that no Israeli Embassy will be safe so this no doubt is a significant attack Israel has been targeting Iranian and Iranian link targets for years now uh but this is the first time hitting a consulate they've killed Generals in the past but in this particular strike they also killed a ranking uh commander in the cus Force so yet another major blow to Iran a number of Iranian generals have been killed in recent months so Iran is promising a retaliation and this really has we've seen a pattern and optic in the Israeli strikes um you know uh targeting Iranian positions and Iranian Pol link positions in Syria in in the past few months ever since October ever since the war on Gaza began and ever since the Iranian L so-called axis of resistance opened fronts against Israeli forces to help Palestinians in Gaza Zena thank you very much for that that's our correspondent Z with what we know so far joining us live from Beirut let's bring in hamuth she's live and occupied East Jerusalem H the White House says they're looking into the reports of what's happened in Damascus but has there been any comment from the israelies about this attack there there's been no comment from the Israelis on this attack in Syria as is per the typical Israeli policy of not commenting on their military activities in Syria but it comes after Israel's defense minister just a couple of days ago yab Galan speaking saying that Israel is going to intensify its attacks on all enemies whether it's in Lebanon whether it's in Damascus and however far they are additionally we know that Israel's military Chief of Staff hery halevi while speaking in Israel's North has said that they authorized plans for quote the continuation of fighting that is with Lebanon but it could also mean a continuation of strikes on Syria the Israelis have said repeatedly that they are going to go after any Target anywhere in the world wherever and whenever they see fit additionally they have said that whenever they carry out a strike in the daytime it means that they have direct and precise Intelligence on a Target or on a person they are trying to Target or assassinate so while there's been no comment on the Israelis from this remember that there was also no comment from the Israelis back when salahi was assassinated in Lebanon as well so it's unlikely we are going to be hearing from the Israelis on this strike in Syria as per the regular Israeli military policy ham thank you for that ham Salud joining us live from occupied East Jerusalem we're going to bring in our correspondent Ali Hashim now aliu have covered the region extensively Iran State media has confirmed that Muhammad Rea shahadi of Iran's revolutionary guard cor has been killed what do we know about him well Muhammad zahidi is one of the most senior irgc commanders he used to be before uh being dispatched to to the region to to Lebanon and Syria he was also the uh head of Iran's area the irgc's aerial forces the ground forces he took several responsibilities over the past years however um he's been in and out in in Lebanon since the 80s and and '90s and was said to be the head of the irgc in Lebanon now meaning to be the head of irgc in Lebanon means that he's in very close coordination with Lebanese group hasballah and in 2021 uh after Javad gafari who was Iran's irgc commander in Syria was dismissed he was appointed as the head in Lebanon and and Syria so he's a very senior commander and he has a lot of uh respect inside Iran especially within the hierarchy of the leadership okay so really a huge Target here it's of course not the first killing of someone from the Islamic revolutionary guard core since the war on Gaza began we were hearing from our correspondent and occupied East Jerusalem ham the Salud she was talking about the assassination of the Hamas leader Salah alarri and and he was said to have you know been going between Hamas between Hezbollah if we look at the pattern of who's been killed since October 7th who is Israel going after well in fact there there have been several assassinations over the past six months starting with a couple of Iranian irgc Tech guys uh they are officers in the irgc but they're mainly specialized in technology and I think as as they were as the Israelis accused them they were responsible for drone attacks these were the first two irgc officers who were killed in Syria and in Israeli a strike then there was an assassination of a Hamas uh operative in Syria and that was surprising because of all what we know of on the kind of troubled relations between Hamas and Syria and that was responsible for launching Rockets from the Goan Heights to from Golan towards the occupied Golem then the assassination of razil musawi who was the irgc logistics guy he was one of the most senior irgc commanders in in Syria and actually he was killed near Damascus then the assassination of saluri then the assassination of the irgc intelligence unit in Syria and now the killing of uh zahidi General zah General zahidi and it's not only zahid who was killed his assistant his Deputy actually was killed and the guy who replaced razil musawi the guy was killed in in in uh uh in December 2023 who succeeded him was also assassinated today so Israel is going behind all the networks and it seems that it's hitting the layers different layers of communication coordination and Leadership and this is aimed mainly at uh uprooting the Iranian military influence and at the same time the for example with the killing ofi the leadership of the resistance groups whether in Lebanon or in Syria of course we have to mention also the killing of hezbollah's uh field commanders uh during the past months we're hearing from Iran's foreign minister and our correspondent Zena in Beirut touched on this saying that they hold Israel responsible that there will be consequences how do you expect Iran to respond they have refrained from responding directly so far but this attack is something else is it not well over the past few months there have been several assassinations as we said but it was clear that the deterrence the Iranian deterence is distored and it isn't it it isn't uh capable of uh retaliating or they're taking a kind of a decision to keep a space or distance and not retaliating the fact is that today's attack is is different we can't give an answer because this is within the the the the area of analysis however it's more Pro most probably that with the hitting of a consulate which is kind of an Iranian soil the Iranians are in front of a big decision to take or else the deterrence will get weakened and weakened day after day and then with the killings uh of such high ranking commanders maybe we'll see much more bigger assassinations over the coming weeks Ali thank you very much for your analysis say that is our correspondent Ali Hashim
