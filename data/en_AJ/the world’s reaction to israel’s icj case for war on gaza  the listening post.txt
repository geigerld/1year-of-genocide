more than 100 days into the war on Gaza the Israeli media space is reeling over the implications of the court case in the hag and the role journalists have played in a war of Vengeance a broadcast network in Australia has been accused of caving in to the pro-israel lobby and firing one of its journalists plus Finland tries to fortify future Generations against misinformation fake [Music] news since South Africa brought its genocide case against Israel to the international court of justice last week the reaction from the Israeli news media has been incredulous some pundits have been mocking the case others have criticized Israeli officials not for the Mass Slaughter in Gaza but for their cander including some blood curdling statements that South Africa has offered as proof of genocidal intent the Israeli government is taking the prospect of losing losing this case seriously prime minister Netanyahu says he will not allow an icj ruling or anything else to stop the bombing of Gaza since October 7th more than 24,000 Palestinians have been killed and according to gaza's health Ministry at least 10,000 children hundreds of thousands more are now going hungry staring a famine in the face should the icj's ruling go against Israel the implications will extend well beyond the Middle East all the way to the US where Israel's lead sponsor will be expected to honor its obligations under the genocide convention Israel's war on Gaza is more than 100 days old and two days after the court hearings in the ha Benjamin Netanyahu was at his most defiant read between the lines though and that doesn't sound like a prime minister who thinks the international Court of justices ruling is going to go Israel's way his statement following the the hearing was for the Israeli audience to say that the war is not over and especially because of right-wing pressure from the extremists in netan government that are unsatisfied that they're moving to maybe the final stage of the war it was also aimed in significant part at the Palestinians if you think think that anyone has the power to stop us raining down high explosives on the Gaza Strip think again because we issue the orders and no one will be able to assist you and very much to the International Community you know don't think of stopping us Nan said the opposite two days before he said that Israel does not have an intention to stay forever in Gaza Israel has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or display replacing its civilian population so it was a combination of being mixed up embarrassed and not knowing exactly what to do with the political system and the media they were all shocked from this whole procedure because it came so rapidly out of the blue sky Israel is used to long long processes which never even start not to say never end and here all of a sudden Israel faced a a situ which she never faced before much of the information War Israel's been fighting since October 7th has been based in its news Studios journalists in those Studios then covered the icj hearings live in this case alongside the deputy speaker of the knesset whose name came up at the hearings as evidence of Israeli officials speaking with genocidal intent during the icj hearing on Channel first one of the guest was Parliament member Nissim vaturi who said that all Gaza should be burned down and this statement was quoted in the icj and the host asked him about the damage it caused and he started to talk about what happened on October 7 kind of preaching to them about the horrific attacks against Israel and the host told him that we already reported that we're asking you something else and when he continued they asked him to leave that kind of push back is highly unusual Israelis haven't seen much of it on their news channels in fact some of the genocidal statements raised at the icj were originally delivered from those Studios not just by politicians or commentators some of it came straight from the anchor journalists have been Among The prominent Israelis driving the propaganda they are in no position now to point the finger in a blame game from the Israeli media there are basically two themes uh the First theme is outrage along the lines of how dare they um we the ones who are the victims of uh genocide here not only during the 1940s but also on October 7th so how dare they accuse us of genocide we're only defending ourselves and the second one is basically a standing ovation for what is um uh presented as the phenomenal job Israel's legal team did in rebutting South Africa how did we get to this we after three months of war in Gaza in which the Israeli media almost all of them totally betrayed its professional Mission you don't see the people of Gaza you don't see the starvation you don't see the dying children on on flaws of hospitals the bombarding you just see vague images so Israelis came to this session of the court with a feeling that everything went right right in the war outside of Israel media Watchers criticize the UK's most watched news channels BBC and sky for failing to provide live coverage of the first day of the hearings when South Africa made its case only to carry parts of Israel's defense the following day some British interviewers had already been pushing back against Israeli talking points once the hearings wrapped up armed with the evidence South Africa had just dropped on the icj they appeared to turn the screws even tighter on Israeli officials I think it is tragic and appalling that South Africa has decided to play advocate for the devil and serve as the legal arm of I'm going to pause you there if I may Mr Levy because almost every point I put to you or every question I ask you you respond with an answer that is not relevant to the question unaccustomed to tough questions from Western news outlets some of the exchanges left this Israeli spin doctor squirming say you're going off you kill civilians this is what CH I wish we agression of war is awful it's difficult for me to comment on you know exactly what kind of motivates journalists to ask the questions that they ask but the icj case is providing foundation for journalists to consider that the allegations that Israel is committing very serious violations of international law have more credibility now that a a third state South Africa has decided to bring this case the icj's judges are expected to issue their ruling by early February if not sooner the American position on this case has not changed at least publicly as its officials keep saying the submission against Israel to the international court of justice distracts the world and moreover the charge of genocide is meritless reports like this one however quoting us officials say otherwise that President Biden is running out of patience for president Netanyahu polls indicate that Biden's backing of Israel's war on Gaza in an election year will cost him votes particularly among Young Americans as one former Israeli political adviser has suggested if Joe Biden is looking for a way out of this the icj case could provide him with one could this be the ladder that helps America walk itself to a different position where we finally shift towards a ceasefire the smart thing for an us Administration if it wants to see an end to this would be to say we didn't go to the icj but we have to respect the seriousness of these hearings assuming there is some kind of finding that is problematic for Israel's current campaign that that offers us a way forward so it could play that role if the court orders provisional measures it will mean that there is at least a plausible case that Israel is carrying out genocidal acts in Gaza and one would hope that journalists would reflect that fact in their reporting that it might shift the debate to an extent on Israel's military operation in Gaza and lend more Credence really to the notion that Israel's committing genocide these formal accusations of genocide at the highest court on the Globe May well turn out to be a turning point a very long overdue turning point but a turning point nonetheless this conflict has cost more journalists their lives than any other conflict can you imagine if the same number of Ukrainian or British journalists had been killed or Israeli journalists killed by Palestinians nuclear weapons would have been deployed against the Gaza Strip as the saying goes Palestinians are indeed children of a Lesser God the pro-israel lobby has Global reach as employees at Australia's public broadcaster ABC might tell you after the firing of a journalist there for sharing a story about Gaza on social media minak shiravi is here with more Richard a month ago a host at ABC's Sydney morning radio program Australian Lebanese journalist antoanet latf was sacked the official reason latf had reposted a Human Rights Watch report stating Israel was using starvation as a weapon of War however an investigation by the Sydney Morning Herald alleges she was let go because of something else entirely something quite nefarious the paper obtained dozens of leaked messages from a WhatsApp group called lawyers for Israel whose members wrote to ABC calling for latf to be sacked and threatening legal action if she wasn't screenshots from the group show a coordinated letter writing campaign in an email sent to All staff at ABC managing director David Anderson rejected any claim that it was influenced by any external pressure whether it be an advocacy or Lobby group a political party or a commercial entity latf called her dismissal unlawful and took ABC to court her lawyer tweeted that the sacking was based on both political opinion and race the case which looked at whether the Broadcasting Company acted under the influence of external lobbying failed to be settled at a legal hearing this past Thursday the matter didn't resolve today um but the Fight Continues and I'm willing and prepared to fight for as long as it takes this is such an important case because it's not just about me it's about Free Speech lat's case is not the first of its kind many journalists particularly in the anglosphere have lost their jobs or been suspended since October 7th for their views on the Gaza War thanks Mina social media the ability of people to broadcast their own stories has shown its importance once again during Israel's war on Gaza but online platforms can also be Hotspots for fake news one country that stresses the importance of training young people to distinguish fact from fiction is Finland the fins got a head start on this for more than half a century they had to contend with Soviet propaganda coming over their eastern border these days the misinformation comes from all directions and is mostly digital so the Finnish government has woven courses on media literacy into its school curriculums to equip fins with the tools to assess the accuracy of the information they see teachers are on the front lines of this fight for truth and the national broadcaster also has its part to play the listening posts Flo Phillips now on a societal wide educational drive that offers a model for educators broadcasters and countries around the world a grinning purple cat a bouncing yellow sun a classic combination for any animators out to attract the attention of small children huh but this video produced by finland's National audiovisual Institute has an important message about the media the kids are consuming it's been designed to help pre-primary school children work out what's real and what's not and what can be done if they're left scared or confused by what they're seeing that's because in Finland no one is too young to start thinking about the reliability of the information they encounter the approach that we are promoting is that that you have to start uh with very young children uh before the school age and and you start with with basic elements of of media and understanding of what media is about and then you build the understanding that there's always someone behind each picture and each story and the the the older the children get the deeper you go into these different parts of media and and content creation and production media literacy is not one single subject it's Tor across all subjects for example in Finish language lure we teach the basic skills we talk about fake news source analysis media criticism then in maths we might focus on statistics and algorithms in art classes students learn about images how photos are edited in history class we discussed an air raid that took place during the second world war and thought about how the same incident could be taught differently depending which side the country had fought on it's very important that we don't just teach the subject matter but also the analytical skills who produced it and for what purpose spotting fake news is a very real part of daily education here in filant sometimes it's subtly woven into everyday subjects sometimes it's more specific we're about to sit in on a class where 14-year-olds are learning all about MCE and Mal information questioning and challenging claims like the moon is made of cheese the students are very good at recognizing fake news for example when news about the war in Ukraine started appearing online fins in general have a very high standard of media literacy we're not easily fooled that's in part because media literacy Is Not A New Concept for Fins it's been part of the culture for more than a century ever since the Nordic Nation first gained independence from Russia in 1917 almost 100 years on having woed itself off from years of Soviet propaganda the fight against fake news is still being fought first in the aftermath of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and more recently with Putin's invasion of Ukraine in particular concerns about narratives challenging finland's ambition to join NATO and media literacy is now mandatory a core component of the national curriculum teaching Finnish students to form a front line of defense against any disinformation including content infiltrating the 830m long border the two countries still share During the period of finlandization in the Cold War The Finnish media were very cautious about their neighbor the Soviet Union people always had to ask themselves whether the news was really true of course there have been changes since Russia has taken on an increasingly aggressive Global role we're also spending an increasingly significant part of our lives on social media so teaching media literacy and criticism in schools is so important we were one of the first countries in in EU uh probably in the world to actually have a specific policy for media literacy there's no one single right way to promote media literacy there are multiple ways and and different organizations can do the work from their own viewpoints that way we feel that we can reach much more people than than we would be able to do if it was all done only by us uh a governmental office uh producing only only materials by the government and and telling like official story there's no escaping the multifaceted media education effort underway so many different organizations are developing and delivering learning programs from schools universities and libraries to government departments and NGS and one of the biggest players is the public broadcaster Wy Mar V is one of we's media producers she works on a number of the news Network's teaching tools including a project called news class we have 14 different news mentors working from around Finland they go and meet the class they tell them who they are and then they go through like how news come about like what do you see on the TV how does that happen and once you go through the whole process they they actually start thinking about these publication meth methods and that is really the way fake news can be detected then of course does a lot of other other things we have Wy learning which does different types of video on media education like the light detector F the Deep fake videos we produced have been really popular and the reason why we put them out was that artificial intelligence is coming at a speed where we need to kind of let people know that it exists and how it works we also offer uh different types of games that you can immerse yourself into and and think of uh what it would be like to be for instance a troll trolls foxes dogs there's a whole managerie of characters being deployed by game designers and developers to draw kids in it's the more entertaining side of the educational toolkit but that doesn't mean it's all just fun and games troll Factory is where you put yourself in the position of a troll and deliberately create as much harmful material as possible for online distribution it's quite an unpleasant game but students experience the harm of spreading misinformation which is perhaps a good thing for them while newslab uh produced troll Factory uh when Russian trolls were really on the news here in in Finland it really makes you think like I do not want to be the Lord of of Lies which is the end result when you think of kids who are Gamers if for some reason we manage to incorporate one media education game into this set of of gaming it's only a bonus playing to student strengths the media literacy program is a point of Pride one of the many International indexes where this small Nordic Nation consistently comes out on top having spent the last century schooling its citizens to fend off fake news Finland is Shifting its focus guarding against new trends Technologies and platforms to ensure that every pupil is prepared to fight false information whatever form it might take in closing more than a 100 days into the war on Gaza with nearly 120 journalists killed we are reminded of the devastating cost to our colleagues on the ground W El ddu has been described as a mountain of Journalism based in Gaza for Al jazer Arabic he has kept on reporting even after he lost his wife son daughter and a grandson to an Israeli strike in October even after he helped lay to arrest his colleague cameraman Samar Abu Daka after an Israeli attack in December that also o left daku wounded and even after the killing of his eldest son and fellow journalist Hamza in the early days of 20024 w El dhu has now left Gaza to get the medical attention his wounds require but he says he'll be back we just wanted to close by acknowledging the many journalists still on the ground still bringing you the news on this story under the most dangerous circumstances imaginable we'll see you next time here at the listening
