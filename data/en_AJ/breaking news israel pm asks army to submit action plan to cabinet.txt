it's 1600 GMT that's 6 p.m. in Gaza and Israel's prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu has ordered the military to submit to the war cabinet a plan for eliminating Hamas in the southern GZA city of Rafa you want also once a plan for evacuating the more than 1.3 million people Sheltering there but it's unclear where people trapped there could go earlier the US president described Israel's war on Gaza as over the the top but Israel is clearly undeterred moving ahead with its bombing campaign and expanding its offensive further into the South alham salut is live for us from Tel Aviv so first of all hamda is the Australia officials giving any details about this plan to invade and to evacuate well we've got a statement from the Israeli Prime Minister's office a about this expected operation inside of Rafa that says quote it is impossible to achieve the war goal of eliminating Hamas and leaving four battalions in Rafa it is clear that a massive operation inside of Rafa requires the evacuation of the civilian population from the combat zones that is why the Prime Minister directed the Israeli defense establishment to bring to the cabinet a dual plan for both the evacuation of the population and for the disbanding of the battalions now this comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke Wednesday night and vowed that the operation inaa would be imminent and it comes after strikes on Thursday hit the southern Palestinian City intense bombardment resulting in the deaths of multiple Palestinians this is something the Israel IES have been reiterating for months now that they are going to operate in teraa so the information is not exactly new but what is new is that he has asked both the Army and the defense establishment to present this plan to the cabinet on how they are going to move forward with operating inside of Raa on the ground but the big question here is where are these Palestinians supposed to go they haven't been allowed back to the north this is something that has been discussed there's been pressure on Israel by the Americans to perhaps let the Palestinians go back to the north but there is nothing to go back to a majority of those buildings those homes have been destroyed so the Israelis are saying that they're going to evacuate more than half of the population you're talking about around a million and a half Palestinians who've been forced to flee their homes multiple times and ending up in Raa which the Israeli Army had designated as a safe Zone and it is also worth noting that this is not the first time the Israeli Army is planning to attack an area that they have deemed a safe zone for Palestinians so a lot of unanswered questions still on how the Israeli Army is going to go about this plan and what sort of timeline how long is this evacuation plan of theirs going to be andham we've heard criticism from the US president talking about Israel's Warriors over the top kind of reaction are we getting from Israeli officials to that there hasn't been any Israeli reaction to the president's remarks but we've also heard from the state department saying that an operation inside of Rafa would be disastrous we've also heard from the National Security spokesperson John Kirby who said that the Americans would not support this military operation where there are around a million and a half Palestinians seeking Refuge inside of Rafa but again the Israelis have said time and time again that they were going to enter Rafa the Israeli Army spokesperson had said months ago that wherever the Israeli Army identifies a Target they are going to strike and he singled out Rafa he said that they were going to go there not if but just a matter of when so the Israelis have also said that whatever it takes to accomplish these military objectives these military goals they are going to do and it seems that the pressure that has been put on the United States until now all of the words that the Americans have conveyed have fallen on deaf ears for on the part of the Israelis so the Israelis have delayed this operation reports in Israeli media are indicating that it will be smaller perhaps more targeted and precise type of military moves but it was it's difficult to conceptualize this when you have more than a million people who are in Rafa who have been forced to evacuate at the words of the Israeli military so again no reaction to the words from President Biden but the military is now drawing up these plans for how they are apparently going to get the civilian population out of RA all right there let's go over to T he joins us from actually from Rafa right now and a lot of the talk as you've been hearing far is about Israeli plans for an invasion and an evacuation are you seeing any sign of that on the ground there well till now Sammy we do not really touch or see any kind of practical developments regarding any possible ground incursion to Rafa District but what we have been hearing the from the Israeli military officials and political leaders including the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about a possible military act to be carried out on the ground here in Rafa as they have ordered uh the Israeli Army to prepare a dual plan for number one evacuating people from Rafa and then to eliminate the remaining military brigades that belong to the military wing of Hamas but that's what the Palestinians have been completely afraid of as Palestinians have completely right now mistrusting what Israel has been always saying because they find out that Israel is doing completely the opposite what they have been ordering people to do since the beginning of this conflict as the real challenge right now for all Gans about the next destination especially that they have been barely uh able to struggle to and were struggling to afford uh the basic necessities here including their makeshift tent where they would not be able to carry with them in their next destination they might be taken to while the original residents of Rafa do not know either where to go specifically that there might be the next Target for the Israeli Army but till this very moment there is no any further details about the plan or how Israel will force people to leave Rafa to start the military act on the ground and at the same time people think that Israel is using that as a kind of a to Russia tool in order to force Hamas to accept all the Israeli demands that are related to the framework of the ceasefire tokes that is right now continuing on Egypt uh uh that are also supervised by Qatar so people are afraid of that practical step as the majority of gaza's population right now have been cramped into that area and they completely depend on the humanitarian supplies being delivered by the United Nations which is by the way had threatened and warned about the possibility of suspending its operations in Gaz at the end of February if there is going to be no much uh fund raise going to be supported for the honora to keep operating Gaza so Palestinians right now Raa have facing completely chaotic options and choices but they do not have any other thing to do just simply because they have lost their houses they are become fully drained frustrated and now they might be the next Target which means that there's going to be much scale loss of life and a high rate of casualties among civilians if that practically happened on the ground all right we'll leave it there thanks so much T AB Al jazer senior political analyst Marwan bashara joins us now live here in the studio what do you make of this announcement that the prime minister of Israel asking the military to prepare a plan for an invasion and an evacuation is this an attempt to show the International Community particularly the US that hey we are taking preparations before we actually invade Rafa yes and we are invading Rafa contrary to what you the International Community or the Biden Administration has been asking us not to do we will do we will invade and we will take over Rafa as we play as we planned this another snub to the US this is an absolute snob to the US this is just the latest of many snobs already the re the most recent of which was snobbing secretary blinkin who did everything possible for the Nano government including bringing the Arabs once again to the table including extracting concessions from the Arab Partners including extracting normalization security guarantees revital izing the Palestinian Authority and yet Netanyahu would not stop he is persistent he wants to continue this is in as far as I can see and the United States can see the war is over but Netanyahu insists on playing in the overtime if you will in order to think that or in order to to win as he thinks and how would he win to my mind this is a very very dangerous phase now of of the war I mean we've passed through many dangerous phases of course the death of tens of thousands but this might actually lead to a Mass Slaughter of people in the southern P part of Gaza and a possible potential expulsion of many many Palestinians into the Sinai plus and this is uh very important underline analytically speaking okay I think Netanyahu once to invade Rafa and he wants to get to the point where he can make sure all the captives are dead he wants the captives dead I don't think he can afford the captives to be alive because as long as the captives are alive he is being held hostage by a part of the Israeli public of the United States by Hamas so that he feels that his plans for Gaza his plans for Palestine are held captive by the captives the best way to do it is to continue under the pretext of destroying Hamas to basically destroy whatever is left of Hamas but in the process if the captives die I think Netanyahu will be liberated from that burden that he's been on him for the past four months this will allow him a free hand to do whatever he wants to do in Gaza moving forward uh let's come back to the point of him asking the mil to prepare a plan for evacuation evacuation to where is it clear I mean there doesn't seem to be much infrastructure for yet another relocation of over a million Palestinians within Gaza right absolutely not any indication from neighboring countries they want to take over a million Palestinians look if we've heard anything certain from the Egyptians over the past four months is that while they're look the other way a Slaughter and genocide is unraveling in plain sight in Gaza the only thing they've been warning against is not the death it's not the slaughter it's not the war crimes what they've been warning about is the ethnic cleansing and the expulsion of Palestinians into the Sinai to the Egyptian territory so CC in as far as we know the Egyptian not the Mexican president insists that there should be no expulsion of the Palestinians uh to to Egypt but that doesn't mean that Netanyahu is not pushing the Palestinians to such desperation that they will walk barefooted to the fence and try to break in to the Sinai looking for safety because there is absolutely at this point in time nowhere safe in Gaza and on the point that you were analyzing of the the captives and what that means for nany's policy what do you make of the line that we hear from Israeli officials that no they want to Liberate the captives through military action they don't want them dead tactically speaking right for the past four months they've been saying military objectives first defeating Hamas captive second right and then they Bridge it by saying the best way to free the captives is by military Victory now over the past four months this proved to be utterly wrong they couldn't free a single captive through military operations the only way they could have done it is through diplomatic process now the more they got in to kanun and other places apparently more than a few captiv have already been killed by the Israeli strikes right now if they move to more and more strongholds in kanun
