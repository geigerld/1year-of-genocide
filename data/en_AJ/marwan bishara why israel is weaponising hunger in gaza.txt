Al jazir a senior political analyst Marwan you're joining us from Paris what Beggar's belief here in all of this Maran is that eight agencies in the UN have been warning about precisely this not for days not for weeks but for months well absolutely and U it's not coincidental I mean they're not exactly uh you know inspired by divine intervention that we've been seeing a pattern here by the Israelis there's an intent to starve the people in Gaza I think it's a a cheap way for the Israelis to be killing and harming and make Palestinians suffering as much as possible on the cheap it's certainly cheaper than bombing them for example is just to make them starve through this besieging of all Crossings and making sure that F does not get to people so this has been a state Terror on the part of Israel it's trying to for the time being tactically speaking put as much pressure on Hamas as possible in order to extract as much concessions as possible by making the people in Gaza suffer as much as possible you've chronicled for us Marwan not just this Gaza War but the previous ones as well and I wonder since you're usually the one you know who tells us to see the wood for the trees see the forest for the trees um and to and to watch the deed rather than public statements coming out of Israel did you 5 months ago see something like this coming well in fact uh on the 12th if I remember correctly of October I wrote Under the title um manufacturing the case for genocide it was clear five days after uh the attack of October 7 that Israel the United States and some European leaders were uh Paving the ground for a side uh by for example among others comparing Hamas to Isis and comparing um October 7 to 911 and so on so forth making it clear that the response is going to be indiscriminate it's going to be total it's going to be a total war and it's going to involve the population of Gaza and as soon as the Israeli president and then every other official in Israel said there are no Innocents in Gaza it was clear there was an intent to make people in a suffer and perhaps get rid of them if possible now if you listen finally you know to the European officials where I am J Bell the EU foreign policy Chief declared today today that Gaza is not on the brink of famine it is in a state of famine so the Europeans are coming to their senses and they're seeing what we saw five months ago that they've been implicit in fact in a genocide what was the Israeli foreign Minister's response to the EU Chief claimed that Israel is weaponizing hunger and famine is already State of Affair in Gaza he said and listen to this it's food for thought the Israeli foreign minister cat said onwa onor is conspiring to drop food deliveries in Gaza that Israel is doing everything possible to get food and and humanitarian Aid to Gaza but onor one is disrupting food to Gaza I mean deception lying and such with such vulgarity by the Israelis where they are denying the Palestinians food while they are in fact starving food has reached a new level of such absurdity we don't know whether to you know hurt for the Palestinian will just laugh at the Israelis but these Israeli claims that this is all Uno's fault I think it's fair to say they're not working nobody is buying this I'm yet to hear of anybody any expert any guest have spoken to anyone for the last five months at least outside of Israel who um doesn't blame Israel for this so we've already seen 23 Palestinians die of malnutrition and dehydration more will continue to die as is likely and as was um starkly laid out in the report Israel will get blamed for this so the question is do they care you'd be surprised by the way because Israel of course claims that Ono is conspiring with Hamas right because out of the 13,000 staff that work for onad they apparently shaken a handful of staff to say that they apparently reportedly by the Israelis with no with no independent verification that six out of 13,000 apparently cooperate with habas or something so the Israelis have been deceiving the public for five months and look I mean despite the German Chancellor yesterday and the EU President vanderlin also yesterday and today Joseph Bell and the Americans themselves President Biden talking about the humanitarian but no one S no one is doing anything about it only words there are no Deeds they are talking the talk but they're certainly not walking their talk they're not using leverage against Israel or in Israel they're not putting enough pressure to make sure that Israel does deliver the food the fact that they started dropping food from the air and bringing it by sea because they simply could not force Israel's hands to allow food in enough to feed the people in Gaza because a long way to show you how bankrupt Israel's Ally in the west have been five months into an unraveling genocide in plain side on TV screen in Paris London Washington and Berlin Mar bishar aljazira senior political analyst thank you very much
