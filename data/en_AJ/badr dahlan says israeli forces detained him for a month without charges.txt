man schuman is a humanitarian worker and activist was in gaza until march and joins us now here in doha good to see you again the israel military have targeted the north since the start of the war on gaza in october but why these two particular areas  i think that's that's a question for them to answer i know that they are very heavily civilian areas they contain a lot of refugees who s refuge in gas in 1967 and 1948 i mean it's a tragedy and continuing and right now we don't see  a stop for it um unfortunately these areas don't only lack security but also lack food right now many of them especially in the far further north in gazp there is a fam people there only have access to wet and are able to make bread lack of security lack of food i don't know happ next over month wa give little bit more's on because is developing situation isra has detain [Music] What are the conditions you lived in there? This prison is a nightmare. What happened to you? They took me out and tortured you. Excuse me, oh, what did they do to you? They said they beat me in prison. They said, “Hold your head down on the bus and don’t get on the bus because someone told you. I mean, they hit me on my back and my back. They hit me with a protector. I went out and was afraid to go. I found someone. I came to someone. I wanted to catch someone to take me out. Someone came out. I caught someone. Two people. Who did I see in their origins? Behind you are the names of families.  The families I saw were the ones who were in prison. What were you drinking? Are you drinking cheese with bread and [music] apples, tomatoes and cucumbers in the iron? No electricity. You know where your family was beaten. I know where to demolish. gas t is prevalent with israeli military in undisclosed military locations i  mean how worrying is it to see images like that right now it's very worrying very heartbreaking but not surprising i think that they are masters of psychological torture inaz also 200 of and we can't forget abouts that they are now administra c in gaz  we can't forget about the 7000 13000 now plus prisoners that are in israelis right now the world need to do something i'm calling on cross cr plus prisoners that have been taken by this administration and let the people of the world know what  is the situation we don't want to see more we want to see our people come back to their hes than much us cr can do
