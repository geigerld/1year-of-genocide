to Lind Zulu who's South Africa's minister of Social Development and an MP with the African National Congress she's joining us from Johannesburg we thank you for your time with us on Al jazer why did South Africa take this step now I'm thank you very much for the opportunity and we wish to uh call on all the people of the world to follow us as we've taken this step and this step is informed by what has seen on ground and what has been happening in Gaza in particular particularly the killing of women and children and civilians I want to State up front that the governing party of the African National Congress has always stood by with the Palestinian people in their call uh for a two-state solution but more importantly we want to see an end of the conflict through peaceful means as far as possible and the international platform is the platform that is available to the governing party of the African National Congress is the government of South Africa this is the available platform that we decided we need to step on to because we are looking for being assisted and also an end to this conflict in the best way that is possible but however seeing what has been happening the numbers that of people that are being killed the escalation of the people that are being killed the numbers are venders and we believe that this is the right time for us both as the African National Congress and our government to step up to the next level in finding a solution what is South Africa's reaction to Israel saying that the South African accusations were baseless and a blood liable it's very unfortunate that this point because what people can see in their on their TVs in their homes and everywhere they are it's speaks for itself South Africa has always been and in particular the governing party the African National Congress has been in solidarity with the people of Palestine not only have we been in solidarity but we have actively engaged both in terms of the Palestinian people as well as Israel by the way because as you all know we do have an embassy here and we in South Africa and Israel Embassy in South Africa but we also have one in ramala and our position has always been lesson learned from our own situation of upper gate and conflict and marginalization of our people and the killing of our people for a very long time but we think those lessons are lessons that can also be exercised and be used as was also declared a crime against humanity interal Community Minister Lind Zulu look obviously the ball is now in the court of the icj and if indeed it rules that Israel is guilty of genocide what practical impact do you expect it to have we expect this to have a practical impact to the global Community because we believe that we not standing alone as Africa on this we think that once that happens the whole world will act even faster in terms of finding a solution in helping end the conflict using the international platform but we call on the International Community to stand up with us as South Africa in our quest to finding peace in in this conf but we do know that icj rulings they are while they're binding under the UN Charter it has no means of enforcement so could this be anything more than symbolic I mean rulings are sometimes ignored as we saw happen in March 2022 when the court ordered Russia to Halt its military campaign in Ukraine and and that didn't happen we wish the world to move more towards finding solution than just symbolism because right here we are talking about the deaths the destruction the complete destruction of the entire area all the people who are being affected they are told move to this area and then they move to this area and they find that the bombardment and the killing continues relentless on them so for us this is not symbolic it is one way of mobilizing solidarity in particular with the people of Palestine but it is also mobilizing the International Community to act and act faster so that we can end the killing of women children and civilians in particular let's just look at some of the detail now in the motion that you filed South Africa is asking the Court to declare quote on an urgent basis that Israel is in breach of its obligations in terms of the genocide convention should immediately seize all acts and measures in breach of those obligations and take a number of related actions let's stop at related actions for a moment what are those exactly those would we have to be dealt with particularly because as I will clarify that we are the governing party the African National Congress but it is the Department of international relationss in particular together with the Department of Justice in South Africa that will then have to look at all the technicalities and follow the rules and all the technicalities to take the matter forward okay we'll leave it there Minister lindula we thank you so much for joining us on aler
