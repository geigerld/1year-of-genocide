about this and other developments in Israel's war on Gaza he's a professor of public policy at hammad Khalifa University here in Qatar thank you Sultan for joining us again we hear again condemnation from the US Administration outraged they expressed over the killing of this activist in the occupied West Bank but that doesn't seem to be stopping the Israelis or even U you know seeing them reduce this the intensity of their attacks in Gaza another attack today on a school in theat refugee camp what does that suggest you about the the intentions of the Israeli government here well the intentions have always been clear from the very beginning it's killing and displacement if they're unable to kill the Palestinians then they'd like to see them out of uh Palestine but uh what the issue here really is the United States should worry about its own interest and its own interest now is becoming under threat in the sense that they are becoming really exposed in their collusion with the Israelis in these war crimes the IC the icj are not sleep they're taking time they're considering the cases South Africa has just come out again insisting that they will pursue the case until a verdict is made and it is very clear that any nation is seen to support this kind of uh uh atrocities is liable now people on the ground in Gaza should really focus on Gathering the evidence that these missiles these Rockets are us made and and this will probably be one of the areas where the US policy makers will suddenly take a a pause and rethink it's not just about protecting Israel politically they have to start thinking about protecting themselves now as we move into this 11th month it's almost a year now of uh incredible infringement of international humanitarian law yeah in this latest attack on uh that un School in the nerat refugee camp the Israelis claimed they were targeting a Hamas command uh Center in in the camp at that school which has been you know the claim they always use when targeting these areas that are populated by civilians which doesn't excuse whether or not they're targeting Hamas control center the fact remains that civilians are in these areas and that's a civilians in these areas it's a school building it's a designated building they would have had their GPS the GPS even before the war of all those schools are known to them it's an honor property there are many many layers of legal protection that cover that site and it is a site that was declared by them as a safe area for the Palestinians to seek shelter so there is no excuse really and particularly when when they use the aircrafts you know the f-16s the sort of thing that the Americans are supplying the Ukrainian with there there there's a major hypocrisy on in in both fronts that uh uh the American seems to uh pursue those conflicts without really understanding the implication that has on their own uh standing in in the future with the the Ukraine I don't know if you watched uh well you presented the news few minutes earlier the secular state in the same on the same Podium he talks about having just offered Ukraine hundred billion doar and then he complains about Iran giving Russia missiles and if you reverse story it's the same thing with Gaza and and Israel on the one hand they are supplying the Israelis with with the with the machine to kill the Palestinians and then he comes out and cry for the Palestinian victims it's in their hand to take a moral stand on Palestine on Ukraine and everywhere else it seems like at the moment they're going through this vacuum uh and misdirection and and so where do we stand now Sultan as far as the ceasefire talks are concerned on Gaza uh this plan that was announced by Biden no one seems be talking about it much anymore is there pressure on either side right now to to try and get this back on track well the plan is uh sort of become really out of date it was announced end of May Biden then took it to the security Council and made it literally into international law mid of June Palestinians accepted it the Israelis refused it now the Israelis have created further facts on the ground including this Corridor in the middle of pal of Gaza not the Philadelphia Cor Philadelphia Corridor is an excuse for them to stay in Gaza but the corridor that war worries observers is the one they created that split Gaza into two okay and this Corridor just north of the Turkish Hospital goes all the way from east of Gaza to the to the Sea 4 km wide uh Israel will never leave that part they have now split the Gaza into two they will not allow Palestinians to return North without being screened by them and they use the excuse of um security but it's really to make the Palestinian life even more difficult and as soon as there is a ceasefire and there are possibilities for the Palestinians to make a choice I suspect a lot of people if they have the right if they have the ability they will seek to move somewhere else because the area now is totally in inhabitable Sultan always good to get you thoughts and insight on this thank you very much for joining us on our ja Sultan Barakat from hammad
