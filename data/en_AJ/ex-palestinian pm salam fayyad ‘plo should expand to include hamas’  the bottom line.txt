hi I'm Steve Clemens and I have a question if the Palestinian Authority has largely been a spectator during the Israeli War on Gaza what will its future be after the war let's get to the bottom line US President Joe Biden wants to see a revitalized Palestinian Authority to take charge in Gaza once the war is over the only catch is that Israel has killed and injured tens of thousands of Palestinians there in the past few weeks and basically flattened the entire Gaza Strip making normal civilian life impossible the other catch is that the Palestinian Authority which co-manages civilian life with the Israeli military in the West Bank is just not popular there either and wait there may be two more problems one no one's asking the Palestinians what they want and two the Israeli government has already said it doesn't like Joe Biden's ideas so where does that leave America's plans and is the Palestinian Authority stop stuck in a catch22 situation where its efforts are undermined before they even begin today we're talking with the former prime minister and Finance Minister of the Palestinian Authority Salam fiad who is now a visiting scholar at Princeton University Salam thank you so much for joining us and obviously this is a grim subject it's tough to discuss while a war is underway to be talking about what happens the day after but you initiated that discussion with an important article in foreign affairs where you said that there are things that need to be done the and and and you look at the Palestinian Authority and the PLO can you share with our audience what you think the building blocks are of a sensible future on the Palestinian side well thank you much for having you on your program uh I decided to actually go out with this article against the backdrop of beginning to hear some background conversations and and noise about So-Cal the after when when the war was really in full swing uh exactic very high toall in terms of the unprecedented indeed loss of human life destruction and all but what struck me the most was uh some thinking that the day after was going to be characterized by a system in which Hamas had no existence which was consistent I guess with the objective that the government of Israel set out for itself when it actually launched this this war uh after uh October 7 uh to me uh actually that was a nonstarter and and because everybody knew at the time and Israel was called on it that that goal was impossible to attain Hamas is an ideology is a political movement with an ideology and ideas and you cannot destroy a political movement subsequent to that some other goals were mentioned little bit of the scaling back of that nevertheless what still what we still have to this day ranges from the impossible to the highly unattainable so to me that conversation really actually meant that tens of thousands superan lives would perish before we got to that day if ever and that was not really going to happen for for certain and and so I decided against backdrop of that to really uh put forward a vision you know just like my own ideas about what what what could and should happen Gaza after all is integral part of the territories that are occupied in 1967 originally covered by the perview of the person Authority now uh consistent with that motive that I have just like underlined it was I I decided to really start that conversation by pointing to what should not be considered first I said no Arrangement that contemplates subjugating the Palestinians imposing an arrangement of them after subjugating them should be considered that should be really out of consideration altogether and by that I was referring to background noise about some transitional arrangement in Gaza involving some people from there dealing with the International Community and all again assuming that Hamas is is outside of the scene completely what I had in mind at the time was the thinking that the PA would not want to really be seen as coming into Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank as is often said but even if it were willing to do it uh I I said it is not in a position to do it and by that I really meant the political weakness the PA was in and that really actually as a segue into a conversation as to what needed to happen in order to provide the political enablement to the P authority to be able to assume that massive responsibility that's the background and that's how I really got into this and and to really get into it basically I said what needs to happen is first of all to really deal with the key reason as to why it is is that the palestin authority found itself after three decades of Peace processing in such a terrible shape politically speaking so weak so Fe with not much standing with the public with Palestinian public whether in the territories over which it should have perview or even amongst Palestinians throughout the work as fact and that key reason was the failure of the bet that the pl took back in 1993 on the oso peace process delivering on promise of statud for the Palestinians it has been many years now since most everybody came to has come to the conclusion that that promise was never going to really be fulfilled definitely not on the path where we Palestinians had found ourselves in the aftermath and in in the course of that process so that was the key contributor to that weakness and much the same as has contributed to the standing of the PLO itself what happened concomittant with that was the PLO has lost much of its representational capacity that's really the the the problem as I saw it and I have seen it for many many years with the fail of oo the pr no longer really represented the consensus view amongst Palestinians in the way it did over the fiveyear period between 1988 and 1993 that consensus that you know virtually complete National consensus fractured for sure upon the signing of the o with the passage of time and the failure of also to deliver on the promise of personal stat you know the P basically lost more and more of that representation capacity what needed to happen was to expand the PLO in order to include in its strengths all Palestinian factions including those that beg to differ with Os from the very beginning especially Hamas Islamic jaab and all other political forces and by the way ham and Islamic Jad were were not the only naysayers when it came to Oso there are some factions within the PLO itself that actually back to Del you know back to differ from beginning nevertheless over time you know the base of descent away from oo expanded progressively so what we're looking at today is a shell of what the PLO used to be I'm not really saying this with joy actually I'm really saying of realization that we have to do everything we possibly can to preserve the hard one gain of having a home for us all Palestinians which at one point actually meant something to say the so legitimate representative ofan people but how much of that really continues to stand to this day there are some who react I said by saying you know how can you even be saying all all of these things I said I say it because I care if it if this is to be what it says it is this all legi representative pan people it has to be expanded to include all points of view it has to be that tent that National tent that home for everybody including Hamas and Jihad that that was the basic idea that I had in mind which would actually in my view Palestinian Authority because the Palestinian Authority is essentially an extension of the P so it's a remarkable provocation because what you're arguing is the Palestinian Authority as is now is broken and there's no hope of Reviving this broken uh Authority in current form and so to re-anchor legitimacy bringing all of the parties back into the PLO including the one that Israel is at war with uh including the one uh where much of the West says can never be in the government you're arguing that in that Patchwork of perspectives Hamas has to be in there am I getting that right you're getting it absolutely right and that's been my view for many years now it's obvious the P law has lost much of its representational power I mean look at basically PS what people say about what it is that they expect and how they really feel about that so-called peace process vast majority of Palestinians you know for long have you know left that station and so our representational body home if you will for it to actually represent us all all all points of view and all of that sort of thing definitely has to be expanded to reflect all those points of views and and naturally continue to be what it was uh when when in fact it entered into oo agreements back in 1993 it's obvious I mean that is something that really needs to happen now why is that a source of enablement and let me be very clear what I really had in mind when I said the VA as it exists today is unable to assume that responsibility even if it were willing to do it I had in mind the political weakness the legitimacy the acceptability if you will I did not have in mind you know technical capacity administrative capacity which might be actually ganed from statements made by American officials us officials and others Now using terms like um revitalized PA surely there is a lot of revitalization that's that's required anyone would tell you that this in part the weak standing of the pl reflects case of chronic misrule so there's no question that that has to be fixed the the Palestinian Authority's capacity to govern must be enhanced and strengthened and it must govern in you know in full Accord with the precepts of good governance that's obvious but that's not what I had in mind the priority now is for political must be and the focus must be squarely on political enablement because how else is a Palestinian Authority government which in my construction needs to be consented to by the expanded PL which includes all factions and political forces is how in God's name is that government going to show up the quote unquote in the day after which of course when it comes it will not have come a day too soon for the tens of thousands of people who have been killed or or injured or or the very vast majority who have been displaced uh not to mention the the massive destruction that Israel has reigned on Gaza Strip since October 7 so how in God's name is a government like that going to show up the after begin to assume that responsibility unless it is a product of a national consensus that's thats to be absolutely essential because minus that it just simply would not have the legitimacy I want to ask you about Jake Sullivan the president's National Security advisor President Biden's National Security adviser you know meeting uh uh with mmud abas trying to indicate that that the United States is hoping the Palestinian Authority can clean up its act can deal with corruption can bring in young leaders what I'm hearing from you is that is a false Choice am I am I hearing that right that's not really the focus of my proposal the focus of my proposal is political empowerment and enablement right imparting legitimacy uh and and you know making the PLO what it is what it should be what it was and it needs to be again you know our so legitimate representative you know that's absolutely important and that is really what would Prov the legitimacy that's needed and the political enablement that's required I'm not really saying the PA needs to fix it I just have really actually mentioned that but is that the reason why we really should be doing what we're doing and is it really the case that it's just now that it has become that the PA has not really offered the best governance model in the world that's really not that's not what the force of conversation ought to be the focus of conversation ought to be on answering the question of what it is it might take the Palestinian Authority which would be a logical Choice the most logical choice to assume responsibility for managing the Affairs of Palestinian people in Gaza stri exactly as it is responsible managing the Affairs of Palestinian people in the West Bank is it not incumbent on us Palestinians to say here we are we ready to really actually assume that responsibility through a reconfigured and and re empowered and politically enabled you know Palestinian Authority to assume that responsibility then this whole conversation about who's going to do be doing what and the day after would with vanish and Israel would no longer continue to hide behind you know such such statement as we we don't want to really turn this into this that or the other thing that it will add to the instruments of pressure on the government of Israel to stop this war of aggression that by the way has to be our overriding priority right now all of these other conversations can wait you know revitalization re invigoration all of that kind of stuff can wait what is required now is political empowerment and enablement of personal authority to assume that responsibility today before tomorrow and by the way that is imminently doable doable and with with with great speed the pl has convened several meetings I mean as of of secretary generals of various factions the most recent of which took place in Al in July of this year and what happened then what happened then was actually a statement read out by president abas that basically said the conferees had agreed to form a follow-up committee to follow up on that which they agreed to follow up on before we don't need that what we really need is for such Mee to take place even if virtually for them to say no conditions on anybody this is open for anyone regardless of their political orientation or political ideology or program Hamas and Jad are welcome to join immediately no one has conditions on anyone it's open for everybody what I'm really talking about is a forum that is actually the home of a multivision platform right where you know different Visions can coexist at the same time but that's what pluralism is about Mr Salam let me ask you a question about the the composite of the PLO now Hussein Shake as I understand the Secretary General of the PLO is reticent about Hamas coming uh into that has commented uh to Jake Sullivan that their violent tactics disqualify them so I'm interested in the tectonics of how this might come about do you think the PLO will accept what you saying it needs to do to reorient the legitimacy of the Palestinian people you know the pr definitely has a choice to make uh if if the pr chooses to continue to basically say unless to the factions including Hamas unless you you agree with our platform you cannot join well then it's going to really have to wait a very long period of time because before these factions would decide to join we asked the question and that's what really people are wondering about is that really a logical expectation is it a logical expectation for membership in the PLO for various parties and factions Palestinian on the Palestinian side to agree to all that the P had signed in you know to back 1993 when three decades later everybody knows that that process was not going to really take us anywhere it's not any longer it cannot it's impossible so the you know whereas there may have been some logic to that back in the 90s you know unless you subscribe to this Vision that really brought us here that produced the PA where is that logic of continuing to expect that to be a demand or expectations of the Palestinians when in fact the conceptual equ equivalent of that was never expected of any government in Israel how logical is it for the PLO to continue to insist on that expectation of Hamas Jad and others maybe even the pflp how logical is it for for to continue to insist on that as a a ticket for membership when in Israel there is a government and it's not really only smotrich and bf and all of that Natan himself for many many many years yesterday he was bragging about being the guy who really actually destroyed Oso the Nan himself repeatedly for anyone who wanted to listen repeatedly said there's not going to be any sovereignty in the territory on the Territory between River Jordan and Mediterranean but for Israel he many times said that where is the palan state in this so when that expectation is placed on Hamas and others who would want to join but for the platform of the PLO you know this would make it totally illogical if not really out irr responsible so the PO has a choice to make here and it's obvious which way it should go that position is much better presented to the World by a United Palestinian politic it's not good enough for that to be presented by the PLO because P right now doesn't present it this way right and it's not good for Hamas alone to present it this way or Jihad or you know those who oppos it is best for us United to present the world with this Vision I am absolutely the world would deal with us that's that's that's my point what I'm hearing from you Salam is is fascinating because you're not asking permission from Israel or the US you're saying this is what Palestinians and the PLO can do to restore the legitimacy of a movement across the public and if Israel wants to play great if Israel doesn't want to play you're going to continue to proceed so I am interested in a couple of things one is how do you think Israel will respond to a PLO with a restored legitimacy what do you think the United States which you identify as one of the most powerful actors in this should be doing with regard to a restored PLO that basically expels the Palestinian Authority uses it if it can discards it if it's irrelevant see it's been always my approach to think about what it is that is in our best interest as Palestinians to begin the iation by what suits Israel is definitely the wrong foot to enter this room or what the world would find acceptable not acceptable we we know that that's really not the right way to go there is no national movement that really seeks Liberation as ours you know has been and continues to do to do that really actually starts conversation on the basis of of what it it its enemy desires to see that just really is the wrong point of entry so to me there is no other solution to the current impa to the current challenge that we Face the fracture in our body politic we need we need to repair that as soon as possible and and that actually the stoppage of the war I see is actually contingent on our capacity to accomplish that objective the sooner we put ourselves in a position to go to the and say here we are united in this position it is my beted and this is not really something that I constructed in the abstract based on many many conversations I've had over the years now with many who would not really want to hear the word ham jiad resistance or any of that who actually in recent years have been telling me you've been telling us these stories for a long period of time are we getting in your way meaning it really is up to us and honestly I believe if we are united look I mean Israel was not very fond let's just remember remember Israel itself was not very fond of dealing with the PLO and anybody who knows anything about our history knows that Israel did everything humanly possible to avoid dealing with the PLO and and try to look for all kinds of formulas up until it really decided there is no other way but to really actually try to reach accommodation with the PLO and that's what it decided to really do this when when they decided to really enter into this transaction arrangement with the PLO they decided because they really felt that they they had no choice what we really need to do is to answer the simple question how is it that we can go about uniting our politic in a way that makes it possible to go the world and say this is who we are this is what we really want to accomplish and this is how we really want to go about it my bet is that the world would deal with the United Palestinian politic if we continue to project ourselves as you know a component here another there uh I am I'm I'm afraid that Israel as well as others will be explo in the differences and medling in our own Internal Affairs when our own Internal Affairs are really our own business there is no other way there is no logic to continue to exclude you know these other factions including Hamas and Jad and there is no logic for Hamas or Jihad to continue to not really actually forcefully seek to join the pl tomorrow on no conditions no one has any conditions on anyone and you know this has even I have not really said the thing except in passing about all we have to do is just look at where Israel is you know it is been my view that the center of gravity of Israeli body politic was never accepting of the idea of a fully Sovereign Palestinian State on the territory Israel occupied in 1967 especially in new well we'll have to leave it there fascinating conversation former Palestinian prime minister Salam fiad thank you so much for joining us today thank you Steve very much for having me appreciate it so what's the bottom line listen more than 90 Palestinian journalists the only journalists on the ground in Gaza for the most part have been killed by Israeli forces in the past 73 days that means more than one journalist killed on average per day one of the latest of these is Al jazer cameraman SAR Abu Daka who along with Gaza Chief correspondent W ddu was fired on by an Israeli drone at an elementary school that had already been destroyed earlier in the day they were trying to bring us the story of what's Happening Sumer bled for hours and Medics who tried to reach him were not allowed to get close yel was injured but survived if you'll remember most of his family was killed by Israeli forces earlier in the war if media who wear bright signs indicating they are media are targeted all are clearly targeted and this is what the world is watching right now thankfully the world has Fearless people who are literally risking it all to tell us what's happening and that's the bottom
