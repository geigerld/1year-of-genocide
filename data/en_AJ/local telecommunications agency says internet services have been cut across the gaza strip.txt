it is 6 GMT that's 8:00 a.m. in Gaza and another night of heavy Israeli bombardment across the strip Palestinians are cut off from the outside world not just physically but Israel's blockade but now digitally too the local telecommunications agency says internet and phone services are down across Gaza the latest round of air strikes has been targeting densely populated areas and refugee camps and scenes of chaos have been coming in from Al Shi hospital as the injured and dead are brought there the spokesperson for gaza's health Ministry says Israel is purposefully targeting civilians Alerus hany mahmu joins us now from khun in southern Gaza and hany we've seen images of intense Israeli bombardment in Northern Gaza around Gaza City overnight do we now now that it is daylight have a sense of the impact on the ground and what the targets were yes we always is started as of early hours of yesterday's evening at about 6:37 uh we the entire Gaza Strip was uh digitally taken off the grid uh leaving 2.3 million people without any contact with uh with each other or with what's going on uh sending waves of fears and concerned that there's something uh atrocious going on similar to the blackout on the 27th of October and the second one the early days of November but as of last night uh uh we were able uh due to uh cut of communication and phone service but we were able to watch some of the images and videos on Al jazer Arabic channel uh just for about half an hour and it it what what seemed to be an intense uh a campaign of air strikes creating a massive fire builts around different neighborhoods and residential blocks in the Gaza St starting from a Sara intersection and going all the way west to a shifa hospital and both NE both residential blocks on on both sides of the remal neighborhoods the northern remal neighborhood and the southern remal neighborhood all the way to Gaza uh Port clearing much of the uh many of the high-rise buildings in that area causing severe infrastructure uh damage now the Israeli military as of this morning on the radio it claimed that it carried out these overnight intense uh air strikes targeting uh Hamas headquarters and offices in Gaza but what seemed to be is more destruction and damage of residential homes and and infrastructure it's important to uh note to our viewers that Gaza has still thousand of people who could not leave they are still there and around the vicinity of a Shiva hospital and um hany do also remind us um why there are still large numbers in Gaza City uh and why they have been unable to evacuate despite these apparent Promises of a safe route by the Israeli military why haven't people been able to escape well this entire enclav the Gaza Strip is not safe anywhere in Gaza is a legitimate Target for Israeli air strike so for example take people the some 700,000 people who uh moved from the northern part and Gaza City the central part and the southern part of Gaza namely city of Rafa and KH unist uh found themselves the targets of Israeli air multiple Israeli air strike killing large number of them that's number one this is a confirmation that there's no Corner in the Gaza Strip is safe second of all all these Israeli claims that there is a safe Corridor for Palestinians to evacuate from the northern Gaza our basist and have no uh evidence they're not evidence-based at all and we seen throughout the past few days examples of how people who took the coastal Road uh uh trying to escape to the central and the southern part of Gaza were on the ground of the road killed with their cars Barren along with couple ambulance and the UN cars as well was targeted by gun boats and air strikes now people have this fear massive fear that if they listen uh to the Israeli calls and leave they would be also a target of these air strikes so again uh it just a matter of is it is it guaranteed safety or not honey mmud live for us and carun in southern Gaza thank you for the update
