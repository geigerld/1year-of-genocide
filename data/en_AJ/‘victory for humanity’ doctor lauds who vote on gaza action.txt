now the World Health Organization has adopted a resolution urging immediate humanitarian aid for Gaza it's warned the health system in the Gaza Strip is collapsing and it cannot afford to lose one more ambulance or hospital bed the who executive board held an emergency session earlier on Sunday to discuss the growing Health crisis in the Palestinian territories now the work of the heal workers is impossible and they're directly in the firing line since the 7th of October wh has verified more than 449 attacks on healthare in Gaza and the West Bank and 60 attacks in on healthare in Israel nowhere and no one is safe in Gaza as more and more people move to a smaller and smaller area overcrowding combined with the l of adequate Food Water Shelter and sanitation are creating the ideal conditions for disase to spread well Paul Brennan joins us live now uh from Geneva so Paul what else did the director General say there yeah the the meeting's just wrapped up we've got a unanimous consensus agreement on the resolution that's been passed uh they stripped out specific specific reference to Israel and put the emphasis on all parties uh to ensure the immediate sustained and unfettered access for medical and humanitarian actors and uh humanitarian uh activists and uh medical staff U but the emphasis was was very clear that it is Israel that's doing the bombardment um and joining me at the moment in fact is just coming back from that just come out of the meeting is Dr Ahmed Al mansari who is the regional director of the uh World Health Organization for the Eastern Mediterranean which covers Gaza uh Dr Alan sari talk talk to me about the significance of first all this Gathering and also the resolution this is only the seventh time in the 75 years of the World Health Organization that we've had a special uh meeting such as this of the executive board exactly yeah thank you Paul for giving me the opportunity as you said this is the seventh meeting uh of the executive board in the history of wh uh it is a very important Gathering and uh we have started in the morning with a briefing from uh uh the emergency executive director Dr Mike Ryan uh shedding lights on the situation there in Gaza from Health perspectives and then it was followed up by input from different member states and with interventions and uh it concluded by endorsement of the resolution proposed resolution which is a very you know uh important moment for wh you know an organization that is focusing on the public health International public health so to me I feel that it is really a victory of the uh Humanity a victory to member states in Saving and promoting health and protecting the vulnerables and and saving lives also what Shan through as I was following the proceedings throughout the day was the pain and the anguish of healthcare workers here in Geneva listening to the testimony of their colleagues who are operating in Gaza and being unable in many ways to fulfill their duties because of the bombardment because of the conditions that they are under exactly our colleagues there on the ground are really facing a very huge difficult challenges they are putting themselves you know on fire by going there in the field despite these challenges we managed to go to some of the hospitals we managed to evacuate some of the patients including the 31 you know premature babies that were evacuated two weeks back uh despite that in fact we have lost as a un around 100 more than 110 un humanitarian staff uh including our dear colleag League Dima from wh who was killed last week you know during one of the attacks yes and and but as at the same time as hearing the Practical impacts of that your work is having I I have to pose the question when the Israeli delegation at this meeting said that frankly it would make no difference to them what you resolve here in Geneva what practical impact what practical Improvement can a resolution like this actually have on the ground I mean at least for us uh there is a support from from all EB member states I mean members of of the EB uh for us as a Who as a humanitarian agency to go there provide the full support and make sure that you know we participate in protecting lives saving lives promoting health and serving the vulnerables uh now when it comes into the implementation it was one of the major uh comments by member states that we should really be given the um the the the the floor and the power and the tools to go and Implement and serve those people so it it is I agree that it is maybe one of the challenges but I'm sure we will be able to overcome that challeng by the super commitment of the member states at the very least this adds to the international pressure on Israel to stop killing civilians exactly I mean that is one of the most common request of member state to have you know ceasefire uninterrupted continuous ceasefire with unembedded you know um shipments of humanitarian AIDS in general but particularly the medical supplies to to to the healthcare facilities uh serving those patients and inur people uh and uh to protect the healthare system and the workers in the health system either in hospitals health centers or those uh in in the field through mobile teams and ambulances drar thank you very much indeed mandari thank you very much indeed for for for joining us uh as I say this resolution was passed by consensus didn't go to a vote uh Israel were there in the room they weren't happy about it but it went through nonetheless back to you poor Brandon life for us there in Geneva thank you
