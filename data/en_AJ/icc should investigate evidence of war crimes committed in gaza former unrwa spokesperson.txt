Now new pictures from a school Sheltering displaced Palestinians in Northern Gaza show bodies piled up following an Israeli attack Witnesses say a number of people including women children even babies were killed execution Style by Israeli forces while they were Sheltering inside the school the Israeli soldiers came in and opened fired on them they took an old man the Israeli soldiers stormed the school took all the men then entered classrooms and opened fire on a woman and all the children with her even the newborn babies among them she her husband and her eight children together with her cousin the Israeli soldiers executed those innocent families at Point Blank the school buildings are totally destroyed we found dozens of dead bodies in the classrooms there is no sign of any missiles or shells all those who were in the buildings were executed from from point blank the Israeli soldiers opened fire on them many families came searching for their children they found them all killed they were all killed executed at gunpoint well Chris gunis is a former unrea spokesperson joins us now live from London your reaction first of all to these pictures which have emerged well it's very clear that there needs to be an investigation I run a thing called the Myanmar accountability project and we we are bringing criminal cases against members of the Myanmar J and what you begin with is an investigation you get Witnesses you compile the evidence and you make a complaint now I think that there are serious grounds for investigating by the ICC there is an investigation open I strongly recommend that Al jazer makes a victim submission on behalf of these victims and their families to the international criminal court it's very hard to draw any legal forensic conclusions until there's been a proper examination of the evidence but certainly this would be appear to be evidence of war crimes it's also potential evidence of genocide because under um article six of the Rome statute which governs the ICC deliberate killing is one of the crimes which Define genocide so I would suggest that this is sent to the international criminal court for investigation but my other reaction is this is the result of Israel being given a free reign to violate International humanitarian law as it sees fit the signals that were sent by our leaders in the UK by the Americans and by other of Israel's allies were incredibly weak it was very clear that Isabel that Israel was given uh green light to prosecute this war in any way it could The Narrative of Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas that was the predominating narrative and that is what in part has res resulted in what appears to be a serious War crime and as I say it must be investigated the fact that Hamas may have committed these crimes and it's clear that absolutely bestial things took place on the 7th of October they need to be investigated as well and those respons need to be held to account and if that means the international criminal court issuing an arrest warrant for Israeli leaders and for Hamas leaders obviously then so be it there must be account accountability for the victims of these what looked like appalling crimes we've seen this is not the first instance of civilians dying in civilian infrastructure right we've seen attacks all throughout this conflict on schools on refugee camps is there a bigger picture of really the undermining of the legal sanctuaries of of these places sanctity of these places indeed the sanctity and the neutrality of unra for example which has given all of its GPS coordinates to the Israelis refugees and displac people assumed that underneath the blue un flag there would be Safety and Security and that has to be guaranteed by Israel the occupying power that rule in the rule book has been torn up and thrown away um but there is also um a wider question um and that is that under the Rome statute again attacks on civilian infrastructure are outlawed and there is an international law the principle of Distinction you have to distinguish between combatant and non-combatant you cannot just walk in to a civilian installation and start shooting people on the grounds that there might be a Hamas operative there or it might be possible to kill one of the enemy that is not how international law works and not to abide by international law that is a crime it's a war crime crime if it's shown to be true and there has to be criminal accountability that's what the victims want and that's what they must have we've seen right from the beginning of this conflict Israeli officials M saying openly that they plan to cut off food water electricity and fuel when we look at the statements that were taken this was even before the sort of Carnage that we're seeing now we look before a year ago to some of the statements we were getting from Western leaders such as Ursula V Deion saying quote Russia's attacks against civilian infrastructure especially electricity are war crimes cutting off men women children of water electricity these are acts of pure Terror we have to call it as such do you feel do you feel disappointment towards Western leaders and we don't hear that same line towards humanitarian suffering that we're witnessing now well there's a clear double standard but I don't feel disappointed because it's been going on for so long Israel has constantly been given a get out of jail free card when it comes to Justice y AV Galant who just quoted the Israeli defense minister said early on in this conflict there will be a total blockade no fuel no food no water that shows intentionality that shows that there was an intention to commit a war crime and guess what on the streets of Gaza in Gaza itself we are seeing evidence of those war crimes the same is true of Mr Netanyahu he called for an amalec genocide invoking the biblical injunction to kill men women children babies let nobody be alive after this attack that's what the amalik injunction AMC injunction says in the Bible Mr Netanyahu actually accused himself he indicted himself by saying that in public the other I mean we have an Israeli Minister saying that a nuclear bomb should be dropped on Gaza I mean that at least did confirm that Israel at least it seemed to confirm that Israel actually has a nuclear bomb but again these are just examples of Israeli leaders indicting themselves you know the criminal the international criminal court needs to prove intense well all they need to do is Google some of this stuff that said that said proudly and on the record there are grounds in terms of the crimes being committed and in terms of the intentionality for arrest warrants to be issued just as they were against Putin all right thank you so much for your thoughts on that Chris GIS
