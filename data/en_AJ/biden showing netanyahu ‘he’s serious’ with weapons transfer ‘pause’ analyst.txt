while the events in Raa are unfolding a ceasefire negotiations brokered by Qatar and Egypt are being held in Cairo Israel's prime minister says the proposal Hamas has agreed to falls short of Israel's demands Israel will not allow Hamas to return to rule in Gaza we will not allow them to rebuild their military capabilities and continue their project of destroying us Israel will not approve any proposal that constitutes a threat to Israel's security and future for that reason I have ordered our delegation that went to Cairo to continue to insist on our demand to guarantee our security in parallel we will continue our war against Hamas our entry into Rafa is a very important step our army is on its way to destroy the remainder of their capabilities Hamas says that if Israel's military aggression continues in ra there will be no ceasefire deal the senior spokesperson for Hamas Usama hamdan says it's now up to Israel whether or not a deal goes through we would like to stress the fact that the ball now is in netanyahu's court and their behavior and attitude after we announced our agreement reflects determination by this criminal to foil all attempts of mediation including those of the United States and expresses his carelessness for the lives of the captives who are threatened every day through the bombardments of the Israeli milit we'll bring in our correspondent Muhammad Jam jum who's joining us now from the Jordanian capital and Muhammad let me first ask you about reporting uh that seems to suggest that the US has paused a weapon shipment to Israel what more can you tell us about this and the details of it so Daren we haven't gotten any official response from the Israeli government to these reports uh what we are seeing are statements uh by some officials anonymously sourced officials in Israeli media uh and the suggestions are that folks in Israel are concerned members of the security establ especially that um the halting of this weapon shipment is a tactic by the US to increase pressure on the US government to stop a an allout invasion of RA and also to try to move the Israeli government into accepting the terms of a ceasefire now there aren't a lot of details being reported about what was in that weapon shipment we are seeing numbers like uh perhaps around 1,800 2,000 lb bombs and around 1700 500 lb bombs those would have been included uh we're told in that shipment that was halted at least the reports are suggesting that now of course we should stress that this is a very small amount of weapons compared to the number of weapons that the US provides to Israel this is really just a drop in the ocean when you look at the type of Weaponry that the US continues to provide to Israel but it does seem even though nothing official from top Israeli officials uh it does seem that there is concern among the security and Military establishment based on some of the quotes we're seeing in Israeli media reports that this perhaps is a harbinger of things to come meaning that if Israel doesn't start adhering more to what the US wants perhaps the US will halt further uh shipments of weapons going forward and okay Mohammad when it comes to what's happening right now and we know that the ceasefire negotiations are still taking place in Cairo how much pressure is there internally on uh Netanyahu because we've seen the demonstrations in Tel Aviv not only take place but they seem to be growing as well yeah that's right and and you know the last two days there have been demonstrations in various cities in Israel mostly held by relatives of the Israeli captives still being held in Gaza when it was announced that Hamas uh was accepting the ceasefire proposal that had been presented to them you had we're told hundreds of demonstrators go out on the streets in Tel Aviv that evening and they were saying that they were going to stay out all night they were going to continue to come out to put pressure on the government to enter into a ceasefire agreement so that they could get their loved ones back uh yesterday there were reports that there were demos also in Tel Aviv this morning even there are reports and there are videos popping up online on social media channels uh showing a smaller group uh perhaps dozens of relatives of captives being held in Gaza but out there blocking one of the main streets ion Street in Northern Tel Aviv trying to send a message to the government that they are going to continue to mobilize now Darin we are now reporting out of Aman Jordan because we're no longer allowed to report in Israel our office space was shut down but I can tell you I was in Tel Aviv this past Saturday at one of the weekly demos that happens uh in on Saturday in Tel Aviv there were thousands of anti-government demonstrators relatives of captives um they were saying the time is now for Israel to go ahead and enter into a deal they were chanting there is a document in front of you sign on the dotted line they want to see this come to an end they say there is no more uh Paramount importance as far as any issue in Israel right now now as far as getting back those captives uh so there is mounting pressure on Netanyahu he has not seeded to any of that pressure as of yet but it's going to be interesting to see at such a crucial hour such a critical time when negotiations are ongoing if more people will be going out into the streets and mobilizing and how much more pressure political pressure that will put on the Prime Minister okay Muhammad thank you so much for that reporting from Aman and once again just to remind our viewers mhammad jamj is reporting for us from Aman because Benjamin netanyahu's cabinet has banned Al jazer so that's why we're having to report from outside of Israel and that is a live shot from uh Gaza right now uh this morning let's uh continue the conversation about the weapons uh shipment uh the pause I should say in a shipment of weapons to Israel by the US and speak to Amir Orin who's a military and government commentator with herro's newspaper joining us from T Aviv Mr Orin thanks for your time so how is this being viewed in Israel well it's viewed as a very significant move and um uh in order to understand the background it's both legal and political later today uh May 8th uh Secretary of State uh blink and Secretary of Defense Austin must certify that all arms shipments to Israel as well as to other countries are given or sold when these countries uphold the international law and do not violate human rights and do not impede humanitarian Aid now um as the time for this document to be signed uh was getting closed Netanyahu kept talking about the Rafa operation in direct uh opposition to President Biden so after all the public statements and the phone calls between Biden and Netanyahu did not help the administration took a two-step move first of all it secretly haltered or posed this particular shipment because it was the next in line it didn't have any particular significance per se but the shipment was next in line and this was a signal intended only for the Israeli cabinet to understand that did not help yeah okay so when it comes to this signal what is the US signaling to Israel or is the US trying to pressure them not to continue with this offensive or is is the US trying to pressure Israel into uh these ceasefire negotiations and eventually deal what's going on here in a general sense and it's very ironic because usually when we speak about deterrence we speak about the political will of governments to execute what they say to make good on their threats and here the threat was not against an adversary but against uh a partner or a lie and uh when the Netanyahu government uh decided to challenge the Biden Administration and ignore its warnings then Biden had to show nany that he's serious now uh yes it has to do with uh with the Rafa operation because uh Biden uh demanded that netan not take undertake any major military operation that is a ground maneuver of course surgical raids raids in order to release the hostages or perhaps even to kill or capture the Hamas leadership are fine as far as Washington is concerned but not a massive movement from the ground but also with L support which will drive the 1.4 million civilians anywhere upth I mean besides this being a symbolic move as many are describing it what difference does it actually make to Israel practically on the ground because even us officials are saying that the Israeli military has enough weapons supplied by the Us and other partners to conduct the RFA operation if it chooses not to listen to the US's objections you know no battle is the very last one and no war can end without the government and Military being prepared for the next one and uh even though one particular action can uh be executed with whatever you have in stock you must replenish your stock in order to prepare for Lebanon for instance or for another Iranian contingency so it doesn't have to do only with what is happening tomorrow you must think about next week and next year okay uh thank you so much for speaking to us from Tel Aviva Orin thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
