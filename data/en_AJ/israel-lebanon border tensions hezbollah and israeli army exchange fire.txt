where Hezbollah has launched Rockets from Southern Lebanon Israel is retaliating with air strikes on The Villages of dyra and yarin after Rockets were fired into Northern Israel on Tuesday hasah fired guided missile at an Israeli military vehicle and Israeli forces responded by bombing Hezbollah outposts we can speak now to Ali Hashim our correspondent On the Border he's live from dirra that's where this fighting has been taking place Ali just talk through exactly what's happening there yes Laura we are standing just in front of the post where all the uh shelling and launching of rockets was taking place uh for now we uh heard from emergency services that there are two civilians injured however there are many civilians who are kind of uh stuck in that area because they can't arrive there there are reports but they can't out there what happened today is that uh in the morning there were several guided missiles launched from the Lebanese side of the border on an Israeli military post and then maybe our U colleague R could take us towards the wall that's that's the the border line between Lebanon and Israel and that's where everything was uh happening so after the the guided missiles hit the Israeli post then we started hearing Israeli shelling now shelling was taken uh place um with drones uh not not uh uh not Air Raids or air strikes rather with drones artillery and um following that moment of strikes we started hearing gunshots so it seems there were some skirmishes now what we are talking about over here is just observations we don't have the clear pict picture it's just what we are able to see from this side we try to be as close as possible to the flash point um however this is this is part of a greater context a bigger context maybe could be explained later yesterday there were Rockets uh launched from South Lebanon from Hamas day of before yesterday uh Islamic Jihad infiltrated from this same area froma so U the tension is is mounting from the Lebanese side of the Border still an operation area but things are gradually getting out of control okay Ali thanks very much for bringing us the situation there on the ground well let's try and get a bit more context on the situation there we can join Zena Hoda she is with us from a village of called Maroon al- Ras that's along the Lebanon Israel border and Zena this has long been a volatile border so can we still say though that the fighting is a contained situation or has it spread wider than that it's still limited but it's gradually escalating it's day four since we've seen um escalation if you like along the Lebanon Israel border and what what we're seeing is you know attacks tit fortat attacks Hezbollah saying that this is in response it's targeting the Israeli position in response to the killing of three of its members two days ago um so both sides really limiting uh the uh artillery shelling or the attacks to military targets but this could easily change and already you hear some officials being quoted in Israeli media that the Rules of Engagement will change we're getting reports that some of the uh retaliatory strikes by the Israelis um hit close to civilian homes so the situation is very very tense we've been coming to this border over the past four days now when you drive along the border you don't see anyone people have left their homes uh the sound of Israeli drones constantly overhead the sound of Israeli war planes people of this region know very well that the possibility of allout War cannot be ruled out but Hezbollah has been treading carefully sending messages putting pressure on the Israelis telling them that if you continue this escalation against Gaza you will face pressure elsewhere and it's not just Lebanon yesterday they opened a new front and that is the Syria border um Hezbollah as well as other Iranian backed groups have positions along Syria's border with Israel there were rockets that were fired across the border yesterday really another message that your forces your resources could be stretched thin if you continue pushing with this with this offensive um but at the end of the day all I can tell you is that people here are worried you're getting uh you know a lot of news that you can't even confirm for example some local news agencies are saying that Hezbollah told the UN peacekeeping forces as well as the Lebanese Army that they should leave the area we called the unifil command they said this is not true uh the Lebanese Army has not said anything about this so tension is building up the pressure is building up as each day passes and as as you know Israel continues to put more and more pressure on Gaza then expect Israel to face more and more pressure from this front and the front uh bordering Syria okay Zoda thanks very much for bring us the scene there on that border Northern Israel and Southern Lebanon thanks very much
