all right let's uh bring in alzer senior political anst M Bashar and moan the sheer horror of what's going on in Gaza is just somehow encapsulated in in that one awful story isn't it absolutely I've been obsessing about this um since I saw this report this morning as if uh the tragedy of this family uh incarnates the 100 days of genocide um in a way that is so tragic and so telling and so revealing really about the cost of War because for the past 100 days we've shown pictures we've spoken with high language about the legal definitions and about strategic implications and and we counted bombs and missiles and and casualties and and and destroyed buildings and hospitals but we never really sunk in to the depth of the human suffering until I saw the story of this family and it's a family of salm the salm salm is supposed to be safe this was not safety for this there was no safety for this family clearly for years certainly for the past 100 days Hiba R and NADA you know came face to face with evil and and the way she's recounting her testimony as if it's a dialogue with death she had uh H her husband killed in the back murdered assassinated by the Israeli soldiers her baby was killed too another baby is injured and dying of starvation and this woman uh speaks with a steady voice but her face is so pale uh her eyes are so sad recounting the suffering that is are going on in Gaza and in the end of the day you look at this and it really starts sinking in what does it really mean this war to the people of Gaza because you know um this whole started at least presently speaking with October 7 and October 7 was gruesome to Israeli civilians who were killed by Hamas Fighters and by their own military uh clearly uh but since then we've had 100 October 7s 100 times worse wor than October 7 and this family and this tragedy isolated like that in Gaza they're not going to get to go to a hotel now until their house is rebuilt like the people in southern Gaza who are now refugees and hotels in Tel Aviv these families have nowhere to go no safety nets no hospitals no social security of any nature and certainly no one is coming to their aid and I'm not sure if there's going to be any Reckoning in terms of the crimes committed against his family well that's the thing isn't it because Charles statford said at the end of his report there that the that family very aware of the chances of the perpetrators of the crimes ever facing Justice incredibly unlikely so you know down the line will there be a reckoning not just about that but about everything that's happened in Gaza and you you you you have to agree uh Charles because looking at the Israeli president being hosted like a like a hero at Davos among the Western Elites uh taking him in listening to him in their hundreds to his testimony and he's the man who Unleashed all evil he is not exactly the executive in Israel but he is the moral Authority as the president of the country and he's supposed to be moderate by the way but he's the one who Unleashed all evil and basically gave meaning to genocide gave the definition of genocide the intent to genocide Mr Herzog is the one who in a press conference with Western Journal said there are no Innocents in Gaza and has been repeating those lies ever since about about children as human Shields to my mind to my mind it's Israel since October 7 who used the dead Israeli civilians as human shield to justify genocide against Gaza 100,000 casualties because Israel continues to use the same arguments that our civilians died in October 7 hence we have the right apparently even the duty clearly to kill you know with no end in sight and the Israeli president saying today that that you in his view every Palestinian has a missile under his pillow I mean imagine that as if as if you know you've been watching some uh you 1950s movies you know where people hide their money under their mattresses as if this makes any sense but also this doctored evidence that the Israeli Army showed us in Gaza under hospitals and Beyond hospitals and and a carry bag behind uh an x-ray machine and all these doctor evidence that we've shown that basically proed to be lies and all the pretext for this war for the bombing of the hospitals turned out to be all humbug and the idea that that if you only destroy the buildings and kill the civilians you will destroy Hamas Hamas became a really potent Force after the civilians left and after the buildings were destroyed and the hospitals and the residential buildings Israeli soldiers started to die in in Middle November when they w't hand inand you know battled in the in the refugee camps and in in Gaza so really all in all once again just to go back to this report because I I wish everyone would watch and listen and really have a feel for what is happening to Gaza and to the people of Gaza and why this genocide that is raing unraveling in plain sight must end the people on Davos should not be hosting the Israeli president they should be calling for a ceasefire and they should be putting the Israeli leaders on trial instead all right M thanks for that M Bashar speaking that now at
