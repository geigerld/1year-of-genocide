Muhammad nazal is a member of hamas's political Bureau he calls Israel's continued bombardment of Gaza and AC of terrorism the intensity of strikes on civilians in Gaza is due to the political and moral bankruptcy of netanyahu's government the Zionist terrorist government while the kasm brigades meanwhile has released video footage showing its Fighters launching kamakazi drones into Israeli territory tree the military wing of Hamas said it targeted sites in Israel for the first time since its offensive more than two weeks ago well let's bring in Alan Fischer he joins us now from occupied East Jerusalem Alan an attack on Israeli territory what have you been hearing about these drones well in the last couple of hours as you see those two suicide drones were fired from Gaza towards communities very close uh to the Gaza border now according to the Israeli Army both of those drones were thwarted around the same time there was an alert in the north of the country just north of hia probably about 17 km away from the border with Lebanon and there was an alert there because drone had been fired by Hezbollah again the Israeli defense the Israeli Army are saying that they intercepted uh those drones uh that but there'll be some concern that they came so close to one another and certainly Israeli intelligence will be investigating whether there was a level of coordination between Gaza and also Hezbollah in the north but it for the Israelis it's certainly a worrying development and I believe Alan that the Dutch prime minister is now meeting with both the Israelis and the Palestinians that's remarkable what are Mark rut's priorities well Mark rut has met with Benjamin Netanyahu uh he obviously expressed his support for Israel and what they were doing but he he's also on record is demanding a humanitarian ceasefire to allow Aid into Gaza he's also talked about while Israel having the right to defend itself they also have to act within humanitarian law and also the the rules of War uh he's then going to meet with Mahmud Abbas in rala now Mahmud Abbas has met with a couple of Western leaders he's met with rushi sunak the the British prime minister that happened in Cairo and he of course met with Anthony blinkin and that was in a man but this is the first time that the Western leader has come here uh to express support for Israel but also added on to that a visit to the Palestinian leader uh in rala it's an interesting development and hopefully we'll hear from Mark Ruta at some point now one thing he wanted to raise with the Israelis was the death of a 33-year-old Dutch woman she had arrived in Gaza just a couple of days before the war started she has been killed and we are told by the Dutch foreign Ministry Mark rut would like to hear an explanation from the Israelis about that woman's death specifically I'm sure Alan there with the latest forest for from occupied East Jerusalem thank you very much Alan well let's bring in Patrick buy he is in B in the UK he's a defense and security Analyst at the University of bth and also a former NATO analyst Patrick just picking up on what I was discussing there with Alan these drones do you think they represent a change in tactics from Hamas and and where have they gotten them from good afternoon no I don't think they've changed uh changed tactics essentially we saw the drones being used very successfully um against the Israeli security wall and in particular some of the sensors that are used there with the um Hamas Commandos using the drones to essentially drop explosives onto the the power packs for those uh Those sensors and then being able to with a culmination of other tactics being able to overwhelm The Defenders so this is just part of the course we've seen them used heavily in Ukraine and continue to be used in Ukraine and indeed I think a lot of these organizations are learning um from each other watching what is happening um via social media Etc looking for what works and adapting as they go ahead so I don't think it's anything new I think it's constantly evolving lots of speculation that they're homemade is that your reading as well uh I it looks like uh just having a look at your footage there some of those uh look like platforms that I haven't seen before and wouldn't immediately recognize um of course Hamas are known for having a indigenous uh weapons building capability be it shells Rockets um explosives and uh it looks like in that case Jones but I couldn't say without 100% without viewing more footage sure well the Israelis have been saying that they're trying to get their captives back we know there have been ground raids in Gaza one soldier killed over the last day or so what are the implications of a ground offensive for those still being held well this is it I think it it really complicates the calculus for the Israeli Defense Forces in any planned uh invasion of Gaza which seems to be looking like it's is going to focus on North Gaza at least initially um essentially you don't really want to start an invasion when your enemy has you know over 200 uh of your hostages uh and so I would thought that the raid is actually quite indicative of how this may go down now in the next few days and that there'll be uh intelligence-led raids and operations probably supported by Special Forces on the ground trying to gain either more intelligence informers signals intelligence to to pick up if they can but Hamas have been shown that they're very adapted avoiding digital Communications in the planning of the sept September uh sorry 7th of October attack so um I think that that would probably be how it goes uh in the in the near term then in the in the in the in the longer term of course if there is a a larger Invasion the unfortunate situation is if all those hostages aren't freed by diplomatic means or or by these raids is there's potentially a situation where you know they are they're brought to harm uh as as the uh as The Invasion goes on either through misadventure and accident and and obviously war is a chaotic uh environment or indeed by uh some deliberate means by Hamas in response to the Israeli ground Invasion uh Patrick so you're saying that you believe that these ground raids these smaller ground raids will continue and then we could still see this this bigger ground offensive it's been reported that the US wants this offensive delayed partly so it seems it can prepare itself for proxy conflicts elsewhere in the region how big could this become in your reading I think the delay so far is is actually quite significant and I think you know it probably what's going on behind the scenes I don't have inside information at all but I would imagine that although a lot of the western leaders are very supportive of Ukraine outwardly they are raising the uh the international law element and you must be proportionate and also avoid civilian casualties um but I wouldn't be surprised behind closed doors they urging restraint because this is now a Tinder Box things are poised very finely and as you rightly say if there was an in Israeli ground incursion into Northern Gaza we would presume that at least some of Hamas would stay in fight that would turn into a very Urban bloody war therefore uh and of course the Arab public opinion which is already against Israel would probably go further so and therefore and in know that kind of situation where you have Hezbollah in the north and and a proxy of Iran the potential for them to decide to take action to be seen as kind of the Arabic uh you know saviors essentially and and uh to to to defend themselves against Israel uh grows quite a lot and and I think that's really the worry and I think hence why a lot of uh diplomacy is going on behind the scenes trying to Cal things down and that includes potentially I don't know but potentially the delay might in part explain the delay of these uh of of the ground Invasion as does of course the re the fact that Hamas have their hostages sure and and very real fears of escalation as you were saying Patrick buy there a defense and security Analyst at the University of b thank you so much for joining us and sharing your expertise with us here on alzer
