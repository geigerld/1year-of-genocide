so Israel's prime minister has again rejected uh growing calls for a ceasefire and says that the Israeli Army will remain inside the strip when the fighting has stopped listen to this as far as the day after goes that day will only arrive after destroying Hamas Gaza will be demilitarized there will no longer be a threat from Gaza on Israel and to ensure there won't be such a threat as long as necessary the Israeli military will maintain control of Gaza to prevent Terror from inside it Sarah kyat joins us from occupied East Jerusalem Sarah Israel's prime minister talking about what he sees as a post-war Gaza what more has he been saying good morning sirel well he talked about as you heard there uh having Gaza as a demilitarized zone um he said that currently they've managed to take control of hamas's stronghold hold which is the north of Gaza uh but he also said that they don't plan to occupy Gaza of course it had previously occupied uh Gaza and then pulled out its troops and the illegal Israeli settlements in 2005 so he says they don't have a plan uh to do the same um he also said that they would be there for a very long time even when they get rid of Hamas that's their plan that's their main goal and it has been since day one um and then they will be there for a very long time in control they said the security situation uh there until uh they can look at the next step they didn't detail what that next step is um but he did say that the possibility the Palestinian Authority regning Gaza uh what he wasn't in favor of that and that that's not an option for them that's despite the International Community especially the US um pushing for the possible Return of the Palestinian Authority taking control of uh that situation once uh Hamas had has been in the words of the Israelis eliminated in this statement that we've been seeing the the kind of tone that we're seeing is very different it's very defiant uh towards uh what the International Community is saying and all of those diplomatic conversations that are happening in the background really effectively what he's saying is that that's their goal and regardless of what the International Community says they're still going to go ahead with it um when they talk about taking control of security like I said it's not clear but we already know that Israel was under a 17-year blockade before any of this which meant that it was an gazans could not leave they could not enter unless they were given permits by Israel uh those borders are controlled by Israel as well including those Crossings um so really effectively um even though they're saying it's not an occupation for many Palestinians they're viewing it as a potential occupation of Gaza Sara hyat reporting from occupied East jus thank you very much Sara
