let's now bring in Maran bashara aler senior political analyst he joins us today from Doha Maran another visit from blinkin now given what we're seeing there in Rafa and the hopes that we're hearing about there from from T of the people on the ground do you think that Lincoln's visit might take any kind of a different tone from the last few you know one would hope so Nastasia especially that his last few trips were incredible uh counterproductive in fact they've led to more violence and more casualties among the Palestinians at the end of November he assured us that he got the commitment from prime minister Netanyahu that Israel will protect civilians since then 6,000 additional children were killed by Israel doubl that number among the civilians of Gaza so clearly neither uh secretary blink's effort nor prime minister Netanyahu assurances to the Secretary of State have been helpful you would hope that this time around things are different now judging from his press conference uh this evening one cannot be that hopeful because it sound that his uh holer than thou approach as if America uh you know has been uh the uh humanitarian in Chief is just not just deceiving it's mind bugling it's it's insulting to our intelligence I mean the United States has been a participant it has been a participant in the war cabinet meeting in the Israeli government it's American Arms American money and American diplomacy that allowed this plausible genocide uh to go forward the past four months so for the Secretary of State to continue to be Israel's Advocate Israel's foreign minister and at the same time wants to play mediator an honest broker I think there's a contrad in term here so I think once he goes to Israel tomorrow he needs to start behaving not uh like Israel's Advocate but more like a mediator of a superpower type where America should use its leverage with Israel if America is serious about ending the war and freeing the captives as well of course as the prisoners you mentioned leverage there ma now in that press conference blinkin was confronted with the idea that Israel's Defiance of requests that we've that we've seen is making Washington look weak but it was interesting to see blinkin took credit for getting humanitarian Aid into Gaza saying that that shows that Israel is listening to the White House what did you make of that now that's the part that's probably you know as an analyst you know would make me roll my eyes uh not just not once not twice but countless times just listening to a diplomat saying that or taking credit for the humanitarian Aid which is basically few trucks of food before people were killed again in Gaza while America was a participant in the war I it's just kind of incredulous uh for uh uh you know the Secretary of State to be taking credit for the humanitarian assistance to a people he I mean his country is helping uh kill and destroy and displace within the Gaza Strip I mean that part was was a bit too harsh to accept from any Diplomat let alone from an American Diplomat but once again one would hope that you know secretary blinkin would start uh shedding uh that kind of a you know Israel Advocate stance that holier than thou uh uh approach and start taking a more credible more responsible more grownup approach to this issue that is turning to a full-fledged genocide perhaps bording on extermination if the Israelis continues with continue with their Onslaught Beyond ra into kanun where some two million people now are concentrated basically helpless basically homeless in the southern part of Gaza Maran as all of this continues I've been wondering how the US and Anthony blinkin is now being regarded by by other Regional Powers we listened to blinkin constantly emphasized how the US wants to deescalate tensions right but how are for instance the US strikes that that have been taking place in the region how are those being read especially by all the regional Powers look despite uh the American diplomats attempts at saying that this has nothing to do with what's going on in Gaza unfortunately for him it has everything to do with what's going on in Gaza I mean clearly those groups whether you agree them or disagree them whether you want to denounce them or praise them they certainly have reacted uh after the genocide started to unravel in plain sight uh in Gaza it is a situation that is getting out of hand slowly but surely America now is engaged in war on different fronts it's bombing in Yemen it's bombing in Syria in Iraq it could be bombing next AR God knows where in in in Lebanon and Beyond so despite attempts or despite keeping up the appearances of wanting to wind down the war and limit its uh spread in the region America is now engaged on behalf of Israel in a war across the region now this is not to the liking of America's allies who have basically invited the United States to come in and to be responsible you know as a broker as a mediator as a protector for some of those States for fear of I don't know their neighbors or or whoever but the United States especially over the last four months have acted so irresponsibly that it's putting in danger even its allies because public opinion is boiling radical groups are becoming more and more popular because of America's support to Israel's genocide in Gaza so once again we have to go back to square one it's time to end the war this war has run its course America understands that it's time to do it now this is perhaps the last chance to save the captives in Gaza because if the war goes on now to kanun and God knows what will happen to those captives it is a last chance also to save the Palestinians from another uh perhaps an extermination or displacement in the south of Gaza it's time for the United States also to do so because once again as I said it is widening the war and it's going to get implicated into another uh Forever War and the region something Biden has said once and again that he wants to avoid so all the signs all the signals all the roads lead to a truce a ceasefire a permanent one where there'll be rebuilding of Gaza exchange of captives and prisoners and hopefully quickly the withdrawal of Israeli forces from occupied territories and establishment of some sort of an independent contiguous Sovereign Palestinian State otherwise we're going to be once again in the cycle of violence that's going to implicate everyone including the United States well we'll see what emerges from that meeting tomorrow Maan Bashar aler senior political analyst always great to hear your thoughts Maan thanks for joining us again
