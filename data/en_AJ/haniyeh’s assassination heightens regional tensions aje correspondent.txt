well the killing of hania comes hours after an Israeli strike on lebanon's Capital bayout at least three people were killed a mother and two children another 74 were injured the strike partially destroyed a building in the southern suburbs of hared that's a known stronghold for the Iran backed Hezbollah Group Well Israel's Army has said the attack killed one of hezbollah's top commanders fad Shakur Israel says the Commander is responsible for Saturday's attack on the occupied Golan Heights Hezbollah has denied involvement in that attack and has not confirmed his death well Ali hasham joins us live now from Beirut Ali so you've been covering this since the war in Gaza uh began and you're now based uh in Beirut uh what what what's happening where you are now Alias people wake up to this news about Ismael hania the political lead of Hamas being killed in Iran what's what's what's been the response there what's going through people's minds well Darren this was a shocking news actually for many people especially that it came after few hours from another Israeli assassination attempt because till the moment we don't have anyah confirmation that fad shukur known also as M shukur was killed in the attack in general giving the precedents over the past years hasah will issue statements immediately after uh informing the families of whoever is being targeted but it's it's been hours now and hasah didn't issue a statement this could be for several reasons he could be injured with uh very uh critical uh uh wounds he he could be maybe not there or there are some preparations that is doing so we don't know mainly why hasah hasn't issued a statement yet this is on one side with respect to what happened in tan intertwined with what's happening in Beirut this is this is a very big picture right now and uh this is making the stakes very high not only for the leaderships not only for hisbah in Lebanon not only for Iran but even for the people of the region because this is alarming actually that there might be something bigger than what's already happening and we saw just a few months ago when Israel uh targeted an Iranian Consulate in Damascus how the region went into a war status for a few days and then we saw the Iranian at attack the Iranian retaliation on Israel so right now everyone is anticipating we have two parallel assassination two parallel high ranking assassinations also this has another angle to look at it killing someone like SM Hanah the leader of Hamas in in in tan killing him in tan means a lot for the leaders of what's known as the axis of resistance led by by Iran that means that there is no safe haven for them because even if they're in tan someone is going to uh Target them this this means a lot not just for Hamas it mean for hisbah it means for the hthis for the Iraqis so this is also raising a lot of of of questions and if we go to the to the bigger picture on how this is going to be reflected on this whole conflict we are actually in the middle of maybe one of the biggest conflicts in the history of the region very intertwined very multi-layered and uh there are several fronts engaged in it whether directly or indirectly whether in support or uh uh like now in Lebanon the situation is becoming more like a direct confrontation so how this is going to be uh reflected these These are also what people are thinking of because this will have direct impact on on their lives this will have direct impact on their stability so the problem is that everyone is seeing right now Israel dragging Iran into this conflict directly because an attack on Iranian soil would mean an Iranian retaliation just as we saw in the attack in Damascus given the fact an Iranian consulate was attack there's another thing to take into consideration Darren this is the first day for president m pesan in power so it's a transitional period also in Iran there is a a defense minister who is inherited from the past cabinet so there is no new one the President should be appointing another one there is no interior Minister it's just the outgoing Minister H it's a it's a country in transition at this moment and with such a very big attack I mean the the the the weight of the attack the new government Maybe would need to take big decisions that's why we are hearing right now that the Supreme National Security Council in Iran led by the Supreme Leader might be convening now we we don't know whether this is confirmed or not but at least for now there are reports that the Supreme National Security Council is convening and whenever this council is convening it's to take big decisions all right Al's Ali Hashem live there from the Lebanese Capital Beirut Ali thank you for that make sure to subscribe to our channel to the latest news from Al jazer
