Israel is reportedly using artificial intelligence in its war on Gaza the technology is being employed to select and expand potential targets but with more than 15,000 Palestinians killed so far what are the implications for civilians in Gaza this is Inside hello there and a warm welcome to the program I'm Jonah Hall Israel's war has devastated much of Gaza the few days of Karm under a ceasefire with Hamas of all but disappeared now with Israel resuming its air strikes and shelling Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu has repeatedly warned that he wants to eliminate Hamas and now its armies reportedly using new AI technology to help it EXP expand the potential list of targets which many fear could lead to even more civilian deaths so let's take a closer look at this Advanced Warfare it's being powered by large amounts of data that's fed into an artificial intelligence system an AI called habur translated from Hebrew to mean the gospel produces potential targets for Israeli air strikes which are then confirmed by members of an intelligence unit the system allows Israel to identify much L A much larger number of targets at the same time the scope of the bombing campaign has been broadened even low ranking Hamas Fighters are considered potential targets for an air strike Israel has also loosened its Rules of Engagement to allow for more civilian deaths in the pursuit of its objectives there have been reports of family homes being bombed with the aim of killing a single Hamas fighter more than 15,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's war on Gaza we've all seen video showing entire neighborhoods destroyed by the bombing Cutting Edge technology is supposed to make Warf Warfare more precise but the evidence on the ground suggests the opposite may be true in Gaza well let's bring in our guests in Tel Aviv meon Rapaport editor of local call a Hebrew language news site advancing citizen journalism and an independent media in Durham in the UK Robert gu pinfold lecturer in peace and security at Durham University who specializes in military occupation and exit dilemas and researches Israeli foreign and security policy and in utre in the Netherlands Jessica dorsy International lawyer with expertise in international humanitarian and human rights law she also leads the realities of algorithmic warfare project at utr University a warm welcome to each of you Marin Rapaport I'd like to start with you your outlet local call and did the investigative reporting uh that revealed details about this system absor the gospel as it as it's as it's known in English uh in a piece of work titled the assassination factory set the scene for us what is this system how does it work uh the system uh um it is uh um it is based on AI uh it is uh it is collecting um all kind of information in order to what uh the Army itself calls a factory for uh producing uh uh targets the ex Chief of Staff a kavi when he left his office about a year ago he said that prior we would have uh uh produced 50 targets a year now we can uh produce 100 targets a day it seems that in this war the pace is even higher uh exactly how uh does these these targets are produced of course we don't know exactly and it's not clear even if the intelligence itself uh intelligence people themselves know exactly they do know you know how that these are being produced by AI uh they in order to to execute an attack of course there's a human uh uh decision in order to push the butn it's not pushed by itself let's not be let's be clear about we'll get to that it's it's it's a relative innovation in Israeli Warfare it's not the first time it's been deployed uh it was first spoken about back in 2021 the 11 days of war in 2021 when Israel boasted then about fighting its first AA AI War using machine learning and advanced Computing now though presumably more advanced yes it's more advanced and I think what is really relevant is of course the adapter you know that there is this uh producing of Targets in an AI way artificial intelligence way the most uh incriminating or maybe worrying uh element in our uh investigation is that uh in every for every Target there's a file and in this file it's written how many civilians should are in this target so uh what it appears that the Army knows exactly how many civilians are living in such and such apartment that is being targeted for an attack uh so the outcome of killing civilians is practically known in advance uh so this is what makes this use of AI really really worrisome yes and sinister let me bring in Jessica dorsy there we got a bit of perspective uh from Marin 50 targets a year the Army used to be able to generate now it's 100 a day with this new AI technology which allows them presumably to get close to the 15,000 targets that they've hit in just 35 days of War that's according to the Israeli Army itself and by comparison in 2014 51 days of War then they hit something like five or 6,000 targets all of which accounts for the extremely high civilian death toll shockingly high for this period of conflict yeah I think um what that piece Illustrated were three extremely concerning uh aspects obviously the um the the the the use of AI to generate at such speed uh these kinds of targets were still not all the details aren't quite known yet but certainly to push back on that Narrative of precision in Warfare we're seeing entire city blocks flattened Precision is not on the order here um another issue highlighted in the reporting from 972 is the non-military targets the power targets um allegations that those were chosen to intend to create a shock for the civilian population these are very concerning and in legal terms thinking along the lines of in possibilities to um try to terrorize a population these kinds of things look another really worrying aspect is that the loosening of the civilian casualty constraints so essentially in a proportionality assessment under International humanitarian law you have to think about your direct military Advantage versus the kinds of Civilian harms that you can expect and when you loosen those constraints that used to be something like permitting perhaps dozens of Civilian casualties to now hundreds this is a recipe for disaster that's being borne by the brunt of it is being borne by the civilians on the ground in these densely populated areas like Gaza it's very concerning um and and from an international legal perspective I think we have to be very very um uh well we need to push back as an International Community on the proportionality questions as well as distinction about what kinds of targets are being um uh exploded in these situations um if they're non-military Targets this is directly contrary to international law well let me put this to Rob gist pinfold uh reporting in the Israeli media Rob describes the system's ability to order Precision strikes while quote making sure as far as possible there will be no harm to non-involved civilians that comes from a report in yedo arono newspaper that's what the Israeli public is being told and that you've only you've only got to look around and look at these figures and look at the devastation to wonder whether you know either this system isn't working or there's been a substantial policy change and the military's targeting is simply indiscriminate I think it's the policy change that's what matters here uh and we focus on the AI but we have to look at Israel's objectives in this war traditionally when Israel's gone to war or engaged in conflict with Hamas and indeed with Hezbollah it's been a status quo power Israel's objective has been to basically reinforce the status quo to project its deterrence uh to get the other side uh to be invested in the status quo and to disincentivize them from trying to change things the attacks on October the 7th meant all of that um was basically was Israel reshuffled its um security conception it moved from um preserving the status quo to trying to create a new status quo so Israel's objective in this war it stated objective is removing Hamas from power or at the very least dealing a crippling blow that would entail killing or capturing the group's military leaders removing it from uh a governance role in most or all uh of the Gaza Strip for example and dealing a lethal uh blow to its military wing uh so that requires a completely different um that that's a completely different operational question for the IDF if previously they were looking uh to keep things the way they are the fact that they're keeping they now want to change things mean that Israel's targeting parameters have been broadened significantly um we know that Israel traditionally operates by what's been described as a traffic light system they know how many civilians are in uh these locations uh and they code them by red yellow and green uh depending on how many civilians are there and the high value of the Target red obviously mean uh meaning that they are less likely or shouldn't attack green meaning that the attack should be a go and because it has different aims because uh Israel's Society is reeling from those attacks on October the 7th uh those um the goal posts have shifted significantly and Israel as you've said previously now has significantly broader targeting parameters many of those targets that were previously red or yellow have now become green because Israel has different political objectives in this war that is the removal of Hamas Marin is that what you're reporting revealed essentially that whilst this system is able to give pretty accurate data about the numbers of civilians in any given targeted area that data is actually being used to decide to attack in some cases rather than not to attack yes of course uh I think there is a um uh it's true that I think the goals of this war are different and the um the sources that we have talked to you know are not um in a in a position to know exactly what are uh the goals of the higher military commands but it's clear that the goals are different that the goals are to eliminate Hamas uh uh and we basically to reoccupy Gaza as we've heard yesterday from prime minister Netanyahu uh to totally reoccupy Gaza and and control it militar uh this also uh uh means or it meant in the first stage in Northern Gaza uh uh driving away uh more a million people uh to the southern uh uh parts of the Gaza Street uh how what connection is there between the loosening of uh of its uh of its rules concerning uh civilian uh casualties uh and uh uh and to the effort to drive away this population of course this is something that we don't know you know exactly but I think uh it's quite plausible to assume that there is a connection a very maybe a very close connection between these two angs uh between these two phenomenon on the one hand push the Palestinian South and on the other uh make a very loose uh attack uh civilian Target in a very loose way uh knowing that there are there may be uh dozens or even in one case as reported hundreds of Civilian casualties that could be Hur out of one attack so uh you know it comes together it seems that it comes together Jessica dorsy a war then on civilians as much as a war on Hamas essentially would you agree with that well that's I think the facto what we are seeing so back to the the points raised by the the other two panelists the policies the Strategic aims and goals may have changed but law Wars still have laws and those are imperative not only for the protection of civilians that centering the protection of civilians has to be it's a legal obligation to follow that and and not only is it a legal obligation we're seeing even close allies the United States uh Secretary of Defense has pushed back on this policy change and approach saying that Israel risks a strategic defeat if they do not protect civilian so it's legal it's strategic it's in the interest of everyone to uh be much less uh loose let's say with respect to the targeting parameters it's all very it's all very well to say that much as as politicians in Washington can say that is Israel and the government of Mr Netanyahu are apparently blindly blindly ignoring uh all of that there's not very much anybody can do about it well it seems in the short term that may be unfortunately the case but I do think uh in the longer term certainly there are investigations ongoing with respect to uh international criminal law at the moment the prosecutor of the international criminal court has opened up investigations to both sides of the atrocities so that's something that's being done certainly the more that comes out about the loosening of these particular constraints can turn the tides from allies even further to to hear the United States pushing back um on the particular lack of precision I think is quite a telling step um yeah I share the the sentiment I wish that something could be done in a much more acute way because people are suffering people are dying as we speak um so it does feel somewhere like nothing is being done but I assure you that's that's not the case I I want to just focus you for a moment back on AI artificial intelligence the system that we are discussing a and and your concern that you've raised about automation bias as part of the functionality of this system and what can potentially go wrong with it what do you mean by that yeah I think certainly from the reporting I was quite concerned the the red flags of automation bias uh were raised by reading that essentially what automation bias is is uh Ai and and machine learning develops uh particular targets or makes decisions in a much faster way than humans can and they do this based on algorithms and computer science and that has a tendency because of the speed at which it happens um for humans to start believing what the machine generates is the right direction the way to go so the Trust In what the the system generates um is to be trusted so we have to uh allow that to continue so de facto even if a human is making decisions on whether to fire um a bomb based on algorithmically selected targets or not de facto and we're seeing also with this reporting that um the the pace at which this is happening doesn't allow for really very much meaningful human control and review of What kinds of Civilian casualties are happening based on the target selection because it's just happening at such a rapid pace Rob G pinfall one of the fascinating things that struck me in the reporting was that in the past one of the problems Israel had was that it ran out of targets quite quickly because senior commanders would go immediately underground into the tunnel system and they wouldn't be able to find them now they've got this system which is generating these huge numbers of targets among much lower value Hamas kind of foot solders and enabling them to go in and hit them at home and their families and bomb and use heavy artillery in big uh populated apartment buildings killing everybody in the vicinity uh it sort of explains doesn't it why Israel hasn't been able to claim the death of many Hamas senior figures but has claimed the deaths of thousands of Hamas Fighters and why this technology isn't going to help them in the end reach the goal of eliminating Hamas it's not going to help them get commanders is it well this is the issue here many of the commanders have already gone to Grand uh many of them will probably be in the uh so-called Gaza Metro hamas's tunnel Network under the territory uh but I think you know your question here about Israel going after hamas's commanders it also reveals some of the operational and intelligence failures uh that have guided Israeli policy to this point uh obviously um Israel has gone into the Gaza Strip it's gone primarily into Northern Gaza it's focused its offensive on Marza City and you know it could claim uh victories there in terms of the casualties the Israeli casualties being relatively low compared to what was expected uh the number of Hamas cases it claims and obviously you know you take this with a pinch of Sal it claims to have killed between five to 6,000 uh Hamas Fighters but at the same time um Israeli officials were telling us time and time again that hamas's entire command and control network is concentrated in the Gaza City area there's no need for them to expand the war to Sou Southern Gaza uh and now the Seas fires ended Israel is looking to do exactly that to expand its War to Southern Gaza is saying that actually either these key commanders weren't there at the start they weren't in Northern Gaza or they were able to relocate to uh to Southern Gaza so Israel has made a um even though it's short term this looks like a operation or strategic victory for Israel it may actually um beely greater intelligence or operational failures which will mean it now has to expand its War to the southern Gaza Strip and the issue here as as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mentioned is that it has um pressured 1.1 million gazans to leave Northern Gaza and move to Southern Gaza it's also under increasing pressure from the Biden Administration the US is saying um we will not let you um have such a high civilian death toll if you do expand your War Gaza you know our support is finite our support is dependent on you preserving civilians and allowing uh fuel for example and other resources to access the Gaza Strip so Israel now finds itself in a strategic dilemma it feels it has to expand the war to Southern Gaza but at the same time its ability to do so is limited uh by uh it's the the closing window of political support from the Biden Administration and that window is only going to close further if um civilian cases escalate which at the moment because of Israel's previous policy of deporting all of those civilians to Southern Gaza that looks sadly inevitable and of course it it won't help that particular argument will it Jessica dorsy the fact that this system and what we now know about it uh raises serious questions about what Israel and the Israeli Army frequently say and Israeli politicians too is the reason for high civilian death toll which is that Hamas and other armed groups embed themselves within the civilian population what we now know is that targets are being generated to hit minor level foot soldiers where they live in their homes which by definition are in amongst civilians in densely packed civilian areas so there's no way to hit them without hitting civilians that really undermines the argument doesn't it absolutely and I think that that is sort of the the key or the Crux here of the argument regarding proportionality and also the distinction discussion we had earlier about the kind of excessive civilian harm that we're seeing in relation to the direct military Advantage expected if you're going after low guys um that is not in any way in line with International legal uh obligations and you do Israel has an obligation to protect civilians um and and follow the laws of war and I think with the AI system the way that it's generating these targets at such a fast pace I think obviously it's acutely problematic in Gaza right now but other countries are watching and learning the way that this is being rolled out there will be actors who will tune in well this is how AI ought to be um that is being used perhaps they're getting away with certain things I think that that's a real danger that we haven't touched upon indeed I wanted to ask I wanted to put that very point to Marin Rapaport this has got to be a fascinating experience for other militaries bent on this sort of of War fighting to learn from it's not just a targeting Factory that they're looking at but they're looking at a sort of livefire realtime experiment in the evolving use of artificial intelligence in this war on Gaza um as for you know for international uh implication I'm I'm not uh really in a position to uh to comment to comment too much I do have to to comment that uh Israel claims that it did hit some high ranking Hamas leaders uh heads of of brigades uh Hamas is not that big but again they did hit some uh high level Hamas militant commanders so and and yes and of course it has to be mentioned that you know Israel went to this operation after this terrible Massacre on the 7th of October where um hundreds of civilians were massacred and and brought into uh hostages civilian hostages were taken to Gaza and this yes although the army of course does not uh uh does not admit it but the Vengeance uh uh uh motive is very much there uh nobody will admit it but it's uh it's certainly behind uh the the the the intensity not Al maybe even the brutality of these early attacks but this as was said by my colleagues before this does not permit is Israel to ignore international law and the the need to protect civilian life not not only for moral reasons only for its own sake because if Israel does not respect these laws it will only create more hatred in the region it will create gener generations of Palestinian who will want also to revenge and we will uh go into an endless circle of violence we will not end violence we will create more violence Rob guys pinfold wrap this up for us in terms of as we were discussing there the future of AI in Warfare sure you've got a machine now which is generating uh targets but it's still a human being who decides to pull the trigger and if as Marin's reporting suggested some Israeli commanders are perhaps more trigger happy uh than others well you've certainly got the potential for an extremely potent War fighting weapon in this war and many to come yeah um it's very clear that you know what's going on here is kind of a petri disc for future conflicts we are seeing an increased move to AI even before the 7th of October you know people were talking about Israel's U Military Intelligence capabilities for example its use of AI like stucks net uh to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Iran Iran's nuclear program as another example uh but even on the guard a border you know one I think this will figure in a commission of inquiry by the way one of the problems that U enabled Hamas to kill so many people on October 7th and to breach Israel's Border in so many places and to take and hold territory was because Israel relied on an automated Network it used sensors it used drones for example it used cameras there was a surprisingly um scant and and small human presence in terms of Israeli soldiers on the border simply because the Israeli Defense Force forces felt that it could manage Gaza from afar that was proven horrifically wrong on October the 7th in terms of not just the massacre of Israelis and and the shock to Israel but also of course Israel's subsequent military campaign in the Gaza Strip but I do want to know make it clear that Israel um Israel signicant yeah Israel doesn't want to call significant civilian casualties that's not out of a humanitarian uh or or International legal perspective it's because knows the more civilian casualties that are generated and caused the more pressure there will be on Israel to stop its operation okay we're going to have to leave it there and thanks to
