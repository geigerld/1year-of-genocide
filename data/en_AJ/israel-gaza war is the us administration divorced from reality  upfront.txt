Hanan ashrawi joins us from the AL jazer Bureau in rala Hanan thank you so much for joining us on upfront thank you Mark it's good to be with you Israel's assault on Gaza continues to cause Mass Devastation and a mounting uh humanitarian crisis uh in fact the world food program's deputy director said that nine out of 10 people in Gaza are not eating every day and half half are starving but last week the United States stood alone and vetoed a un Security Council resolution that called for a humanitarian ceasefire despite overwhelming support for it by other countries the US Deputy ambassador to the United Nations told the council that the veto was against a quote imbalanced resolution that was divorced from reality also saying that it would not move quote the needle forward on the ground in any concrete way what is your re reaction to that well I don't know whether I can take that seriously or not it's act actually it's Preposterous you can't imagine that a grown intelligent human being can say these things with a straight face if anybody is divorced from reality it's the US Administration it is Biden and blinken and there spokespeople who are parting such Hollow meaningless ridiculous terms that are exposing their own loss of contact with reality if you cannot see the tens of thousands of people killed under the rubble or uh uh wounded or starving or suffering from horrific diseases or children who have all sorts of digestive problems because they're drinking sea water or contaminated water uh or people who are going not knowing where they are not knowing where their families are it's incredible the the dimensions the proportions of the horror that is unfolding before our eyes are unconscionable are unfathomable I can tell you we cannot even you know uh think of of all these things at once and yet you have these people sitting there nicely talking about giving Israel more time voting against a ceasefire For Heaven's Sake a ceasefire stop killing innocent civilians stop killing men women and children stop obliterating whole families stop destroying everything that can sustain and maintain life whether it's their homes neighborhoods infrastructure water bakeries hospitals schools universities everything is being destroyed systematically and with Glee and you sit back and you talk about this being divorced from reality what happened to I mean really there is something quite astounding in the way they lost touch with reality absolutely and they lost touch with any sense of decency or morality how how isolated is the United States at this point uh in this position I asked that because this week uh the UN General Assembly voted on a resolution calling for full and immediate ceasefire it passed with 153 votes has the International Community changed its its disposition toward this yes yes clearly there are no two ways about it the uh World public opinion is Shifting um countries in the world States even those who at the beginning you know jumped with the American uh instant position of maligning the Palestinians and declaring that we're Liars or we're terrorists or whatever uh now they are beginning to see reality as it is and at least some of them are motivated by a sense of humanity and decency by saying No this has to stop now the US refused the C far consistently it's not the first time it uses the veto they call called for what they said temporary pauses to bring in some food Aid some Aid and then to resume this is absolutely ridiculous and this is inhuman you're of course in the West Bank you're in ramala right now again from the Ala uh Bureau uh and detentions have been a consistent issue in the West Bank uh however Human Rights Watch noted a substantial increase in the number of Palestinians who have been arrested by Israeli authorities since October 7th more than 3,000 people including minors have been arrested or placed under administrative detention since then uh which brings the total number of Palestinians imprisoned to more than 7,000 uh in your view uh what is the reason behind this increase well actually since this year since the uh uh this uh extremist racist right-wing Coalition in Israel took over they have been escalating not just in in uh land theft not just in house demolitions and so on but in raids in in uh villages and towns in carrying out a full ethnic cleansing in the West Bank and as you rightfully said there are hundreds uh now thousands of course of Palestinians who have been detained under the colonial uh administrative detention system in which people are detained without evidence without trial without a hearing without charges without any kind of Defense so it is a a way of exercising control it's a way of again uh getting more and more cards in this game that they're playing in order to say well look we've exchanged one for one or whatever they have now close to 8,000 prisoners in in or or detes in Israeli jails and they want to use them for exchange well they could have prevented uh this escalation and this hard that we're going by agreeing a full exchange of prisoners hostages or detes by saying okay this statement all for all release our captives we will release your captives what I'm thinking about the consequences of these conditions uh in light of any vision of future negotiations you're talking about thousands of people imprisoned you're talking about 18,000 people dead according to gaza's health Ministry since uh October 7th as you mentioned lots of stuff happened before October 7th that we also have to take seriously in light of hunger in light of incarceration in light of mass death in light of all of this stuff uh how do you think about future negotiations with Israel what's the calculus moving forward now what's possible I think talking about negotiations is really not only unrealistic it is really an insult to the suffering and pain of people from the beginning we kept kept talking about you know not being able to have negotiations in a situation of asymmetry that is a total lack of balance and occupied people cannot negotiate with their occupiers we kept telling people that because the occupying power has uh influence and has power over the occupied who have no rights whatsoever so you cannot ask uh people under occupation to ask that occupier for permission to be free not only don't they want us to be free as a settler Colonial system they want to take our land without the people and they want to maintain the system of of control and willful infliction of pain and now Netanyahu and his government they say this openly there can be no negotiations there can be no Palestinian State no sovereignty we do not accept any of these Palestinian leaders whether they're Hamas or fat or anybody else now they're saying something very serious they're talking about the Palestinian police and security as being also the enemy so they're preparing the grounds for an escalation in the West Bank and of course they have totally destroyed Gaza so who's going to negotiate what with whom I think it's the responsibility of the International Community to end the Carnage to end the siege of Gaza and the West Bank to end the occupation and then you can talk about peace based on international law and the recognition of Palestinian rights as equal people who deserve their rights their freedom their dignity their right to self-determination and not as second or third class citizens in an apartheid state that is trying to superimpose greater Israel on all of historical Palestine it's not going to work and to talk about peace negotiations is just absurd at this present moment you talk about the world Community watching all of this happen uh over the last few years uh it's been shown that youth opinion particularly in the west has shifted toward a more sympathetic view of Palestine even former Israeli Prime Minister ahud Barak expressed concern over this change he told Politico uh quote listen to the public tone we are losing public opinion in Europe are you seeing that shift and does that give you any hope for a different kind of future and a different kind of political reality absolutely because for decades for years Israel had the full sway the full power to shape public discourse it had its own uh uh propaganda machines it has its own influence uh especially in mainstream media um and and the Israeli narrative and the Israeli version was constantly the dominant one and the Palestinians were either invisible or silenced or maligned and and labeled uh and so on gradually now with of course with social media and with access to information and knowledge and with the ability to network and understand and with the South also speaking out because the global South now is becoming more vocal the sort of dominant white European Christian mentality is no longer the the uh ruler of the world so to speak and now throughout the West the people are rising the people are are understanding the nature of of the Palestinian cause the fact that we are an indigenous people being erased so to speak and denied and oppressed by a colonial power because to us Israel is a Col is an offshoot of colonialism uh and uh they are beginning to speak out and they've refused to listen to their own governments they've challenged their own governments as you saw in London and Paris and different places the younger Generations are questioning are asking are see seeking facts and knowledge and are reaching out and this is what gives them power that they are not easily intimidated and they are seeking uh their own voice and they're seeking Partnerships and networks and that's what makes a difference now Dr Hanan ashra thank you so much for joining us and up front thank you Mark it's good to be with [Music]
