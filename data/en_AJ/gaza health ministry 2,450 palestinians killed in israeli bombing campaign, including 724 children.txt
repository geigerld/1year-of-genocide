let's recap the latest in the war on Gaza Israeli air strikes have killed at least 2,450 Palestinians since last Saturday at least a quarter of them were children the Israeli military has killed more Palestinians in 8 days than it did in 51 days of War on Gaza in 2014 the number of Israelis killed in hamas's military operation stands at400 including 289 soldiers Israel has ordered 1.1 million Palestinians in Northern Gaza to move South as the military prepares for a wide ranging Land Air and sea Invasion Elder is a political analyst joining us from Tel Aviv uh thank you very much for joining us on Al jazer first of all what has been the reaction in Israel to the 2,450 Palestinian civilians that have been killed so far in Gaza um Tom I I can just uh give you a taste of the reaction in Israel to people who Dar to mention the Palestinian victims um a renowned Israeli Chef AAL Shani wrote a post begging nanyu to help the uh babies in incubators in Gaza to help them to get out uh after he got so much hate Mill and he was labeled a traitor he had to remove this post from the social media the uh Israeli public opinion is still mourning the victims of the massacre uh comparing this to the to the Holocaust to genocide um any politician even from the left doesn't dare now to talk against ER an attack on on Gaza and uh about human crisis in Gaza and this is going to change I believe in the next few days after the international media the international uh public opinion is going to change and Israel will be uh will turn from a victim to the aggressor so you're basically saying that the anger and hatred is so strong in Israel you can't even mention uh Palestinian civilians that have been killed is that right yeah absolutely uh there are couple of uh Brave journalist sites just gidon Levy in AR I can count them on one hand I wrote an article today in AR saying that what Israel needs is a peace cabinet rather than a war cabinet and mentioning the AR peace initiative that was uh endorsed again in in jeda a few months ago and uh uh people you should see the uh reaction the talkbacks I'm getting um you know there was a journalist today who was praying for the recovery of uh civilians both in Israel and in Gaza and he had uh to be helped out from his house by the police since he was harassed uh by rightwing gangsters W the the the Israeli emotions are are very clear that there is no room for peace now uh the Hamas is not looking for a two-state solution for Independence uh they are equal to to Isis and Israel on top of this has got a full clearance from theal International Community and F first and foremost for the United States to do what it takes in order to remove Hamas from us and even if this means uh I I would even say crime against humanity um the United States is looking at the Hamas and nowah as the aggressors the ultimate aggressors and Israel has the right to defend itself this is the message that the Israeli public is getting yeah well G given all of that and the fact that we've seen Netanyahu build the expectations and the case for war over the last few days I mean do do Israel's do do Israelis want to see a full invasion of Gaza yeah uh and this uh is uh really connected to your previous question Tom uh look previously in the previous rounds of uh escalation aggression in Gaza the U uh option of ground Invasion uh was just in very marginal uh corners of the Israeli public opinion and the experts now it's the opposite uh for the first time there is a consensus among the Israeli former generals who are many of them were protesting against Netanyahu just a few weeks ago and now the uh I I think that uh people are giving up the uh rational thinking and the thinking about what will happen the day after the ground Invasion what happens after Israel goes back to Gaza do we want to build more settlements in Gaza uh like we did until 2005 nobody is really getting answers to uh the question what will happen the day after we don't want to build a military government we don't H want to uh take the full responsibility of uh the uh two million people civilians Education Health Care you name it um so we have to uh think about you know the the International Community is not going to uh tolerate uh more aggression uh after what is happening now with uh pushing to another nakba we call it nakba number two what happened in 48 cannot happen again right I mean we've seen protests I believe uh they were yesterday against Netanyahu from family members Israeli family members that uh had uh families held captive by Hamas I mean how deep is the anger towards him and is there blame uh towards him and the government for allowing Hamas uh to I guess embarrass Israel uh like they did on Saturday yeah um there are more and more Israeli who are demanding to release the Israeli hostages just Tom remember how many Palestinian prisoners including murderers were released for one Israeli soldier who was held by the Islamic Jihad gilad Shalit the whole country was busy in demonstrating and protesting and demanding his release now think about maybe more than 100 Israelis including old people who cannot survive without their medication there are people who are 84 85 years old there are babies there and of course there is a growing pressure on the government the problem is that uh unlike in the the former rounds of uh aggression Israel was willing to negotiate uh through uh German negotiators facilitators through Egypt as far as I understand now nobody wants to talk to us Kamas is saying first of all Israel has to stop the air raid and uh to agree to ceasefire which Israel is not willing to hear about and there is and this is the Paradox on one hand Netanyahu doesn't have legitimacy he lost his legitimacy yeah see people are accusing him for the war on the other hand people trust him that he knows what he's doing which I don't okay well thank you so much for your time and your inside that is AA Elder a political analyst in Tel Aviv thank you
