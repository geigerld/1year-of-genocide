my name is I'm a mother of four children with the fifth due this month I feel aches and pains all the time my home was shelled and destroyed my children and I are living in this tent suffering from Fierce cold and hunger I can't afford to buy any clothes for my baby which is due soon and my home was new but we didn't have time to enjoy apart from my pregnancy I'm diabetic and also have high blood pressure since the war started I'm not able to get my medications by the grace of God my baby is alive and kicking and I hope he comes safe to this world I'm not able to follow up with any doctor like other pregnant women I don't have any source of income I can't afford to get anything for the baby that could be born anytime I rest my case with God and generous people I know I'm pregnant and not supposed to be exposed to smoke but as you can see I'm living in this plastic tent during this fiercely cold weather it is war and I am helpless smoke is harmful to me and the fetus too but it's nothing compared to This ferocious cold weather this is how I prepare food for my children and myself I don't have anything just one pan and one pot there is no food just some sugar I can wait but children can't he's a year and seven months old he's not eaten anything since morning just one piece of bread he's starving he wants to eat anything he can't sleep out of hunger and we don't have anything to offer children we're left to God's mercy make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
