it is 13 GMT that's 3 p.m. in Gaza just under an hour ago as we were speaking to our correspondent in Gaza an Israeli airay targeted positions right behind him striking residential buildings near the Kuwait Hospital in the southern city of Rafa four people were killed and dozens injured in the strike let's replay the moment the remaining population the area gets to be displaced and and this is the uh the Tred of every air strike causing more problem and forcing more Palestinian to displacement which can of course Mount the pressure uh on on on healthc Care Facility as well as evacuation Zone as we're we're getting into yes sir oh my god did you hear that oh my God that's the hospital that's the hospital that's the hospital oh my God are you guys hearing this are you guys hearing this all the debris oh my God no no no no this is really bad this is bad ah are you guys seeing this this is right behind the hospital right [Music] now oh my okay let me see let me see okay are you guys seeing yes say see this is a huge huge Dark Cloud of smoke this is what we were expecting for five days this drone did not leave the sky of this area flying at a low level and I think what it was marking a target of more residential homes people now are rushing to the site just to see if if there are people I guess we're we're looking at a a tragedy right now it's causing a chaos you see people are running away from from the side of of the explosion those were multiple massive air strikes right at the vicinity of the Kuwaiti Hospital you see people are panicking they can't even walk this is really get get this is really bad this is I you see people are rushing now down the road this is this is multiple multiple multiple residential homes and we we're hearing there were people inside those homes that were targeted there are home these were homes full of evacuees and displaced Palestinians at this particular location more than three residential homes completely destroyed you see this is this is exactly what we've been talking about there is no safe place in Gaza at all no safe place in Gaza no place more safe than the other even the vicinity of this hospital this a Smalls siiz Hospital become became a target of those Relentless air strikes that's exactly what we describe every word describing these air strikes being relentless aggressive and brutal hany Mahmud reporting to us there just an hour ago we're going to go back to Han who is live for us now in southern Gaza and Hanny it was a pretty frightening scene just over an hour ago uh to all of us watching this here in in the safety of of The Newsroom in Doha and I can only imagine uh what it was like for you and your team and everybody there just uh bring us up to date on on what's been happening since the last time we spoke yes H him just SL 50 minutes separates the first attack and the the second one just within the past five minutes another massive air strikes but at this time at this time right at the borderline that's further uh southern western side of RA City close to the Egyptian border which is not far from here we're talking about a 20 minutes to drive it from the location of the hospital but another major Relentless Mass bombardment with more than five five air strikes at one time happened uh right at the the the side the the West the the southern western side of raah city and only 50 minutes separates uh sep separates the first attack uh from the uh from the second uh one but the first attack as the everybody was watching live a we're talking about a mosque and a two residential buildings were completely destroyed with large number of people brought to the hospital in with the critical injuries we're talking about a little over 25 people with the critical injuries brought to the hospital and within just the past few minutes ambulances uh paramedics started transferring them to other uh medical centers and hospitals in rafah to a Nar hospital and to Gaza European hospital as they are midsize and larger size hospitals well equipped and better for medical uh medical intervention to save uh those who are are who can survive those Relentless air strikes but so far we're talking about four bodies were were taken from the hospital in a quick funeral procession to a nearby burial SES the Drone is still hovering at a low level over the this the sky of this area and keep circling it as it did within the past hour and within the past a few days constantly uh doing this which indicates there might be more more bombings going to happen as we've seen within the past hour and hannie um as we we've been saying uh where you are in southern Gaza is is already a very densely populated area of the because of so many Palestinians who've been displaced from their homes and forced to move uh South so there it just remind us again as you said there in your report a little bit earlier there really is no uh safe place uh in anywhere in Gaza right now certainly not Southern Gaza by the looks of it yes well not only there is no safety place but there is no we place to go right now now this is the last Point uh people have evacuated to after this we're talking about a whole new story going to happen people have no other choice if they are kept uh pushed into this area and squeeze under heavy bombardment people will we we don't have any other choice but to cross over uh to the Egyptian side which seems to be the Israeli strategy and tactic to keep pushing and squeezing displ Palestinian at this particular area and it's also very consistent with what people have expressed all the past weeks the frustration and the anger that they had at the Israeli narrative that is that had been largely a very vague contradictory and confusing when it when it came when it comes down to a designated safe area because what we just seen in the past hour has proven unequivocally that there is no safe place and the whole narrative about about evacuation zones and and areas that people could move to to avoid getting bombed in the central part or the northern part of Gaza is largely false and has been proven inaccurate as people particularly displaced Palestinians in the southern part have been largely the victims of those unpredictable Fallen bombs on their homes not only killing them but destroying the the very shelters that they took as a refuge targeting every means of life in here gradually ra turn into a large refugee camp but more more profound is becoming a death zone right now as people who are displaced and hungry and thirsty and traumatized are getting bombed and torn into pieces one person just described the scene near the the side of the two residential homes and the mark that were targeted at ear earlier at this hour he removed the flesh from a wall across the moth that was the MOs that was destroyed somebody ran over the rooftop of another residential home picked up body parts that were thrown into the rooftop this is the intensity the brutality of those air strikes and largely we're talking about the most of the the majority of the injuries who came to the hospital are all women and children it just watching those Fallen BMS and hearing the the frightening sound of it is so scary just imagine what it does what it does to small bodies of the children and and weak body of of women here yep unimaginable scenes there appreciate all of your uh reporting uh and your team still bringing more more injuries Hy uh we're going to stay with this a little bit because looks like there's more activity right now more ambulances uh going in uh to that scene where where those explosions occurred just over an hour ago just talk us through some of some of what we're seeing more ambulances and paramedics are bringing back injuries from the side of the the target of at earlier at the the the past hour at the vicinity of the Kuwaiti hospital we uh talking about a mosque and two residential homes were targeted completely destroyed with five massive bombs but just within the past 10 minutes another massive multiple air strikes took place at the southern western side of rafah City that's very close to the Egyptian borders and those ambulance are bringing more injuries from that side uh of the targets we're trying to get more uh uh updates on the number of people who were injured in that a in that massive air strikes and the number of people who who have been killed and there we we soon enough we're going to be getting into inside the hospital and get more updates and numbers of the people people who have arrived to the hospital either in ambulance or as we seen earlier they're brought pieces and in blankets hany we're going to leave it there for now thank you hany RAF hany Mahmud
