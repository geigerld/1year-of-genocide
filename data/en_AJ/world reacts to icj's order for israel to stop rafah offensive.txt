Reed Brody is a war crimes prosecutor and author of the book to catch a dictator and he's joining us live from New York thank you very much for your time Mr Brody uh your reaction firstly to the Court's ruling and what you've heard well I think this this is just huge um the the the icj has really stepped up uh to confront the reality of the escalation uh in in in the Gaza Strip I mean these are very specific orders um you know stop the offensive in Rafa open the Rafa border crossing allow in fact finding missions there's not a lot of wiggle room here um I I'm really impressed well first of all by South Africa's tenacity uh and perseverance in keeping coming back to the court in holding their feet to the fire and saying this is not enough this is no longer good and the court has responded and responded almost unanimously including all of the western judges um on the court um who have really been as as as radical as as as reality I mean South Africa has been asking since day one for an order for for Israel to stop its military very offensive the court has always said well you know we can't do that because uh you're because Hamas because palestin is not before this court we cannot only order one side to stand down and that's what they have finally chosen to do here um and it's a testament to uh uh this court it's a testament to South Africa um and it does I think together with the decision uh by the ICC prosecutor earlier this week it it is a real one two legal punch that's really interesting of course the international criminal court and the international court of justice are separate but can they influence what the other is doing oh I have no doubt I I I don't know how much the the this court has been influenced by the IC um but I I do feel like the ICC has been the prosecutor has been uh influenced I mean we have you know the the the the question of Palestine has been on the desk of three successive ICC prosecutors for 15 years and no one wanted to really uh bite the bullet and do something even this prosecutor um who came in uh you there was a lot of speculation I was with him at the uh ICC assembly in in December uh I've seen his uh body his his his rhetoric and many people felt he would not do anything that this was a red l i mean the I the political constellation at the ICC and the icj is different and it was always assumed that there was a red line that the prosecutor of the ICC would not cross and that was indicting an Israeli official and I think it's the the the the continued Onslaught by Israel the international consensus around the criminality of Israel's activities but also this case before the other court before the icj um in which the icj has been saying that South Africa essentially has a case to answer that Israel has a case to answer on genocide that made it untenable for the ICC prosecutor not to act Mr bro do you think that that continuing Onslaught by Israel that you mention that the latest orders by the international court of justice can have an impact because since the international court of justice ordered the first set of provisional measures in January Israel has killed more than 15,000 civilians in Gaza so does the latest ruling put more pressure on Israel and more importantly does it put more pressure pressure on the United States I think that I think that's what it does I mean Israel has not been impressed with anything that the icj judges have done yet but I think it's to the rest of the world um uh who now have in front of them very specific this is not a question of are you doing are you behaving are you not behaving are you um complying I mean the first ruling was comply with the genocide convention uh allow humanitarian Aid the second ruling was Stronger ensure humanitarian things but this is very specific you are or you are not stopping your military offensive you are or you are are not opening the RAF of Crossing you are or are not allowing in fact finding missions and and and the like and I think that this put puts obviously the United States uh uh in a very very difficult position this the US judge voted for these measures uh all the US judges I mean again these judges are elected in their personal capacity they're among the most distinguished jurists in the world but it is indicative that all of the western judges uh voted for these measures Mr Brody I want to go go back to one uh point that you made at the beginning of the interview where you said that the orders are so clear they leave no wiggle room but I do want to speak to you ask you you know because you are a war crimes prosecutor you have so much experience about the wording of the most important order which is that Israel has to immediately halt its military offensive any other action which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part could Israel argue that its operations in Gaza don't bring about the destruction of the Palestinian people you know I I I actually haven't seen where the commas to be honest I haven't seen where the commas are in that sentence and and and and what does um stop immediately halt its military offensive in the rafid government and other and other actions which uh May create these conditions and I don't know whether that which create these conditions modifies halt all your military actions right or other actions so I don't I don't want to answer that without seeing where the commas are in that sentence okay Mr Brody we will be speaking to you over the next few hours so we'll give you time to get your head around the exact wording of that for now that is war crimes prosecutor Reed bro thank you now let's get more on this with hindel in Al balah in central Gaza uh H has there been any reaction yet to this very significant orders from the international court of justice especially pertaining to Rafa and the situation in Rafa well unfortunately there is no reaction because most of the people here where I am right now do not have any connection to the internet or to any cause only journalists are well aware of what's happening again people here in the Gaza Strip are currently striving to feed themselves to find clean water to drink uh to find a spot to live after the continuous displacement so people are not very well aware of what's going on they're asking journalists and they're knocking our doors and asking us if there's anything positive but uh actually we're waiting a little bit to see what this uh is going to turn out we really don't want to tell people news and to to give them hope because we have been uh witnessing a couple of times where we told them uh positive news but it turned out like no it's not so we're waiting a little bit to tell people uh the situation in rafah is very intense um there has been carpet bombing for uh a couple of residential areas in Al shabura refugee camp in the central draah uh according to our sources there they said that a couple of injuries made it to the Kuwaiti hospital but again alaiti hospital is a very small medical point they do not have icus they do not have uh um they only have a couple of beds and they do not have a lot of doctors uh because most of the doctors uh were uh evacuated to the middle area so the situation is uh still uh uh um escalating uh the Israeli tanks are expanding their land incursion and they are only 400 m away from Al naar Hospital in Rafa um our sources are telling us that air strikes did not stop artillery shelling did not stop and we are also talking about 2 800,000 Palestinians that evacuated from rafah to um the middle area andun in the past couple of weeks when the Israeli forces ordered Palestinians to evacuate but there there are at least 300,000 Palestinians still till this point in Rafa and judge Salam of the president of mentioned exactly those numbers when issuing those provisional orders for Israel to stop its military operation in Rafa where you are H what is happening at alaka hospital behind you because we've heard UNICEF say that the lives of more than 20 newborns at that hospital are threatened because oxygen will stop as not enough fuel is delivered well it was a very hard night for Al OA hospital last night all of this building turned off because the hospital ran out of fuel but uh uh thanks God um the World Health Organization gave uh the AL AXA Hospital 15,000 L of fuel but unfortunately these this number is only um it fuels up the hospital for 4 days only because the hospital needs at least 4,000 lers per day where we're talking about hundreds of of uh kidney dialysis patients who made it all the way from Rafa to uh ala Hospital we're talking about more than 700 uh patients that are receiving their dialysis treatment every single day we're talking about premature babies we're talking about people connected to the oxygen machines we're talking about surgeries where every single day multiple and dozens of injuries make it to Ala hospital after they have been uh targeted by the Israeli forces airri uh this is the one of the only uh hospitals still standing on uh uh it its feet and if anything happens if we they don't have consistent fuel there's going to be a dire situation in the middle area in the Gaza City and thank you very much for that hindel live in Al Bala let's bring in Imran Khan now a reminder to our viewers that Prim Minister Benjamin netanyahu's government has banned Al jaaz in Israel which is why we are reporting from the Jordanian C am man Imran I hear that you've already seen some reaction from Israel to the ruling that's right what we're hearing from diplomatic s sources to Israeli Channel 13 uh the TV channel uh prime minister Netanyahu is going to convene an emergency meeting in that meeting uh will be the foreign minister Israel Katz war minister Benny Gant and the government's judicial advisor that's how seriously they're taking this ruling but the first reaction has actually come from uh the Finance Minister Beth Del smartr uh one of the governing one of the members of the hard right part of the Coalition he says the state of Israel is at War for its own existence in sad times in history we could not stand on our own today the Jewish people have the independence and ability to protect our lives it's a lengthy statement but he ends with um we continue to fight for ourselves in the entire free world history will judge the who today stood by the Nazis of Hamas and Isis now we're also hearing from political sources uh speaking to local media in Israel um they're being told that Israel is not going to respond uh to the decision of the Court uh both politically or militarily it's already holding uh under the table talks with America uh those talks have been ongoing since this decision was about to take place and they expect Washington to veto the resolution all right Imran thank you for that
