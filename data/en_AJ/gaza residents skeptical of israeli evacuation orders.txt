I'm currently standing on a rashed street a couple of meters away from Wadi Gazza the last point that separates the north of Gaza Strip and the south of the Gaza Strip where it has been separated a couple of months ago where Israeli forces called this a safe Corridor and it's the only Corridor and it's the only Road for people to evacuate from the north to to the South it has been a tough night on the Gaza Strip where there has been endless Israeli raids on refug camps in several areas across the Gaza Strip since the morning the Palestinians in Gaza Strip in shewan neighborhood in alwa neighborhood and in the middle of the Gaza City have been warned on their iPhones and their phones uh they received messages to evacuate from those areas to DAR balah but as you see no one showed up we are surprised that people did not um do what the Israeli Army um asked them to evacuate but at the end of the day people in the Gaza Strip now acknowledge the fact that the Israeli forces are asking them to go to Safe areas and then these safe areas turn into a war zone we're talking about people who have been called to evacuate to kanun to evacuate to ra toat and to all the southern areas as you see people do not trust what the Israeli forces tell them and no one Evac uated just like the Israeli forces requested them this is hind Gaza
