Geneva Margaret for more than 25 years I
 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.350 align:start position:0%
Geneva Margaret for more than 25 years I
believe<00:03:23.280><c> the</c><00:03:23.400><c> Gaza</c><00:03:23.680><c> Strip</c><00:03:23.959><c> was</c><00:03:24.159><c> polio</c><00:03:24.640><c> free</c>

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
believe the Gaza Strip was polio free
 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.550 align:start position:0%
believe the Gaza Strip was polio free
then<00:03:25.760><c> just</c><00:03:26.040><c> last</c><00:03:26.280><c> week</c><00:03:26.599><c> polio</c><00:03:26.959><c> was</c><00:03:27.159><c> detected</c>

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 align:start position:0%
then just last week polio was detected
 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.190 align:start position:0%
then just last week polio was detected
in<00:03:28.000><c> in</c><00:03:28.239><c> six</c><00:03:28.599><c> out</c><00:03:28.760><c> of</c><00:03:29.000><c> seven</c><00:03:29.360><c> routine</c><00:03:29.879><c> sewage</c>

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
in in six out of seven routine sewage
 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.390 align:start position:0%
in in six out of seven routine sewage
samples<00:03:30.560><c> I</c><00:03:30.640><c> mean</c><00:03:30.840><c> we</c><00:03:30.959><c> know</c><00:03:31.159><c> in</c><00:03:31.280><c> war</c><00:03:31.519><c> scenarios</c>

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
samples I mean we know in war scenarios
 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.390 align:start position:0%
samples I mean we know in war scenarios
it<00:03:32.599><c> creates</c><00:03:33.000><c> the</c><00:03:33.159><c> environment</c><00:03:33.680><c> for</c><00:03:33.879><c> polio</c><00:03:34.239><c> to</c>

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
it creates the environment for polio to
 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.309 align:start position:0%
it creates the environment for polio to
spread<00:03:34.760><c> but</c><00:03:35.080><c> where</c><00:03:35.239><c> did</c><00:03:35.400><c> it</c><00:03:35.560><c> come</c>

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
spread but where did it come
 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.550 align:start position:0%
spread but where did it come
from<00:03:38.319><c> so</c><00:03:38.640><c> basically</c><00:03:39.480><c> it</c><00:03:39.760><c> comes</c><00:03:40.200><c> from</c>

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
from so basically it comes from
 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.390 align:start position:0%
from so basically it comes from
somebody's<00:03:41.360><c> gut</c><00:03:42.360><c> uh</c><00:03:42.560><c> that's</c><00:03:42.680><c> what</c><00:03:42.840><c> the</c><00:03:43.000><c> sewage</c>

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
somebody's gut uh that's what the sewage
 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.350 align:start position:0%
somebody's gut uh that's what the sewage
samples<00:03:43.879><c> tell</c><00:03:44.159><c> us</c><00:03:44.519><c> that</c><00:03:45.120><c> at</c><00:03:45.319><c> least</c><00:03:46.080><c> quite</c><00:03:46.239><c> a</c>

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 align:start position:0%
samples tell us that at least quite a
 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.670 align:start position:0%
samples tell us that at least quite a

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
few people because those samples were
 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.670 align:start position:0%
few people because those samples were

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
from hunis and from Dera Bala and it was
 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.670 align:start position:0%
from hunis and from Dera Bala and it was

six of seven as you've correctly
 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.470 align:start position:0%
six of seven as you've correctly
reported<00:03:54.680><c> so</c><00:03:54.959><c> that</c><00:03:55.480><c> means</c><00:03:56.000><c> that</c><00:03:56.959><c> probably</c>

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
reported so that means that probably
 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.949 align:start position:0%
reported so that means that probably
more<00:03:57.720><c> than</c><00:03:57.879><c> one</c><00:03:58.280><c> person</c><00:03:58.840><c> now</c><00:03:59.120><c> does</c><00:03:59.400><c> have</c><00:03:59.599><c> the</c>

Margaret<00:04:18.959><c> so</c><00:04:19.280><c> there</c><00:04:19.400><c> are</c><00:04:19.759><c> different</c><00:04:20.120><c> strains</c>

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
Margaret so there are different strains
 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.629 align:start position:0%
Margaret so there are different strains
of<00:04:20.880><c> polio</c><00:04:21.320><c> I</c><00:04:21.639><c> understand</c><00:04:21.919><c> this</c><00:04:22.160><c> particular</c>

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
of polio I understand this particular
 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.870 align:start position:0%
of polio I understand this particular

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
strain that's been found is vaccine
 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.350 align:start position:0%
strain that's been found is vaccine
derived<00:04:25.360><c> polio</c><00:04:26.120><c> can</c><00:04:26.240><c> you</c><00:04:26.440><c> explain</c><00:04:27.040><c> that</c><00:04:27.199><c> for</c>

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
derived polio can you explain that for
 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.830 align:start position:0%
derived polio can you explain that for
us<00:04:27.600><c> what</c><00:04:27.759><c> and</c><00:04:27.919><c> what</c><00:04:28.040><c> that</c><00:04:28.199><c> might</c><00:04:28.479><c> potentially</c>

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
us what and what that might potentially
 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.749 align:start position:0%
us what and what that might potentially
mean<00:04:29.000><c> for</c><00:04:29.199><c> spread</c><00:04:29.520><c> to</c>

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 align:start position:0%
mean for spread to
 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:33.590 align:start position:0%
mean for spread to
too<00:04:31.759><c> so</c><00:04:31.960><c> it's</c><00:04:32.160><c> actually</c><00:04:32.360><c> a</c><00:04:32.600><c> variant</c><00:04:33.240><c> that's</c>

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
too so it's actually a variant that's
 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.390 align:start position:0%

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
off we do a big vaccination um response
 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.510 align:start position:0%
off we do a big vaccination um response
to<00:04:55.560><c> and</c><00:04:55.759><c> that</c><00:04:56.160><c> usually</c><00:04:56.960><c> shuts</c><00:04:57.360><c> it</c><00:04:57.600><c> down</c><00:04:58.280><c> so</c>
