un's Top Court is set to rule on a request for Germany to Halt military aid to Israel the case was filed by Nicaragua which argues that Berlin is failing to prevent genocide or uphold International humanitarian law it's the latest case involving Israel before the international court of justice South Africa approached the court in December accusing Israel of committing genocide and then the US has found five Israeli military units responsible for gross human rights violations in the occupied West Bank this is the first time Washington has reached such a conclusion now these incidents took place before the war on Gaza in October despite the findings the state department said the units have not been sanctioned paty cohain explains for weeks we've been waiting for the US state department to announce the results of its investigation into whether certain units in Israel's Defense Forces committed gross violations of human rights the reason is the secret Secretary of State himself Anthony Lincoln said earlier this month that he had made the determination now this is important because if it is found that these certain units violated human rights there's laws inside the United States it says no US military aid can go to those units while we now know it's unlikely to happen four of these units have effectively remediated these violations which is what we expect Partners to do um it is uh consistent with uh what we expect all countries whom with we have a security relationship the deputy spokesman here at the state department was repeatedly pressed on this issue and he just simply wouldn't answer the questions such as what exactly were the gross violations of human rights what units were involved exactly how did Israel remediate the situation and what kind of information Israel provided again he simply wouldn't say padal h Al jazer at the state department let's go to Stephanie deer joining us now from occupied East Jerusalem so we've known for at least a couple of days now that Washington is considering the imposition of sanctions on this uh Israeli military Battalion accused of abuses against Palestinians tell us more about this military unit and their alleged activities yes this came out last week the NSA Yehuda Battalion they are an Ultra orthod Ox Battalion a lot of the soldiers there actually live in the occupied West Bank um last week when we covered it uh the Americans had said that they would be sanctioning this particular unit this unit was moved out of the West Bank in 2022 when the incident happened one of the incidents um believed to be part of the charges is that they killed a 78-year-old Palestinian American juel citizen they bounded him gagged him and left him to die in subfreezing temperatures in the occupied West Bank now you were mentioning there four other battalions they haven't been named uh but you were talking about uh you heard Patty there questioning what allegations this all came to light uh with an investigation and an article proa um it's an American Body did just a couple of weeks ago they have a few of the allegations including the 78-year-old Palestinian American that I mentioned but they also accused the Border Police this is not part of the army but it is part of the security forces saying EX judicial killings by the Border Police and then one other allegation they mention these are the only three that in that interrogators tortured and raped a teenager accused of throwing Molotov cocktail so the bigger picture is this um you heard there from Patty they believe that four of the units have remediated meaning they're now fine and they will continue to receive military aid the NS Yuda Battalion last week wasn't going to receive military aid now they've given Israel more time to look into it also why because of the massive backlash at the time if you have Israel's biggest allly it's biggest supplier of military aid actually recognizing in a way that its security forces are responsible for gross human rights violations against the Palestinians something that the Palestinians will tell you happens on a daily basis uh there's been massive backlash the Israeli Prime Minister saying that he would fight any sanctions personally you had the ministry of Defense you had really across the political spectrum because you simply do not criticize the Army in Israel so I think significantly certainly that this is now being highlighted that the American recommendations is that some of these should be shankton but interesting as you heard from Patty is that US Secretary of State uh blinken had been sitting on this report since December uh and so far really nothing has been done about it thank you very much Stephanie Decker let's now bring in Salman shik he's the founder of the peace building organization the Shea group and a former un official and it's important to bear in mind that there has been a long running History of Violence Against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank but this has seen a sharp acceleration since October the the involvement of this particular Battalion precedes October and it seems as though Washington is going in the direction of uh not imposing sanctions as far as we know well it's part of a pattern that we've seen where the United States and the Administration have provided cover and made excuses for the actions of prime minister netanyahu's government and those of the Israeli Army um on the ground that cannot hold the walls are closing in international law has to be administered otherwise we will see the event of particularly Joe Biden but also Western countries effectively cannibalizing international law and the rules-based international order which they themselves set up after the horrors of the second world war tell me hasn't that already happened well yes uh of course we have ample evidence and those who have committed those grave violations of international humanitarian law whether they are Hamas or other Palestinian groups but also the Israeli Army where they have been disproportionate from the start in terms of their operations but of course as you said this has happened for a very long time this cannot continue and you know the rest of the world as I go through diplomatic offices and and capitals around the world everyone knows that there is a there is now a grave situation and it's probably again the Biden Administration coming back to your original question which can turn us away from from where we are right now and in terms of the Grave situation it seems as though we are seeing countries in the developing world in the global South but are are taking measures to try and push back against it we were just mentioning that Nicaragua had initiated proceedings against Germany this was back in in March they were going to see some uh progress on that today accusing Berlin of facilitating genocide in Gaza by providing support to Israel how important is this case not just for Gaza but for any state that manufactures uh and supplies weapons that are ultimately used to commit violations of uh International humanitarian law well it should be of grave concern to Berlin it should be of grave concern to the German chancellory um because it's something which I believe is a part of a pattern which we'll continue to see we've seen how South Africa originally initiated the the case in the icj against Israel and now we see uh Nicaragua and the global South which we need as part of a of an alliance in the changing geopolitics of the globe is no longer accepting that and it is the reason why I think uh European capitals and Washington again have to think really hard about their actions including the supply of Weaponry um to the Israeli Army offensive weaponry and which is now also reflected in their campuses of University that I myself have seen in Paris or in Washington but I suppose in recognizing that uh these crimes are taking place given Washington's incredible financial and uh military support for Israel that there that then there would be some sort of recognition that uh they too are complicit in what is happening well they would implicate themselves well this is the case being made by Americans it's the case being made by Germans or other Europeans and it's being made by those younger people particularly in the United States who do matter we have a 1968 moment in my view going on right now and you remember what happened in 1968 the democratic convention was held in Chicago in August well it's going to happen again this year in 196 this year in 2024 and if this war does not stop if we don't then start to rebuild Gaza and allow the population to um uh to be able to go back to their homes as well as to hold accountable those who have been part of the Grave violations of international humanitarian law which have taken place then I fear that President Biden is going to meet the same fate um that uh the Democrats did then in 1968 when they lost the election and the in terms of the significance of is happening you mentioned the student protest and perhaps something we've not seen before is that we now see teachers and professors that are prepared to get involved who was facing disciplinary action and in some cases sacrificing uh reputations and careers uh in order to take us down does that surprise you not entirely no um I think not something we've seen before perhaps well it's the weight of evidence um of course we've seen it in the past in terms of other protest movements I myself was leading the anti-apartheid group in my university in the 1990s and 2000s um but uh but you know it's it's a particularly heightened situation now I think back to when I used to visit Professor Edward S in Columbia University when I was working for the UN when I was actually working for the UN Middle East peace en boy and he always said that you cannot hold truth back and that is what we're seeing now
