has Israel achieved its objectives by launching Wars on Gaza for decades it has bombed the strip and laid Siege to Palestinians there now it's carrying out yet another war on a scale never seen before but will it serve Israel's purposes this is Inside Story [Music] hello welcome to the program I'm Tom McCrae Israeli troops have entered Gaza from its north and east and intense fighting is being reported between Israeli soldiers and Hamas Fighters that's as the strip is being continuously bombarded so far more than 8,300 Palestinians have been killed with that number Rising all the time this is not the first time Israel has launched a military offensive in the territory this this is its fifth since 2007 protests are being held around the world in support of the Palestinians and many fear the conflict could spread through the region and Beyond so is peace possible and what does Israel seek to gain from its unprecedented war on Gaza there's plenty to discuss with our guests but first this report by Sara Gill that looks at Israel's military actions and the history behind them Balls of Fire have lit up the sky above Gaza every night since October the 7th but a Communications blackout followed by one of Israel's most ferocious bombardments laid the foundations of its ground Invasion Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he will not give demands for a ceasefire just as the United States would not agree to a ceasefire after the bombing of Pearl Harbor or after the terrorist attack of 911 Israel will not agree to a cation of hostilities with after the horrific attacks of October 7th calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas to surrender to terrorism to surrender to barbarism that will not happen Israel first occupied the Gaza Strip in 1967 and has held a tight grip ever since in 2005 it disengaged ordering Jewish settlers to leave but it has kept control of the lives of Palestinians ever since and in 2007 it imposed a blockade of land air and sea after Hamas took control of the territory from fata since 2008 Israel has repeatedly launched attacks on the densely populated area today Israeli tanks have been seen on one of the main roads in Gaza linking the North and South they are believed to be preparing to divide the strip Hamas says its Fighters are battling Israeli forces but for people who live in Gaza they say nowhere is safe we're in constant fear constant pomping we we hear the sounds all the time day and night we go to bed in fear we hug each other when we don't know if we going to wake up or not this is the fifth cycle of violence in Gaza in recent years and it's even led to increased fighting between Israeli forces and Hezbollah on the border between Lebanon and Israel it's fueling fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East and possibly Beyond many are questioning Israel's motives and what it may gain and lose by waging this unprecedented war on Gaza SAR Gil for Inside okay let's bring in our guests now in Tel Aviv is Michael Harari policy fellow at The midf Institute a political Think Tank he is also the former Israeli ambassador to Cyprus and the former counselor for political Affairs at the Embassy of Israel in the United Kingdom in Cairo is Sara Kira founder and director of European North African Center of research and in London is Shashank Joshi the defense editor with the economists thank you all very much for being uh with us here on Inside Story Michael if I could please begin with you Israel's stated goal is to wipe out hamas's both a militant group and a political force inside Gaza how realistic is that from from an Israeli point of view well it's going to be quite difficult very difficult I mean actually but I think it becomes clear now now after October the 7th that this is what should be done let's say I think it becomes clear in Israel for all Israelis because previous to that I mean we had different kind of views or different kind of perceptions that we may be able to deter Hamas etc etc and I think it it is quite clear for the international and Regional Arena to be honest I mean it's quite impressive the support for the Israeli let's say operation right now not a a I mean and not confuse ourself let's say between the support of not enabling Hamas any achievement not enabling Iran any achievement and of course the Deep concern about the humanitarian situation so I I think it is going to be very difficult absolutely but but it's quite realistic to be honest okay Sarah do you think that at this point in time that Israel has a long-term plan when it comes to an extended War well uh I don't think Israel can uh take on a very long War uh especially that it's um it's losing its diplomatic ties it's losing its normalization steps it's losing Decades of soft diplomacy and integration in the region today with this hostile act Israel is making everything difficult for itself not for anyone else it's not realistic at all because the country it Israel as a state in this region cannot practice this um this kind of practices especially that it's trying to be integrated it's trying to win over neighbors so it it doesn't look realistic to lose Decades of diplomacy isn't it shash do you think that Israel has potentially bagged itself into a bit of a corner here by saying so early on after October the 7th that it was going to decimate Hamas with a huge ground invasion was going to completely overwhelm it do you think that now it could be potentially perceived as being weak if it doesn't follow through on those threats that it made so early on here yes I should say Israel never committed to a full-scale ground Invasion but it did commit to the destruction of Hamas and I think that that is a risk that it finds itself unable to do so in a reasonable time frame and it is worth remembering here that almost every previous ground invasion of Gaza has been roughly in the region of two weeks we're now seeing Israeli officials talk about a war that may last for a few months but if you think about the extent of hamas's network inside Gaza the fact that they have been running Gaza formally for 16 years but of course their influence inside the strip goes back a long way before that uh this is going to be an exceptionally difficult military job and unless they can buy themselves The Diplomatic space to conduct military operations in Gaza probably for years to come I think it's it's not going to be realistic that they can completely eliminate hamas's military and political presence and therefore you will be back to some kind of situation in which they will be containing and managing hamas's presence rather than having destroyed it altogether at the end Michael what's your response to that is is there an appetite uh for war for for a full invasion is there a thirst for Revenge within Israel and do you think that that is clouding any judgment uh in terms of the the the consequences of having a long drawn out War I I I fully understand of course these question marks I mean I share most of them if not all of them what I'm saying is that this is a different situation this is not as the round of violence that we had in the last few few few years every year and or or or two years let's say this is a different situation I think it this is why I emphasize that nowadays it is very clear to Israel that this is what what it has to do now it's going to be not a I mean a long process but I I don't think it's going to take let's say months or years I mean I I don't I don't let's say accept any given statement by whoever let's say yes it is correct as Sarah said that diplomatically Israel needs to keep its room to maneuver up to now almost a month after let's say the barbaric attacks by Hamas to be honest I am still impressed by the let's say support strategic support of the region itself as well with a lot of tension a lot of pressure domestically in each Arab country let's say and of course public opinion let's say in the region and out of the region a a concern of the situation but there is a clear understanding again for the necessity to top Hamas now will it will we succeed I think it's realistic but I'm not sure we will succeed no I cannot I cannot guarantee a a success but it is a common it is a common I would say goal for too many actors in the region and out of the region okay I just want to bring in uh a a little bit more on this when we talk about the ground Invasion because before Israeli troops entered Gaza I spoke with David Petraeus a former director of the US Central Intelligence Agency about the risks that come with a ground Invasion here's what he had to say about that what would be an extraordinarily challenging scenario it's hard to appreciate in fact how difficult this would be we've Des described it as fishlyn add in a an enemy who's willing to kill himself to take uh Israelis with them a movement that as you know is founded on the idea of destroying Israel and killing Jews as we saw uh Saturday over a week ago with the horrific murder barbaric actions of over 1,300 Israelis uh this would be a very very challenging Mission keep in mind that it took the Iraqi security forces nine months uh to clear a similar uh city mosul of the Islamic State other terrorist elements obviously extremists with support of the US the Israelis are much better they have a lot more capability well that's clearly someone who knows a lot about ground invasions having been involved in the US uh invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan she militarily how difficult is this going to be for the Israeli troops to to try and take Northern Gaza with the extensive tunnel Network that Hamas has got there well the answer is very difficult and just to give you a sense of why let's reflect on the fact that in 2014 during operation protective Edge the last major Israel Gaza conflict the IDF as I understand it took out about 32 kilm of Hamas tunnels as I understand it there's about 1300 kilm of those tunnels across Gaza so that gives you an indication of how difficult that is we can also compare this to other comparable Urban conflicts and if you look at the Coalition effort to try to remove Islamic State from mosul back in 2016 2017 that was a nine-month campaign uh on the ground preceded by uh many months prior to that of air strikes that still uh incurred uh it costus very heavy civilian casualties and it was conducted using a ground force of Iraqi units um who were able to benefit from Western intelligence and Western drones and Western airow this is going to be a different kind of campaign it's going to be a different campaign um because the IDF will have to do it itself the IDF is a conscript Army of course a large number of those who've been mobilized are not regular professionals and it will have to do this on an accelerated timetable much more quickly than the Coalition was able to do in musul so all in all um this is going to be difficult even in relation to all of these extremely difficult Urban campaigns of fuja ramadi mosul and others even by those standards it will be difficult Sarah we've all seen the the civilian cost already in in the in the weeks since October the 7th that is clearly only going to become worse once a full ground invasion is underway isn't it full ground invasion is totally a breach to humanity that that's how exactly we see it first of all we refuse the comparison of Islamic state to Hamas even if some of the countries the Arab countries are not getting along with Hamas but the comparison here is rejected especially because this is a resistance group we call hamus a resistance group because they fight for the civilians of Gaza that's how we see it even now all the Arab people who were against Hamas now they are revolving around them who did you think did that I think the Israeli Prime Minister did that he enforced Iran and ham in the region it doesn't have to be the fault of civilians today it doesn't have to fall on the expense of four 4,000 little kids it doesn't have to be that way we don't have to see the scener okay if Israel has more uh uh uh uh aspiration in expanding in the region that's also rejected evacuating the people from a land a territory that is theirs already but under the colonization of Israel so that should be respected because there is international law in that part to protect civilians and to protect Israel's right and to protect the neighbors right but Israel first has to draw its borders in order not to face this kind of conflicts again in the region this region doesn't need Israel should have focused on the Iranian actions in the region and try to like protect itself yes yeah Michael complicating this even further is the fact that there's more than 200 Israeli captives being held by Hamas somewhere uh in Gaza I mean do you think that that uh that's a priority for Israel I know a lot of family members of those being housed are outraged that not more has been done this is a priority for is but it only emphasize the complexity of the situation I said day before yesterday in different interview that the families of the hostages should do their job to exert as much pressure as possible over the government and the government should do its job in order to release them still for our discussion it complicates very much love the operation in Gaza how do you deal with the your duty to release them and to dismal Hamas I want but please to comment on General peto's let's say comment that you brought yes I think that Israel made that it does not want to reoccupy the whole Gaza stre Israel did not say that it is having let's say full ground operation it did not say so in my opinion it means that this process which will be let's say long I have no idea how long it takes will be reexamined by the developments on the ground and one more point the aim or let's say is what Israel is trying to do is to exert pressure as much as possible over Hamas by distinguishing it from the Palestinian people in Gaza street are we successful doing doing it not not not fully SU uccessful I'm aware of there so many civilian casualties let's say in Gaz let's say in Gaza stre but but basically this is Israeli policy now I am fully aware and fully understandable let's say to the pro Palestinian solidarity feeling all over the region but please don't don't make mistakes it's just final statement there's a distinction between solidarity with the Palestinian people and let's say against Hamas sorry understood shank as we saw on October the 7th uh Israel's military and intelligence had a massive failure some said that they were even embarrassed by how easy it was for Hamas uh to go across the border do you think that Israel's Army has been overestimated and on the other side of that do you think that a ground offense uh actually plays into hamas's hands because obviously it doesn't have tanks or any war planes but it can fight Street to Street Building to building tunnel to Tunnel yes first of all I think that all all countries are at risk of intelligence failures it does happen to all countries it happened to the United States on 911 uh it has happened to European countries with terrorism in the last last 5 to 10 years um even Ukraine itself was surprised by the Russian attack having discounted American intelligence um but it is nevertheless the case that the Israel Defense Forces Remain the most technologically sophisticated and well-trained Armed Force in the Middle East you may like them you may despise them but that's that's a professional assessment about their proficiency on the ground but nonetheless I think you're absolutely right to say that certain types of invasions can play into the hands of Hamas um the aim of terrorism and not withstanding my colleagues reference to Hamas as resistance group the aim of terrorism is the Strategic use of violence it is sometimes designed to provoke a response that can worsen conditions for civilians in an area by dragging an Army in uh and by uh creating political conditions that favor the terrorist organization that is what we saw from Al-Qaeda it's what we have seen from other groups and it could be what we see from Hamas so while my view is uh no Armed Force in the world could stand by after the kind of Massacre that we saw on October 7th and it is entirely understandable that Israel needs to weaken and degrade Hamas so that it cannot repeat that kind of Massacre um if it were to be sucked into Gaza in an open-ended occupation I think that the risk as we have seen in some previous Israeli conflicts like that in Lebanon in the 1980s is that it creates political conditions that may perversely favor Hamas and I think no Israeli official would really seek that no indeed so there's also a risk of this spreading Beyond Gaza and Israel isn't there because there's been a lot of talk about contagion about this being break breaking out into a wider War Iran Hezbollah and now potentially Yemen getting more and more involved how bigger concern is that that's what nobody wants that's what no country or state in this region of the world helps for but that's it's it's it's really weird how uh the West sees things or Israel's part and our part we see that there is a lot of Injustice here Gaza was under siege and then there is some political dispute in Israel and then all of this Revenge comes out on the Gaza people just after Hamas operation against uh uh uh the Israeli government which was an operation that is not equal to such huge Invasion and no one wants it to be a regional War taking more of of our resources more of people's lives no one wants that but that that fear might come if it continues like that because no one can know if will when would they get involved and we kind of know that they kind of eager for it okay so let's help build peace and not drag this region down to to to more fire and bring fire I'm I don't know what what are we waiting for more involvement from other countries and and and and uh to save who to save the Israel prime minister to save who on the expense of people it doesn't make any sense on the expense of of human lives so is Israel as a state as people that we do respect people and humankind everywhere should get done with that and with their government and I say that yeah okay Michael just after all the fighting has finished does Israel actually have a plan for what happens next does it want to occupy Gaza does it want to try and displace the millions of people that will still be occupying that land I think just I think to to put it as clear as as possible i' say this is not an invasion this is a military operation and as I said before this but what happens next what happens after The Invasion yes yes yes absolutely absolutely yes I think if it is successful enough let's say then it should be possible to top Hamas Authority and to replace it with the legitimate address of the Palestinian people clearly it will need a transitional period clearly it will need Regional and international let's say involvement so and hopefully we can we can we can reach this point but I want to H mention one more word about the lack of peace process the Israel understands now tragically okay that lack of peace process L lack of political let's say momentum is a critical mistake nowadays we have an emergency government I don't know what happens after the war or usually in Israel there our elections most probably it will bring for political change but the the the message that Israel got that that lack of political momentum lack of peace process is is not healthy to put it this way to the region to the Palestinian question and to Israel and we should bring it as so as soon as possible let's say to the U equation not being naive but in order to show what is the alternative Shashank can you just give us an idea of what you think is going to happen once the fighting is all over and done with how big a mess uh is there going to be left in Gaza and and do you think that Israel and other leaders in the region actually has a plan to deal with what whatever is left behind right well I mean first of all there's going to be profound destruction we've my colleagues at The Economist have looked at satellite images and we estimate that around 10% of gaza's housing stock residential housing stock has been destroyed and we estimate that about 280,000 people will be missing homes so there is a huge reconstruction challenge irrespective of whatever happens next but in addition to that there is a postwar governance challenge which is to say that either Hamas is weakened but not destroyed in which case uh it will still be present or it will be destroyed and there will have to be some kind of alternative Arrangement either um that is the Palestinian Authority running the place uh a coalition of Arab and Gulf countries providing some kind of Assistance or an a circumstance in which Hamas or even more violent extreme Splinter movements may find the latitude to establish themselves and conduct further attacks on Israel so a great deal depends on how the war ends you know if it ends like the other conflicts have ended with a ceasefire a deal uh and Hamas is been chastened but is still present we may go back to normal but otherwise we may face some more disordered situation that is uh characterized by a severe lack of governance sah we've only got about a minute or so left just picking up on on that point do you think that you can ever truly get rid of Hamas I mean surely there's a scenario that it could potentially come back even stronger even more radicalized the scenario is on the Israeli table to to take Hames as the cape go to as an exit of this war but unfortunately that will make it a very long War it's very hard I think uh weakened Hamas who who brought Hamas to power in 2005 so I think there should be drawing of borders first for this war to end for sustainable peace in the region and for sustainable security drawing borders for both Israel and Palestine okay thank you so much we really do appreciate all of your time and your insights from all of you Michael Harari sarak Kira and shishang Joshi thank you so much for joining us and thank you
