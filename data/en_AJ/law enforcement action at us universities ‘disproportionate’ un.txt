the UN Human Rights Chief says that they are troubled by the treatment of students who are protesting in solidarity with Palestinians at us universities the protest showed no sign of slowing as they spread Coast to Coast over the weekend and police crackdowns and arrests continued students vow to stay in tended encampments until their demands are met now these are pictures from Colombia University in New York students occupying Hamilton Hall have barricaded themselves inside the building they are in like with other states there are activists that have joined students calling for their universities to cut ties with Israel they're also urging an end to US military aid we are traveled by a series of heavy handed steps taken to disperse and dismantle protest across University campuses in the United States of America freedom of expression and the right to Peaceful assembly are fundamental to society particularly when there is a shack disagreement on major issues as there are in relation to the conflict in the cupied Palestinian territory and Israel Let's cross over to Kristen salumi she's outside Columbia University in New York uh the tension was pretty high there in the last 24 hours and many more people joining the protest but the focus seems to be on the building behind you right now that's right we're told it's calm on campus but they are only allowing a very limited number of people onto the campus in an attempt to deescalate the situation the encampment remains but only students who live on campus are being allowed to go onto the campus and essential Personnel for the University itself media not being allowed on anymore to film what's happening as those demonstrators have taken over the building that you see over here that is Hamilton Hall renamed hind Hall in honor of the six-year-old girl who was killed in Gaza the demonstrators stormed that building uh in the early morning hours uh taking it over blockading it so no one could get inside this is a group that is autonomous from the group that is uh in the encampment itself uh many of the people who have been participating in the demonstrations on campus in fact can't get back on you know not everybody was sleeping in that tent area but a lot of supporters came out when there was rumors of an arrest yesterday as a deadline was set for the students to clear the encampment many teachers and other students came out to surround it and prevent that from happening no arrests were made uh but the situation continued into the night so this morning many were surprised to learn that they could not get back on campus uh should also say that the suspension notices have been going out to many students that have been participating in these demonstrations including some of the negotiators uh getting notification from the University that they have been suspended and in regards to the people in Hamilton Hall they are being threatened with an even Ser more serious step they're being threatened with expulsion uh meaning no chance of returning to Colombia if they don't vacate that Hall so far no find that they are making a move and Kristen of course as you say tension High the police were there in pretty big numbers uh on Monday what's the situation like there now with the security services honestly right now I'm not seeing very many uh NYPD New York Police Department officials there are uh they do uh have patrols around the campus they are stationed around the campus but not as many as we have seen on other days uh the buses that are used to take away people when they are arrested uh I haven't seen any signs of those but security is very tight from the University in terms of allowing people on campus or not and there are plenty of police standing by um the concern I think from the administration is that the police presence just brought more attention and more supporters out last time so there uh seems to be a war of attrition going on here to try to get more people off the campus less people on the campus so that they don't have a major development or scene on the campus Christen seli there for us at Columbia University in New York thank you let's cross over to Phil lval who's at the University of Connecticut in Mansfield he's outside the police station where people were brought in well Phil they were brought in and detained have any of them left they have been sell in fact what we've seen over the last two hours or so is that every maybe 20 30 minutes a student will come out having beam processed they've got their papers and the crowd who've come here to show solidarity to show support break out into cheers of Applause and they clap and they welcome them back into the group and also we've been seeing cars going past not just students but people who look like they come from all walks of society honking their horns in support of those students now this encampment was broken up early today it had actually been in place since Thursday but on Friday the university said to those students look these tents have got to go and you have to Adar to a complete silence policy one of a better phrase uh they University says that the students did not do that they said they were making what they call Amplified noise the tents were there they said as of Monday there were 20 tents earlier today the police arrived they said look you've got to go or you're going to be arrested some of the students chose to leave others stayed and that's why they've ended up here being process and I got to bring in man s now who's an activist who was there this morning man you were not arrested right I was not arrested to just explain to us how it all unfolded like what happened yeah so today in the morning we were waking up around 5:00 a.m. and we noticed a huge increase in police activity in the previous days we've had maybe one or two Cruisers kind of monitoring the situation today we had maybe 40 50 cars uh pull up on campus we then kind of saw them start you know start increasing their presence getting on the ground state troopers arrive they start circling the entire Camp you con PD they closed off all the entrances they weren't letting students you know go back in and out um and then they made an announcement they said you know whoever is left here uh will be arrested and that was kind of the point where some students decided to stay right to make a stand to show the university that look these students care about what they're saying they're going to put their money where their mouth is um and as such the Yukon PD they rolled in they swept the entire Camp they arrested people They confiscated a lot of uh supplies tents uh people's bags laptops Etc um and yeah and the police had already arrested people on previous days as well I understand right so on Thursday uh when initially when the rally kind of took place in that Center area uh students put up a few tents and keep in mind this was before Yukon had outwardly put out a policy of no tents allowed so when students put up tents Ukon PD started coming in they started getting very uh physical with the students started pushing in and they ended up arresting one person actually dislocating the shoulder are there any plans to start up another protest maybe not in the same place but is there any PL to do do anything else more action 100% there's a plan to do more action on campus and over the next couple hours uh organizers will think about what is the best way to do that it's not necessarily a camp because it's important to remember that the point of this movement isn't just camps is to raise awareness and to really show the administration that we want them to come to our demands all right thanks very much for that I appreciate it just to tell you about another situation this is at another University Not A Million Miles Away Yale which is about what 50 Mi away from here uh there has been an encampment there that encampment has now gone uh the University City or rather the police surrounded the campus area where the tents were at 6:00 a.m. they said we are going to arrest anybody who stays here the students chose to leave the university themselves started to say we will start to invoke uh some disciplinary procedures against you if you leave those protesters decided that it was best for them to leave for the time being but as we've seen over the last few days a protest ends and then it begins again or they come back so whether or not it is truly over that remains to be seen sah thanks very much filal for us at MIT now let's cross over to John hendren who's at Princeton University in New Jersey hi John um a developing situation really there these past 24 hours uh where you are what's been going on well overnight uh there were about 13 arrests students uh entered a a building and uh some of them were taken out put into a bus where police had planned to cart them away but hundreds of students surrounded that bus and were able to negotiate their release they were written up on disciplinary charges by University Police not uh City police that's a difference between you know a civil action and a criminal action and you might be wondering why I'm not at Princeton University I'm across the street where they're about to have a news conference and the students who are arrested are not allowed to go back on campus so we are in the Town Square in Princeton where they're about to address what happened happed last night but about a dozen arrests I think 13 was the actual total and faculty were involved they were helping escort those students to try to protect them from police no faculty were arrested but this is uh really one of the latest scenes where you're seeing this across the country we've had more than 700 arrests and these were simply the latest joh for us there at Princeton in New Jersey thanks very much let's go over to the US capital Washington DC where sheab rans is standing by at George Washington University interesting we've been to three universities already sheab detention arrest detention arrest detention arrest that hasn't been the case where you are though has it I mean there have been attempts to arrest but but they've been sort of filed by the protesters but the fact is we know that the administrators here at George Wasing University have asked the police to come in and violently clear the place and the police are saying saying no it's quite it's quite bizarre really actually let's talk to one of the protesters one one is here with us I mean it's strange though you get that sense that if you were protesting against Russia for example or you were Pro protesting about climate change you know the the head of the University were like fine this is great but why do you think she is or why why think they are so so virant against this particular protest yeah no I'm I think it's a really great Point um and it's heavy on all of our minds and I think the answer is rather clear about um this is a financial institution this is not an academic institution um and our demands are clear and it's for them to divest and that is absolutely something they're not committed to um but more than that we're bringing attention to an issue that they want to gloss over and that's the genocide happening in gusa um and I think that's that's really the the important part right why why would your administrators at the academics you know the academic infrastructure here be against you drawing attention to that though yeah I think it's definitely something that is trying to be swept under the rug the way that even most American is covering it the New York Times think Publications such as those refuse to use the word genocide and and that's a word that we're going to put out here on every sign and and you can't walk by this campus you can't walk through downtown DC without seeing it then that leads to the question of how you're so aware of what's going on in Gaza and indeed you know the depth of knowledge about the nature of the Israeli occupation and so on is huge here but how how is it that you're also aware of all of this when as you say Western media is trying to avoid it all right yeah absolutely um and you know my honest answer is my specialty is not this specific conflict not even Middle East as a region um mine is Latin America and I study borders and I study migration because my own parents were displaced because of us imperialism um and but that's that's the the point we're getting at here is that everyone the students have come together and they assess the world they assess what they see what they see what they can feel what they can touch and they say something's wrong and something's up and that's where the where the search for knowledge happens right you have students here who are inquisitive of about the world around them and if you're looking for answers it doesn't take any time at all to find them to find the truth and that is of course the the the mass grapes the massacres that are that are going on in Gaza and and just all of the displacement that's happening there and that's the term is almost over so I mean what's going to happen how is this going to resolve itself do you think here at this encampment yeah um I mean I as well as fellow fellow encamps are are are here to stay I think like I'm I mean I'm here I'm here during the summer you know and I know that Administration is too this is where they live the president's house is a block away um so if they think that I mean this lack week last week of classes is going to be any any indicator of slowing down I think we have strong Community Support it is a student encampment that is backed by Community because it's not just students that see what's happening in gusa it's it's community members that are coming in outpouring of support um all across the city and that's I mean as you mentioned it's the community power that has avoided violence that has avoided arrests and has made sure that this sustained effort can occur um in such a powerful way that it has well thank you very very much thank you so still a determined student populace here at George Washington University so thanks very much she had brany there for us in Washington DC thank you let's cross over to heid Joe Castro live for us in Austin in Texas at the University of Texas it was just over 24 hours ago when we were talking to each other Heidi and the situation was getting very stressful for students and faculty staff and those either side of the protest debate it seems to have C down definitely now uh 24 hours later but what's going on right now that's right so it's it's a huge difference than when we last spoke 24 hours ago but the protest Still Remains here in a very different form behind me is the lawn where we saw that encampment that was broken down by police in which protesters were dragged away one by one despite sitting peacefully on the ground and now this is a teaching this is the a similar scene to what we' seen prior to that spontaneous encampment bursting forth yesterday and now we're learning that more than 100 people protesting at UT Austin yesterday were arrested by police to our knowledge they still remain in police detention we trying to learn what charges they face what their future might be but the protesters Who Remain here say they are undaunted and will continue to be delivering their message and that's why I wanted to turn to Our Guest this is Amar Kumi thanks so much for joining us you're one of the original organizers of the protest that kicked off all of this last week tell me about how this turn of events has unfolded yeah so on Wednesday April 24th we uh were we announced we were going to have a peaceful demonstration uh on campus a walk out followed by educational teachings here on the south lawn um we received uh notice from UT that we that they were not going to allow this to happen without giving any basis for you know any sort of policy that we would be in violation of uh and we continued with the event um with the officers with the with the just Army of officers that UT Administration called in which is similar to what we also saw yesterday so let's jump forward to that and you saw a ground swell of support coming from the university community describe what's seeing that manifest around you felt like yeah no so I think you know the the community saw that how on April 24th uh the university had no restraint in in violently uh suppressing our voice and so when there was another demonstration peaceful demonstration that was being threatened by uh this Army of police uh presidents called here by the university uh you know although we did not organize it we called on our community to come out in support of this demonstration of free speech um which was uh threatened to be violated uh yet again by our University uh who just again showed no constraint uh in using um any means of of of uh crowd dispersal including mace including beating uh protesters students with batons running them over with motorcycles um you know Mass arrests hospitalizations uh it really just is appalling to see uh our University take such great uh take such great measures in violently suppressing uh what is supposed to be free speech from their students and we certainly here we were here to see some of the masing some of the arrests uh police really just tearing people out of the crowd and putting them in handcuffs one by one to see that uh overtake your camp campus and then not only that but to see the response because originally there were several hundred but then it grew to a thousand if not more talk about how that happened yeah so I mean again I think our community you know they understand the sort of pressure we're under here at UT I think we've become the most hostile campus just based on a number of arrests in the country um and I think our community also understands the severity of the situation given that we are advocating for the liberation of a people that are being that have been under siege for the past 18 years that are Curr ly under a brutal genocide that has killed tens of thousands of children uh men and men women and children uh and the community understands that that The Stance our University is taking to just crack down uh despite the the Free Speech despite the the subject of what we're actually protesting our community understands us and will always be there to support us and for that we're very grateful thank you so much ammer and as you can see the the continued protest now remains peaceful uh it's likely to stay this way for the rest of the day I'm told but there are other events planned in the future still no word from the UT Administration we sent requests about why yesterday's police Crackdown was ordered and the response to all the chaos that we saw unfold afterwards so hi DJ cter there for us
