the head of hamas's political Bureau is in Ciro in what could signal a new phase of possible ceasefire negotiations earlier on Tuesday isma hania met Iran's foreign minister in Doha it comes after the Israeli president said he was open to another humanitarian pause razi hammed joins us now he is a member of the Hamas political Bureau thanks very much for being with us so I want to ask you first of all uh about where things are uh with all of these uh talks that are going on is in in Cairo as we just mentioned uh and as we reported earlier there are ongoing discussions uh between uh Hamas leaders and their through their intermediaries in in in Q about the possibility of a of another ceasefire deal of some kind what can you tell us about that okay I think many countries they are now trying to find an exit for this dma all of these parts are trapped Americans Arians and even some sometimes Arabic countries they are looking for an exit for a way to find a solution but I think they are going here and there north and south east and west some of them they are trying to uh cheating try to pip pass but I think our our vision is very clear we want to stop the aggression with the war in Gaza and because I think what is going in the ground is it is a big catastrophe it's a holocaust it's mass destruction and masing of people Mass massacres we want to stop this this is our priority now some people looking for a small pause pause here and there for one week two weeks three weeks but I think that our decision is very clear we want to stop the aggression because I think Israel will take the the card of the hostages and after that they will start a new round of masculine and massacr against our people I think we will not play this game I think we want to stop this war this aggression our people and after that we are ready to negotiate uh with the all or the com big compromise for the diones for the prisoners for the hostages but the priority we talk with the Egyptians with the c with different parts stop the agre in Gaza because what is going in Gaza is a big shame for the International Community to keep silent especially after the discussion in the general assembly Security Council that most of countries 99% of the countries all over the world they want Seas fire they want to stop the war but I think United State and Israel and some countries like United Kingdom they are participating in the crimes on Gaza Strip and they still give Israel green line to continue but I think that we still have a strong vision and a Clear Vision to stop the the the the aggression on Gaza as a priority for us as Hamas and as Palestinian people so you're saying at this point you would not be in favor of some sort of a of an interim deal because that's the indic those are the indications that we are getting right now is that this this may still be a possibility look I think that we we we talk to the all mediators either country and Egyptians and other even some people from United Nation some European people visit us in in Doha and we we talked to them very clear I think they they understood our position and they I think some of them they support this because they fed up of continuing of the of the war and aggression and the crimes and masking on Gaza Strip This catastrophic human situation in Gaza they want to stop this and I think we had different statements issued by United Nation European communities even some people in the American Administration they are asking for the ceasefire but I think now inside Israel they want and assist to continue the the the this big crime against our people and um but I think we are still strong we are still abide to our position and we will not change because I said first and the end we want to stop the aggression okay we pay the big price that's right but I think we are have a strong energy in order to take the responsibility to protect our people and to stop the massacr in gazan I I want to I want to ask you as well gazi hammed about another development that's being reported um and that is there are reports of Hamas leaders talking with uh leaders from uh the fat uh Palestinian faction about what Gaza will look like at the end uh of this conflict and that there are ongoing discussions regarding that is there anything you can tell us about that look we are all to to to have contact with all Palestinian factions we look the fat has a big organization they have their hory their existence in Palestinian Society we call home many times in order to meet us and to sit with us in addition to other Palestinian faction in order to have a clear vision and a national Vision because I think that this is very important time in order to meet together to think together and to take decision together but I think the problem they still in the in the the president of the palestin authority who still rejected the this calls from Hamas because I think we are very interested to meet our brothers in fat and the Palestinian faction in order to think how can we deal with the current situation in Gaz either politically or the humanitarian aspect or this American attempts in order to change this situation I think it is a time to have a national decision and a national decision uh policy but I think U till now there is no good steps good initiatives from fat organization in order to come close to Hamas organization I said again we are open to sit with with with him to talk with him with all palestin faction in order to first of all as a priority to stop the aggression and after that we can think how can we deal the situation either in the West Bank or Gaza in the in order to to rearrange the Palestinian home in order to have one political system one Palestinian Authority this is I think it is our interest but I hope and I expect from our brother in order to show more positive steps in this direction gazi hammed appreciate your time thank you
