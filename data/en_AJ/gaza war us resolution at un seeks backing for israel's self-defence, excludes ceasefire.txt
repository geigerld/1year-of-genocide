well the US will also be introducing a new draft resolution to the UN Security Council on the war on Gaza that resolution does not call for a ceasefire Gabriel zondo has more now from New York the draft resolution that was issued by the United States to the UN Security Council is three pages long it's 17 different points there are a few I want to point out it uh says that Israel has its inherent right to self-defense it also condemns M multiple times for acts of terrorism from October 7th attack on Israel it calls for the release of all hostages being held by Hamas and it calls for her Iran to stop all transfer of weapons to Armed groups and it also voices appreciation for Qatar for its mediation role in getting the two American hostages freed but what is not in this draft resolution might be just as important as what is in it there is no call for a ceasefire or even a humanitarian pause and there is no call for a cation in any hostilities now the US has given other Security Council Members until 10:00 a.m. local time on Sunday to issue any sort of rebuttal or amendments to this draft resolution it could go to a vote by the security Council as early as Monday Gabriel zando Al jazer new New York
