the Israeli Army continues to pound the densely populated Gaza Strip ahead of what it says will be a coordinated wide raging Land Air and sea operation in the Palestinian territory it accuses Hamas of trying to stop people from leaving for southern Gaza before the offensive starts that Hamas has both issued warnings to their civilians not to evacuate and when people didn't listen to those warnings of Hamas they have actually stopped civilians and they have stopped convoys of gazan civilians trying to flee from the situation and listening to our warnings knowing that they are much better off South of the gazi Gaza River than staying in the northern part the Israeli Army continues to deploy troops and heavy Weaponry strengthening its position at the border with Gaza Palestinian Fighters continue to fire Rockets from the strip most are intercepted by the Iron Dome defense system but some get through as intercepted rockets explode above and after repeated warnings by the Israeli military the remaining civilians in the town of stot are starting to move there's still thousands of civilians inside stot a town around 3 km from the Gaza border since we've been here this morning there's been a heavy firefight on the outskirts of town a lot of heavy machine gun fire Small Arms there's also been a lot of outgoing shelling the mayor of this town now is saying that the remaining civilians here must leave and now most are reluctant to go 45 years I've lived here I have no choice but to go we have the strongest army in the world but we won't beat Hamas we thought it would end after a week but it hasn't I'm just taking what I can carry just 15 km from here at the shiffer hospital across the Gaza border staff can't cope with a sheer number of wounded medicine Fuel and water are running out further south in can Yunis an area the Israeli Army says Palestinians should go to to avoid being killed survivors of Israeli air strikes struggle to come to terms with their loss we were inside the house my son and grandsons suddenly without a warning they bumbed the house 14 people were killed only this girl my granddaughter fulla survived I hope she will get better and stay safe and heal May their souls rest in peace Israel's heaviest bombardment of Gaza in history is unrelenting destroying entire neighborhoods and killing more than 3,000 people and in the midst of it all hundreds of thousands of pal Palestinians are fleeing for their lives Char stford Al jazer stot Southern Israel well we can go live to Charlie now who's still there in this thr in southern Israel so Charlie just give us an update of the latest situation well we've had a number of heavy barges of of rockets that have been fired from the Gaza Strip in the last couple of hours the last one very close to where we were to the point where when the interceptions happened at least six Rockets literally there was shrapnel falling around our feet we understand that there are no casualties because as I say those six were intercepted but let me just show you one of these recent strikes or the kind of effect they have on the civilian population here this is somebody's home um and you can see the power of the the rocket is has blown a hole in the wall the the roof that noise you can hear behind me is the flapping of corrugated iron in the roof um and if I ask the cameraman Marino just to pan around just across the street here it was another strike site just along the road here and we understand that that that landed that that contact was made there um earlier today the Gaza Strip is just to the right here it's about 3 km in that direction the town is virtually empty but as you saw in our report there there is an ongoing evacuation effort now the mayor of stero has repeatedly over the last few days being insisting that people must leave it is not obligatory it is not mandatory there are still some people here who say they won't um but yeah the situation here remains very tense indeed we he also here as you can imagine quite a lot of outgoing from we understand from The Sound um artillery large artillery pieces but of course the situation here as we saw in that report is nothing like it is in Gaza as the hours tick by towards what we understand will be according to the Israeli according to the Israeli Army um a coordinated Land Air and sea attack on Northern Gaza right Charles thanks for that update there Charles traford there in St in southern Israel
