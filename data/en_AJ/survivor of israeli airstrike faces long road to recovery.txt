I am Suheir Abdel Fattah Muhammad Rabei Ahmed. I am a widow with nine children, my children and daughters. As for Ghazal Ashraf Abdel Fattah Rabei, their house was targeted in 911. All of her family were martyred, and she was seriously injured. Praise be to God. I mean, she is the survivor. The revelation came from her family, meaning her family and her uncleâ€™s house, two floors, meaning 18.  A member of her family was lost, and she was the only survivor. Ghazal was. I mean, when the bombing happened, they took her out, I mean, from their home. Their building was completely bombed. I mean, she had a blood bleed in the brain, and she had cranial insufficiency, and she lost part of the brain fluid. She was the girl, and she had a fracture in the femur in her leg, and she was the girl.  It means a lot, and she even has a problem in her jaw and her teeth. The problem is that her jaw is as crooked as the one above became, so I tried to tell the doctors something about her condition, and they all tell me that after the war, she had ghazal before the injury. I mean, thank God, she used to go to the bathroom on her own and eat and go away healthy.  Then, it means her mental abilities are weak, but thank God, she is much better than that. I mean, when she wants to go out, she gets the comb and gets her boots, and she has what she wears, so her mother takes her out. It means they worked. The most important thing they cared about was her head, and they meant that she would recover and the girl would wake up, even she, so her condition was bad.  Extremely, the doctors meant that the girl was finished, meaning there was no hope in her. God, who gave her birth to Omar
