more trucks have been allowed through the rougher Crossing into the southern part of the Gaza Strip but the government in Gaza says that the total allowed in during the last 17 days 17 days that amounts to 522 that's equal to the number that usually enters Gaza in a single day before hamas's attacks on October the 7th the government has also announced that all bakeries in the north of the territory have also been forced to stop operating well we can now speak to Bushra khi she's the policy lead for Oxfam in the pal inan territories in Israel she joins me now from rala Bush we just starting with this food situation and orx famam has said that starvation is being used right now as a weapon of War now that we're hearing that bakeries in the north are no longer operational where are people getting any sustenance at the moment um so people in the north and in Gaza City are either queuing with um to like people are are baking bread in their own homes if they have flower uh but we also know that um flower supplies are dwindling we also know that Aid is not being distributed in Gaza City or in the north so even though that Aid so little not enough only two it represents only 2% of food deliveries that would have been carried out before 7th of October um is not reaching um affected communities in Gaza City and in the north and we're talking about almost half a million if not more uh people still in the north and Gaza City so people are hungry sorry just to to check in with you there was any of that Aid actually ever destined for the north Israel had been quite explicit about wanting that Aid to to be really only for the the South and Central part of the strip the north has been completely sealed off um from the south so the aid is not reaching the north I think except for some medical supplies that got in last week um to some of the hospitals in the in the north but I mean again not enough the needs now are even greater than what they were before the 7th of October so if we needed 500 trucks a day um before the 7th of October we need much more um to be able to meet the daily needs of 2.2 million people um and half of which are children um people are hungry um and hunger has become a norm uh in Gaza and this is my family's testimonies uh uh they're you know they just eat very small meals one a meal a day at best um with you know a lot of people are also Ready for War because this is the sixth escalation they have so people usually have you know lentils and rice and flour at home but again the problem is is the water the water is dirty so they're also cooking with dirty water if they are cooking um bush in terms of obviously fuel has been a huge issue here especially in terms of of being able to produce clean water even being able to bake bread at home but also to to move around you talked about the northern part of the Gaza Strip being now basically completely cut off are people able to leave if they want to especially given the lack of fuel and the presence of Israeli troops there on the ground well I mean the Israelis have given windows for people to leave from the north to the South and have asked for all residents of the north and Gaza City to evacuate towards the South the problem is is that these um orders have often been um not on true but but they're not safe uh these are not safe boots we know that these boots have been bombed we know that civilians were killed while trying to evacuate to the South so people don't trust those orders anymore it's causing so much panic and Chaos um people are having to make these difficult decisions and also people like my family they're elderly they can't walk to the South it's not feasible um for them to actually evacuate by foot um with no belongings they're not allowed to take any money they're not allowed to take anything um when in their evacuation so a lot of people are choosing to stay um because it's not safe um and they don't know where to go um bush in terms of of the displacement we've we've now understood that something like 70% of people have lost their homes what are their options now and and I'm asking I guess is there a growing design to leave the Gaza Strip despite what we're hearing from politicians about Force displacement and red lines are people now in such desperate situations they just want to go I mean they're being forced to go they don't they're not choosing to go they're being forced to go because they're being starved and they're thirsty and they need shelter yeah um but there's nowhere to go to because ra has closed and Israeli borders are closed and this is the responsibility of Israel as the occupier to ensure that it protects civilian population in Gaza and it's not because it's chosen to do the opposite by cutting off water electricity fuel medical supplies bombarding indiscriminately hospitals ambulances and necessary civilian infrastructure um so people are I mean people some people don't have the choice like I'm saying some of my family they don't have the choice to evacuate because they don't know where to go to places are overcrowded there's a wash sanitation crisis now developing um why is my my father-in-law being forced to go to an overcrowded situation that is probably unsafe anyway he'd rather stay at home and and he said to die in dignity in my own home rather die than die in some strangers home Bush there the policy lead for Oxfam in the Palestinian territories in Israel busha thank you for joining us on Al jazer and I'm sorry to hear that your family is stuck at the moment in Gaza we we wish that they that they do remain safe thank you for your time yeah
