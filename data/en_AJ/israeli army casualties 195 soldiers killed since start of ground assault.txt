well Israeli military casualties are also mounting the Army says one soldier has been killed in battles in Gaza Palestinian factions say they attacking Israeli tanks and military vehicles with rockets and improvised explosive devices at least 195 soldiers have been killed since Israel launched its ground offensive in late October let's get more with Laura Khan who's an occupied East Jerusalem uh clearly the uh prime minister under huge pressure his relationship with other members of the war cabinet not going so well tell us a little more about this well uh one of the big reports over the last few weeks has been his relationship with his own defense minister YF Galant uh many say that after the war cabinet meetings which I have to say our top secret no one's supposed to know what's going on with them uh inside them alongside the security cabinet meeting but there are continuous leaks to the Press afterwards and that their relationship has become Petty and embarrassing to some of the ministers during the time of a war and I'll just read out some of these headlines um from Israel's Channel 12 the headline this is how the battle between Netanyahu and Gallant looks for weeks the Prime Minister and defense minister tried to hide the tension between them and now it's futile there reports that a week ago yov Galan walked out of a a walk cabinet meeting after he wasn't allowed to bring his assistant and he claims that this was because Netanyahu didn't want him to actually spend time with mad and shinette that's the head of intelligence and security um so he believes that he's he's essentially not getting a look in to some of the decisions being made that he's big part of now he was hired by Netanyahu because he trusted him as a good soldier as someone who has plenty of experience uh inside well in in wars and also inside the military but it's not just there where we're having leaks also with the New York Times International media uh there were leaks from four Top members of the military that they believe Netanyahu is two-pronged approach to the war that is trying to rid of Hamas but also releasing the captives uh were incompatible that you can't continue to bombard the gods of strip and fight a gorilla Warfare inside this waren of tunnels and on the ground and expect the safe release of the captives we've also had pressure from across the country from the captives families who've been saying this again reiterating this point this is incompatible um while he has a two-pronged approach they have one they just want to see the release of the captives and we're seeing this these growing protests across the country all with the same rhetoric release them now and hold a ceas fire and many are also calling for another election and for Ben Benjamin n Yahoo to step down so a huge amount of tension and pressure coming from all sides Laura uh as you said there many Leakes out in the newspapers International and domestic there have been uh you you touched on the captives but there have been reports that there could be more negotiations uh going on at the moment to release those captives can you tell us a bit more about what is being reported yes uh wet is reporting again leaks on condition of anonymity uh that uh senior members uh of the political uh Wing not not coming from the military are saying that they can strike a deal with Hamas and other groups in order to release the captives and they say that Hamas is also um interested in this idea so they are they say they are moving forward they're engaging with other countries um including Qatar um Egypt and and also the United States been part of these mediation efforts so again another leak we haven't fully confirmed this yet um but once again this is against what Netanyahu has been saying from the beginning that the only way of defeating Hamas inside the Gaza Strip is through military pressure thank you for that Laura KH there for us in occupied East Jerusalem
