Israeli settlers have killed at least three Palestinians in attacks on a village south of noas in the occupied West Bank several others were injured in the violence two of them critically the occupied West Bank is also being blockaded by the Israeli Army Imran Khan joins us live from rala you're continuing to see the Ripple effects Imran of what's happening in Gaza tell us what you've learned about the settler attacks on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank well those attacks are still actually ongoing in alusa we're hearing in the last hour that another 13-year-old boy has been shot in the head he's wounded uh he's wounded critically we're also hearing uh that one of the U 13 that have been injured is actually a six-year-old girl now alus has always been a flasho for settler violence uh but now Palestinians are incredibly afraid you can't like you say the the the occupied West Bank is actually blockaded now there are roads that Palestinians can travel on but they're near settlements people don't even want to get onto those roads the roads that they can actually travel on because they're very worried about settler violence this was always a concern the minute Palestinians here in the occupied West Bank watched the events of Saturday and then over the past 5 days with the bombing on Gaza they were very worried that settler attacks would increase but settler attacks have been on the increase for a decade now 800 in the last year alone some three a day those are big numbers but they're likely to exceed uh even three a day across the occupied West Bank and that's the real concern here people who live near settlement seral people who uh live near the border with Israel are actually stocking up on food and water because they don't want to leave the house and they're worried uh about this blockade becoming even more permanent Imron you're looking at another aspect of this which is that the conflict is impacting the livelihoods of hundreds of Palestinians because workers from Gaza are being dismissed from their jobs in Israel well dismissed is a very gentle way of putting it what they what happened is the uh Israeli workers uh sorry the Israeli bosses actually on advice of the police put them into cars and dump them on the borders uh with um the occupied West Bank and that was after police interrogation uh but we've been hearing from those workers let's take a closer look cut off from their homes this has become a makeshift home for some Palestinians from the Gaza Strip it was a local government building designed for sports and arts it's now a camp for displaced people there isn't a person here whose family hasn't been touched by this war my brothers and cousins called me and told me my son was injured a few hours later they called again and told me he was killed I want to go see him his mother is in Egypt for medical treatment she's stuck there and I'm stuck here he will be buried and I won't see him my other two children are Sheltering in schools alone others tell us they have lost multiple members of their families most don't know if they'll have a home to return to these men were employed under an agreement Israel made with the Gaza labor Ministry which allowed a set number of people to work in Israel it was a good deal for Israel businesses got cheap labor and could circumvent labor laws the Israeli government could say it was doing something to help Gaza but on Saturday employers acting on Israeli police instructions were told to take them to checkpoints at the occupied West Bank before that happened we are told some were interrogated and assaulted by the Israeli Security Services a claim we cannot confirm the influx has taken the Palestinian authorities by surprise and they woefully unprepared we need to maintain the health Factor very importantly in this location we are talking about as we speak 550 this number might just rise to a 700 or maybe a th000 because people are keep they are keeping pouring once they are discovered inside Israel handed over to the Israeli military and they they are just simply left after being beaten and humilated on the checkpoints to find their way to this to this shelter everyone here is watching the news on their mobile phones but unlike you I they're not watching for the news they're watching their homes being destroyed in real time they can't get home and there's nothing they can do about it Imran Khan out is r
