well Hamas has welcomed the ruling by the international court of justice but in a statement it says it expected the court to issue an order to stop the genocide against our people in all of Gaza not just in Rafa well joining us on the phone is senior Hamas spokesman Osama hden he joins us from Beirut now first of all can you just give us your initial reaction to the icj ruling how significant do you find it well first of all it's uh a very welcom decision from the icj and we believe it shows EXA clearly that the icj considered what's happening Gaza is a genocide and Israel is committing a genocide because everyone knows that the genocide is identified clearly in the court the second issue I believe this decision uh brings the whole International Community uh to carry on their own respons abilities everyone was waiting for this decision uh to understand whether it is a genocide or not we believe as Hamas it was a genocide from day number one but at least now everyone in the International Community has to understand it's a genocide and they have to work hard in order to make an end for that and to stop Israel from going on forward in this issue and I believe it's a a great challenge for the International Community mainly to the United States because for all the last around 8 months isra Israel was supported totally by the the United States on all the levels uh if you want to talk about a political level they were supported in the security Council they were supported and by by by by military a they they were supported economically and even they were defended by the US Administration that was what was happening is is not a genocide now everyone understands it's a genocide and has to work hard in order to stop it since the ruling was handed down by the icj as it was handed down we saw the Israeli military step up its air strikes on raford do you think that there is any chance at all that the Israeli government is actually going to comply with this ruling what it's clear that the Israelis will not accept the decision and they didn't ever accepted any resolution in the United Nation or the icj uh this is a challenge whether Israel is a country uh above the international law or a country have to accept the international law everyone is talking about the international law everyone is talking about the Justice now there is a clear issue uh and everyone is supposed to answer about that how he cons considered the Israeli decision I think if they were treated like a smallo child they will continue but if everyone said is enough and there was an action against Israel by cutting Israel dismantling This Racist uh regime I think this will stop the war against not only RAF it will be stopped against the Palestinians we are under the Israeli cation for the last 75 years the massacres did not start today the genocide did not start today it started 1948 but at least this is the first time there is a clear evidence that the international Community considering what's going on is a genocide uh through the resolution of the icg yeah part of the the ruling was uh as well was uh to deal with the opening of the rougher border crossing how significant how important is that getting Aid back into uh back into Gaza well it's very important because in the last two days there is a clear signs uh in in the northern part of Gazza about a hunger situation we we we we are facing a real situation in in northern part of B according to the Israeli Siege and according to the the closure of the the borders uh mainly in so I believe this this this is supposed to reopen all the closed uh uh checkpoints and allow the the the the the a to come inside Gaza and that will make the Palestinian people survive we need also medical support we need all the the the essential issues from food to medicine to medical support from uh everywhere and I think this can open the door for the Palestinian to the Palestinian people in gazda to have this support well there is obviously increasing International pressure on Israel uh to stop its offensive and rougher in particular and allow more Aiden there is also more pressure coming on Hamas to release the captives well our position was clear from day number one we have declared that you are ready uh to do our best to send the non-militant Israelis uh to to to their families we have Ted that the early days as you remember and everyone may maybe remember that we've sent two Americans and N said no and after internal pressure he accepted that so we sent two old women after that in November we have a ceas far which was undermined by n himself and we sent around 110 of those uh women and children uh and and we we said that we are ready at the time to carry on but Netanyahu undermines that through the last four months all the negotiations NY insist to have uh the Israelis only without sending any Palestinian or release any Palestinians from the Israeli jails we are talking about dozen hundreds of thousands of Palestinians we are talking about more than 10,000 Palestinians in the jail half of them they were arrested in the last five months so uh we were clear in the negotiations we have to insist on five issues which must work together a complete stre fire a withdrawal from all the areas in Gaza uh the return of the Palestinians to their houses with uh providing the with needed Aid reconstructing and a fair brisar exchange deal and and and we insist on that and the last uh paper which which was introduced by the mediators I mean the Karis and the Egyptians and it was endorsed by the Americans we've said yes that was on the 4th of May this month but the Israelis rejected that so we are ready to go on if they said yes this would happen today so they they have to to make their mind and to decide you are not going back to the to negotiations there was an initiative and was accepted from Hamas and they have to say now yes okay still clearly a golf between uh the two sides
