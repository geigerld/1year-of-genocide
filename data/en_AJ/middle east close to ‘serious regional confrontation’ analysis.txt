hisbah says it carried out another attack on Northern Israel the Israeli military confirmed several Rockets had been launched from Lebanon early on Monday an officer and a soldier were injured in the attack and have been taken to hospital King Abdullah of Jordan has called for further International efforts to prevent a regional expansion of the conflict his message came as Jordan's foreign minister met with the Iranian president to discussed the situation in the Middle East in a rare visit to Tran during that meeting the president reiterated that Hamas political leader Ismael Han's assassination would not go unanswered Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Iran and its allies that his government would exact what he called a heavy price if it was attacked Iran's blaming Israel for the assassination of hamas's political leader ishia in tan last week hisbah to has vowed to avenge the killing of a top Commander by Israel earlier this week and in the United States Joe Biden will convene his National Security team in the White House Situation Room to discuss all of these developments is being reported the US general in charge of the Middle East General Michael Killa is in the region for talks in Gulf countries and Israel and King Abdullah of Jordan is also expected to speak with the US president well for more on all of this we are live in Washington but first let's head to Beirut and speak to Zena hod say as we wait for this promised Iranian and Hezbollah response we're hearing report reports of backdoor negotiations happening at the same time what more can you tell us about those well yes International and Arab diplomats trying to contain uh the possibility of a fullon regional War now the message from Iran media close to Iran is that it will not be restrained that the decision has been taken especially since we heard from the supreme leader himself that there will be a severe punishment even the Hezbollah leader Hassan nah referred to Iran by saying that its dignity was harmed by um in this attack that led to the death of ish that assassination so we saw the Jordanian foreign minister in a very rare visit in tahran on Sunday um yes Jordan is in a very difficult position because the last time Iran directly attacked Israel uh Jordan did play a role it helped the US military intercept Iran missiles and Iran has warned that any country that takes part or helps the United States will be considered a Target but while the jordanians are saying they're not mediators um and not delivering messages between Israel and Iran he is talking about a very you know serious escalation in this region so the message from Iran is that we will not back down now the question is what kind of a response will will Iran carry out and what kind of a response Hezbollah will carry out because b 2 is threatening a harsh response for the killing of its Chief of Staff really in in the heart of Beirut but what is clear is that they both have to respond this is very important for for them because of deterence Iran sought the attack and April you know would stop Israel from from carrying out strikes in in in Iran now of course Israel has not claimed responsibility but it is being blamed for killing isma honey so you know we are still very much in in the St hand off waiting for this possible response which really could escalate tensions in in the region yes Z as well as all of that to consider there's also been more fire along the Israel Lebanon border hisbah says this though is not the response to the killing of its top Commander though yes the exchange of fire continues along that border but what we've seen really in recent days is an increase in the tempo of operations especially from um Hezbollah Hezbollah carrying out sustained attacks now um this of course is not the promised response uh to the assassination of its Chief of Staff but this is a message from Hezbollah that its Rank and file has not been disrupted by the killing of its Chief of Staff we have to remember uh just a few weeks ago and recent months they lost three of their top commanders in the southern Lebanon so these sustained attacks continuing Israel too intensifying its a strikes in southern Lebanon in the past 2 to three days killing up to six people four Hezbollah Fighters and we believe two paramedics were the target of an Israeli air strike in the Border Village of mesel shabal uh this morning so tensions really at an all-time high Hezbollah making clear that it could be more than one response um they they saying that they could hit the military Target even the Secretary General hinting that civilians also could be targeted we are expected to hear from the Secretary General tomorrow an expected speech tomorrow afternoon to Mark the one we one week since the killing of its top Commander okay thank you so much Zana for talking us through all of that that's Z hter for us in beay we're going to go now to Phil level who is in Washington DC uh covering reaction from the United States obviously uh these latest developments show just how serious the US is taking all of this Joe Biden uh convening his uh National Security team as well as one of the top generals here in the Middle East talking uh to anyone and everyone that uh he can at this point in time to try and keep this from unraveling further yeah I mean what we're saying now is diplomacy at the highest level the fact that we're going to have President Biden talking to King Abdullah of Jordan in the coming hours just hours then before he convenes the security advisers in the situation room because there is a very real awareness now that we may not be talking about weeks or even days this could be something that takes place within a matter of hours there is a very real fear that there could be an attack as early as Monday and that is why we have seen over the last few days all of these meetings all of these calls for deescalation the defense secretary here Lloyd Austin speaking to his Israeli counterpart twice in the last few days firstly to reiterate America's um commitment to Israel but also calling for the need to De for deescalation and also the Secretary of State Anthony blinkin speaking to G7 Nations today or rather yesterday to urge them to do whatever they can to exert any diplomatic pressure they can on Iran to really deescalate this and all of this as we're seeing that military buildup the fact that the USS Abraham Lincoln is on its way to the Middle East the fact that there are Cruisers there are destroyers that have been deployed there there are military personnel that are there and Michael krilla that senior military figure also there speaking to everybody he can to to deescalate this and all of this against a backdrop where we are pretty much aware that the relationship between prime minister Netanyahu and President Biden is at a very low point the fact that we are told by advisers or there have been leaks from advisers that their last two conversations one in person here in the US last week one on the phone in recent days have been tense uh there was an expletive used by uh an unnamed official from the Biden Administration to describe the reactions that they've been getting from prime minister Netanyahu and in heret a Biden official was said to have said that prime minister Netanyahu is ungrateful for American Support so the fear fear is that even though America has to back Israel it's its main supporter its main protector its main arm supplier it too could be dragged into this wider conflict which nobody really wants no indeed well the fact that we saw Iran attack Israel in April will that give the us or Israel any sort of strategic Advantage when it comes to uh the retaliation that seems inevitable from Iran well on the surface of it you would think so but of course there are so many different variables now the fact that as Zena was just saying that Hezbollah has said that there could be a number of attacks the fact that back in April Iran telegraphed what it was going to do now that was in the context of an Israeli strike against Iranian Iranian military Generals in Damascus so both sides almost got what they needed out of it Iran got to show that it could respond Israel got the warnings that it needed so that it could avoid any Mass casualties and both sides effectively got what they needed out of it but here it is very different we've heard uh from one unnamed Iranian Diplomat who has apparently said that they are not telegraphing what is going to happen because Israel has crossed so many red lines and therefore the uh the the potential for escalation is really really high especially if Israel does respond as it is threatening to do and the US feels that it has to protect act okay thank you so much for all of that Phil that's Phil the for us in Washington DC okay well let's get some more analysis on this with Ibrahim fart he is an associate professor of conflict resolution at the Doha Institute thanks for being with us here thank you first of all it seems like everyone uh not just in the Middle East but in the wider world is waiting and anticipating a response from Iran what will Iran be considering when uh it retaliates eventually yes I think there is a reason uh for everyone to expect a retaliation from Iran um and what to expect U from Iran at this moment one is that to respond to this uh unprecedented uh type of attack on Iranian soil uh by Israel crossing the darkest red line uh that one can do um in relations with Iran and by assassinating isia on their soil on that level so uh this has put Iran in a very uh difficult position where it has to protect um it has to respond to this humiliation that Israel caused it has to show that it's um able to respond um and to retaliate and to deliver a a message that's equivalent to the type of attack that Israel has conducted so how does it go about doing all of those things without going too far and having even more blowback against Iran because we've heard Israel and the United States say that they will respond if Iran does retaliate well I think what we gather from uh official statements by Iranians uh is that Iran at this point does not really care and uh we have plenty of evidence to suggest that the type of response that Iran is conducting is uh different in nature from the attack that it the response that it delivered back in April when it communicated the timing and the tab of attacks that they're going to do and the agreement or the implicit agreement was to deliver something symbolic but now the Iranian leadership is making it clear we're not about symbolic uh uh response there is a coordinated response with hisbah and it has to hurt Israel the way that they are promising and they made this public like when you make these statements public you're committing your political Capital um in the in the process because now you are expected to deliver on this level so that's why I think uh we are uh probably in my view this is the closest point that where we got to a serious tension Regional tension and the closest point to a regional confrontation because yes though despite the disagreements between the US Administration and the Israel government the US remains committed to engage and to protect Israel and to respond because there was a state a warning from the US Administration that um if the Iranian response is strong then we will respond as well so now we are at least on the rhetoric level we're engaging in some sort of a regional confrontation you're a professor of conflict resolution we've seen uh King Abdullah of Jordan you know calling for more International efforts to try and bring the situation under control what do you make of how the US is handling this as well as other players uh in the region and trying to deescalate I mean or is it just simply inevitable that there that this is going to uh I guess the tension is going to ramp up into more violence it's not inevitable at all actually and I think the US Administration Bears the major responsibility here and it's conducting to answer your question it's the conduct of the US administr admin ation has been really terrible because there is a way to avoid this I think some sort of a serious American leadership to deliver um an initiative at this point speaking of conflict resolution for example is to stop the war in Gaza right and I think this would suffice for Iran to stop or to to stop itself from responding and engaging on this but instead of delivering a political Solution by a key player like the United States the United States sending more weapons and is is arming more Israel and threatening to to respond this is not the way to deescalate and disolve conflicts this is the way to escalate and exacerbate conflicts at the same time it sounds like the relationship between Netanyahu and Biden is deteriorating it's a low e as uh our correspondent in Washington said so how is that going to impact uh what happens here and how the US tries to control or manipulate Israel in terms of what's going happen next well I mean Biden uh is now in a more serious position that where he can really claim leadership and take a position he's now from free from the constraints of the US elections he's not running for the US elections he made many threats during the past months to Netanyahu to try to intervene and take take a position to stop Israel but he has never delivered instead he's sending more weapons and is supporting more more money and more diplomatic protection you can't you can't run this kind of diplomacy while you're sending uh more arms at the same time you are asking them to stop so this is it's it's a contradiction that the US Administration is doing and it's unfortunate that um Israel is making the call here and the US Administration is paying the bill the is the financial The Diplomatic and think of the credibility the image of the US uh the US is is isolated on this conflict on the way the stage uh where now nanahu is the only place where he is received is the US Congress no parliament in the world is willing to receive a war criminal that's wanted by the IC except the US Congress this is extremely embarrassing and extremely isolating for the US for for for the US Administration to be in this position but instead it seems that Netanyahu is making the call and uh is conducting and is executing his plans and the US here is um coming to serve and to to prevent Iran from responding and to pay the cost of the bill that's that's an equation the US Administration should never accept when Netanyahu makes the decision to escalate and assassinate in Iran and in Lebanon which is something that Biden opposed at least on the RoR level on that level then he should bear the responsibility should take the the the consequences of his own actions not that he makes the call and then Biden comes to to support him and to serve and to pay the cost for that we'll have to leave it there but as always we really do appreciate your insight into all of this that's ibr frad for us there thank you thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
