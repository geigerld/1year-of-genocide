just two days after Israel killed seven Aid workers in Gaza an Al jazer investigation has found they were intentionally targeted the Israeli military launched three consecutive air strikes against the world Central kitchen workers despite being told of their movement reports also suggest Israeli military officers and soldiers in Gaza routinely act on their own violating Army regulations and proper chain of command one Israeli newspaper has quoted Israeli Army sources as saying in Gaza everyone does as he pleases the world Central Kitchen a agency Convoy was struck as it left a Food Warehouse in darab Bala on Monday six of the victims were foreign Nationals and one was Palestinian well here is what Al jaz's investigation has revealed World Central Kitchen says it's three vehicles left the warehouse here in der Al Bala sometime around 10:30 p.m. local time on April 1st the Convoy just over 4 kilm making it to rashed Street along the coast Witnesses say the first vehicle was hit by a missile here just before 10:45 p.m. the injured was seen being transferred from the first car to the second armored vehicle the second car made it 800 M south from the first attack when it was bombed to photos clearly show it was hit straight through the roof by a projectile from above the Third vehicle in the Convoy made it a further 1600 M down the road before it was hit by a third and final strike also through its roof let's discuss all these developments now with Omar asur professor of security and Military studies at The doai Institute for Graduate Studies good to have you again with us on set Omar um let's talk about this report in harit which uh talks about a disconnect between what the Israeli Army says and what actually happens on the ground in Gaza are we in a situation where soldiers in Gaza are setting the rules for themselves it's it's complicated so the Israeli Army has a history of uh what we call Mission command so uh giving the uh allowing junian officers to make um decisions uh in the battlefield without going back to the senior uh commanders it's a very Israeli way of warfare and they learned it from from the Germans from the verm who was fighting they used to call it out TRS tactique which is the mission type tactics so devolve usually to the junior officers to have more tactical aggression and uh more rapid decision making in terms of the combat situation so that can Will yield tactical aggression and will yield some tactical and operational victories but also will yield uh trigger happy soldiers who may shoot the wrong people and in the case of the Israelis in Gaza you had wrong people such as civilians uh tens of thousands of them you had wrong people such as the aid workers you had wrong people such as as the hostages and also you had a lot of Friendly Fire the rate of Friendly Fire death is in uh in the in the Gaza war is about one in five So 20% of the Israeli soldiers killed were killed by their own colleagues not by the adversaries so this is uh one issue and it's not just Gaza it has a very long history it has a long history that's quite interesting so it's not necessarily a lack of discipline from the soldiers on the ground but rather something that's ingrained in the system itself that makes it uh possible to have so much collateral damage yeah it is an Israeli way of warfare uh but also what makes it more and more um um obvious in this case is one uh there is no ramifications for um so it keeps happening because there's no accountability and no consequences for yeah and also it has a history Ariel Shon who violated many many rules was still a decorated General as opposed to a court Marshal officer which he would have been in any NATO army or any other Army um and also uh the other thing is that uh in in this particular case uh we don't see much uh uh internal procedures uh when when these violations happen and apparently there is um a a hinted unspoken um shall we say structural to tolerance of of getting the wrong what is the motivation though ultimately when they target Aid workers when they target uh hospitals medical workers ambulances and so on we've heard franches albanesi the UN special repur say that Israel is doing this deliberately targeting Aid workers to scare uh humanitarian uh workers from going into Gaza to starve the population of Gaza deliberately is that the intention here e think it it's very difficult to determine the intention but it is possible it could be a way of uh what you can call Strategic bombardment so or the D Doctrine in the Israeli way of War which uh means basically punishing the civilian population by targeting the infrastructure by targeting uh some of the uh civilian assets to punish the civilians uh because they permitted uh attacks from their from the territories and this was conducted in Lebanon and and it seems to be conducted on steroids in in in Gaza so this is possible but it's still too early to determine what is the intention and also it's very difficult because it it TR needs either independent investigators or uh a sincere uh internal investigations by the Israeli armies and both both are not going to happen at at least at the moment thank you very much Omar as always good to get your thoughts s Alish from the Doha Institute of Graduate Studies
