let's now speak to Harry foret he's joining us live now from our London Bureau Harry first of all we're hearing that the EU has frozen Aid to the Palestinians what does this mean well it means an immediate end to one of the major sources of funding for uh Palestinian uh institutions for the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank as well it's come from the head of EU enlargement at the European commission Oliver veli uh he said the scale of Terror and brutality against Israel and its people is a turning point and so we're talking about $728 Million worth of Aid that is immediately Frozen now this is money that goes uh some of it to Gaza the The Lion Share to the occupied West Bank uh it goes a significant proportion to the unra organization the United Nations relief and works Agency for Palestinian refugees uh which looks after education for uh many children among other things now uh the Israelis have long complained about some of the syllabus content of some of those schools and so there is some reference I think to that point later in his statement that he made on X formerly Twitter saying that the foundations for peace tolerance and coexistence must now be addressed incitement to hatred violence and glorification of Terror have poisoned the minds of too many he says uh that been some push back uh under that Twitter comment that ex comment uh with people talking about Collective punishment because of course the attacks that were carried out on Saturday were carried out by the fighters of Hamas uh fat which is in charge of the Palestinian Authority is a rival faction of course um and as well as this from the EU in terms of its uh sort of global Aid to the Palestinians there are also bilateral deals between member countries of the EU and Palestinian institutions Germany announcing that it is also uh putting an a temporary end to those as well it is suspending them uh the minister in charge said that she wouldn't talk about freezing them but it was reviewing them and a temporarily suspended them that's a a total over the this year and the next year of some $264 million and Austria has done the same thing as well about $20 million worth of Aid in that case the foreign minister of Austria also saying the extent of the terror is so horrific that we can't go back to business as usual and Harry just on another note we're seeing a lot of disruption to international travel what's happening as far as you're aware on that front yes well a number of uh United States Airlines had over the weekend announced that they were uh suspending their flights to and from benan airport the Tel Aviv airport uh the United Airlines American airlin Delta as well and more airlines are being added to that list Air France Emirates LT hanser there have been disruptions and changes to the schedule for Virgin out of London British Airways is maintaining its service but is changing uh its schedule to earlier flights saying it is keeping uh its flights under review other airlines as well have suspended or at least cancelled flights so this isn't obviously just about tourism it's also about isra citizens and indeed a number of Palestinians who have dual nationality uh many of whom especially recently for the Palestinians had been using the airport in Tel Aviv because of a new US Visa waiver program which presumably is going to be very seriously affected by what's going on uh and a lot of Israelis have dual nationality as well so this is a major disruption to a large number of people who who have family and sort of alternative bases uh from which they May well find it much more difficult to get to and from okay Harry thanks very much indeed for bringing us the latest there from London
