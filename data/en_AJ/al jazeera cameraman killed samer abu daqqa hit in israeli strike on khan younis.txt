luchano zakara is an associate professor of golf politics at the golf studies Center of qar University he joins us now in the studio thanks very much for being with us so um what's happened here does remind us once once again of of of just how dangerous this job is not not only in general but in this uh particular uh war and that the the the journalists that are reporting from Gaza are doing a lot more reporting they are they are living through what's going on there just as much as everyone else is yeah exactly I mean uh being uh War reporter is a very dangerous uh uh profession but here in gasa is becoming particularly dangerous as the report has been saiding not only the reporters that the most of them I mean considering that more than 60 or 70 people already died already journalist died but their families are dying because they are living the same place that they are have been bombed which is showing that there is no profession or no uh Place safe in gasa right now being journalist being doctor you go to work and you don't know if you come back if you be going to be killed or if your family that you left behind because you went to to work is going to be killed this is the case that we are witnessing uh nowadays uh the couple of or last month journalist of Al jair lost all his family we all know journalist not only from Palestinian but from many countries that they have relatives that they are living in gasa that they lost their lives ER and they know they knew about that when they were working when they were reporting about the gasa War Yeah you mentioned there um the Al's gar of bureau chief who lost so many members of his family yet he continues to do the job and he U suffered injuries uh as well in this um attack and uh he is hopefully recovering from those injuries in hospital because he was he was able to get to um a hospital uh and yet the fact that he he continues to do this um it is it is incredible that that they find the determination to carry on after all of this yeah exactly I mean I mean this is a very um uh I mean the spirit of these people that they are still there working on doing their their job trying to report considering all the already uh problematic situations that they are witnessing uh I mean how to deal with the with with the emotions because they are reporting about their own people they're reporting even their about their own families I mean if you reporting about a a bomb uh that just exploded one neighborhood you are noticing that it's close to your place or close to your family close to your relatives friends Etc the situation is much more complicated we are not talking about journalists that they are traveling to another country to report we are talking about journalists that they live they belong uh to that to that uh to that same to the same place and that they have their family there so I think uh it's not something that is happening out of the blue as many reports are saying that they have been specifically targeted but as I said before there is no profession that is safe now being journalist being security agent being a um I mean someone who produce food or bread or whatever I mean doctors nurses are all being uh targets uh so basically everybody is is not safe they in gasa right now luchano good to get your thoughts on this appreciated thank you very much now
