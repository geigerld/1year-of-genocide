let's turn to some breaking news now the deputy assistant secretary for Israeli Palestinian Affairs at the US state department Andrew Miller has resigned he's citing family reasons and said if it weren't for family responsibilities he would have stayed on to fight for what he believes in multiple officials have resigned from the state department over the Biden Administration stance on the war in Gaza well let's go to mam bashara Al jazer senior political analyst he's joining us now from Paris M Andrew Miller has been a skeptic of the administration's approach to this conflict from this beginning his colleagues are saying that he would have fought for his beliefs if he felt he could have see he's saying he hasn't seen his family hardly in the last eight months he's not the first to resign but certainly the most senior I understand with this portfolio well look I mean judging from The Washington Post uh reporting on his resignation clearly there's more to it than uh family obligations clearly this is a thankless job uh to be a state department official uh presided on by secretary Anthony blinkin who basically has man manipulated and monopolized decision making in a way that left very little room for the uh you know for the diplomats who've been working there for decades or for years or the Specialists within the state department if you're not a hardcore Zionist in blink's State Department there is no point being there if you're not passionate about supporting Israel or have been paid in order to support Israel or have been appointed through some kind of an APAC arm of some sort or some kind of those uh you know Washington Insider groups that are meant to be supportive of Israel then it's a terribly thankless job because if you thought uh 37,000 people killed uh by Israel with the support of the United States is taking place and you can do nothing about it what's the point of being there m this is coming as a bit of a blow surely to others who've been trying to change policy from within I see a number of officials who've resigned not just from the state department but also the Pentagon other other parts of government they've been trying to come together in recent weeks is that likely to make any sort of a difference you remember we've seen many different statements people signing them uh not exactly uh you know officially or publicly a lot were Incognito because of how this could translate in terms of their um you know future careers in Washington so it's not surprising to me uh that Miller and others would quit what's surprising to me is that dozens of others are not quitting because seriously we haven't seen anything as suspicious as thankless as uh Biden blink's policy on Gaza whereby the Biden Administration and its officials are continuously humiliated by their junior Partners in the Israeli government who just until just what couple of couple of days ago humiliating the Biden Administration cooking up lies about armed supplies trying once and again uh to humiliate the Biden Administration in a way uh uh to prepare perhaps to for a trump Administration when in fact blinkin uh has done so much for Netanyahu and his government of Fanatics you would think that blinkin would have probably been Israel's Secretary of State not Americar aler Senor political analyst there thank you for sharing your thoughts on this SM
