America has shown unwavering support for Israel's war on Gaza critics say this highlights its double standards and could be a turning point in the world order is the US strategy shortsighted what damage could the war inflict on America's Global standing this is Inside [Music] Story hello there I'm James Bay Washington's steadfast support for Israel's allout assault on Palestinians in Gaza is Shifting Global perceptions several analysts and Arab leaders have warned the US risk severe reputational damage in the region if it continues to back Israel while its forces bomb hospitals schools and refugee camps initially Western Powers were United in their support for Israel's right to self-defense after the Hamas offensive in early October but the sheer magnitude of the destruction and killing in Gaza has seen several countries change their stance and the Biden Administration has been criticized for failing to pressure Israel to declare a ceasefire the US is no longer the world's only superpower the emergence of several new alliances could challenge American dominance so where does this leave the US on the international stage in this first national address following Israel's war on Gaza last month President Joe Biden acknowledged the significance of the war for the United States we're facing an inflection point in history one of those moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come American leadership is what holds the world together American alliances what keep us America safe American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with to put all that at risk if we walk away from Ukraine if we turn our backs on Israel it's just not worth it a recent poll shars the majority of Americans nearly 70% backer Ceasar in Israel's war on Gaza this is significant particularly ahead of the 2024 elections as the US gives Israel nearly $4 billion dollar in military aid every year accusations of hypocrisy are another challenge for the Biden administrations critics say the US has double standards it's focused on human rights in Ukraine but disregards them in Gaza China and Russia have long called for a change in the global order questions are being raised about other countries looking to form new alliances will team up with them to challenge Western dominance well let's bring in our panel of guests to discuss this further in Boston Ramy kurri Isam farz Institute distinguished fellow at the American University of Beirut Ramy is also the author of a US pivot away from the Middle East fact or fiction in London Samuel Romani an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute and a milit milit and geopolitical analyst and in Washington DC James Jeffrey a former US ambassador to Iraq and Tura and chairperson of the Middle East program at the Wilson Center thank you gentlemen for joining us today on the Inside Story program we just heard President Biden there let me just remind you what he said we are facing an inflection point in history one of the moments where the he was speaking four weeks ago on October the 20th um Ambassador Jeffrey I'm gonna call you James from now on um do you agree with him I do why uh the core American role in the world since 1947 48 and we have had many different roles is to maintain a global collective security system to ensure that major Global actors do not start snuffing out States destroying or use hamas's language extinguish Other Nation States because that puts us down the road to World War I and World War II that is the most important issue for US foreign policy um Joe Biden sees it and he's absolutely right okay Ramy curri that was two weeks into the war we're now six weeks into the war rather a lot has changed the death toll in Gaza has risen dramatically Al it's not even being counted anymore Israel has besieged hospitals and ra ra and raided the biggest one um Israel's also displaced two-thirds of gaza's population and the UN is now saying there's the risk of starvation and chronic disease do you think Biden now finds himself on the wrong side of History I think he probably does I don't I don't think Biden or American leaders really understand history that's the real problem they've had so little of it themselves in terms of global engagements other than military engagements uh and trade and so there's a real problem in how the United States deals with the world i' I've used the phrase that the US deals with the world as markets or targets markets for trade and targets to attack or to sanction um and the the record of the United States since World War II uh has not been uh very good in terms of using its military in Vietnam and Afghanistan and Iraq and Syria and other places so the and and it supports these autocratic countries all over the third world so instead of preserving the states as as Ambassador Jeffrey said the United States is actually helping autocratic regimes uh Hollow their States from within if you look at places like Egypt and and other places around the world that the US supports severely and we see the consequences of its allout support for Israel which is expanding tension and and warfare and and the US sending huge amounts of military hardware to to the region so there's a real problem in how the US analyzes and engages with uh the world Samuel that speech in the Oval Office was also about the war in Ukraine you've written the book Putin's war on Ukraine you're a chronicler of the last 20 months in Ukraine we'll get to all the detail of that in a minute but on the the the inflection point in history do you agree with Biden well I think that obviously Russia's full scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 was an inflection point in modern European history it was the most Brazen assault on the sovereignty of a European States since the end of the second world war and Russia has also described as an inflection point for the broader Global Order when you look at the statements from sery LA or Demitri Mia you very often see that this invasion of Ukraine is the start of a challenge to the US Le Global Order and and the start of a new multi-polar order led by Russia and China but also empowering the broader Global South and Biden I think is touching upon the fact that now sovereignty is being breached in a more flagrant fashion and that's definitely a problem for the Post Cold War order but there are obviously also American double standards as Ramy pointed out that make his message even though accurate on the sovereignty question a bit hard for many across the world to pet James if I can ask you about the bombardment of Gaza and the scale of the bombardment of Gaza among the high level jobs that you have held um in the US system you were the US Special representative for Syria and the uh presidential Envoy for the global coalition to counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Isis isil um and I know you took up those jobs after the battle of raka but if we compare what happened in raqa to what happened um in in um Gaza um there were 1,600 civilians killed in the US Coalition air and artillery strikes now I know those aren't us figures they're figures from from Amnesty International and from Air Wars but even if you take those figures perhaps you dispute them that means that Israel has killed 10 times that number in just six weeks and the the ra the raka campaign went on for 11 months uh that's correct and there are reasons for it I would also say a better example because it's a bigger city was mosul which I also um have looked at closely in 2016 2017 where there are some 10,000 civilian casualties uh first of all uh Israel did not have the time that we had in 201617 or 201 18 and Beyond with the Islamic State it's mobilized it's in part of its entire Workforce it is facing possible escalation uh in the north possibly from Iran and so it moved in in a very very Rapid Way that the nature of Gaza and I've been there I've seen no place in the world that is more crowded with more people and hamas's uh true policy of using uh civilians as human Shields putting their uh installations inside these areas uh has led to these high casualties uh what the administration uh is trying to do is to minimize these particularly now that the Israelis have seized control of most of the north of Gaza but do you think these High casualties are too high are you uneasy about them James anybody who is not uneasy about casualties particularly civilian casualties uh is not you know uh looking at this in a humane way uh but I also look at what are the Alternatives I also know if we're going to talk about casualties because I was involved in most of these wars uh some million people killed in Iraq Syria uh Yemen uh since 2003 uh and 15 million displaced uh this is an extremely dangerous region or it has been last 20 years uh and uh it requires as soon as possible uh much more stabilization much more security than we have right now but of course the US Prides itself on respecting the rules-based international order doesn't it Ramy and some of those Central rules are the rules of war the Geneva conventions um isn't Israel with its indiscriminate bombing breaking those most fundamental of rules yes it's clearly it is and many respected International groups independent credible groups have said so and and people in the Arab side have broken these rules as well people in turkey and everywhere so this is very very common the problem is that these rules were made by Victorious countries after World War I in World War II and they really are not followed very uh very diligently uh Ambassador James was correct to say that you know in the last 20 years we've had all these really messy situations in the region but I would argue that in the last the one of the reasons for this is for the last 200 years since Napoleon we've had almost non-stop Western military direct intervention uh or manipulation uh of States uh and sovereignties uh economic systems military ties and uh leaderships uh in throughout the whole uh Middle East so there's a real serious problem in the uh integrity and the efficacy of statehood and sovereignty and citizenship across most of the Arab countries and other countries uh in the Middle East and foreign direct military involvement is one of the reasons uh for this as well as local reasons and particularly the continuation of 100 Years of Zionist expansion ISM settlement settler Colonial partti expansion which has reached the peak now in Israel's policies the government policies not freelance Rogues the government's policies in Gaza and in the in the West Bank so that at some point the world has to uh stop issuing platitudes and really get serious uh if you want stability and peace you have to do what happened in Northern Ireland uh and in southern Africa and a few other places where tough decisions were made to change existing patterns and policies and bring about real uh security and peace because it was based on Justice for All there's no sign of that in the in the region and there's certainly no sign of it in the last 30 40 Years of the United States monopolizing Arab Israeli peacemaking and it would be a catastrophe if the US again led the search for a permanent resolution after the fighting in Gaza and the West Bank by the way after it stops James I saw you smile or laugh um when Ramy was talking about settler colonialism why um uh for the last 200 years uh Western military Powers have moved into the entirety of the North and South America all of South uh uh uh subsaharan Africa and entirely of East Asia except for part of China and uh that's a reality all around the world not just in the Middle East nowhere else do we see any I underline anything like the Carnage we have seen in the Middle East um not just the last 20 years but think of the 1980s with the Iran Iraq war with the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and other conflicts it is an extremely unstable uh region whose political leadership and uh possibly outside uh intervention uh is not uh worthy of the people who are suffering uh uniquely in this region now I've had on this program in the last six weeks we don't have an international lawyer here but I've had one on many many days and I haven't yet found one who doesn't believe that Israel is probably breaking International humanitarian law in other words committing war crimes Samuel you're there in London are the US's allies getting uncomfortable about this well I think that we're starting to notice obviously some efforts to distance from US policy towards Israel the unconditional support I think early on within the European Union there were a few voices like Ireland and Spain who are really calling for an immediate ceasefire or really challenging Israel's conduct in Gaza and now we're seeing more countries follow that way I think Emanuel macron's uh vote against the United States and the United Nations General Assembly over the Arab peace resolution that was sponsored by Jordan and then comments about the killing of children and women is suggestive of that Rift even in Britain itself I think the dismissal of su rman was largely also linked to this kind of unconditional support for for for Israel being challenged at DEC gra Britain has also been a bit more cautious certainly voting against the US on the settlement issue abstaining on other resolutions so there definitely is frictions within the Western Alliance block but those frictions really haven't boiled over there's only a small number of states like Spain and Ireland they're still calling for a ceasefire within the collective West now Biden as commander-in Chief has sent an Amad to the region by my count its two aircraft carriers at least 10 warships a nuclear submarine A detachment of Marines and numerous fighter aircraft but if he's trying to look strong the problem is that every time he says something to Israel Israel is not listening on humanitarian pauses on bringing more Aid in on bringing fuel in now finally they're going to a little bit of fuel on what happens at the end of this bringing the Palestinian Authority in would you agree Ramy yeah I think there's a real dilemma for the United States that it is the only country that Israel really trusts therefore it has to be centrally involved in any kind of effort for peacemaking that might be revived but the Dilemma is that it's also the major backer of the U of the Barbarian policies that Israel the medieval Siege and destruction policies starvation that Israel is now implementing and and the settler Colonial AP partide system that Zionism introduced into this region starting in the late 1880s and continues today you see it in the West Bank and in Gaza it's an extraordinary Legacy of non-stop uh violence designed to house the Palestinian indigenous Palestinians who were 93 94% of the population 100 years ago in Palestine and and the Israeli Zionist Israeli aim is to have a Jewish State they succeeded they created the Jewish majority state but they haven't stopped and this is one of the the reasons that people in the Middle East but also really most of the third world most of the South don't believe or trust the United States when it says we want a two-state solution I wish the US really did work for a genuinely Equitable two-state resolution of the conflict that addresses the core needs of both sides we've offered the Arab world has offered that many times in peace agreements peace offers uh but the US has a real problem it's it's it can't be a peacemaker if it's the principal uh backer of the War maker your views on that James um he certainly has a point with this uh Israeli government uh it is hard to imagine a government that has views more different than those of Joe Biden but I would say that uh that's this government there's a history to this uh the United States did support very strongly the Oslo Accords and uh President Bill Clinton put much of his presidency on the table to try to get one uh Clinton's View and he has repeated it many times is that uh there was a deal in 2000 yat to town well the speech that we spoke about at the beginning of the program four weeks ago in the Oval Office wasn't just about the war in Gaza it was also about the war in Ukraine and you could argue that this is President zelinsky's worst nightmare what we've uh seen right now listen to what he said in a recent interview of course course Russia understands that now when Focus from Ukraine taken off and when this Focus to the Middle East and when they try to divide the world in this crisis Israel palestin crisis and of course of course Russia is very happy with this war so what they want they just want to divide the world so president zelinsky there Samuel this is his worst nightmare isn't it the attentions gone away that means that the money and the weapons probably aren't going to come in the same numbers well I think it's more of a political rather than actual military necessity construct in fact Biden has repeatedly said that the United States is the most powerful country in the world it's the only superpower it can arm both Israel and Ukraine at once but in practice being so actively involved into two Wars and also upgrading the US industrial Machinery to something of a war footing is very very difficult to do in an election and we're already seeing the outcomes of that leading to a squeeze on supplies to Ukraine Congress has admitted that Congress holding up the Ukraine Israel Aid bill has led to the White House having to admit that there's going to be smaller Aid packages coming forward and that Aid will be finite and we're also seeing problems with the delivery of artillery shells especially because Israel has asked for and appears to have gotten the 57,5 mm shells going their way and those shells are directly diverted from Ukraine to the Israelis so there is a significant uh draw down of support at a time when Ukraine's CER events have installed and the Russians are escalating events of operations in ABA so seninsky is very worried James I mean we come back to the allegations of double standards now I think because Biden has called what Russia's doing a genocide he's condemned attacks on hospitals by Russia he's condemned bombings of civilians by Russia and he's condemned the force transfer of civilians by Russia people will be asking why is Gaza different uh people should and the fault is Joe Biden uh much as I like him and enjoyed working for him uh he gets too effusive I was a th% behind everything he has done the International Community has done for Ukraine but I and I know the Russians well from Syria and elsewhere but I was very unhappy when we're using such language war criminal and uh uh genocide against the Russians because I knew this would come back and haunt us uh this is aggression as spelled out in the nurg trials against uh the state of Ukraine just like uh what we had on the 7th of October was aggression against the state of Israel both purposes were to wipe out those States that's the issue uh I was nervous about genocide then I remained nervous about genocide being used in the context of uh uh Israel let's look at Russia's position on global events Ramy um of course it's not any longer a superow but perhaps it's been boyed by the war in Gaza seems to have thrown aside its careful diplomacy with Israel for years and taken quite a strong position on this war um you could say there are ACC accusations of hypocrisy there as well oh absolutely most big powers are professional Hypocrites it's it comes with the DNA of political leadership in the western world and probably in in the South as well this is normal uh but so I don't think we should worry about what people say and if it contradicts what they do that this applies to to everybody I think the bigger question here and this is what the US and Biden are really having to confront and they're not confronting it uh is is the United States mandated by anybody to be the U the maintainer of the global order you said in the beginning the us well I think Jim said that the US wants to maintain the postor War I order it's it's true that the US probably wants to do that but nobody has given it that mandate the UN has the mandate to do that and the United States is facing and Biden is facing a real serious problem which is going to hurt more than anything else which is his Democratic party is fracturing and it's fracturing along age lines generational lines the young people are wildly against what is happening happening in in in Palestine and Gaza and the West Bank with direct American support and the uh the pressures are going to imple impact the democ Democratic parties and Biden's electoral fortunes uh in the elections likely next year if things don't change so we have domestic pressures we have international pressures and I don't think the United States leadership uh has the ability uh uh to address these issues in any coherent way it'll it'll continue to bring in the Navy and the and the Air Force and send in the special forces and and talk in apocalyptic ways about its god-given mission to uh to support the good people in the world so this this has very little credibility anymore but the world can't do much about it when the United States uses its power the way it does so that we need a much more sophisticated Global Coalition of like-minded decent countries and the US is a decent country except when it comes to uh its foreign policy which is military based and supporting autocrats but we need a better International mechanism uh to uh achieve uh Global Order and that can only be based on social justice and equal rights for all parties and this is not what Israel and Zionism are about and this is not what the United States has supported in practice and words of course they support it in practice they don't okay uh James I don't want to I'm coming to it right at the end I don't want to leave China out of this discussion it is the other major power in the world how do you think China sees the war on Gaza because traditionally it's not been its sphere of influence but we have seen them involved in the region particularly with regard to that rosma between Saudi Arabia and Iran um briefly China wants stability in the region it's not ready to play a big military or diplomatic role and it needs the Region's hydrocarbons but more importantly and this gets to everything we've been hearing look what's happened in the last few days China has met with President Biden uh the Chinese caved on an important American demand which is military uh Communications but even more importantly for the first time in eight years China several weeks ago agreed to talk about ballistic nuclear missiles with the United States why because what China sees is if the United States is going to back Ukraine if it's going to back uh Israel it will also back Taiwan this is a serious International play or we take it seriously so when I hear about the global South and US losing International opinion I say how is China treating us now they're treating us like a very serious important uh partner Ramy finally to you um given their very important partner do you think China and the other world powers are going to let at the end of this conflict the US run the show as they have done in the past yes the two US is talking about a two-state solution but it sort of abandoned the idea of a two-state solution and went round the Palestinians in recent years yeah of course and everything the US has done in terms of its policies to Israel and the Palestinians in the region and the last 20 years has allowed the two-state solution to die away under the weight of Israeli non-stop settlements uh but the the world China and others are going to try to play a more constructive role if they can China already has done things between Iran and Saudi Arabia and other things in the region but the reality is that nothing will happen in Arab Israeli diplomacy without the us being somewhere near the center of it because they're the only people the Israelis trust and this is this is one of the problems we have so I think there has to be a more serious search for a multilateral approach that allows the US to maintain a central role but tempers its negative uh attitudes and and War making and pro-israeli sentiments tempers those so that both the Arabs and the Israelis can actually achieve equal rights and this is what really we have to look for everywhere um in the world and this can only happen with the international mandates it can't be a unilateral decision by the US saying we want to do this so I would look for more activism by global powers to see what they can do thank you Ramy very much and thanks to all our panelists for joining us today Ramy curri Samuel Romani and Ambassador James Jeffrey 24 hours a day Al jazer will continue to report on the war on Gaza with our reporters around the world in Israel in the occupied West Bank and on the ground in Gaza you'll also find more
