we begin with breaking news from Gaza where Israeli forces are carrying out a raid on gaza's largest hospital alifa they've asked everyone to gather in the courtyard in preparation for the evacuation from the medical complex earlier the director of Health said he'd heard gunfire and the movement of Israeli tanks inside the complex there are reports that an Israeli air strike had hit the fourth floor of the main building well days of Asian air strikes have crippled elifa which is situated in Gaza City in the north more than 3,000 patients medical staff and displaced Palestinians are Sheltering in the complex at least 11,300 Palestinians have been killed since October the 7th doctors say patients at alifa are at critical risk dozens of premature babies were transferred on Tuesday within the facility to an area with electricity but they're not in incubators because oxygen supplies have run out let's speak now to Han Mahmud he joins us now live from hanun inside the Gaza Strip Hy good to see you what is the latest that you're hearing about this Israeli Raid inside alifa Hospital yes well uh as we know within the past few days the aifa hospital complex has been brought to uh crippling Point under heavy uh air strikes and bombardment and tank shells and as of early hours of this morning is really special forces uh under heavy cover of gunfire and tank shells has raided uh the uh aifa hospital and what they are doing now they're conducting this aggressive search room by room Corridor by Corridor uh uh all the way to the basement of the hospital uh to searching for uh uh what they what is really has claimed so far based on their intelligence or what the or in addition to American intelligence that the shifa hospital houses a a a command center for uh Hamas leadership and Hamas element carrying out their their operation and this is not the first time we hear that we heard it since the beginning of the war and also in the past that sha hospital was at the spotlight of these uh these claims so far there are no uh concrete uh evidence of what the Israeli claims uh uh put forward uh but what what really frustrating about these rid that we have some of the most vulnerable group of people inside the hospital babies who were have been taken off the uh the incubators we have those critically injured we have patients with a chronic disease and some of them having they need that oxygen they need electricity to stay in the Intensive Care Unit uh on top of that uh there are electronic Gates Now set up around the uh V around the buildings of the hospital where evacuees those who took took the hospital as a refuge Sheltering from the heav bombardment are asked individually they are interrogated and then they're taking uh and forced to take their clothes off and sat in groups in at the court uh at the courtyard of the hospital and as since last night the weather hasn't changed it's getting a little colder there is rain so there's some inhumane conditions going on with those evacuees being interrogated pulled out of the building and sat outside uh uh with almost uh their they close off in at the the courty yard of the hospital uh there are talks about these really are making uh these uh they're providing medical some medical supplies and incubators for the babies is just the questions uh Al always the practicality of this this has come after three uh four three days of heavy bombardment of the hospital and its facility destroying much of its uh its necessities and and an intensive care unit and incubator those babies needed right away to be in in incubators but after 3 days uh we don't see the how practical this going to be but the situations are getting very very uh critical at the hospital now yeah you you the Israelis are talking have been talking about getting incubators uh to alifa but the issue as far as I understand it is not the lack of incubators it is the lack of oxygen uh what is the latest you can tell me about the fate of these 36 babies I believe uh who were recently moved uh to another room are they all still alive well we know those babies are already in danger they were born at a a premature station they needed to be in incubators they need all the Necessities they need that flow of oxygen to stay alive and to sustain their growth but for the past 3 days we know there was no oxygen the pipe the station next to the uh the incubators was destroyed 3 days ago there's no flow of oxygen what doctors uh have resorted to is just a very old methods to uh keep those babies alive by wrapping them with multiple layers of of a blank but this is so far is not helping us not provide them with the suitable environment that they needed to grow and we know those baby have to be inside those incubators so the talk about now they they're bringing those incubators okay how about the oxygen how are you going to provide that is there is is there a pipeline for oxygen or are you going to fix that station uh that generates oxygen so there are a lot of question mark about this and my fear is that this is all I mean there is a lot of publicity about this going on but how practical it is and based on what we heard from doctors in the shifa hospital it's not going to uh to help at all it's been a three days those babies are out of incubators those critically injured are not getting the immediate medical intervention and the in the Intensive Care Unit and now the talk about medical supplies and incubators it it doesn't seem to help at all other than the publicity it's it's getting right and honey I wanted to also uh find out a bit more about the humanitarian situation uh of the people that have moved from the north to the south in hunis you are I understand that there was some heavy rain yesterday A lot of these people obviously living in makeshift tents uh the rain would have caused a lot of uh uh problems yes absolutely the the rain has unfortunately uh made the conditions for these people for evacuees very bad as we most of these people here at the hospital for example the vast majority of vacu as the number triple every family tried to set up those a plastic Shack or plastic tent uh to just to stay in it but with the Heavy Rain uh most of these uh tent have drowned and with water inside their on on mattresses on their the equipment that they manag to get with them it just the situations are not very very suitable for for for humans uh right now and people who are in the streets who don't have any of these uh uh uh elements at all no tents no uh survival items with them so in our way to the hospital we've seen a example of how people are just standing in the rain trying to hide under a tree or under a balcony but it's it doesn't help the the rain was so heavy and and it just it drowned most of the areas and we really know infrastructure in Gaza suffered a lot due to the heavy bombardment and the the air strike and and even before that it was it was reported that uh the infrastructure needed lots of work just to to be suitable for for people living uh around here uh but unfortunately the situations are are getting really worse what what makes it more uh worse now is that the lack of of supplies we're talking about there is no gas for example propane gas is running out as well so people have no way of of setting up those uh uh uh a special uh object to just to warm thems in this cold weather uh they don't have let's say uh enough food supplies to stay healthy they don't have medical supplies uh just to run the the necessary intervention to fight for example the flu or or cold okay thank you so much for your reporting and that update hanim Mahmud there
