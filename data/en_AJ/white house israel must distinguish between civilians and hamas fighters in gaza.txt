bit earlier we were talking about the US National Security adviser Jake Sullivan and what he's been saying he told CBS news that Israel has obligations under international law let's have a listen we have seen thousands of Palestinian civilians killed in this conflict that that is a tragedy each and every one of those individual deaths is a tragedy and that the life of every civilian Palestinian Israeli anyone is sacred and has to be protected and it is important for Israel to distinguish between going after terrorist targets to take out terrorists who continue to threaten Israel and going after civilians that is an obligation and a responsibility for Israel and it's something that we will continue to press them on Let's cross live now to Washington DC Rob Reynolds is standing by and Rob tell us what more he had to say well uh Jake Sullivan also indicated that President Biden would be uh on the phone speaking to prime minister Netanyahu later today the president's also expected to talk to Regional leaders uh although Sullivan didn't specify which leaders uh he would be uh talking to for discussions that would at least in part involve the some 600 or so uh US citizens who are currently trapped under the bombing in Gaza and uh uh he said that the administ a is committed to getting those people out if they want to leave now a lot of discussion here in the past hour about uh Israel's obligations under na international law and whether uh International pressure could be brought to bear certainly uh if it's true that the administration as Sullivan has been saying is trying to uh thread this needle between giving Israel the leeway that it wants to attack Hamas and on the other side urging Israel trying to persuade Israel not to excessively uh Target civilians or to uh cause civilian casualties um that might be something that comes up in these discussions uh later today but really when one talks about international law where is the International legal police force who enforces international law it's really not a a that kind of a law it's it's an entirely different law that involves uh International public perception and public pressure uh there have been of course as we've noted uh demonstrations popular demonstrations in many places around Europe the Middle East and even here in the United States but uh all of that does not uh amount to the kind of intervention uh that some people are calling for by on the part of the International Community uh against Israel I don't know exactly what sort of intervention that that would be uh certainly not military and it's certainly very unlikely that the United States is going to cut off the supply of Munitions or the billions of dollars that it uh provides to Israel yearly all right Rob thanks for that update Rob Reynolds there at Washington DC
