um Marwan bashara he's Al's senior political analyst he's joining us by Skype from Paris to talk about this uh Marwan Linda Thomas Greenfield uh going through the statements that we've heard before from uh the us about the concern that they have for the number of casualties particularly in Gaza and she did say that Israel has a right to respond to threats but how it does it matters nevertheless it seems as though she was again reiterating the US line that any fault any delay when it comes to negotiations it lies with Hamas rather than with the Israeli government and and it seems to be an encouragement to try to get Hamas to the negotiations but of course that may prove difficult well I tell you I I actually Envy you for the capacity to repeat all of that uh when we all know it's Ground Hog Day every time the UN Security Council convenes and the Americans repeat more of the same the same thing for the English the same thing for the algerians they all seem to be you know um basically political commentators rather than diplomats representing states with the exception perhaps of the Americans and the American ambassador basically read the same sound bites the same lines she did in previous speeches with one difference I'm not sure you've noticed perhaps our viewers around the world did the United States is not just concerned now the United States is deeply concerned that's the difference deeply concerned I'm sure the people in Gaza the children of Gaza are going to sleep better tonight because the United States is deeply concerned while of course repeating more of the same mantras it's very orwellian for the United States to continue to talk about defense and stability and peace and ceasefire and so on so forth while it's edging on financing our ing Israel and here I'm repeating myself shielding Israel at the United Nations supplying it with all the arms it needs to carry is genocide and to carry violations of international law against Lebanon and Iran and to defend it when those countries would want to retaliate this is basically as I said Groundhog Day every day the past 24 times as uh as Gabrielle told us earlier since October 7 the Algerian representative Amar benjar when he was speaking and as I mentioned it was Algeria who called this emergency meeting I was talking at one point about the the attacks that have been going on in the West Bank but also particularly in Gaza he made the point that the attacks would not be possible without the generous support that Israel gets now I'm paraphrasing what he was saying but that was essentially what he was meaning and as I was discussing with Gabriel alzando a correspondent almost at this exact moment the not notification started to come out on the wires that the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has just approved $20 billion worth of a of US military equipment to be delivered to Israel and this is really where we see as you were just talking about the the heart the split if you like in uh the situation that we find ourselves because on the one hand the US is saying that it's concerned about the number of casualties is that Israel has to the right to respond but how it does it matters but at the same time of course it does not stop the flow of military aid to Israel it's truly unprecedented audacity in international relations when it comes to the United States justifying um Israel's crimes and supporting Israel's crimes and arming and financing Israel as it carries its crimes all the while talking about peace stability ceasefire and the concern over it the Deep concern for casualties in GM it's an unprecedented uh audacity it's it's orellan in every possible way but what what is happening in the meanwhile I mean I'm not here none of us is trying to be clever about this in the end of the day you can't really clever out uh death right and destruction and genocide I should say because what is happening is through through these 24 type meetings at the UN Security Council and through the very support that you just spoke about from Anthony blinkin on the likes America send its diplomates to the region now I think three or four of them are going to show up mcer what's his name uh Anthony blinkin and uh and the CI director Bill Burns and perhaps the UN the US National Security advisor they will all be in the Middle East all the while it's sending armadas strike forces the most powerful armadas in the world the biggest aircraft carriers the United States has the Lincoln right so it send the diplomats but it also s the armadas it talks about diplomacy but it's really more or less like gunboard diplomacy right it's just sends in the armadas and threatens everyone around as if the Middle East is its background back backyard the Middle East is two oceans away from the United States but it behaves like it's the Gulf of Mexico it is not the Gulf of Mexico the Middle East is the Middle East American or North American is two oceans away but anyway be as a May and this is my real you know my Essential Point here the United States is allowing Israel to get away with genocide by arming it financing it and shielding it at the United Nations the United States is enabling Israel's genocide and allowing Israel to get away with genocide not only that now it's allowing both the Israeli government and and his prime minister Natan to get away with their war crimes by shielding it by shielding them from the ICC and the icj and the likes and even giving them all kinds of guarantees so that if they do reach a ceasefire their government will not implode because secretly the United States is guaranteeing that Israel can go back to the war after phase one of phase three of three phases of the ceasefire according to two uh Israeli media reports so really all in all it is tragic that we sit here and we try to analyze just to find any light in the end of the tunnel and we find the word deeply concerned instead of just concern while the United States once again is enabling genocide in Palestine Mar we're waiting to hear from the Russian representative to to the UN Security Council so we just want to keep uh asking you some questions until we get to that that point forgive me if I have to to break away if if you're giving me an answer but I want to widen this out a little bit and just talk about the negotiations themselves two things are absolutely evident um Hamas now has a leader y sunar who is in Gaza is when he was alive was the political head of Hamas and he traveled the world as part of these talks in order to be part of the the negotiations Sim is in Gaza he is very unlikely to leave Gaza that's going to slow any process down now Linda Thomas Greenfield saying no Hamas has to be at the table in these talks they have to be represented Q says there will be some sort of representation what kind of impact do you think this is going to have on the effectiveness of whatever talks we're going to see on Thursday uh I'm actually pretty sure analytically and from the various sources and and reports that I've seen that nothing changes with senir being in Gaza and being assassinated and terms of the logistics and in terms of who makes a decision and how Collective is a decision and how it's consensual and institutional within Hamas and why Hamas is in fact a very disciplined group regardless of who's on the head and regardless the geography of where is the person who hates it and I think they already said that uh that that issue is not going to be a problem and they already made some proposal towards how they see this thing needs to move forward in order to end as quickly as possible now having said that let me remind our viewers around the world and let me tell you about the New York Times report today it's a exclusive report in the New York Times and I bet you anything you want that the American ambassador read it just like the English Ambassador and the other ambassadors they read it because it's a very important report in the New York Times that basically says that they got the documents from the various ceasefire uh negotiations from the various uh round tables you know what went on and so on so forth what were the documents and the New York Times concluded that it was Netanyahu Netanyahu Netanyahu that obstructed the progress towards 65 that each and every time he either underlined expanded his conditions or added new conditions for why at least since May when the UN Security Council adopted that extion 2735 for the for the ceasefire Israel has been obstructing its own or its American version of its own ceasefire proposal because nanahu does not want a ceasefire he he didn't want a ceasefire I'm not sure if he's going to be pushed into corner now with Biden basically saying look if you're going to continue to obstruct as the New York Times reports we're going to have to call you out on it this time because Biden basically is not running for reelection and there's a good chance according to at least a number of reports that Biden might call him out on it this time around that he just will not make leave it vague he will not blame Hamas for it he like Galant the Israeli defense minister will call out Natan for being the obstructionist in why the parties why the mediators are not able to reach a ceas fire I want to ask you about the other side of this which is or the other um background to all of this which is of course Iran's threat to respond on behalf of the the assassination of is in tan it's been holding off and holding off there's been a lot of speculation that that response may well come within the next few days as far as I can tell that speculation or that public speculation seems to be coming particularly from the United States um in your assessment is there is it is there anything in the in the suggestion that Iran is holding off doing until it finds out what happens on Thursday or perhaps in the succeeding few days to to try to establish what kind of response and what scale of response if any at all it actually makes depending on whether or not the talks go ahead and if that is the case and I'm jumping ahead a little bit here could that be part of the leverage that the US is perhaps using on Israel to say you can have this deal we'll just give you $20 billion worth of military equipment as well and we can give you a guarantee that Iran is going to either have a limited response or no response at all well uh the answer is yes and yes probably yes and yes probably because already we have one Iranian official talking to to Western wire Services Western media saying that only a ceasefire deal could prevent an Iranian response we don't have that from the acting for minister or from the president but there is some sort of noise from Iran that if you do reach a deal sooner than later this could be a factor of why Iran would not retali at least for the time being right I mean they could also always say that they're postponing not uh not you know not stopping it all together not just freezing it the other thing is that this could be used as a leverage against Israel by the United States or by on itself says you know you you don't want to be punished for your assassination of Han and violation of our sovereignty you going to have to work out the de now and this is important back to my original Point whether there is or there isn't an Iranian strike I am sorry to say that I know this is important and I just answer the question but either way the Israel is getting away with genocide because you just as you just stated they will be rewarded and they are already rewarded with billions tens of billions of dollars and they're going to be rewarded moving forward with normalizations of relations with a good number of powerful Arab countries they're going to be rewarded for moving the ethnic cleansing to Jewish Jerusalem for Vi for violating and consecrating Al aam Masque for annexing territories on the West Bank for beginning to do in the West Bank a version of what they try to do in Gaza so they're going to they're going to get away with genocide in Gaza and because they are doing it with such impunity they're going to probably do it again and again and again throughout Palestine and perhaps in the region because why not if you are an Israeli leader listening to the people at the security Council you would say they're stupid you know I mean what are they saying if you're an Israeli right I'm not saying I'm not projecting here if you're an Israeli Prim say these people are stupid or they think people are stupid they think Palestinians are stupid because they're not doing anything they talk like political commentators and they talk from past past uh you know uh speeches to the can you believe that there still talk about two- State solution and I'm talking about powerful countries like Russia China even the United States like when there's an Israeli government that's committed to know two states when they're committed in every possible way and today they are acting in every possible way to prevent the establishment of Palestinian state so while they talk about being committed to a two-state solution they don't even say well Israel actually reject that while the Palestinian Authority is for it or even Hamas is forign right so here we have a situation whereby Israel is getting away with murder it's getting away with mass murder the Json right and it's that's being allowed because of the impotence of the International Community the weakness of the Arab world the cynicism of Western Powers not over the United States by continue to sell us words while in reality supporting Israel in its genocidal war against the Palestinians from what you've been saying it sounds as though that uh Benjamin Netanyahu is probably as isolated as he has ever been in his uh Prime ministership of uh of Israel um his foreign um supporters are now appearing to if nothing else identify him as the problem um do you think that in the event that there is no solution that is reached as a result of ceasefire negotiations that start on Thursday or at any other time that the the end of netanyahu's tenure in Israel may end up coming about because of internal pressures that that eventually the the people of Israel and his fellow politician will have to draw a line and say enough is enough you are responsible for this and you have to go I actually see uh especially since Natan was invited to speak to both houses of Congress for the fourth time historic he's the only leader in history to speak to both houses of US Congress four times to once again meet with President Biden and once again being met with claps what 53 54 55 five times by American senators and Congressman being you know sealed with embraced at the White House that Netanyahu feels Invincible that Netanyahu now will probably I would think will fire his defense minister who is a member of his own party leud by the way and bring someone else from prop one of the smaller factions on the on the on the on the radical right replace him and even expand his Coalition from 64 to potentially 68 or 7 make sure to subscribe our channel to get the latest news from aler
