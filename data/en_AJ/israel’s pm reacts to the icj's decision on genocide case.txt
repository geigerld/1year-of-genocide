Dage to C the court did not call on Israel to stop its military campaign in Gaza but it also did not throw out the case submitted by South Africa on genocidal intent as Israel requested instead the international court of justice ordered Israel to take steps to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza a ruling that prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quick to dismiss Israel's commitment to international law is unwavering equally unwavering is our sacred commitment to continue to defend our country and defend our people like every country Israel has an inherent right to defend itself the vile attempt to deny Israel this fundamental right is blatant discrimination against the Jewish State going into the proceedings Israel was hoping it could rely on the vote of the six Western judges at the court but vote after vote it became clear that the judges were United in their decisions twice even getting the vote of the Israeli judge on two of the six provisional measures 16 votes to one the state of Israel shall take all measures within its power to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide in relation to members of the Palestinian group in the Gaza Strip but while the court session was underway the war continued in Gaza Israeli tanks targeting the surroundings of ml hospital and air strikes targeting homes where civilians were Sheltering similar tactics made the basis of South Africa's submission to the international court of justice Israel is under pressure internationally but at home public support for the war remains High I think there's a lot of double standards placed on Israel if you look at the UN resolutions throughout the world so many are placed uh uh are in indictments of Israel and countries that are notorious for human rights violations seem to get by without the same scrutiny so I think this is par for course uh for the International Community to place this level of scrutiny on Israel Israelis overwhelmingly think that the Army is using the necessary amount of power in Gaza and that the high number of Civilian casualties is Justified for Israel to reach its goal even if the court did not call for a ceasefire or for Israel to pull out of Gaza this is the first time Israel is stripped of what Palestinians see as impunity at their expense it's not clear if it will abide by any of the rulings or how but for decades Israel has been saying that it has the most moral army in the world the international court of justice deems otherwise and now Israel is requ required to submit a report within a month showing how it complies with these provisional measures H abdulhamid Al jazer Tel Aviv make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
