[Music] we begin in Gaza where the Israeli military has withdrawn most of its troops from the KH can Yunis area in the South however it has left one Brigade behind it's unclear what's behind the move but Israel said a significant force would continue to operate in the rest of the strip it comes six months after Israel launched its war on Gaza and what the international court of justice says is a plausible case of genocide the assault began after Hamas attacked Southern Israel on October the 7th killing more than 1100 people since then Israel's bombardment of the strip has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians nearly half of them children most of the population around 1.7 million people has been displaced another round of ceasefire negotiations is set to resume in Cairo on Sunday an Israeli delegation will attend and Hamas has confirmed it is also sending Representatives let's bring in Rory Chalin he is in occupied East Jerusalem for us and Rory first of all let's talk about troop withdrawal what are we hearing Israel saying about the decision well basically there is just one Brigade of Israeli troops left in the center of Gaza the 98th division which has been doing so much of the fighting in KH Unice for the last four months has been uh withdrawn now the justification is not official but it's being talked about in the Israeli media and essentially what the reasoning behind it is is that the Israeli military believes that that Han Unis operation has been satisfactorily completed the 98th division now needs rest and recuperation and the Israeli military thinks that the best model for its future uh campaigns and missions in Gaza is more smallscale raids that are intelligence-based uh and that positioning of the nahal uh Brigade right in the middle of Gaza means that it's still splits the strip in two it stops people who have been displaced from the north to the South going back uh to their homes which the Israeli military at the moment doesn't want them doing um so it allows the military to do those raids North and do South but maintain a very minimal footprint in in Gaza what does this mean for the Rafa operation well of course it doesn't rule it out because any big assault on Rafa would need a big call up of reservists anyway but it does make it more uncertain and it does perhaps push it further into the future Benjamin Netanyahu has been promising that it will still take place but of course he's under significant International pressure to either cancel that operation or reduce its scope significantly he saying it's going to go the head but he hasn't pulled the trigger on it yet okay and Rory what are we hearing about this delegation going to Cairo for another round of negotiations yeah I think there's perhaps a sense here that there is more momentum behind this particular round of negotiations than there has been for some time at least why do we get that impression well it has been announced today that a high level uh delegation of Israelis is going to Cairo it's leaving and it is going to be engaged in those talks later on this evening it's going to be made up of David B who's the head of mosad it's going to be made up of the head of shinette the internal security organization and it's going to be made up of military Representatives too we understand that that delegation is going to Cairo with what is being described as an expanded mandate what does that mean well this is how it's been uh talked about on Israeli media that expanded mandate means that this delegation has powers of negotiation now previous delegations that have gone to Cairo have gone with very fixed parameters that have been set by the Netanyahu government essentially just to go to Cairo and to listen but not to partake in actual negotiations themselves because the negotiating the the position had been set uh back in Israel this delegation goes with more Powers than previous delegations have gone with and that suggests that there may be a bit of amens in building behind this now Netanyahu is saying that it is not against a deal uh but it is not going to surrender to Hamas it says that any surrender to Hamas Hamas would essentially allow for another October uh the 7th still big gaps between what the Israelis think is acceptable and what Hamas thinks is acceptable but perhaps a bit more hope than in previous rounds of negotiations okay worry many thanks for that update and we'll keep an eye on those negotiations as they get underway in Cairo thanks very much
