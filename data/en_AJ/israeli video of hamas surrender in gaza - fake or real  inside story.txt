an Israeli video apparently shows Hamas Fighters surrendering and handing over weapons in Gaza but critics are dismissing it as staged and part of Israeli propaganda so is the footage real or fake and who gains or loses by circulating it this is Inside Story [Music] hello and welcome to the program I'm s vaner propaganda as a tool of war is a strategy that has been used for years the war in Gaza is no different both sides have been accused of spreading disinformation a video is circulating in Israeli media which purports to show the surrender of some Hamas Fighters but critics say it is staged and they've cast doubt on its authenticity the footage comes as Hamas continues to resist Israel's Relentless assault more than 9 weeks into the conflict and Israel faces growing Global condemnation for killing Palestinian civilians as the death toll reaches 18,000 people killed so is the video an attempt by Israel to deflect accusations of genocide in Gaza and is it real or fake we'll discuss all this but first Finton Monahan's report looking at the footage and the circumstances leading to its Palestinian men stripped and humiliated by Israeli forces one man comes forward and hands over a weapon the Israeli government says these men are Hamas Fighters and that images like this are proof its war in Gaza is succeeding in recent days dozens of Hamas terrorists have surrendered to our forces they are laying down their weapons and handing themselves over to our heroic Fighters but many analysts have cast doubt on the video accusing Israeli forces of staging some elements civilians have been identified among the detainees as of un staff Aid workers and at least one journalist others point the coreographed nature of the clip and even as a piece of propaganda its Effectiveness has been called into question whatever the Israel's intended to do it has backfired disastrously bad regardless of the authenticity of it or not because the images that have gone around the world are images that show men and and and young men and older men stripped down to their underwear they're uh forced to kneel on the ground they have their hands tied behind them what does that remind people of so reminds people of Isis it reminds people of Abu it reminds people of brutality Israel is frequently accused of spreading misinformation the Army maintains these images show large numbers of Fighters surrendering to Israeli troops but Israeli media later reported that only around 1 in 10 had links to Hamas this video shows an Israeli military spokesman alleging a piece of paper on a wall was a list of names of Hamas members guarding Israeli captives it turned out to be a list of the days of the week and in early December a military spokesman said one Hamas fighter was being killed for every two civilians in Gaza a number many analysts find difficult to believe especially given the number of children killed Israel is waging an information War to win support for its military campaign in Gaza but as that offensive drags on it's facing increasing criticism on the international stage and growing impatience at home Benson molan Al jazer for Inside Story let's bring in our guests in Washington DC is Sahar kamam a non-resident senior fellow at the Middle East Council on global Affairs and a specialist on Arab and Muslim media Sahar will come to you in just a moment in Doha is Mark Owen Jones an associate professor of Middle East studies at hammad bin Khalifa University you research how technology can be used as a tool of Oppression and from London we are joined by Dina matar a professor of political communication and Arab media at the center for Global media and communication at soas that is the school of Oriental and African studies thank you very much to all of you for being with us um Sahar let me start with you I'd like your take on uh this video and it was in Fenton's report this is the video where we see dozens of Palestinian men stripped to their underwear one of them whom aljazera reporters in Gaza have since identified as an aluminum shop worker who is made to walk follow Israeli instructions and and put down weapons um in front of them I'd like what did you think when you first saw this video well thank you for having me I think that there is a famous saying that truth is the biggest victim of War so whenever you have War you also have some accompanying degree of propaganda misinformation and disinformation and this has been very prevalent and very clearly spread in the current situation in Gaza and the horrific attack on Gaza it is not the first time that we see footage that cannot be documented cannot be really verified as accurate and I think that in this particular case there's a lot of doubt about the authenticity and verification of this particular footage and this particular video because indeed some of the people who showed up in this particular video were found to be civilians whether they are just average citizens or even a journalist or other people who have no affiliation uh with Hamas and let me just say that this is not the first time that we have seen this type of disinformation and even stag staged videos emerge out of this particular situation we all remember the case of the staged video of the woman who posed as a nurse from Al shifa hospital and she started to say things like oh Hamas is using you know the AL shifa hospital as a place to actually have its own military command center and it's stealing food and fuel and resources and energy uh from the uh Palestinian civilians and doing horrific things and then this whole video turned out to be staged and fake and there was no proof whatsoever that this woman was a nurse or that she was at elifa hospital and the whole thing was completely fake so unfortunately we have been seeing that time and time again in the midst of this horrific attack on Gaza and thisinformation and propaganda has been used as a brutal we weapon in this particular terrible situation Marco and Jones referring back to that video again the one where this Palestinian man surrenders uh a weapon what is the audience who's the audience for this for for pictures like these well I think the audience is primarily the the Israeli public but I would like to add that what was a crucial aspect of that video that we need to explain is that firstly one of the iconic photographs was showing the man holding the gun in his right hand surrendering it and putting that gun on a pile of other guns right and then what later emerged on social media was a video where you saw the same man walking and holding his gun in the left hand right which led to obviously obvious accusations that this had been staging that the man was repeatedly asked to come and put guns down for the camera and there's even a voice of a soldier off off camera who's saying uh please put the gun that we gave you down right so I just wanted to emphasize that point that people have talked about this video being stage and there is a lot of evidence to suggest that it was stage and that they made a man who had already been stripped to his underwear carry weapons for the purposes of a photo shoot so I think the purpose of that video one is humiliation you know there's no real reason why they should be stripped to their underwear and photographed let's not forget that it's seen as a contravention of the Geneva conven vention to public humiliate and degrade prisoners of war and if you photograph those prisoners you are degrading them so to engage in that kind of behavior and then publish it in a way that goes viral I would say is designed to humiliate not just Hamas but Palestinians as as sahas said you know there's there's plenty of evidence to suggest that these Fighters are or the people sorry in the pictures are Ordinary People so I think what's happening here as the pressure from the US for the war to end is increases Israel are more desperate to convey to their domestic audience that there is some sort of Victory here and the way that they want to do that is to have this Mass humiliation of Palestinian men uh and then published that to an Israeli audience to sort of demonstrate that there has been sufficient Vengeance for what happened on October the 7th Dina matar your thoughts on this because you one could easily argue that this has backfired this as other videos have that Israel has released since the beginning of this conflict there is so much talk on social media um in Broad news on this video and in a similar way there was very a lot of talk on previous videos that Israel has released and there was just really deep questions fundamental questions on the on the authenticity of the videos whether they were staged to what extent they were staged Etc could one consider that this has backfired and continues to backfire for Israel um well that's a good question I think I was today looking at the BBC coverage of this uh particular video and even the BBC which has now gone into the practice of verifying and putting the word verify uh of U various videos that come out of of the war um it was interesting to see that even in the BBC report it said there are still questions remaining in terms of the authenticity there's another point you know so the first images of uh the group of men or you know it's not only a group it's a couple of hundred men stripped down to that under where that that first image came out um you know maybe about four days ago or even more and then the video of uh the man with a with with a gun came back uh later so there is the timing element so the question arises as as to why um did Israel decide or Israeli authorities or the IDF decide to um to publish uh the image of the man with the gun there's another issue that I want to raise here which is despite the very um you know the sophistication of Israeli intelligence and Israeli uh communication practices and their propaganda machine these videos show a bit of kind of naivity and in a sense they are probably images taken by by the soldiers themselves of of their captives uh and then reframed uh by I um that's my assumption I mean I I don't know whether I'm correct or not uh time will tell is that they have been reframed as part of the Israeli propaganda campaign and the uh misinformation campaigns that have um that have kind of come up quite a lot during this this war against Gaza there's something I'd like to put to all of you is that these videos that we've been by the way putting up on screen of course as you've been talking um these videos have been referenced by Israeli leadership we heard Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referenced it earlier in that report that Hamas Fighters were laying down their weapons this is heri the Israeli chief of general staff listen to him I see the achievements from day to day we are seeing every day terrorists are killed and also terrorists who are injured in the last few days we also have seen them surrendering a sign of the collapse of the system a sign that we need to press harder and this is what you are doing all right um Sahar so we see there's this kind of of feed feedback loop almost where the video makes it onto Israeli media this video the sound bite that we just aired was recorded a couple days ago uh and then you see the heads of the military or the Prime Minister saying ah we have a video this shows that our military campaign is working and it seems that one feeds into the other I think that Israel is desperate in order to paint an IM of some kind of quote unquote Victory because that has not really been the case I mean it was hoping for some kind of grand operation that would really put Hamas down to its knees in a very short time and as we all know that did not happen the ground operation in Gaza did not go as planned for Israel or as as hoped for and as it loses more and more of its own soldiers and artillery and all of that stuff it is really desperate in order to show that it is doing some kind of success or some kind of Victories being being achieved in Gaza hence these kinds of videos that are mostly staged and unverified as we've been giving examples before we all know the example of course also in a chfa hospital where the soldiers claimed that Hamas had a command control center under the hospital and then of course there were all of these jokes in uh you know Arab uh social media posts about the calendar that was shown on the wall and that some Israeli soldier was pointing down to as like oh this is like a list of Hamas Fighters when in fact it was just a list of the days of the week so there were like jokes going on viral on social media saying you know be careful if you're an Arab don't keep a calendar because that can really prove that you are somehow associated with Hamas or humus so it has been like you know really uh used in in the uh social media context as some kind of making fun of this type of dangerous disinformation but it is not only funny it is really very dangerous because some people unfortunately take these types of disinformation and it is disinformation not misinformation because misinformation happens when you don't get the facts right but you have a good intention but this information happens as in these cases when you deliberately tweak the facts and actually create some kind of fake uh scenario or fake story that never happened so this is called disinformation and that is very dangerous because unfortunately some receivers or audiences may not be witty enough may not be really media literate and can just take all of that stuff at face value and believe it to be a fact when it's not but you know even within the Israeli media if you read haret for instance They Carried this report with uh and they attributed they they quoted senior security officials told haret on Sunday that of the hundreds of Palestinian detainees photographed handcuffed in the Gaza Strip about 10 to 15% are Hamas operatives or are identified within the organization now simple math tells us that means 85 to 90% of the people that we see in these pictures are not in any way affiliated with Hamas and the military the Israeli military say that they've released they've released the others so it it seems that there's there's the there's the big picture narrative that's being put out as we said that by Netanyahu the heads of the military and then when they're questioned in detail by the media they say well actually 90% of these people are not Hamas operative so mark this goes back to the question that I was asking you earlier who is the who's the intended audience and what's the purpose if you're then going to say actually most of these people were civilians well again I think you know this isn't just about Hamas I think what we're seeing here and and I mentioned it earlier and this notion of you know the fact that the men in the photos were stripped down down to the underwear this is about humiliation right and it's not just about the act of humiliation it's it's it's it's the public broadcasting of these images which makes that humiliation a form of viral humiliation right it's about you know helping dehumanize Palestinians and othering them and I think this is another argument of why it's for the not just the Israeli audience but the global audience to an extent one of the issues we've seen coming out of uh the past two months is this attempt to routinely dehumanize Palestinians why is it important to dehumanize them well because if you dehumanize them and we've seen lots of discourse like this from for example Israeli official the Palestinians as human animals if people are encouraged to see Palestinians as less than human they'll be more likely to support continued uh not just Israeli action against Palestinians but increasingly horrible treatment of Israelis of Palestinians right because and this Narrative of dehumanization is contributing to this so I think this photo of Palestinians uh was an attempt at dehumanization to further basically legitimize continued Israeli attacks on them and I use this kind of example of the audience right some people say well why this this disinformation often seems so flimsy or the staged elements seem obvious well it's like Israel air strikes so Israel are happy to kill a 100 civilians if it means they're killing one Hamas leader they're happy to arrest 100 civilians if it means arresting 10 Hamas leaders but I say the same for disinformation it doesn't matter if a 100 people you know critical people realize that the disinformation is nonsense as long as two or three Israelis will believe that disinformation then it's been successful to an extent Dena there is in Hebrew and it doesn't have an English exact English translation the concept of hasbara uh which is um which is essentially a Communications strategy to explain what the state of Israel is doing the closest approximation to the word to the Hebrew word hasbara is explain right explain what Israel is doing do you want to explain to our viewers how how Israel uses that and has used that in the past so Israel has used hasp which is um translated into public relations or communication strategies uh in very specific and um targeted ways I agree with Mark that the um audience for uh this particular clip we we were talking about is the Israeli audience and in a sense it's a way of telling them look you know we are taking hostages and in a sense it's saying we but also you know kind of um keeping them and humiliating them um so maybe uh it's a way of responding to the uh current debate uh within Israeli societies particularly by the um family members of hostages uh in in Gaza but to go back to hasbara it's a it's a a strategy political communication strategy that Israel has been using to try and uh legitimize its own uh narrative about about itself um in a way you know the right to exist the right to defend itself um you know kind of locating it within this uh anti-semitic frame U you know everyone who who uh criticizes Israel is is immediately branded as being anti-semitic and this hasb is um targeted at different different people and publics it's not only it it's basically targeted at public in um in the West perhaps in the Arab world as well to try and uh you know kind of um change their perspectives or perhaps uh show that you know or or U support Israel in its claims to about itself and we have seen many examples uh about that over the years and um uh it is a very pernicious um strategy um and you could see that um some of the one of the most important figures who practices uh it is of course Mark reg who um who probably has had uh training in communication and how to use language um and he insists on uh using particular terms all the time um denying any possibility of thinking otherwise so this is what hasbara is and it's been written about quite a lot um in in the literature in the academic literature in terms of the literature on propaganda and on strategic communication by the way Mark Reger is an Israeli Diplomat a civil servant a government adviser but most TV viewers especially people who watch news about the Israeli Palestinian conflict they will definitely have seen him in interviews because he speaks obviously in favor of Israel but he speaks he gives a lot of interviews to explain uh the Israeli uh the Israeli point of view outside of Israel do you feel that for this conflict hasbara is working because Israel since since October the 7th has lost a lot of international support we know how the world feels about this war because there was a resolution at the UN General Assembly I'm not not talking about the one at the security Council I'm talking about the general assembly which takes the temperature of how all the countries in the world feels there was an overwhelming majority for a ceasefire and to stop the fighting do you feel hasbara is working outside of uh Israel for this conflict for this war are you asking me I can I can answer um I think I I think um it has worked in past uh but I think people are beginning to see the uh you know are beginning to see that uh there are the claims made by Israel are just claims you know they're just uh lies misinformation you know propaganda that's all we could say um and there is a shift in opinion particularly amongst the younger generation and that's because they are using social media they're able to see what's happen they're mobilizing behind other terms and so on but uh hasar is is still used and and you know it is supported by a lot of funding uh in the UK we have something called bom which is a British Israeli communication um unit that was established about um I would say 2016 with a purpose of um with the purpose of uh flooding uh the public space and the media space in the UK with with the pro-israeli narrative um so we see a shift amongst the young people but I think the older generation are are much harder to shift in terms of their opinion Sahar does this kind of video and others that came before it including ones that you talked about others that we referenced that were either debunked or that were you know laughed at on social media and seen as either widely inaccurate or completely staged does that pose a problem for the US which is the main supporter of Israel in this war at this stage I mean let's just remind our viewers you know based on the the the US veto at the UN Security Council just a few days ago Israel is just one US veto away now uh from not being able to prosecute this war as it's currently doing right so that they need the US to be on board does this create a a PR problem for the US I think it does because the unconditional and one-sided support that us has been given Israel since the beginning of all of the events unfolding since October 7th has been really uh something that a lot of people have critiqued and blamed the US for really being this staunch supporter of Israel when we have more than 18,000 lives lost uh in Gaza most of whom are women and children and elderly people who are just plain civilians that have nothing to do uh with Hamas so this really creates an image crisis for the United States and shakes its own reputation credibility and International Leadership on the international stage I also want to highlight the very important point which is the double-edge sword of social media social media played a very very important role in the midst of these events I mean on one hand it really allowed the truth to come out in a way that was not possible through the mainstream American Media or Western media in general most of whom have adopted a narrative that's really really very supportive of Israel all the way and did not give a lot of room for showing the other side of the story which is the suffering of the Palestinian people day in and day out therefore the world Consciousness was shocked when they started to see all of these images and videos coming out of Gaza and they're like oh my God wait a minute we are not seeing that on you know traditional mainstream average Western Media or American Media but we are seeing it now through social media social media played a very important role to create this kind of Awakening of international public opinion and we saw how that was reflected in massive demonstrations and protests and marches all over the world one of them here in Washington DC exceeded half a million people which is unprecedented on the other hand however social media had another side which is a negative one where it really became a platform for the spread of staged videos and in some cases misinformation or disinformation or propaganda just like some of the footage and videos we have been talking about so we have to bear in mind also this double-edged sword effect of social media and how it can have positive as well as negative consequences at the same time Mark if we flip the coin what has been hamas's communication strategy how have they countered the the the whether it's the videos or the messaging that we're seeing out of Israel well I think they've shifted over time I think the initial attacks on October the 7th you saw a sort of celebration of brutality uh which obviously was in the terms of generating Global sympathy was entirely in effect persective but I think the thing is Hamas apart from putting out these occasional videos where you see spokesmen talking about what they've done and how many Israeli how much Israeli equipment they've destroyed have attempted to kind of try and portray themselves in a more legitimate light so we've seen Hamas spokesman conferences now with those advertising backboards uh when we've had the hostage hostage exchanges we've also seen you know a lot of narratives promoting this idea that Hamas have been humanely treating their hostages whereas Israeli palestin prisoners of Israel have been really treated badly so they' made a kind of lot of this and now we're seeing more videos of of Hamas you know showing and documenting their attacks on Israeli tanks uh again to show you know Hamas are strong and won't be cowed uh but I think generally over time the need Hamas have to to kind of counter Israel's points are not strictly that important I mean as sah said and as deas mentioned you know there's a lot of social media content coming out from journalists still in Gaza that show the absolute devastation that Israel's bombing has caused I mean when you have over 16,000 people killed uh a huge number of which are children uh then Global sympathy is obviously going to be on your side so Hamas actually don't need to do much because when those videos are being put out that is going to be the most effective form of persuasion that Hamas need and so I think that's really important to remember when we talk about the propaganda War here there's a certain asymmetry and Hamas have benefited from the fact that Israel's brutal response has just generated so much anti-israeli propaganda itself and that's all the time we have for today but I'd like to thank all our guests for joining us Sahar kamam Mar oen Jones and Dina marar thank you very much to all of you and thank you too for
