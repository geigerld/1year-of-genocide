the United Nations has completed its investigation into 19 staff members of the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees who Israel accused of being involved in the October 7th attack they found no or insufficient evidence to support the allegations against 10 of its staff they found evidence that nine may have been involved and have terminated their employment un employees around 13,000 people Gabriel Alando joins us now from unhq the very latest on this in Clarity is what the International Community wanted will these findings close the chapter on this particular episode Gabriel listen I think so uh because uh after these allegations were made by Israel in late January more than 12 countries suspended funding to unra uh that was a critical Lifeline for unra to give Aid to Palestinians in Gaza that needed it the most so since then all but one country has resumed funding again to uh uh to unra the only one that hasn't is the United States and I doubt that these findings are going to change anything in to in terms of countries uh wanting to reevaluate that overwhelmingly the International Community has come out and said in the last few weeks and months that they need to support unra for the work that it is doing uh in Gaza and elsewhere and so I think that this this this report uh will certainly be taken in various different ways but I think that what you're going to see is countries accepting the findings as best as they can and saying let's put this uh situation behind us and move forward it would be nice to put the situation behind us I'm sure that's what the UN would like but is that what the UN will get well listen I mean you you can split these numbers however you want here but the bottom line is the facts that the UN came out with were 10 individuals were there was no evidence linking them to being part of any attacks on October 7th now there were nine and this is key that may have been a part of the October 7th attacks according to the internal un review that has been going on for more than six months now now the secretary General's spokesperson was asked about this he said were they part of it or may be part of it he said listen we did an investigation we think there might be enough evidence to link them to perhaps partaking in the October 7th attacks and so that's why they're being fired but it's important to point out that the evidence that Israel says they have linking these uh individuals uh was never really released to un investigators it's still in the hands of the Israelis so uh the Israelis basically s the UN your people have been involved in this now you go investigate and try to find out for yourself and that's what the UN has B basically been trying to do in summary here though this has certainly been a traumatic situation for the UN whenever staff members are accused of wrongdoing or being taking part in a violent act like this it it leads to ramifications whether it's Justified or not but it's also important to point out that more than 200 unra staff have been killed since October 7th due to Israeli bombardment uh of Gaza so I think the message from the UN and particularly from the Secretary General irregardless of this report is going to be a ceasefire and a ceasefire now something that he's been calling for for months now gabrielo there at unhq thanks Gabriel let's join Mar Bashar Al jazer senior political analyst who joins us now via Skype from Paris hi Maran and are not completely exonerated but where do you see the position of the agency Now sort of moving forward and with the information that Israel says it still has being you might say waved in the air or rattled like a saber I actually uh I disagree with the premise of your question so exonerated it shouldn't have been on the stand in the first place when did you ever hear of organization an institution an international one working in a in a war zone with 30,000 staff when nine of them were suspected of something how does that put the entire organization on on the stand how does that make the organiz ation accountable for all the troubles with the Middle East how does that make the the the organization that is known for its transparency and accountability become uh become the the perpetrator of uh of whatever when when when most of the parties at least the Israelis in this sense are are are an institution of criminality are are carrying war crimes are carrying genocide in Gaza are killing uh hwa sty I don't think the hwa needed to be exonerated at all and those who accused it did not mean for it to be exonerated because the entire accusations the entire list of accusations was all cooked up it's Shameless it's totally Shameless and it's not not unexpected of Israel to do that you know Israel has bar is ment to Li that's what do why why because that's the nature of Israeli hbar it's to lie and it lied about on and it implicated it because it hates Ona and it doesn't want a UN agency to tackle the question of refugee the question is why did these Western Powers followed Israel like sheep like sheep they did not look into those accusations they did not look into these shameful Wall Street Journal report the New York Times report that were not substantiated there was another Dark Day for journalism just like it was a dark day for West democracies claim to be democracies while accepting the fact that an institution of 30,000 employees could not potentially we don't even know yet could have nine of its staff run Rogue let's say and of course what we are seeing again still though you know even while I I ask these questions to get an elicit elicit a response from you uh that our viewers would understand as well uh Marin is the fact that the countries that did uh defund unoa have slowly one by one gone back to funding it again because they haven't been offered any evidence they haven't been offered anything by Israel and again they have a position where their own respective publics are questioning their position and and public opinion has been a great deal a factor in the way that countries have had to start refunding uh funding sorry un again public pressure look we have to put few Concepts to rest when we address issues like that relating to the United Nations a few Western powers and their clients are not not the International Community that's not the International Community if you Western Powers devising A rules-based system that basically in some of its facets contradicts international law is not the International Community few Western powers that appease a genocide in Israel are not the International Community few Western powers that overnight turned off the assistance to a viable indispensible UN agency be on the basis of false reports and hasbara Israeli propaganda they are not the International Community the International Community did not look at Ana and said oh my God this is terrible let's look into that let's put it on the trial let's investigate it that's not what happened what happened is the Secretary General of the United Nations decided under pressure from important donors and they happen to be Western powers to look into those issues the issue is not if that there are nine people that may have been involved in the October 7th the issue one why aren't they 90 why aren't they 900 they are part and parcel of the two plus million people living in an open prison called Gaza their family members were killed their family members were displaced their family members were put in prison their family members could not find work or even food so the idea that nine out of 13,000 or N Out of 30,000 were found to have maybe been involved in whatever capacity we don't know in October 7 that is not an issue concerning hona as a un agencies and certainly once again those who went along Israel's false Shameless shameful accusations against you they're the ones who should be put on the stand they're the one who should be shameful they're the ones who should be investigated the Israeli government is one of today it's one of certainly I mean it's almost consensus in including in the western public opinion is a criminal Enterprise but Western Society Western countries Western Government continue to provide a to it they don't ask themselves what the Israeli Army has done in Gaza the Israeli Army is far more dangerous than on don't we all agree indeed let's see what people do agree and don't agree on in the days ahead but for the moment M Bashar thanks for joining us in pus make sure to subscribe to our
