we have some breaking news from Gaza where at least 25 people have been killed in Israeli attacks on two schools in the west of Gaza City our correspondent Han Mahmud is joining us now from bah in central Gaza hany what more can you tell us about these attacks yes Daran well we're looking at a situations that happened less than 24 hours after the bombing of yet another school in Western Gaza that's inwan District in the Northern Western part of Gaza City and this time it happened to be two schools that turn into evacuation centers for the past months Sheltering uh refugees and displaced families from different parts of the Gaz strip now this place families are not coming from particular areas they're coming from different parts of the northern part of the strip and Gaza City fleeing the unpredictable bombs the horror of the ongoing War these schools are back to back they are what operates between these two school is the fence one is a private school educational facility the other one is a public school and they are backto back filled with a displaced families the eyewitnesses in the area describe these school as overcrowded the most overcrowded spaces available for displaced uh families in in the central part of Gaza City the bombing took place simultaneously at the same time the two schools were were struck relentlessly by multiple air strikes and uh several people reported to Al Baptist hospital so far we getting from the hospital the only operational Hospital in Gaza Center AL Baptist Hospital 25 people transferred to the hospital already pronounced dead these are dead bodies were managed to be removed from the rubbles and from the dust that filled up the area into the hospital there are more still under the rubbles we're talking about overcrowded packed to space in two schools by the th the number of people inside these two facilities uh by the Thousand we're looking at a situation a context that is full of horror right now Bloodshed and more destruction something that is becoming as we monitor how the situations have been evolving in the past a few days more of these uh evacuation centers are attack systematically the attentions it seems by the Israeli military right now okay hany uh thank you hany for that reporting from in the center of the Gaza Strip let's bring in h who's joining us from H ham of course reporting from am because Al jaaz has been baned from reporting from Israel um hamda what is the Israeli military or the government saying about the targeting of two schools Sheltering displaced people in Gaza well this is the third school that's been struck by the Israeli Army in just less than 24 hours and in a lengthy statement the Israeli military says that they struck these two schools because they are claiming Hamas was using them as quote command centers and to carry out attacks on Israeli troops but of course no evidence was provided for these claims this is something we've seen from the Army time and time again saying that Hamas is using several different places schools mosques hospitals as command centers when we have never once seen evidence of these claims the military is also claiming they took precautionary measures to make sure that the minimal damage would be caused to civilians including quote using precise Munitions but it's a little bit difficult to believe when you see the images on the ground when you hear our colleagues in Gaza reporting from the ground reporting at least 25 Palestinians killed and several others who are stuck underneath the rubbles the screams of the Palestinians continuing even at this hour while our colleagues from elaz Arabic are live on the air hearing the screams of Palestinians who are stuck under the rubble of these schools from the Israeli strikes now the military is saying that quote hams is using these civilian areas and they are using civilians as human Shields a claim time and time again we've heard from the Israeli military in order to justify their attacks on displaced Palestinians in Northern Gaza in southern Gaza in central Gaza and especially on civilian infrastructure and um hamda we also hear over and over again from people on the ground in Gaza as well as our correspondents who say look the Israeli Army in the military they never give any prior warning even to people who are Sheltering in these areas allowing them time to find some other place to go to that's exactly right the Israeli military has previously falsely claimed that they do give warnings they do give some sort of knock prior to the air strikes that they are alleging or targeting Hamas operatives but that is simply not the case we've heard from Witnesses on the ground from our own teams on the ground in Gaza that that's not the case that the Israeli Army regularly carries out these attacks I mean look at what happened yesterday three simultaneous strikes on a school where at least 17 people were killed and there is Army is saying that they use precautions they try to minimize civilian casualties but you see time and time again Palestinians picking up body parts and remnants of people who've been killed and injured in these attacks so there is no prior warning when the Army is attacking civilian infrastructure especially when they allege that Hamas is using the facilities when in fact there are thousands of forcibly displaced Palestinians using these schools and hospitals as a place to stay as a place to escape the fighting as they've been displaced time and time again but the military says and continues to claim that Hamas is using these facilities for military purposes which we have never once seen proof of and and in this case as well ham just for confirmation I mean up until this point the Israeli Army has not provided any evidence to support their claims that's exactly right the military time and time again leases lengthy statements saying that Hamas is using civilian infrastructure for military purposes in this specific day on these two strikes on these schools they say that Hamas was using these schools to plan and Carry Out attacks on Israeli troops on the ground and remember these are areas that the Israeli Army has said time and time again more than six months ago in fact that they have achieved near full operational control on the ground but we see it over and over where they are continuing to face Fierce resistance from Palestinian Fighters but nonetheless they are still claiming that Hamas is using these civilian infrastructures but never once has given this proof and the biggest of all of these claims by the Army was back at the raid at Al shifa Hospital the continued attack saying that Hamas was using it as a command center which still to this day there has never been proof of there has never been information or pictures or any sort of intelligence that the Army is citing to back up their claims we've seen this time and time again in this war that has so far killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians and the Israeli military continues to make these claims without providing the evidence to the public the media or anyone else um hamda let me just ask you about uh developments a little earlier on today where we did see reports of Rocket attacks on Israel from the south of the Gaza Strip just talk us through what happened there well we're looking at at least five rockets that were fired from Southern Gaza many of them intercepted but some actually ended up hitting areas and causing fires and again this is also an area the military has said they've reached full operational control over or partial operational control they often claim these big strategic military victories on the ground we've seen this again and again especially in the invasions of KH Yunis the attacks on RAF saying that they have these big military achievements and that they have eliminated almost all of the Hamas brigades and fighters on the ground these are claims from the Army but again time and time again we see that they are still facing Hamas Fighters Islamic jiad fighters on the ground there where these claims are actually false they have not achieved this full operational control they have not achieved these military and strategic victories that they often boast about they've said time and time again they have eliminated the capability of fighters in Gaza to launch rockets but just in the last several days we've seen several projectiles that have been fired from Gaza something that of course is driving the security establishment within Israel kind of crazy because for 10 months there have been continuous air strikes continuous bombardment and somehow these Fighters are still able to launch rockets something that the Israeli military is constantly assessing and constantly looking on how they're going to continue their fight and the war on Gaza okay ham we'll let you go for now thank you for all of that reporting from Aman and these are the latest pictures that we're getting right here on Al jazer of the two schools uh in Gaza that have been attacked and the latest death toll is at least 25 people have been killed by these attacks on two schools where displaced Palestinians have been Sheltering let's get an update once again from our correspondent on the ground hany Mahmud who's joining us from d what more are you hearing about these attacks well the F they confirmed number of of people who were killed in these multiple air strikes at these two schools again these schools are backto back they are full of this place families have been Sheltering inside these do evacuation centers people are running to these evacuation Center because their neighborhoods their their homes and their areas resal areas have been completely destroyed or severely damaged by isra military to the point they become in uninhabitable they turn into a waste land what people will do they concentrate in these evacuation centers seeking safety seeking protection and away from the horror of the unpredictable bombs now what's really concerning and horrifying and we've seen this pattern happening for the past few days the attacks concentrated attacks on evacuation centers are happening without any prior warning whatsoever something that contradicts the really military it put in a statement that they they're being cautious they're trying to minimize the the damage but on the ground what we're seeing this you there's no way as people in a very frustrating tone you can't minimize damage if you're not giving a prior warning to a a facility that is full of this place uh individuals already tired exhausted they they've been in this situation for the past uh 10 months H there are more people we're expecting the number to increase the number of casualties the number of people who are being removed it from under the rubbles and a transfer to the hospital and unfortunately this been happening uh for quite some time now and what what's really concerning for many of the people who are still in evacuation centers that haven't been targeted yet this attack has has caused further internal and force displacement has people feel that they're they're their their tiny bit of of of remaining safety have been shattered completely right now not evacuation centers that have been identified and designated as areas for displ families are not safe for them we seen in the past how hospitals turn theband on by the Israeli military to the point the entire Health Facilities being completely destroyed or severely damaged the only operational H facility is here in the central area and doesn't have the capacity to uh provide proper Health Care uh or medical care to those who are needed and right now when when the attacks are happening in this manner at the evacuation Center soon enough we're going to see more people are lifting left in the streets they're exposed to SK Predators drones surveillance drones and attack drones that are finding them as easy pre being under attack hany how many people and how many families would have been Sheltering in these two schools and and which areas of the Gaza Strip would would they have come from or have they come from practically all over well the P 10 months have been quite difficult for uh Palestinians family across the god STP some of these families have been displaced more than three times five times it's just shocking sometimes to hear people talking about the seventh or eight times being displaced and they're coming from different parts of Gaza City and the northern part of the strip that includes Bon B and the Eastern neighborhoods of Gaza including sh that has 100% being obliterated uh when the uh the Israeli military invaded it a few weeks ago it becomes quite unhabitable it was declared by the municipality as disastrous area it it's quite created catastropic situations living conditions and and catastrophic situations for people to the point they they had to leave the area and seek shelters in these uh evacuation centers mainly the schools we're talking about hundreds of displaced families and if we look at the Palestinian Society the way how it's socially constructed we're talking about the the average family is made of five to to seven and in some cases your family is made of 10 people and the vast majority are children if you multiply that by hundred of families we're talking about thousand people inside these uh schools Sheltering seeking protection and safety from the horror of the unpredictable falling bombs and this is exactly it's not an exaggeration to say it's unpredictable horror of the Fallen BMS because there are no prior warning whatsoever everything that has been put out by the Israeli military every narrative that is being pushed um to uh pretty much describe that the Israeli military taking cautions and taking necessary steps to protect civilians well on the ground what we're seeing is more children and more women and more elderly people and more young men coming in pieces or coming is shredded severely bleeding or severe burnt transfer to the hospital that is the dominating scen was documented it we've seen it happening with our own eyes whether here in the central area or the from the footage coming from the bomb site like yesterday they were video of of people looking for remains buting parts of their relatives who were inside the school that was bed in Awan District the same exact situation is happening again repeating itself in what seems to be a new normal for Palestinians inside evacuation Cent Hy for those who have survived this attack or or are injured where uh which hospital is operational in that area and what is the state of that hospital right now well the the only semi operational health facility in in Gaza City and the entire northern part is Al Baptist hospital that's at the center a part of City mainly or namely the Gaza square area it's uh it's a a hospital has been pushed repeatedly out of service and to remind our viewers that the initial weeks of the war there really really military bombed the school and killed the close to 200 people who were Sheltering in the courtyard of the hospitals it's running at a very low capacity here many of the doctors including medical missions who made made it uh to the hospital describe hor situation inside the hospital some of them even went to describe that it's is not a hospital anywhere it's more of a morg here the only thing that is provided there is receiving the dead bodies that prepare them for barrier because there isn't any medical care taking in place whatsoever thank you so much my apologies but we are just coming to the top of the hour so uh we will let you go for now we'll speak to you again in the next couple of minutes these are uh from Gaza City where Israel has attacked two schools uh which had been Sheltering displaced Palestinians the so far we understand at least 25 Palestinians have been killed that death toll expected to go uh higher we're back in make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
