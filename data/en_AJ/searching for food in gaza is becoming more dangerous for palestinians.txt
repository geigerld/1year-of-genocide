a crowd in the northern part of the strip came under Fire from guns and tanks as they gathered to obtain flow on alrashed Road West of Gaza City News Agency footage was released on Monday a day after the incident Israeli forces have fired on crowds trying to get Aid several times in the past the un's food agency says it was forced to suspend Aid deliveries in the north because of this violence and some Israeli have blocked humanitarian aid from getting into the Gaza Strip the group lay in front of a border crossing with Egypt preventing trucks from moving as they queued to get into Gaza a trucks are meant to be checked in Egypt before they cross over well the spokesperson of the un's humanitarian office says a recent medical evacuation Convoy was also stalled by Israeli forces for several hours despite prior coordination for all staff members and vehicles with the Israeli side um the Israeli forces blocked the who Le Convoy for many hours the moment it left the hospital the Israeli military forces the the Israeli military forced patients and staff out of ambulances and stripped all paramedics of their clothes three Palestinian red chrisan Society paramedics were subsequently detained although their personal details had been shared with the Israeli forces in advance while the rest of the Convoy stay in place for over 7 hours one paramedic has been released and we appeal for the immediate release of the two others uh and all other detained health personnel but ter kazum is live for us in Rafa in southern Gaza and TK Israel is not only blocking Aid getting getting into Gaza they're also targeting people trying to access the little food that has managed to get through how difficult is it for people right now well it has been widely systematic systematically clear how the Israeli military is very keen and exacting the humanitarian situation in the another part of Gaza it have been multiple reported the people being shot and exposed to the Israeli fire as they were waiting for humanitarian trucks to get to the nor part now people there have been suffering from famine uh from a very long weeks ago as they have nothing to feed on they have the the majority of uh food items in the Palestinian Market with it ping prices has run out completely from there alongside that people also start depending on Alternatives fors start depending on animal feed mixed with uh rotten food in order to at least have at one Loop of thread for every couple of days at least to remain survived just to to to be able to continue for the next day this is absolutely inhuman despite all the international calls to remove all the restrictions being placed on Aid deliveries to the another part of Gaza and even regarding the latest um Aid parachuting from the Jordanian military plane uh we did not really the majority of these spes did not really get to the people hammed because large parts of it had been dropped in the water have been completely ruined and cannot be really usable usable for human consumption and this is absolutely terrifying and two now only Aire can help to mitigate the deterioration of humanitarian crisis in part of territory and TK you're joining us on the phone now because you yourself were targeted as you were making your way to the live location first of all we're we're very happy to hear that you are okay but can you just explain run us through exactly what happened well absolutely terrifying uh moment when I just think alongside with my my know getting ready to live location uh we just get in the car start moving uh peacefully and then uh we have been completely surprised by a drone attack just only one meter away from the driver's side that we managed to survive a loud explosion to place my cleaner one of us had been injured and but we have been traumatized from the we have been right now suffering from a clear psychological PA from such horrific attack because right now I'm being completely suffering from uh with my ears being hurted being hurt from this military attack alongside my Army is unable also to speak well right now he is psychologically traumatized saying that we were close this time more than every single previous time of Israel repeat attack had been carried down from one of the streets that had been targeted before and it was full of people as since the moment of the attack and right now we are trying to take all safety procedures in order to be safe but basically we have lost the sense of safety we are no longer feel safe in Gaza even in the area that's supposed to be a safe Zone more than 1.9 million Palestinians we have been following the Israeli orders since day one of the fighting moving from one place to another according to their instructions and right now we are ourselves being targeted maybe we do not know the real reason behind this targeting is it to silence our narrative to stop prevent us from keep keeping reporting and informing World regarding all the latest updates on the ground well it's absolutely a chaos we cannot really think for right now we are entirely traumatized by this mil yeah ter you have and your team have been doing an incredible job uh of keeping everyone up to date with exactly what is going on there you talked you've been uh taking all of safety precautions uh as possible that includes riding in cars that are clearly marked as press or as media doesn't it yes that's right we have been uh we're our vest our helmet and with a sign that this vehicle belongs to a broadcast channel and this is absolutely terrifying because we have been by the way we have been moving on the same road for couple of days taking the same road without changing our our our Direction and it's absolutely terrifying like how this can happen for journalists who must be protected by the principles of international L and this is not new by the way they have mully attacks before they havea killed different members of family one of the latest attacks have killed myag Hamza and right now it seems that they are expanding that attx even for uh journalists who are trying to send the the message for the International Community about what is happening here on the ground and since the beginning of the this war more than 100 Palestinian journalists have been killed and we do not know exactly who's the next TK as always we really really do appreciate uh all you and your team's incredible work uh from ruffer and Gaza thank you
