this is video from the village of uif south of Nabis in the center of the occupied West Bank where soldiers detained at least three Palestinians israeli's military also set up checkpoints at a number of other Villages and interrogated Palestinians driving through Israel has detained an average of 60 people every night and killed nearly 290 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank since October Israeli forces have endered their most intense raid in the occupied West Bank since the War Began the incursion in Janine started on Tuesday morning nearly 500 people have been arrested and at least 12 Palestinians killed ABD Hamid joins us live from Janine in the occupied West Bank and so the raid after 60 hours is finally over what's been the Fallout there well certainly the Army has announced that this raid was over uh last night well the Fallout here as we were driving in uh this is a desolate City everything is shut down I'm just going to move out of the picture here so just you can see this is a place where the Israeli soldiers were stationed you can see on that wall they uh drew the Star of David the symbol of uh Israel and next to it a minora but also look at the wider picture here you see this is the entrance of the refugee camp here in uh in Janine you can see how the infrastructure the roads have been destroyed that is sewage water that you're seeing uh we spoke to some people here telling us about how the bulldozers were the first ones to go in and in their wake they break uh everything some some to pave the road for the armored vehicles to go in but also to destroy the infrastructure to make people's life here very difficult um people are saying that this was the longest raid but since October 7th the Israeli Army was at least two dozen times here in Janine mainly fol focusing on the refugee camp in their house to 14,000 uh people as you mentioned hundreds have been arrested a good number of them has also been uh released after questioning uh but they did say that they were very badly treated they were beaten some had to be taken uh directly uh to the hospital so certainly now when you ask people well the Army has announced that it this operation is finished do you think they will come back well the answer we got so far is yes and uh hter as we've heard Jake Sullivan is due in the occupied West Bank later there today to meet with abas what sort of reception is he likely to receive well I think it's probably going to be somehow of a cold reception simply because the Palestinian Authority has been completely isolated ever since October 7th yes on one hand the International Community is engaging with Mahmud Abbas is discussing the postwar uh in Gaza situation and scenario with abas but on the other side we heard the rethoric coming out of Israel coming out of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself who says there's no role for the uh pa uh in Gaza after this war uh so those are going to be difficult uh conversations but I think also Mahmud Abbas will discuss things like what happened here in Janine there's continuous pressure on the Palestinian uh across the occupied B Bank occupied West Bank rather sorry and the the thousands that have been detained since October 7th the bodies of prisoners who have been withheld there's a whole long list of complaints that Palestinians talk to you about every day and probably Mahmud Abbas will discuss that okay thanks so much ABD for us there in Janine
