I have never been so ashamed of Israel as I am at this moment to me it seems as if Hitler has won he's changed us Jews from being compassionate and caring and do unto others as you would have them do unto you into this vicious genocidal nationalist Nation pursuing and killing women and children what we are doing Jewish people over in Israel is shocking embarrassing and wicked and in the name of humanity I call upon all Jews to shout beg scream for a ceasefire it is not anti-semitic to have a different opinion on the wartime actions now
