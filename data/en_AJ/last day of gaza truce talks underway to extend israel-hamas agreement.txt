so then it is the Sixth and final day of the Gaza ceasefire agreed between Hamas and Israel after a two-day extension set to expire on Thursday talks are underway to extend the pause and hostilities on Tuesday Israel released another 30 Palestinians in exchange for 12 captives that Hamas has been holding in Gaza kter has been helping to mediate the negotiations it's hoping for a more durable agreement the foreign Ministry said the main focus is to secure an end to the war intelligence Chiefs from the US and from Israel are also in Doha uh they met K's prime minister on Tuesday to discuss extending the ceasefire and the release of more hostages so as we've been saying it's the last scheduled day uh of the ceasefire lots of negotiations are underway uh as to whether or not that will be extended we'll get more on that now from uh Imran Khan who's standing by for us uh right now in occupied East Jerusalem so Imran tell us more about the situation there in Israel we have uh this ceasefire negotiations underway what's the mood there about the the potential for it being extended well certainly all parties are talking quite positively about uh the negotiations ongoing uh the International Community G who is kind of leading uh the negotiations between Hamas and Israel the Americans also very keen that the the ceasefire should uh continue but what are the deta s of what are the negotiations going on well that's obviously being kept very very uh secret but we do know uh from leaks coming out uh that there are negotiations to release additional captives and extending the ceasefire by another 5 days now they're doing this over five categories the the five categories they're talking about are releasing uh Israeli captives elderly men firstly who are too old to be reservists now the reason they they bring the word reservist up is because military AED males and females here have to do national service so the idea that once you're too old to do that then perhaps you can be released a bit more then it's female soldiers uh reservist soldiers and then the bodies actually of Israelis who are killed before or during a captivity so that seems to be what they're negotiating on there seems to be positive noises actually coming from Hamas about this as well Hamas is according to the Cy according to leaks uh towards the Cates rather has said they are very keen to respect uh what the Israelis want in terms of these five categories but there's a lot of pressure uh from the rightwing in Israel who actually control uh the government that this ceasefire should not go on indefinitely in fact there is a deadline that keeps being said and that is the deadline of Sunday 10 days of a ceasefire is about all the Israelis May well be able to stomach if all of these leaks are to believe to be believed that happens on Sunday after Sunday if the ceasefire last that long the Israelis will want to go back in and we keep hearing this not just from sources but actually publicly uh from people like the Daniel hagari who's the Israeli armed spokesman saying that we will go back into Gaza it's not a question of if it's a question of when Iman thanks for that Iman we'll leave it there for the moment that's a scene from occupied East Jerusalem let's go now to hind kadari who's in Kan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip and and hind tell us how people are feeling there today as discussions continue to try and expand these these days of quiet well let's start from the north of the Gaza Strip where we just learned that there has been uh shooting from the Israeli forces on two Palestinian civilians in the northern area of the Gaza Strip where two Palestinians have been injured and one of them H is in serious condition uh moving back to the South we feel and we we see on the ground mixed feelings we see fear hope resilience anger anxiety depression people uh think uh they are using the last hours of this extended Seas temporary ceasefire where they're trying to buy as much as they can despite the the fact that they are striving to find anything in the markets they say and they say that there is nothing available no winter clothes no food they're trying to reach some Aid that is been entering the Gaza SHP but at the end of the day they feel that this um after talking to a couple of people they said that this um uh temporary ceasefire is meaningless as long as they were not uh um able to go back to their houses to make sure that their family stuck in the northern area of the Gaza Strip is safe we are still uh disconnected from the northern Gaza Strip and it's very hard for us to reach people in there and it's not only us as uh uh reporters it's also about civilians that are striving to get any news from their their beloved ones uh in the northern area of the Gazo strip yes incredibly difficult situation there so what's the agid you mentioned what's happening to that Aid who's managing its distri indeed how is it being distributed okay so every single day since the beginning of this temporary ceasefire uh 200 trucks of Aid inured We're talking about a total of 950 approximately 950 Aid uh uh uh trucks that entered including food medicine food uh fuel uh cooking gas uh who's Distributing these uh uh uh Aid is uh International uh Nos and international Agencies with local Partners in the Gaza Strip we noticed that wfp the world food program was able to enter uh the northern area of the Gaza Strip we're also talking about icrc and pcrf uh all of these International organizations have been uh facilitating in the Norine area of the Gaza Strip since uh since the first day of the season temporary ceasefire so Aid is coming in the Gaza Strip but at the end of the day it is not enough the demand of food water medicine uh fuel cooking gas is huge is massive people are striving to find any of these basic needs uh to continue uh uh coping with this life the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip is catastrophic and we are seeing this on the ground every single day despite that there is a temporary ceasefire but people still don't have access to clean water to hygiene uh to electricity to bathrooms people in this Hospital in alnaser complex wait for hours in lines to enter the bathroom and use the bathroom at the end of the day there is also no water for washing themselves so all of these uh hygiene problems uh the health situation is deteriorating and we're also talking about thousands of people displaced in this hospital and other un facilities with with like they don't have they don't even have the minimum basic requirements to continue and survive uh this Israeli War indeed sanitation situation getting worse by the day we'll leave it there hind thanks for that update hind kdari there in the south of Gaza
