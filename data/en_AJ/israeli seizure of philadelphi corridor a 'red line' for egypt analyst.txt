well Israel has been expanding its military operation both in Central and Western Rafa the military says that it is now in full control of the Border area with Egypt which is known as the Philadelphia Corridor the area is 14 km long and intended to be a demilitarized buffer zone running along the border between Gaza and Egypt let's go to hany Mahmud he joins us now live from deala in central Gaza hanni so what more can you tell us about the Israeli Army's movements in southern Gaza yes well just judging from the the patterns of attacks and the movement of the Israeli military and its occupying forces on the ground along the eastern part of the of Rafa City that's near the the Border as well as the Egyptian rafah border that's the Philadelphia Corridor all the way the 13 km from uh the uh from the eastern part all the way to the coastal Road that's the area the Israeli military this is not the first time it it it it stated it's going to be the militarized or it's part of the uh buffer zone it was stated at the initial weeks of of this genocidal War but what it does really on the ground it's eating up more of the area of raah city is similar to what's going on in the northern part and along the Eastern Area so far we're looking at a map that it shows with the buffer zone that is being established by the Israeli military is eating up about 16% of the total area of the Gaza Strip and right now in Rafa City this area we're looking at least a 1 kilm depth uh Northern the Philadelphia Corridor into Rafa city which means the vast majority of the residential buildings the public facilities on on that particular area including the the schools the honor facilities and the residential buildings the mosque all are going to be uh destroyed in order for that area to to be demilitarized what that means it's more enforced displacement that what people have been so frustrated about everything is happening right now with these buffer zone or demilitarized area feeds into permanent displacement for people who will not be able to get back to this uh to these areas whether in the the southern part of R City the Philadelphia Corridor and the area surrounding it or the eastern part of the G strip all the way from to the city of B that's further northern part and and this is the arrangement that the Israeli military has been pushing for all of its sentiment and narrative has been uh endorsed uh to get to this point where they have not only uh the military control but also uh the uh to empty the area and make it uninhabitable from its own residence right honey as you as you've been describing what is uh the biggest dilemma for people to escape the fighting is they're now being forced for to leave the South and return back to the north but fighting in the north is also continuing yes and this just happened as the Israeli military in the past hours early hours of this morning started to widen its military Maneuvers and operation in the zun neighborhood that's at the eastern part of gas densely populated a neighborhood and it has been uh invaded several time in fact this time it's the fourth time and already the large part of this neighborhood has been destroyed in terms of the its public facilities and it's infrastructure the residential homes literally people within the past weeks have been going back to more of a wasteland similar to the scenario that happened in Khan unun we're looking at an area that is has become increasingly uninhabitable given that all social services and all means of Life have been destroyed while this is happening in a zun neighborhood in eastern Gaza Israel military announced ITS Tactical withdrawal from jabali refugee camp all the way to the edges of the area that's between tat and the City of B Laha and the further northern part of the Gaza Strip and in doing so it continues in circling all the hospital that has been under military siege for the past 14 days there are injuries there are patients there are people who are inside unable to leave to safer area unable to get whatever necessities of of term of of supplies water food or medical supplies to that hospital so this is not a full withdrawal it's tactical by the Israeli military it means they can get back to the refugee camp at any time given that what it created on the ground the new routes and the New Roads established by the Israeli military gives it an upper hand in maneuvering into the uh Refugee despite all of this we still have these confirmed reports of ongoing clashes the ongoing confrontation between Palestinian and fting groups on the ground whether in the northern part in jabalia and the northern part of the strip or Rafa City okay thank you for that update honey Mahmud there for andala in central Gaza joining us now on set is Tamar kamut associate professor public policy at The doart Institute for Graduate Studies good to join uh speak to you again Tamir I want to get a sense uh from you as to where we are to you think in terms of the war because we now have the Israeli military seizing control of this Philadelphia Corridor which is this entire length of uh the Gaza border with Egypt and despite everything that we've been hearing from the International Community in recent days they seem to have deepened their ground Invasion into Rafa um Maline correct I think the taking over the Philadelphia Corridor um signals for a beginning of a new stage and I think this is also related to the statements we're hearing from the Israeli government officials that this war will will will take month or maybe years to come um the Philadelphia Corridor was a a red line by the Egyptian government because it it it the Egyptians were very concerned and they were threatening that this would change the arrangements over the C David uh peace agreement they had with Israel and so it was more or less like a red line that Israel has already crossed again so Israel has been Crossing all the red lines set by the US the International Community even by its neighbor Egypt now and I think the Israelis are more or less they have upper upper hand in this in this War I mean I don't see any sincere um willingness by the us to stop the Israelis the Israelis or change the discourse of their behavior or action and my fear and my concern this this signals a new stage of probably a long presence of Israeli troops in Gaza reoccupation of the Gaza Strip cutting it into canons having full control over all the border crossings including Egypt isol in Gaza something similar to the West Bank you know maybe at later stage they will reintroduce the ABC areas you know and it's it's I think that they're there at this stage meanwhile the suffering for the people of Gaza continues another warning today from the UN about Aid deliveries into Gaza have dropped by 2/3 since Israel's move into Rafa and we heard from hany there people just going back and forth between the North and the South trying to escape the fighting but the fighting is now everywhere correct and and also you hear from the Israeli officials again statements they don't hide it I mean that they want to more or less to Corner most of gaza's population in this narrow strip of Al mawasi and kanun and there will be no return for gazans to the north unless Hamas releases the Israeli captives and so they're crushing the people like you know it's it's torture for the people and I think it's it's a brutality at its best you know and uh and and sadly yes the Israelis are more or less having an upper hand I mean I mean there's no one who's really able to stopping them what what the Americans are really caring about now is for Israel to have a clear plan for the day after as if again they're implicitly approving the reoccupation of Gaza they don't don't have a problem with Israel having control in Gaza but they want to know how Israel is going to govern Gaza and with whom and again that's another Scandal Palestina Z deserv this again to remind your viewers it's the Israeli occupation occupation is the root causes of all these problems we don't need another another reoccupation of the Gaza Strip if the Israelis get rid of Hamas Palestinians will keep resisting whether it's Hamas or someone else and sadly that the US is not there uh yes there are good news coming from many countries we see this wave of recognition that's very good and that's a step in the right direction but we're still far away from reaching a fair settlement for this conflict okay good to speak to you Tamar kamur Professor
