in other news British prime minister Rishi sunak has sacked his Home Secretary suela braan this follows her public criticism of the way police handled a pro Palestinian march on Saturday she had previously described demonstrations in support of Palestine as hate marches and mobs her departure comes as part of a wider cabinet reshuffle let's find out more with Sonia Gago who's in London for so Sonia after days of speculation about her future swela braan is out why did the prime Minister act now well I I think Mr sunak really couldn't ignore the signs anymore really uh not just from within his own party but also what was coming from the police forces as well uh there had been uh much concern uh especially from within the police force that their operational Independence was being compromised with the rhetoric that was coming from the Home Secretary uh herself uh way the way she called police officers as having some kind of bias now while she's managed to row back on this a little bit she she did give a note of thanks to the police uh officers for their the way that they dealt with the marches over the weekend she still uh remained quite uh vocal quite quite full-throated about her opinion of them uh calling them hate Marchers still uh and it just seems that this uh increasing divide between uh Suella Bran's opinions and the opinion of those even within her own party uh that she is perhaps causing more division more trouble as evidenced by the appearance of far rights on Saturday's March and this is more trouble than it is worth for the prime minister so does this Sonia indicate a change in where the government is headed on this issue well it may not indicate a change as such this evening on Monday evening the prime minister is actually going to be outlining his vision of for of foreign policy at a lord mayor's event where he will be talking about exactly where he sees the UK in this and in it he's expected to underline and emphasize re-emphasize the importance of establishing a two-state solution in the Middle East uh namely because of the fact that he will refer to the UK law Akers who were responsible for writing that in in the un uh uh document uh but they are likely to be sort of on not likely to be any other surprises but it will actually refocus on how the UK is adamant in trying to make that two-state solution that two the two states a reality rather than just a discussion with that as well and of course there is also the ongoing uh cries and and of course the ongoing uh discussions for there to be uh the access to humanitarian Aid that is also being talked about more and more often just like with France and the us as well so the importance of of on human life being placed on this as well as the definitive securing of that two-state solution okay Sonia thank you very much Sonia Geo Live for us there in London
