we're going to go live now to Rafa Crossing this is the crossing between Egypt and Gaza which has been blocked uh since the 7th of October the UN Secretary General Antonio gues is speaking let's listen in it is impossible to be here and not to feel a broken heart we are witnessing a paradox Behind These Walls we have 2 million people that is suffering enormously that is no water no food no medicine no fool that is under Fire that needs everything to survive on this side we have seen so many trucks loaded with water with fo with medicines with food exactly the same thing that I needed on this side of the wall so these trucks are not just trucks they are a Lifeline they are the difference between life and death for so many people in Gaza and to see them stuck here here makes me be very clear what we need is to make them move to make them move to the other side of this wall to make them move as quickly as possible and as many as possible now recently it was announced by Israel and by the United States that humanitarian Aid would be allowed to enter Gaza and I know that there is also an agreement between Egypt and Israel to make it possible but these announcements were made with some conditions and some restrictions and so we are now actively engaging with all the parties actively engaging with Egypt with Israel with us in order to make sure that we are able to clarify those conditions that we are able to limit those restrictions in order to have as soon as possible these trucks moving to where they are needed we need we absolutely need to have these tracks moving as quickly as possible and as many as necessary but for that this must be a sustained effort we are not looking for a one Convoy to come we are looking for convoys to be authorized in a meaningful numbers of trucks to go every day into Gaza to provide enough support to the Gaza people on the other hand there are requirements of verification but those verifications need to be effective but at the same time those verifications need to be done in a way that is practical and in a way that is expedite on the other hand we are not in a No Man's Land we are in the land of a sovereign country Egypt and it's essential to recognize the role of the Egyptian institutions and namely of the Egyptian red crescent and finally for unra to be able to distribute Aid on that side it's necessary that unra is Foo and so we need to have the guarantee that there will be enough foel on the other side to distribute Aid to the people in need so it is very clear that uh it is abs absolutely essential to solve these problems quickly and I'm hopeful they will be solved quickly to make sure that there is massive support humanitarian support to the people of Gaza unfortunately this is not a normal humanitarian operation it's an operation in a war zone and that is the reason why I have appaled for a humanitarian ceas fire not that I consider that humanitarian his fire is a precondition for humanitarian delivery we don't want to punish the Gaza people Twice first because of the war and second because of the lack of humanitarian aid but it is clear that humanitarian C fire would make uh things much easier and much safer for everybody and I want to end by expressing my deep gratitudes to the people and the government of Egypt Egypt is today the fundamental pillar that allows hope to exist on that side of the Border hope that these trucks will move to support them hope that the food Aid and the medicines I've seen in a train in a in a plane that has landed will also go to the people that needs it hope that there will be a future and hope that one day there will be peace with a two State solution with Palestinians and Israelis living in peace in two states one side by the other thank you very much thank you very much
