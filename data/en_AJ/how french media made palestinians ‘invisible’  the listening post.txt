[Music] October 10th 3 days after hamas's attack on Israel and France's most watched News Channel bfm TV is reporting an incendiary claim that among hamas's victims were 40 infants the reporter making that claim a claim which was soon disproven was not one of bm's own he worked for I24 news an Israeli Pro Netanyahu channel that has the same owner as bfm the French Israeli billionaire Patrick drai it was I24 news that first reported the dead baby's claim babies their heads caught off that's what they said throughout this war bfm has relied on I24 news for much of its coverage and it shows bfm TV has acted as a message relay medium for the Israeli military a lot of space was given to a representative of the army and that gave him a platform to spread propaganda the fact that there is a through line from a propaganda Channel like I24 news to a French News Channel which is required to cover the news impartially is an ethical problem I don't even dare to imagine the reaction in France if we had a 24-hour outlet that broadcast from a Russian Channel there's impunity when it comes to Israel senior editorial staff at bfm have themselves taken issue with the Channel's coverage complaining to management about a lack of balance among their misgivings the repeated interviews with a certain julianah described to viewers as a French Israeli living in Tel Aviv or a specialist in Israeli Society bahul is in fact a former spokesperson for the Israeli military as well as a former journalist for I24 news bfm did not respond to our request for comment however some of those disgruntled journalists at the channel say its reporting has begun to improve coverage of the war by France's publicly funded news outlets and some of its newspapers has been more even-handed but that still leaves plenty of others in an increasingly right-wing media landscape pushing some d divisive narratives I've often had the impression that the French media were telling us a story of civilization against barbarism several commentators have told us we absolutely cannot compare a child killed by Hamas on October 7th and a baby killed by Israeli bombings in what has greatly affected the media coverage is that there are very very few Palestinian voices on TV panels in most cases there are none we are invisible in the French media landscape and so there are no voices to Prov a counternarrative to correct lies to correct an analysis that has dehumanized the Palestinian cause instead for two or three weeks we found ourselves in an endless debate about who considers Hamas as a terrorist group who does not who condemns it who does not without ever going into the real issues in any depth since 2015 in France we have been very sensitive to the risk of islamist attacks and what we saw on October 7th reminded us of the attacks we've had in France so it was the nature of October 7th that led to it being interpreted in that way even so all opinions are represented in the French media as they are in most western media and as I would hope at Al jazer as well the discourse in France over the war in Gaza is unique because of two factors one historical the other demographic there was France's role in the world war to Holocaust when the government installed by the Nazi occupation helped deport an estimated 75,000 Jews to the death camps and modern day France is home to Europe's largest populations of both Jews and Muslims that Demands a delicate approach on the part of the macron government which for the most part has been missing macron's interior Minister Geral Daman set the tone quickly imposing a nationwide ban specifically on Pro Palestine protests citing a risk of quote public order disturbances France's Top Court later watered down that policy which demonstrators had ignored anyway risking arrest in their thousands dharma's lopsided approach towards bigoted attacks has also riled people since early in the war he has toured French TV studios sharing government figures on the surge in anti-semitic incidents it took weeks of pressure from Muslim Community leaders before darh manam published the stats for islamophobia which has also spiked multiple right voices in the media have been using the rise in anti-Semitism to delegitimize Pro Palestine protesters and to demonize Muslims during the war the issue of islamophobia has somewhat disappeared from the coverage what's more there are islamophobic media outlets in France the most scandalous is C news owned by the billionaire vanon bore who is a Catholic fundamentalist he has become extremely powerful and his news Outlet spread islamophobia on C News hosts like Pascal PR or son mabruk always emphasized that Muslims can't integrate that they can't understand the values of the French Republic these media personalities read the Israel Palestine conflict as the expression of an incompatibility between democracy and in the Arab Muslim world the coverage by these far-right news outlets has argued that if we are pro Palestinian we are necessarily anti-semitic and drawing links with theories about terrorism and islamism but we must not forget that many people from immigrant backgrounds in Europe come from the history of decolonization we are facing one of the last Colonial conflicts in the world and so it's normal that people who come from these anti-colonial struggles rally around the pal inan
