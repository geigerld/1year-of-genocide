the Israeli military says it can now confirm that it has killed Marwan Issa the deputy commander of hamas's military Wing Israel says he was killed by an air strike earlier this month that targeted the central Gaza Strip another senior Hamas Commander was also reportedly killed in that same attack this evening after checking all the intelligence at our disposal we have established with certainty based on solid intelligence that Maran Isa was killed in the strike we carried out approximately 2 weeks ago along with gazi Abu Maran Isa was the deputy of Muhammad Al daif and one of the planners of the October 7th Massacre while gazi Abu Tam was the former commander of the Hamas Central brigades and was in charge of weapons Manufacturing in Hamas they were killed in a targeted and precise strike based on information we received from military intelligence and shinb and which the Army used substantial and unconventional operational capabilities we will pursue our Noble efforts to track down and Target Hamas leaders well we can now speak to Osama hamdan he's the senior spokesperson for Hamas he joins us now from Beirut Mr Haman is Maran Isa dead everybody knows that Maran Isa is one of the major commanders of alasam brigades and everybody knows that the Israelis have been saying since day one that they want to Target the alasam and Hamas commanders in the Gaza Strip however in the absence of an official statement from Hamas or alasam confirming the marom or wounding of any of its commanders or members we cannot confirm such information have you sir heard anything from the alasan brigades your military Wing as to Mr issa's whereabouts and safety this information is not usually traded inside the movement the whereabouts or information pertaining to the safety or or alasam commanders is not information that is exchanged internally however in the absence of a statement by alasan brigades about the martyrdom or wounding of any of its leaders then the information published by the enemy is not deemed as confirmed it could very well be part of a psychological war that is waged by the occupation against the resistance and the Palestinian people so just to to be clear with our viewers at the moment Mr hamdan you're saying that you have no information as to Mr issa's whereabouts or safety because the military Wing has not shared that information with you I understand that he was acting as a sort of career for the captive negotiations some mediators have been saying that he's not been seen for some time are those talks being affected of it's not about information sharing I can confirm that any any attack against any of our commanders is something that is announced by the alasam leadership regarding the negotiation process there is a Hamas delegation that uh handles the negotiations these negotiations were recently thwarted by the Israeli side and our brother the mujah Maran Isa was not present in any negotiation sessions and I think that any talk about him not participating or appearing in the negotiations until now is part of the Israeli claims that they succeeded in reaching him and assassin meting him another Israeli claim that we're hearing today is that you Hamas have rejected a proposal for a deal and that action apparently shows the damage that's been done by the UN Security Council resolution that was passed demanding an immediate ceasefire can I ask you for your response to that and perhaps your assessment of how those talks are going quite frankly the occupation did not put forward any proposals the side that submitted an accurate proposal to put an end to the aggression and to conduct the swap was actually the Hamas movement and this garnered Praise by the mediators however the response that we received from netanyahu's government two days ago confirmed their rejection of our proposal and we believed that what actually encouraged the US Administration to abstain from voting against the SEC Council resolution was the realization by the US Administration that the side that is actually thwarting the negotiations is the Israeli side therefore the uh Security Council resolution did not cause any damage as claimed by the Israeli government however this resolution confirmed that the continuation of the Israeli aggression and the continuous efforts by the Israelis to thwart the negotiations will push the International Community towards resolutions that until recent were very impossible to reach due to the US veto the Israeli delegation has reportedly left Doha can I ask you what the situation is are the talks ongoing are you optimistic that there is a conversation to be had we have relayed a clear position based on the acceptable Israeli response we have informed the mediators of our position and this position can be summarized in two points one any deal that is reached must accomplish the Palestinian demands putting an end to the aggression a pullout of occupation forces allowing the refugees to return to their homes and provide them with Aid ensure the Reconstruction of Gaza and in return for that we are willing to conduct an acceptable and Equitable prisoner swap the mediators have relayed our stance to the Israeli delegation and it is possible that they went back to their country for further consultation with the Zionist entities government uh Mr hamdan I I want to ask you for Clarity on the Hamas position because a Hamas spokesperson yesterday told me on Al jazer that you are only open to releasing captives if an agreement with Israel is reached that's in violation of the UN Security Council resolution that was just passed is that still your position the resolution of the security Council states that prisoners and captives must be released from both sides so we have approximately 13,000 Palestinian prisoners that were arrested during the war and before that we had several thousands that were arrested and there should be a clear mechanism to releasee the prisoners being held by the Israeli side and we have been very clear if there is a seiz fire and if Palestinian prisoners are released it would only be um fair for us to release the Israeli captives uh in our custody what we want is putting an end to the aggression and releasing the captives however it was the Israelis who refused the security council's resolution and not Hamas on the contrary Hamas welcomed the resolution ution and we asked that there be practical mechanisms that actually Force the occupation to commit to this resolution and abide by it and implement it and the security Council resolution did actually call for the unconditional release of captives but I do hear that you are saying that you require some kind of an agreement in order to go forward uh we'll leave it there for now AMA hamdan the senior spokesperson for Hamas speaking to us today from Beirut thank you very much sir for joining us on the alaz newsour and for your time sorry clar to clarify quite frankly the security Council resolution first off stated that there should be a ceasefire followed by a prisoner release and therefore the security Council resolution prioritizes a ceasefire on the prisoner release and when there is a ceasefire we will be glad to engage in a prisoner swap thank you for that CL clarification Mr hamdan and thank you again for your time here on the aler news hour well let's now go to our correspondent hamda salut in occupied East Jerusalem hamda just coming back to what we've been hearing from the Israelis about Maran Issa this strike that they say killed him happened some two weeks ago what new information are the Israelis sharing or saying that they've received now in order to confirm his death the Israeli Army is saying that based on intelligence they've gathered from both the military and the Shin Bet they've now drawn the conclusion that mwan Isa was killed in that air strike in central Gaza a couple of weeks ago the Americans however on March 18th said that based on their own intelligence gathering they were able to confirm themselves that mwan Isa was killed in that air strike where the Israelis were still working to confirm it now again we have not seen any of this intelligence or any of this information that the Israelis are saying Hames itself has said that they don't have any information on the matter but it goes back to Israel saying that it is going to accomplish every single one of the goals and objectives that it's set out to achieve in the beginning of this war and one of the main ones was dismantling Hamas both militarily and politically they've been saying it for months nearly six months in fact that they are going to go after all Hamas leadership not just in AA but all over the world and that includes both political figures and Military figures Daniel hagari had said that mwana Isa was in fact one of the people who planned the October 7th attack saying that he was third in command to yya senad and Muhammad and this is the highest figure in hamas's military Wing that the Israelis are claiming they have killed in Gaza and they say that they're going to continuously go after people in Hamas both fighters on the ground and Leadership despite the fact that this catastrophic and dire humanitarian situation has unfolded in Gaza with more than 32,000 Palestinians who've been killed as a result of Israel's war Hamas alut there with all the latest for us from occupied East Jerusalem thank you very much hamda
