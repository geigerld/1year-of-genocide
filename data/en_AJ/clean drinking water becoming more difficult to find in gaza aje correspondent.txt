these exhausted Palestinians have waited for hours to get clean water at this station in children are also in the queue clutching containers too large for their hands this is their daily reality for Palestinians where diminishing Water Supplies turn every day into a struggle for survival we have to wait 3 hours just to fill one container there are lots of people we have to Quee and the water pressure is weak and sometimes the water is completely shut off and the world is just watching since Israel's bombardment of Eastern Raa has escalated many have flit to Central Gaza increasing the pressure on supplies there Gaza has been suffering from water shortages for years the main source the coastal Aqua fires is contaminated by sewage and pollution making nearly all of its water and fit for human consumption Before the War people had access to 80 lers of water per day and that was already far below what the UN recommended but now everybody here gets between two and three lers per day the situation is worsening each day due to water infrastructure being damaged by Israeli air strikes we came here today looking for a safe place I walked for 10 or 15 minutes looking for water and I heard of the desalination station here and I hope the water is drinkable and for human consumption and this is what we are hoping and as Palestinians endure long waits for dwindling supplies of water diseases caused by the shortages and War are spreading rapidly H Mahmud Al jaaz Palestine make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaaz
