diplomatic efforts are underway to reach a ceasefire in Gaza with the US pressuring Hamas to agree to Israel's terms Secretary of State Anthony blink's been meeting prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel to push for a deal he says is achievable blink's also told Netanyahu the US still opposes a ground offense of in Rafa and that there needs to be an improvement in the distribution of humanitarian Aid into Gaza we're determined uh to get a ceasefire that brings the hostages home and to get it now uh and the only reason that that wouldn't be achieved is because of Hamas uh there is a proposal on the table and as we've said uh no delays no no excuses uh the time is now uh and The Time Is Now long past due to bring the hostages home to their families uh at the same time even as we're working uh with Relentless determination to get the ceasefire that brings the hostages home uh we also have to be focused on uh people in Gaza who suffering in this Crossfire of Hamas makan going to get more with our correspondent in occupied East Jerusalem Stephanie Dean and step we've been here so many times before with Anthony Lincoln turning up and visiting uh senior figures in Tel Aviv and in in Jerusalem as well uh what is the aim this time does it do it make any difference to what we have seen before well the difference this time is that the Rafa the Rafa offensive seems to be imminent if this this deal doesn't go ahead and this is why also you have the Americans and also the Egyptians putting incredible pressure on both sides they don't want to see the Offa offensive happen in the wide scale ground offensive as it is planned um so you have him really pushing for that but interestingly the rhetoric that's been coming from the Israeli Prime Minister for the last couple of days and today and the message to blinkin is that basically there is not going to be an end to the war and we know that this is something that Hamas uh is stuck to they say that there has to be an end to the war in any agreement before it releases any captives the current deal on the table talks about a sustained period of calm in the second phase after a 40-day ceasefire but with the message coming from the Prime Minister talking also the fact that Rafa is going to happen with or without a deal uh certainly it's sending a message and we're expecting to hear from Hamas uh by the end of Wednesday by the end of tonight a response to the deal that is on the table it's sending a message that a he has no intention of ending the war and B Rafa is going to happen Deal or No Deal uh so you know you start to question what incentive Hamas will have to agree to anything very complicated negotiations we're going to have to wait and see certainly what they're going to respond and then go from there as we were mentioning before Anthony blinkin saying that this push for a deal is he says achievable that he's told Netanyahu that the US is still opposing a ground offense of in Rafa as you've been talking about just talk us through briefly what the situation you alluded to it just a moment ago just talk us through what the the the logistics are if you like about the ceasefire deal that's going on at the moment yes what's on the table at the moment is uh initially a 40-day ceasefire uh 33 captives will be released these are captives that fall under the humanitarian umbrella so uh those over 50 years old women uh and those that are injured um and sick in response we understand uh up to 900 almost a thousand Palestinian prisoners will be released also the Israeli Army will remove itself somewhat from the corridor that currently Cuts Gaza into from the North and the South and there should be the allowance of Palestinians to return North to their homes once that happens you will then have a period uh a second phase of sustained calm so all of that uh seems to quite clear but if you look at the positions of both sides which is one is saying only a deal if there is an end to the war Hamas the Israeli Prime Minister saying absolutely no enter the war and Rafa with or without a deal it seems very difficult as to how this deal can be achieved the way Anthony blinkin still is describing it is as cautiously optimistic that something is tangible at this point but again what's different this time is that if there is no deal the Israelis have made it very clear Raa is going to happen and it's going to happen very soon Stephanie deer and occupied East Jerusalem Stephanie thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
