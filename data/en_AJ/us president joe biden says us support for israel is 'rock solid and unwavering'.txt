US President Joe Biden has vowed to support Israel and his warning against countries interfering in Israel let me say this as clearly as I can this is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek Advantage the world is watching I've also been in contact with the King of Jordan spoken with members of Congress directing my National Security team to engage with their Israeli counterparts milit Ary to Military Intelligence to intelligence dipl Diplomat to Diplomat to make sure Israel has what it needs from Kuwait to Yemen thousands of protesters have also marched across several cities to show their solidarity with Palestinians hundreds of people celebrated in the Iranian Capital tahran following hamas's attacks on Israel crowds rallied at the Palestine Square waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-israel slogans and in Parliament Iranian MPS voed their support for the unprecedented attack on Israel rosalin Jordan is in Washington DC dorsa Jabari is live in tan let's start though in Washington DC with Ros and Jordan so are we seeing American politicians take a familiar pattern of uh backing Israel at a time of conflict uh that is correct uh you have not uh seen any uh over criticism of Israel in this uh situation of anything you have seen full Thro at support not just from the Biden Administration but also from members of Congress whether Republican or Democratic uh this is uh perhaps one of the few issues in latterday Washington where politicians of both political parties agree that the US's National Security is very much tied to that of Israel and that there is a commitment to ensuring that Israel does what it needs to do and that it has what it needs in order to protect its citizens now there is a growing uh sentiment that uh the uh treatment of Palestinians both in the occupied West Bank as well as in Gaza needs to be dealt with that Israel needs to be held accountable for it but you don't hear as much of about that as you do about the need and the right of Israel to protect itself and that it's according to politicians from both political parties all right roson stay with us for a second because what we're going to try and do here now is show you as always all sides of this conflict and story and DSA Jabar is joining us from tan having listened in as as Rosen was explained to us the perspective there emerging from the body politic in Washington DC it's a very different narrative and perspective in tan right daa certainly Sammy this has being seen as a historic Victory not only for the Palestinian resistance uh movements but also for the Palestinian people which is a cause that is very close to the leadership here in Iran the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali has not directly commented about the events that unfolded over the past 24 hours but just a few days ago on October 3rd he was speaking at an event and he spent most of that time talking about how Israel is a cancer that must be eradicated and how the Palestinian resistance will prevail uh some very interesting comments from the supreme leader just days before uh what happened in Palestine and Israel we also saw the social media accounts of Ali K put together very quickly um a montage of pictures of what we saw yesterday in places along the border between Gaza and Israel um and uh where the supreme leader words in previous speeches when he was talking about the resistance movements of the Palestinian people over the pictures of what transpired on the ground so I think it's very telling the leadership here has had a very strong uh position and a close relationship with the Palestinian leadersh leadership uh since they came into power here after the revolution of 1979 it's a very um close ideological relationship ship as well Israel is Iran's Public Enemy Number One every unveiling of a new missile or uh a drone uh program that Iran has uh they make a point of saying how long it would take that missile to reach Tel Aviv the last time we saw that was um just a few months ago in June I believe where Iran unveiled a Hypersonic ballistic missile and they said this would take six minutes to reach Tel Aviv I I think that's very telling after the events that unfolded over the past few hours all right Ros and stay with us we're going to go back to dors back to Rosland and there's a line that just dropped Rosland which is this is according to Israeli media we should point out because earlier we had a figure of 400 Dead from the Israeli Ministry of Health well now Israeli media reporting the number of Israeli dead in this attack has jumped to 500 that's 5 00 dead and the last figure we had for those wounded was over 2,000 Rosen I'm wondering you know the pattern of conflicts that we've seen in the past between Israel and Gaza have resulted almost exclusively in large numbers of dead and wounded reserved usually for the Palestinians in terms of really Mass numbers this time we're seeing a big number of casualties on the Israeli side certainly bigger than than anything we've seen for a long time time uh before is this going to in any any sign that this is going to shift the discourse and the thinking in the US that it's time to deal with the root causes of this any space in the narrative there to talk about ending occupation ending Siege rather than just going from one round of violence to another well you're already seeing among uh the uh pundits who are publishing uh snap editorials and uh think pieces that uh this is putting the Israeli Palestinian uh conflict back at the top of the agenda for the Biden Harris Administration and there had been this U growing assumption that this particular conflict was not a top priority especially in light of the issue of Ukraine and the issue of China but certainly given that this has now come back into into the uh public uh discourse political analysts uh you know Regional uh strategists are now saying that the US needs to bring its uh good offices to bear and to try to deal with this question once and for all in fact there had been this suggestion that perhaps it was setting aside you know this uh setting this aside as a priority because it was uh trying to build on something that had been started by the Trump Administration the Abraham Accords trying to build political alliances and political recognition between Israel and more of its Arab neighbors and this was certainly uh something that uh many people were expecting could be coming to fruition if Saudi Arabia and Israel were to agree in the coming months to recognize each other officially and to open diplomatic relations well that was now become much more complicated because the Saudis had been one of the advocates for the Palestinian people and there was a growing up thought that the Saudis essentially were setting aside that advocacy role in order to build this diplomatic relationship well now how do you marry the two there's no one uh resolution or one agreement here in Washington on how this can be settled I would imagine that this would lead to many discussions particular ularly given that the United Nations Security Council is meeting later on Sunday to talk about the um the crisis at hand but certainly the bigger discussion now is of how do you deal with the question of a still unformed un uh legalized Palestinian state with the larger issue of trying to bring peace to the greater Middle East this is something that the US and its allies not just in the region but in Western Europe and really in other parts of the world are now going to have to Grapple with whether or not they feel there is bandwidth to do so all right let's thank both of our reporters for their excellent reporting on different sides of the world Rosen and Jordan there Washington DC and Dosa Jabari who joined us live from tan
