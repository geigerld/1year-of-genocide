just one day after an Israeli attack killed 45 people in a camp in Rafa in southern Gaza the city's main hospital has been forced to shut down Kuwait hospitals where most of the victims of that Sunday night attack were taken the director of the hospital closed the facility hours ago citing security concerns earlier on Monday an area just outside Kuwait hospital was hit by an Israeli attack two of its medical staff were killed eyewitnesses say the victims were hit by fire from an Israeli aircraft just out inside the hospital Gates the injured must now be taken to field hospitals Israeli forces have damaged destroyed or occupied 24 hospitals in the strip since October the 7th so now out of gaza's 36 hospitals only six are still functioning and then only partially all of them lack critical supplies staff and Medicine the alali Baptist Hospital is the only one open with limited capacity in Gaza City in the north of the strip in central Gaza four other hospitals Al AXA Al AA NASA and the European are caring for the bulk of the wounded and the sick the AL emirati hospital is operating in Rafa in the south of the strip supplies for the remaining functioning hospitals are critically low the alali Baptist Hospital in Gaza City received a lifeline on Monday with delivery of medicines Health supplies and fuel from the World Health Organization Israel has been blocking life-saving supplies from reaching Health Facilities across the strip and is reporting from alaka hospital in central Gaza where fuel is in desperately short supply there were supposed to be 200 trucks including four fuel trucks to enter the Gaza Strip till this point nothing entered the Gaza Strip we're trying we were trying all day to follow up what happened to these trucks and there's no any confirmed reports that they made a a step into Gaza but uh uh we just talked to uh the health officials in Al AA hospital and they said they did not receive any fuel uh so far and it they are going to witness a very catastrophic situation if this continues they have to uh uh receive fuel as soon as possible especially tomorrow let me show you uh right now how the situation is first this is the entrance of the hospital and where people are um receiving their Med medical uh treatments some of the medical uh some of the patients are receiving their Medical Treatments outside the hospital because the weather is so hot the the hospital is packed and overwhelmed with patients and here are some of the patients that are um uh having like staying outside because they're saying that it's very suffocating inside of the hospital a lot of Palestinians rely on this Hospital if the hospital does not receive any fuel in the next 24 hours hundreds of Palestinian patients are going to be in risk of death joining me now is Dr Muhammad T he's an orthopedic surgeon from London volunteering in Rafa with faral scientific it's a charity organization good to have you with us on Al jazer um I understand that you and members of the organization left Gaza about a week ago but I believe you still in contact with people on the ground particularly people in Kuwait hospital are you able to give us an indication of what the situation is like there uh hi good evening thank you for having me yes I can I can say that uh the situation is very dire um of course as you know the Kuwaiti hospital had a direct attack uh to its uh out side perimeter in which uh two staff were critically injured uh even killed and uh it's the evacuation on the hospital has been forced and so now you have uh the Kuwaiti field Hospital in Al maasi bring uh being prepared but it's not quite ready as far as I understand and uh as we speak uh right now I've got off the phone to some of my colleagues who I worked with at the eh and they are experiencing artillery fire and quadcopters attacking very nearby they are in fear for their lives and we are talking about healthc Care Professionals here talking about regular people like you and me they are holding on to their children in the basement of their home and hoping that nothing nothing hits them it's a dire situation uh of course the you know this is in tala suan which is in the west of Rafa this is an area which has not been evacuated and yet there is very Fierce very Fierce attacks happening as we speak um so the Kuwaiti hospital was evacuated the the main hospital and they are moving to al- masasi where they have a field Hospital which is not quite ready and in the meantime not only that but quad copters as far as I know and I've seen some footage to confirm this are uh restricting the movement of ambulances so those that are injured cannot even receive help uh the medical situation in Gaza really is in a dire State I mean I cannot tell you enough how terrible it is uh we need to do more the International Community needs to do more um we need to allow for medical uh Personnel to enter Gaza we need to allow for medical Provisions to enter Gaza all these hospitals are experiencing uh diminishing supplies of very critical medicines um and also fuel to run we saw very recently with Al AA Hospital uh that they were nearing the end of their uh functionality as their fuel supply dwindled into nothing um so the situation is terrible there and I really I urge everybody and I urge the International Community to please act you know we're advocating for Humanity here we're just advocating for the preservation of human life and dignity and so you know it words start to fail me at this point the Kuwaiti hospital is one of the key medical facilities in Rafa we know that Israel is focusing its attacks um on Rafa with the closure of that hospital what do do you think is going to be the impact on medical facilities and the ability to care for the sick and the injured in Rafa as those attacks continue so when I was in Gaza I was based at the European Gaza hospital and uh many a night when we would see and hear the strikes in Rafa uh we knew that the casualties were all going to the Kuwaiti hospital and at times they were simply overwhelmed but there were there was no safe way to bring those patients to the European Gaza hospital so the the Kuwaiti Hospital in the South was the main port for all those that are being injured or or worse and now that we have the closure of this hospital really the people are rougher are in in in severe danger they are lacking access to critical Health Care this is really a dire situation that I cannot convey enough how terrible it is um not only that but you you must remember that t sulan is not an area as far as I know that has been evacuated according to the colleagues that I have there and they are experiencing uh artillery strikes very nearby they are living in fear for their lives these are nurses these are doctors these are my colleagues and it's just a dire situation if they are hurt where do they go where do which hospital do they go to so the field Hospital in Al maasi is not quite ready it doesn't have the capability to care for the injured for the critically uh uh uh sick either it's not quite ready and it's not set up for this service so really what we're experiencing here is a multi-prong attack unfortunately whereby not only are the people being attacked directly but they're also being uh blocked from receiving critical uh medical services and it's not just a question of treating uh injuries and sickness there is the present risk of disease spreading as well because of course the conditions that people are being treated in now in field hospitals are far from sterile and far from controlled um put it this way uh even within the European Gaza Hospital uh it was not uncommon for us to experience um many dire situations of of a lack of s sterile conditions and uh provision of appropriate wound care I mean I I encountered patients on the ward who had external fixators applied to them because of fractures and they were sitting in a pile of pus uh with with precious SES going into their into even their hip socket uh it was a very terrible and and when I remember this story it's actually of a very young person and he was emaciated and it was really a terrible a sight because you know I looked at this individual and I thought my God this is a human being for God's sake and look what they have been reduced to so if you have these conditions within an institution like the European Gaza hospital let me remind you set up by by us in Europe um then you can imagine what the conditions might be like in a in a field hospital where they don't have access to clean water and the rest of it if the Israeli military action in Rafa and indeed The Wider uh area of Gaza continues at the rate that it currently is what are your concerns about the impact on Palestinians as the medical facilities dwindle I mean words fail me really I I fear for the people of uh Gaza I fear for the people of Rafa um theyve been forced from the north to the south from the south to the West there is no safe place left anymore um without access to Medical Provisions they will suffer they will die unnecessarily um even when I was there we we would work tirelessly on some patients we would operate on them in the middle of the night we would save their lives and then they would die because they didn't have access to dialysis for example and so sometimes it's only you know the system is only as good it as its weakest link so if that fails the whole system collapses and there are many many weak links in this chain right now either the supply provision of care sterile conditions safe conditions and with the intensifying of the attacks we really find oursel in a situation where Humanity really is being extinguished there and I call upon all International Players to do their part to please do more to bring this war to an end please help us to help the Palestinians please allow medical personnel back into Gaza as soon as possible we need to be there we need to be able to take medical supplies with us there is now a a restriction so for example when we first arrived uh via the Rafa Crossing we all individually lugged around 10 suitcases full of Medical Aid uh now if uh emps want to enter they can only take two for a 3-week mission you cannot what can you do with two suitcases full of Aid absolutely nothing that will be extinguished within matter of days so please for the sake of humanity we need to do more we need to help them this is a really a dire situation and it's unpalatable for any decent human being I mentioned that you had been in with a charity organization for a scientific previously are you going to attempt to get back into Gaza to help I am actively trying every single day to return um and we are hoping that we can coordinate our mission with feder scientific and the who uh to enter as soon as possible those people need us we are willing servants uh we we all we want to do really is to help uh the people of Gazza for us this is an honor they are a people that are wonderful people they are being starved they are being killed through no fault of their own these people that I refer to are apolitical they have no affiliations with any political organizations they are just families they're just colleagues and we really need to do more um it's really not good enough what's going on right now uh I mean the International Community needs to exert more pressure I really call upon them I call upon our American uh Partners I call upon my British government I call upon the European Union please do more please allow us to help these people our cause is a human humanitarian one we we don't have any political affiliations we simply want to serve these people and help them and protect them Dr Muhammad T thank you very much indeed for being with us on Al jaer thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
