10 members of the security Council Gabe I'm sorry to interrupt you but that un Security Council session has begun let's listen in with rule 37 of the council's provisional rules of procedure I invite the representative of Israel to participate in this meeting it is so decided the security Council will now begin its consideration of item two of the agenda members of the council have before them documents s202 4239 the text of the draft resolution submitted by the United States of America the council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it I now give the floor to those members of the council who wish to make statements before the vote I give the Flor to the representative of the United States thank you Mr President colleagues for all the stories that have been written about divisions in this Council and there are many real divisions I believe most of us share many of the same goals first and foremost we want to see an immediate and sustained ceasefire as part of a deal that leads to the release of all hostages being held by Hamas and other groups and that will allow much more life-saving humanitarian Aid to get into Gaza of course we can't just want that to happen we have to make that happen we have to do the hard work of diplomacy I know you've heard me say that a lot and that's because it's the truth a security Council resolution means much less if it is not actually made real on the ground that's why the United States Egypt and Qatar are working around the clock in the region to secure an immediate and sustained ceasefire as part of a deal that leads to the release of all hostages being held by Hamas and other groups that will help us address the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza we believe we're close we're not there yet unfortunately and this moment is one where the security Council has a critical role to play by adopting the resolution before us we can put pressure on Hamas to accept the deal on the table colleagues you don't need me to tell you that every day without a deal meaning every day without a ceasefire leads to more needless suffering for more than 100 hostages including a one-year-old child being held in cap captivity by Hamas and other groups for innocent Palestinians in Gaza who have been displaced who are starving who desperately need peace for Israelis who've continued to face missile attacks from Hamas a terrorist group that set this conflict into motion on October 7th every day without a deal means more needless suffering this resolution will move us closer to securing that deal and help us alleviate that suffering and I urge all council members to vote Yes to vote for a resolution that at long last condemns Hamas for horrific terrorist attacks and sexual violence that makes clear that all civilians Palestinians and Israelis should be able to live without fear of violence that demands the protection of civilians in Gaza and stresses that a major ground offensive in Rafa poses a grave threat to civilians even as we still work toward eliminating Hamas from all parts of Gaza that calls on Israel to eliminate all barriers and restrictions to humanitarian Aid especially as the threat of famine looms large in Northern Gaza that condemns calls to resettle Gaza and makes clear that the Palestinian Authority should have ultimate authority over Gaza and that reiterates this council's support for a two-state solution this is a strong resolution it's the byproduct of exhaustive inclusive negotiations it reflects the consensus of this Council and it does more than just call for a ceasefire it helps to make that make a ceasefire possible it would be a historic mistake for the council to not adopt this text and I again urge all council members to vote yes thank you Mr President I thank the representative of the United States for their statement I give the Flor to the representative of Russian feder ation Mr President the United Nations security Council has for a half a year 6 months been unable to adopt a document with a demand for a ceasefire in Gaza all of the attempts time and again came up against the resistance of the United States who four times in Cold Blood cast a veto in this chamber in this time we have heard from us colleagues repeatedly their justifications either they were saying that the achievement of a fire is premature in so far as there is a need to give space for so-called counterterrorism efforts of Israel or they demanded for the security Council not to stand in the way of effective diplomacy of Washington on the ground that is a quote or they called for us to wait for the onset of Ramadan when apparently an agreement would definitely be reached for cease for an end to the violence and now 6 months have elapsed Gaza has virtually been wiped from the earth and now the US Representative without blinking has been asserting that Washington has finally begun to recognize the need for a ceasefire this sluggish thought process in Washington has caused the lies has been come at the cost of the lives of 32,000 peaceful Palestinians 2ir of whom are women and children and even now we have observed a typical hypocritical spectacle when wrapped up in a ceasefire the United States have been trying to sell a product to the membership of the security Council and to the entire International Community they've been trying to sell something completely different namely a diluted formulation about a det about a definition and determination of the imper ative for a ceasefire this kind of philosophical passages about moral imperatives are seen in limited quantities in the work of Emanuel Kant however to save the lives of peaceful CI Palestinian civilians this is not enough and this is in no way what is stipulated in the Mandate of the UN Security Council the council which is vested with a unique mechanism to demand a ceasefire and we necessary to compel compliance therewith US Secretary of State an Anthony blinkin during an official interview in jida on the 20th of March with the correspondent alhad stated and I quote well in well in fact we actually have a resolution that we put forward right now that's before the UN Security Council that does call for an immediate ceasefire tied to the release of hostages and we hope very much that countries will support that end quote however in the text of the US draft which has been put to the vote today there is no such call so what turns out is that either the US representative at the United Nations or the US Secretary of State have been deliberately misleading the International Community distinguished colleagues from the very onset it was clear that the so-called negotiations which are us colleagues have been engaged in on this issue have been focused gear merely to drag out the time all of our comments all of our red lines were Time and Time disregarded as were the proposals of a number of other delegations this was some kind of an empty re rhetorical exercise rather than normal work on a document the American product is exceedingly politicized the sole Purp purp of which is to help to uh play into play to the voters to throw them a bone in the form of some kind of a mention of a ceasefire in Gaza and to establish the US's political Ambitions in the region through the establishment of terrorist labels and to ensure the impunity of Israel whose crimes in the draft are not even assessed I wish to draw attention to the following the US draft contains an effective green light for Israel to mount a military operation Rafa at the very least the authors try to make it to such that nothing would prevent Western Jerusalem from continuing their brutal cleansing of the south of the Gaza Strip and what is Washington actually trying to achieve we have already stated that we will no longer tolerate pointless resolutions which do not contain a call for a ceasefire which lead us to Nowhere this draft should not pass with the majority of the membership to send a message about the in admissibility not the paliative but the actual int of Washington it would be very strange for us to see that those members of the Council of whom there are a majority who understand this and who persuaded us of the deficiencies in the US draft it would be be surprised if they now lift their hands voting in favor of it ladies and gentlemen if you do this you will cover yourselves in disgrace consider once again how will you look before the population in the Middle East in front of your own populations if you support this hypocritical initiative which is designed to disorient the International Community and essentially to undermine the authority of the council uh making sure that it cannot have an impact on the situation on the ground that this Council will not be able to have an impact of the situation on the ground to ensure that it not get in the way of the White House are you willing to play into their hands when it comes to this unsavory spectacle the Russian Federation will not do this as a permanent member of the UN Security Council as one of the founders of the United Nations we recognize the historical Global responsibility we shoulder for the maintenance of International Peace and security we cannot allow the security Council to become an instrum instrument in the advancement of Washington's destructive policy in the Middle East if this resolution is to be adopted this would definitively close the door when it comes to discussions about the need for a ceasefire in Gaza this would free the hands of Israel and it would uh result in all of Gaza and its entire population having to face destruction Devastation or expulsion we are not Guided by what is convenient for Washington and sat satellites The Satellites who rais their hands following instructions from Washington we do not follow this what we what guides us is what is necessary for the Palestinian people and what helps to advance peace we call upon the membership of the security Council not to allow this to occur to vote against the US draft Mr president for the United Nations security Council to ultimately be in a position to deliver upon it mandate for the M maintenance of International Peace and security a number of non-permanent members of the security Council have drafted an alternative draft resolution which stipulates black on white the demand for both a ceasefire and the unconditional release of hostages this is a balanced and a a political document we see no reason for which the membership of the security Council for the members of the security Council not to support this unless a ceasefire and the release of hostages is not part of plans this is an attempt to allow the council to comply with the noble functions that have been vested in it and I call for you not to let this opportunity slip away thank you for your attention I thank the representative of Russian Federation for their statement I shall put the draft I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now now will those in will those in favor of the draft resolution contained in document s224 239 please raise their abstention the result of the Voting is as follows 11 votes in favor three votes against one [Music] abstention the draft resolution has not been adopted owning to the negative vote of a permanent member of the council I now I now give the floor to those members of the council who wish to make statements after the vote I give the floor to the representative of the United States thank you again Mr President today okay so we have been watching there the UN Security Council voting on the latest draft resolution by the United States which spoke of the imperative um the imperative need for a ceasefire which has been vetoed by Russia which means that it is not going to go through let's listen to the US ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas Greenfield who's speaking now and now Russia and China will give you all sorts of explanations for his obstruction but whether or not it will admit it there are two deeply deeply cynical reasons behind its votes first Russian China still could not bring itself to condemn hamas's terrorist attacks on October 7th can we just pause on that for a moment Russia and China refuses to condemn Hamas for burning people alive for gunning down innocent civilians at a concert for raping women and girls for taking hundreds of people hostage this was the deadliest single attack on Jews since the Holocaust and a permanent member of this Council can't even condemn it I'm sorry it's it's really outrageous and it's below the Dignity of this body the second reason behind this veto is not just cynical it's also Petty Russia and China simply did not want to vote for a resolution that was pinned by the United States because it would rather see us fail than to see this Council succeed even after inclusive consultations over weeks and weeks even after negotiations and edits produced a draft that received overwhelming Council support and as you saw today nearly every council member voted to put the full weight of this body behind the Diplomatic efforts to secure an immediate and sustain ceas fire as part of a deal that leads to the release of all hostages that will allow much more humanitarian Aid to get into Gaza but once again Russia put politics over prog o over progress Russia who has carried out an unprovoked war on its neighbor has the audacity and the hypocrisy to throw stones when it lives in a glass house itself so let's be honest for all the fiery rhetoric we all know that Russia and China are not doing anything diplomatically to advance a lasting peace or to meaningfully contribute to the humanitarian response effort colleagues there is obviously another resolution that some of you would like to be considered but in its current form that text fails to support sensitive diplomacy in the region worse it is it could actually give Hamas an excuse to walk away from the deal on the table all of us want to see this Council speak out but we should not move forward with any resolution that jeopardizes the ongoing negotiations and these are not just negotiations that are being carried out by the United States others in the region Qatar and Egypt are engaged on these negotiations so if that alternative resolution comes up for a vote and does not support the diplomacy happening on the ground we may once again find this Council deadlocked I truly hope that that does not come about and so far our apart the the United States will keep at it we'll continue to work toward a deal alongside Qatar and Egypt and we will work with any council member that is seriously interested in adopting a resolution that will help make that deal possible thank you Mr the United States for their statement
