let's go straight to Dr T Ahmed he's an emergency medical physician who was working in Gaza a little earlier this year he served as a medical escort for a child who was evacuated to the United States more Specialized Care he joins us now from Chicago so astonishing figures really over 22,000 people suffering from lifechanging injuries in Gaza that's a quarter of those injured what do you make of these figures well I I think this is something that many who are involved in humanitarian relief and many of the healthcare workers on the ground and international healthcare workers this is something that we've been suspecting something that uh has underscored the urgency to stop the aggression against the Gaza Strip I want to kind of say a couple of things about the report that the who analysis kind of mentions first these are very conservative estimates um they're doing so in a way to let you know that there is something urgent Happening Here year a quarter of the more than 990,000 people who've been injured will require care for the rest of their lives but that number is likely to be astronomically higher they're using conservative estimates and this is something that should scare everyone and what kind of injuries are we talking about here when they say life altering I just want to kind of paint the picture of the three most common injuries here you mentioned spinal cord and brain injuries these are people who need aroundthe clock care these are people who will need to be at least checked uh once or twice a day we want to make sure that they have the best chance at surviving these injuries we're talking about major Burns Burns that put you at risk for developing an infection and potentially dying as a result of that we're talking about amputations limb amputations things that will alter the course of your life forever with respect to whether or not you may be able to work again whether you can do activities of daily living like being able to go to the bathroom these are the kinds of injuries we're talking about now when you picture that and you realize that we're saying that an entire population of people have been deeply affected by this that virtually no family will be untouched you think about really how catastrophic this is how many how much resources will be required to address the needs of all of these injured people and where will the money come from who will rebuild the health care infrastructure that's been destroyed over the last 11 months how are we going to make sure that the people that I just mentioned that miraculously survived the intense bombing by the Israeli military how can we make sure that they don't suffer silently or that they don't succumb to these injuries a year later or two years later Dr Tara Ahmed you mentioned uh the limb amputations because those were figures that really stood out to stood out to me around 4,000 limb amputations have taken place over the course of this war during the course of the last year and many of those affected will of course be children tell me when someone loses a leg or an arm or it's amputated what happens next what sort of Care and Rehabilitation would a person need if somebody survives this devastating injury of course the initial phase of this is the surgery that will be required but afterwards that's the most important part of the recovery you want to make sure that an infection doesn't develop you want to make sure that this person who has suffered who has suffered this severely disfiguring injury this injury that has rendered them potentially immobile or they're not going to be able to you know go to the bathroom or go to school what can we do to support their recovery how do we make sure that they're able to get back on their feet this acquires rehabilitation services in fact in the United States we have rehab hospitals dedicated to this so once you're out of the hospital during that really initial critical phase the real work starts and you go and you work with a physical therapist with an occupational therapist it should also be noted that this specific analysis by The Who said that from January to May January to May that over that almost 40 physical therapists have been killed in the Gaza Strip so we have injured patients that they don't have necessarily the services available to them but we also have a human resources problem the people that can help save some of these lives are being killed they're being targeted so this is something that's really important to know so what you're saying is the sort of Rehabilitation we're talking about here people are not able to get in Gaza yeah they are not able to get it in Gaza it's not readily available and it's for all of the people that are involved in this care the people who would be providing these Services we have to recognize that they're also under attack they're being being targeted and that there is a very short supply of the healthcare workers needed to support these Services if they were somehow available if a hospital was still functioning I mean we're talking about 500 healthcare workers that have been killed since the start of this in October and so this is a major problem that we all have to recognize and so making things like medical evacuations easier making sure that this is an international effort is of Paramount importance and that's not happening right now in fact it's incredibly difficult to get somebody out of the Gaza Strip and to get them the care that they need Dr Tera Ahmed I appreciate you speaking to us on Al jazer an emergency medical physician who was working in Gaza earlier this year thank you thank you for having me make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
