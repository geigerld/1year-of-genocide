families in gaza are mourning this funeral is for yasir and napahin he and his three children muhammad dalia and ahmed were killed in the beit hanoon home by an israeli airstrike not far away other palestinians are surveying the damage some have set up temporary shelters others are trying to salvage their possessions three years three wars and we suffer every time they bomb the house from a different side once from the east ones from the west once from the north and every time they ask us to leave and every time we suffered great fear because israel says a hunt for leaders of the palestinian islamic jihad israel and its allies call them tourists but the relatively small armed resistance group enjoys support among palestinians the effect heavy aerial and arterially attacks on neighborhoods in gaza and retaliatory rocket fire into israel egypt mediated the cease-fire between israel and the islamic jihad with support from the uan and qatar islamic jihad has told al jazeera that as part of the deal it has been assured that senior members held in israeli jails will be released something that israel denies we have a very clear decision that without releasing khalid and bassam assadi there will be no ceasefire agreement that will be a break for the agreement from the israeli side and the fight will be continued ferguson's living under decades of illegal occupation in an open-air prison the latest ceasefire is just that a brief pose until the next attacks you is the spokesman of the palestinian islamic jihad in beirut he says egypt has guaranteed two members of the group will be released as part of the peace deal israel denies that says the group is ready to resume bombing if the two aren't set free that agreement announces that have to be released today morning and uh is to be released in within two weeks now it's for the egypt it's for egypt to announce which one is right and which one uh is saying the truth and what the agreement really had uh in its uh points we have a very clear decision that without releasing khalid be continued now i think that it's in the egypt hands egypt has to say what was the agreement and how to deal with the situation this is not the first time that the israelis break the agreements we know that and we believe that bennett and lapid the government had to make victory at the polls at the expense of the palestinian people at the expense of the palestinian blood i spoke to lynn hastings who's the un humanitarian coordinator for the occupied palestinian territory she says a long-term solution is needed the entire situation is a tragedy our first concerns right now of course that the ceasefire must hold there were children who have been growing up in gaza and have endured the repercussions of five wars i just want to say that both israelis and palestinians need to be able to feel safe palestinians need to be able to exercise their rights to movement to education to be able to get access to health care and to be able to have jobs every time there's an escalation these goals are set back for both israelis and palestinians going back to the beginning of august here is not normal going back to 2021 which during which there was another escalation that's not normal either we really need to be looking for longer-term solutions here well even outside of the latest strikes how does the continuing israeli siege affect palestinian lives well i think a number of the pictures that you've already shown demonstrate that and some of the things that i've said uh demonstrate that just in terms of being able to exercise the rights that you and i and so many of us are able to enjoy all of the time they don't have freedom of movement they're unable to access economy they often are not able to access the their health care all of the things that most of us or many of us at least are able to take for granted at least 45 palestinians including 16 children have been killed how do you think that can be justified um well according to international law of course children should never be put in harm's way anybody who is engaged in any type of hostilities needs to ensure that the use of force is proportionate to the circumstances i also want to point out of course that the use of indiscriminate weapons especially if they're coming from well-populated residential areas and landing in well-populated residential areas are contrary to international law israeli forces have demolished palestinian homes during a raid in the occupied west bank bulldozers accompanied by israeli forces destroyed two houses in the village of umane near janine one belonged to the grandfather of a twenty-year-old palestinian who was accused of killing three israelis in early may is 17 kilometers northwest of the palestinian city of janine the village is home to around six and a half thousand people neither ibrahim sent this report from the demolition site in ramani this is what remains of the bihart family home after israeli forces raided the romani village and demolished the house it belongs to the family of a 20 year old palestinian who has been accused by israel of killing three israelis in an attack in may the grandfather of his bihar says this was his dream home he worked abroad for 30 years and it was his dream to come back here and build a three-story house but now him and 16 other members of his family are homeless the destruction of this building here only increased hatred and not fear me my children and grandchildren are not afraid they are sowing the seeds of hatred amongst the new generation i told the israeli commander all occupations will come to an end the house of 19 year old assad referee has been demolished as well both men were detained in israel after a three-day manhunt the families here say they had no idea of their son's intentions i'm joined here now by the uncle of assad i want to ask you can you rebuild this house we can't even remove the rubble before we get the approval of the israeli occupation we can't rebuild the house now eight family members have lost their home and have nowhere to go many here are telling us that they're following the news of the latest israeli escalation on the besieged gaza strip and they say even when a ceasefire has been reached the israeli occupation its violations and its measures are still ongoing
