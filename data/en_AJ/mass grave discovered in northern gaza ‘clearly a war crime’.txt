the decomposing bodies of dozens of Palestinians have been found dumped in a schoolyard in Northern Gaza Witnesses say the victims were blindfolded and tortured by Israeli forces before they were killed their bodies were then placed in plastic bags TK Abu aom reports from rafan a warning his report contains distressing images this man searching bags containing the bodies of Palestinians who had been missing they were taken away by Israeli forces and now some of their remains are being discovered near hammed School in Northern Gaza as buildo SE through the Dei scent of Decay fills the air dozens of bodies have been dumped here we were shocked to find a MTH grade inside the Schoo yard were shocked to find the dead bodies those are Palestinian civilians blindfolded and handcuffed at the back the dead bodies were kept inside black plastic bags Palestinian authorities are calling for an investigation in a statement the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and expatriate said it demands the formation of an international field investigation team into the massacres committed by the Israeli occupation and the conditions of the missing and detained from the Gaza Strip the discovery of this Mass grave reflects the magnitude of the tragedy faced by Palestinian civilians and serious violation of all International laws the discovery comes just the day after Israel returned 100 Palestinian bodies for burial in Rafa just like Northern Gaza the condition of these bodies Rangers from severely decomposed to M kilter remains making it heart to identify them but people still come to this site searching for cloa in this place of tragedy tabun Al jazer Rafa in southern Gaza Diana butu is a Palestinian human rights lawyer she's with us live from rala Diana what was your reaction to the discovery of these 30 bodies of Palestinians who were found handcuffed blindfolded and thrown in garbage at the school in Northern Gaza uh this is precisely why Israel was taken to the international court of justice with the accusation that it is committing genocide and the fact that we see that the icj ruled in favor of South AF Africa and said that there was a plausible risk of genocide is simply this this evidence just simply bolsters that opinion look Israel's been committing war crimes against Palestinians since 1948 and nobody has ever held Israel to account I certainly hope that this time the world is going to wake up and do something about it uh because this is this is clearly a war crime and clearly Israel should not be able to get away with it how incriminating is it that the Israeli soldiers left left these behind with evidence of handcuffs that had serial numbers and words in Hebrew written on them this is uh because they feel very emboldened and the reason that they feel emboldened is because because Israeli soldiers are rarely if ever charged with crimes uh and in particular war crimes especially when it comes to their actions in Gaza we've seen video after video since uh Israel's attack on the Gaza Strip began with of them bragging with the way that they are uh abusing and torturing Palestinians so this is yet another phase of them feeling as though they are emboldened to do whatever it is that they want to do they feel that they that they will be able to get get away with it and how how critical is it that uh Palestinians and international organizations document these kinds of atrocities and and if so how do they go about it in the middle of a war this is a very important question this is why the international court of justice in its decision on Friday indicated that this type of evidence needs to be preserved and of course the only way that this type of evidence can be preserved is if there is a ceasefire what Israel has done instead is it's tried to distract the world it's tried to come up with spous allegations against Ana and against other organizations as well and instead of people focusing on this genocide and focusing on these war crimes instead we see that everybody's turning their heads in a different direction that's why it's so vital for people to keep their eyes on demanding a ceasefire to keep their eye on demanding that Israel stop such that this evidence can be preserved Israel is not above the law and shouldn't be allowed to get away with war crimes and with genocide as it so far has been able to get away with right and if this if this information is documented and is able to be preserved how critical is it going to be How likely is it going to be that there is some some sort of prosecution of the army I mean are there any precedence uh that we can look at within Israel the pr utions are few and far between and and and completely and totally insufficient uh for example a few years ago there was an Israeli solder who was caught on tape uh as you it was recorded as he shot a emotionless Palestinian man who was lying down the street he shot him in the head and killed him and that uh Israeli soldier ended up going to prison for under a year in fact when he was released from prison he was hailed a soldier with everybody from the prime minister to the former Prime minister to others um declaring him a hero and having a hero's welcome for him so I don't have any faith that there will be any prosecutions inside Israeli um inside an Israel court that said I do believe that this opens the ground for opens the path for prosecutions internationally this isn't just a question of going to the ICC the international criminal court which is itself very political but it paves the way because of this icj ruling for countries around the world to to prosecute these soldiers and these individuals for the crimes that they have committed because genocide is not like ordinary crimes it is the worst of crimes in international law and this is precisely why the Israelis were fighting the icj ruling why they're trying to distract from the icj ruling and why they continue to to not implement the icj ruling okay I really appreciate your time and perspective Diana butu Palestinian human rights lawyer speaking to us there from romala my pleasure
