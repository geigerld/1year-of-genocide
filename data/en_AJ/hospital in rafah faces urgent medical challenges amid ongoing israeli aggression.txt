Dr. Salah Al-Jaabari, physician at Kuwait Hospital in Rafah, 7 days after this barbaric Israeli aggression against our people in the Gaza Strip, we are still serving our people and serving the sick and wounded in the Gaza Strip. We are still receiving thousands of cases daily. That is, of course, in this, these 71 days away from our people have affected us and Our psychology is that we have not seen our family for a long period of time. I miss them, of course, at every moment and every time, with every strike, a missile strike, and every bombing by the Israeli aircraft, whatever it may be. Our hearts are broken and we wait for the ambulance to see who is injured, who are our friends, who are our friends, who are neighbors, who are loved ones. I mean,  An indescribable feeling when the wounded, wounded, and body parts deal with various types of cases and injuries. Cases, that is, with phosphorus bombs. Cases of burns of different degrees. Cases, that is, we cannot provide them with everything required to save their lives due to the lack of capabilities and equipment. We even perform some quick and basic surgical operations without even anesthesia. The health condition is  We have a very difficult situation that cannot be described. We are suffering from a lack of fuel to operate medical supplies and equipment, and we are suffering from a lack of fuel to move even ambulances to transport the injured, to bring the injured and take them to larger hospitals. These are great challenges facing us here. We ask God to protect us, to protect all of our people, and to calm down.  We are a people who demand peace, but this war broke out on us so that we were helpless in the truce. We did not leave our places, we did not arrive, I did not reach my home. I mean, during the entire period of the truce, I was present in this hospital and did not reach our home.
