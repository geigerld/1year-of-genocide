so we're going to begin in Gaza where at least two Palestinians have been killed and several have been injured in Israeli air strikes near al- AXA Hospital in Dar albala initial reports suggest the attack was carried out on tents housing people forced from their homes as well as journalists in the courtyard of the medical facility the hospital's Courtyard has been directly targeted hospitals and Medical Teams and all Health sector workers must be protected the International Community must provide such protection the patients the wounded and displaced people are in a state of panic and horror fearing that the Israeli plans will attack the hospital again I went to say hello to my friends the journalists in one of the tents and suddenly something fell to the ground and exploded I felt extremely dizzy and after a while I looked up and found my colleagues lying everywhere on the ground I just want to thank Allah Almighty for not being seriously injured together with the others during the shelling Al jaz's H Kadri was near the AL AXA hospital when the attack happened she sent this report almost straight afterwards we're currently in a luxa hospital where the Israeli Air Forces targeted two of the TS with at least two air strikes this is an area where there are a lot of Palestinians seeking Refuge this is a makeshift office for journalists to work in inside the hospital where there are hundreds of thousands of Palestinian currently seeking Refuge there has been dozens of Palestinians injured there have been horrifying scenes where the Israeli air strikes damaged bodies of the Palestinians who were targeted here we still don't know how many Palestinians have been killed according to the eyewitnesses and the paramedics they're saying that the air strike severely damaged the bodies of the Palestinians that were sitting here they literally don't know how much Palestinians have been killed it's horrifying everyone is terrified seeking shelter in this hospital for more than six months right now nowhere is slave and Palestinians are targeted in hospitals in schools in makeshift tents Palestinians do not know where to go this is alaz ala Hospital is the executive director of the international press Institute he's joining us live now from Vienna um good to have you with us uh tell me your reaction first of all to these latest strikes I I'm absolutely horrified that again journalists are being uh injured and possibly killed while working while reporting it is absolutely difficult if not impossible to believe that the Israeli forces had no idea that this was a a place where journalists were functioning and working and this is adding to a toll uh of journalists dead in this conflict Which is higher than any other conflict that we have recorded in history this is absolutely horrific um I'm just reading here there's a statement that's come out from israeli's military uh from the Reuters News agencies quoting the Israeli military saying that on Sunday it carried out an air strike against a command center operated by the armed Islamic Jihad group in the courtyard of Alexa Hospital in the Gaza Strip it said the Alexa Hospital building was not damaged its functioning wasn't affected it was uh the they were struck precisely intended on minimizing harm to uninvolved civilians there are of course protections given to journalists as whe as well as medical staff when it comes to conflict areas like this but this clearly doesn't seem to have applied in this case I mean journalists are civilians under all International rules under the rules of War under the Geneva Convention journalists are civilians and they have to be treated as such and they have to be protected even in times of wars and uh conflict and it's very difficult to believe that there was no understanding or knowledge that this what that these at least one of the tents in the nearby area was being used by journalist as a working area I mean I don't know where else can people uh be safe in this moment we've seen of course this kind of situation before we've had so many cases particularly in this region where journal ists have been targeted as an organization what kind of advice or protection can you give to your members when they're going into a conflict area like this I think this is a conflict like no other we have ever seen um normally you would tell journalists um and I'm sure you have also done this kind of training uh in terms of working in Conflict zones in war zones where you put on protective equipment where you try to stay safe where you try to say in areas where there is no fighting where you are you know clearly displayed in journalist and what we have seen is that even when journalists clearly display uh the Press symbol on their helmets on their flag jackets they're still killed even targeted there is clear evidence on a number of cases which have been researched very clearly that journalists have been targeted even though they have been displaying the uh press signs so it's almost impossible what to say to journalist they cannot leave um I've been working uh with some of the other organizations on how we can allow journalist how we can find ways to journalists to even leave this area and what we are finding is that people have to pay a ransom in order to leave um the Gaza Strip This is just one of the most horrific situations that we have come across um it is of course the case in many conflicts that particularly Al jazer has covered over the years that journalists are caught up in the fighting and are killed as a result of fighting which is going on in the area which they're reporting are you noticing a change towards the actual targeting of journalists um my organization has not done the research but what we have seen is that uh other organizations such as Amnesty International uh such as reporters Without Borders have analyzed a number of cases uh where journalists were targeted there was a very well-known case of journalists in southern Lebanon in October where it was clear and the evidence shows that journalists were clearly visible uh the cars were clearly marked as press they were wearing the Press inia uh the Drone was circling around them for a certain amount of time clearly seeing who they were before they were being attacked there is also other cases of journalist in Gaza I mean we cannot investigate every single case because actually journalists are not allowed to enter the Gaza Strip as well so we are relying on the reporting of the journalist on the ground but what we are seeing is there are number of cases where it has been shown that journalists were targeted who were clearly displaying the signia as journalists who were clearly working as journalists who were not combatants who did not have weapons who were not threatening but they were still killed as journalists and this is something that we have seen in this conflict a number of times but it's also recently in more and more conflicts we're seeing that journalists are being targeted as journalists for doing their work so this is the safety of journalists is one of the most horrific situations that we have seen I think in a very long time Fran morich is executive director of the international press Institute uh thank you very much indeed for being with us let's go to TK abom in Rafa TK I understand you've got an update on what's been happening for us yes that that's right as within the past few hours the Israeli military has targeted the one of the tents that belongs to jist inside Al AA Hospital in darel balah where at least two Palestinians have been reported killed while uh at least 10 others being wounded till now and those who have been wounded are now receiving a treatment inside alaa hospital as medical sources describing their medical condition to be uh critical and now they have been receiving much needed uh medical treatment there and it's not the only time that hospitals have been bombarded and attacked on all areas where the Israeli forces previously had operated had destroyed and damaged the majority of hospitals and make it comes out of uh service and right now they are attacking hospitals that is considered to be one of the largest hospitals that providing medical treatment for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the middle areas where there had been clear damage being inflicted to the area of the bming right now as the attack has been widely condemned by the gaza's government media office describing the situation there to be really dangerous escalation as it has calling the International Community to uh perer its responsibility and to force Israel to scale back its military uh campaign uh across the Gaza Strip and that's absolutely terrifying as journalists another time being attacked with no kind of protection for those uh class of the Palestinian Community who are tirelessly in order to deliver all the latest updates on the ground here and mainly right now they have been widely again targeted as since the beginning of the conflict more than 130 Palestinians uh journalists being killed so far T thank you very much indeed t a zoom talking to us from Rafa
