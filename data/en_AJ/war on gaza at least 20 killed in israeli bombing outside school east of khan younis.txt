let's bring you some breaking news coming in there's been an Israeli attack on a school housing displaced Palestinians it's happened in the town of abasan East of Khan Yunis in southern Gaza at least 20 Palestinians have been killed 64 in total across the strip in the past day let's get more now with hindel she joins us on the line from d balah in central Gaza so what are you hearing about this strike near a school in Khan Samy so it's another Israeli air strike and it targeted an entrance a gate of a school in funes in abasan and let me remind you that the Israeli forces called people in draah when the ground Invasion happened started there they asked them to move to kanun and most of these people evacuated to shelters like Q shelters and schools so especially before uh night hours Palestinians in shelters in un schools start getting uh moving around finishing all their stuff for the day because they do not move during the dark so it's very obvious that this number of casuality is going to rise because it's an entrance it's where everyone is moving around children are playing around and Sammy this is the fourth attack on a school in the past couple of days this is happening every single day now and no one is is is sure why the Israeli forces are now targeting all of directly targeting schools and un shelters they're justifying that every time they target a school that there's a Hamas base and that Hamas Fighters are in there but we see that most of those who are injured or killed are Palestinian children and are a Palestinian women Palestinians now are terrified everyone that is Sheltering in a school are trying to evacuate in a different area but Palestinians are left helpless because they do not know where to go and nowhere nowhere is safe Sammy what kind of posture are civilians taking there now as you said they they went into schools in Khan unun and in abasan because they were told to go into these areas are they do they have any clue basically what to do next to stay there to go from there where to go I me I feel like is horrified everyone is terrified the Israeli forces have been trying to squeeze all of the Palestinians in the middle area inun but as you see earlier today there was a Target on abu's family and 17 Palestinians were also killed 14 of these Palestinians killed are children and women and now schools have been a Target but Palestinians do not have any place to go even agriculture lands empty lands they're all packed with makeshift camps now and there's no uh space for people like even to bring your tent and to set it up in a place you do not have space other than the fact that there is sewage everywhere there's garbage everywhere so that's why Palestinian chose to stay in those tents now I'm I'm sure families are in panic they're trying to evacuate schools but there are also left homeless because there's no place Samy Palestinians do not know where to go and everywhere is a Target in the go strip so far hind as you're talking we're showing what we can of the latest pictures the there's plenty of pictures coming in that we simply can't show they're very Grizzly and they show a lot of well frankly remnants of children perhaps you can give us an update on the aftermath and the casualty count I mean the latest word is I think 20 but the pictures suggest that the the final count and picture is going to be much more Grizzly than that Samy and not only that we're talking about the medical facilities there are running out of medications like even if the doctors have the opportunity to save the life of children or of or of Palestinian civilians they do not have the medications to do that so that's why most of the people who spend hours in ICU end up dead because there has been no uh Medical Treatments there have been no uh like all the medical supplies that have been supposed to enter Gaza have not been entering since the beginning of the ra incursion also a Ned hospital has been alarming that they're very low on fuel they're very low on medical in the past couple of weeks so all of this is overwhelming and more people are still coming uh to the hospital being transferred but also let me remind you this is an entrance of a school an entrance of a shelter where where thousands of tal are Sheltering so it's a very busy place and let me also tell you that it's not the first busy area that was targeted today earlier today the market in in ban middle area was also targeted and at least have been killed so this is happening on hourly basis and casualties are expected to rise cing all right hind there updating us on the breaking news a strike at the entrance of a school where Palestinians have been taking Refuge we know there's a number of casualties and extremely Grizzly pictures some of which we we can't show you um indicating that there are a lot of people including children body parts of children uh hin thanks for updating us on that make sure to subscribe
