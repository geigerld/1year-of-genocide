we start in Northern Gaza where Israeli shelling and snipers have wounded several Palestinians as they waited for Aid doctors at a shifer hospital are treating the injured on the floor Israeli troops targeted crowds waiting for Aid to enter nauli roundabout in Gaza City civil defense Crews have recovered the bodies of Palestinians killed in the latest Israeli air strikes in Gaza City at least 10 people were killed in the attacks on several areas the city on Sunday wounded children and others were pulled from the rubble of their destroyed homes in the aabra neighborhood meanwhile the Royal Jordanian Air Forces carried out an A Drop operation in Gaza delivering much needed humanitarian Aid hundreds of displaced people gathered where the aid was dropped much of it fell along the coast Palestinians had to wait out into the sea to obtain the packages abum is live for us in RA in southern Gaza let's start with the latest strikes from the air sniping from the ground it's a day of very gruesome images emerging from Gaza take us through them yes Sammy another bloody day that took place again as the Israeli forces are even waging more military attacks across Gaza stban in the past hour we have been recording more military attacks on the of kanun were at least five Palestinians there have reported killed as a part of the ongoing bombardment of the city uh civil defense as well managed to recover five dead bodies that were killed previously in a previous Israeli bombardment for the city and being transported to the European hospital later for burial and we have been also hearing more loud confrontations and fire Exchange in the western southern part of the city of kanun as a part of the ongoing battles raging in the city there between the Israeli military troops and the Israeli fighter as well we also have been seeing thatat refugee camp had been widely attacked as well where a residential building was reduced to the rle but what is also had been reportedly happened Samy within the past few days is the ongoing shooting of people who were waiting for humanitarian supplies today the another part of Gaza and for the third day in a row Palestinians have been reported killed and injured after being exposed to the Israeli fires as they are trying to search for something that will help them to survive in the Norther and desperate part of the city and tell us what you know about this a drop by the Jordanian Air [Music] Force yes Samy just a few hours ago I've been seeing in this R and parts of Gaza and a Jordanian uh military plane dropping different and parachuting uh different uh humanitarian AIDS and it's not yet clear if they are being delivered to the people or to the Jordanian field hospital that had been established within the war inside Gaza but we have been seeing crowds of people being gathered in the coastal line of the southern part of Gaza waiting for such drops to get and to land here in Rafa or even in the coastal line in fact the vast majority of such drops have been landed in the sea in the middle of the sea where people cannot really manage to obtain it and this is absolutely terrifying as people are in a very desperate need for humanitarian supplies in light of the very limited number of humanitarian trucks being allowed to get into Gaza throughout the last two remaining uh spots of a deliveries all right stay with us for a moment th we're going to come back to you but I want to pick up on a line that's been breaking today and that's his Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisting that a ground invasion in Rafa will happen now he says only a potential seat that a potential ceasefire will only delay that Israel's Army presented its operational plan to the war cabinet on Sunday ahead of the planned offensive at least 1 and a half million Palestinians are Sheltering in Rafa that's more than half the strip's population let's go to H because she joins us now from occupied East Jerusalem so looking at this plan is it clear hamda what happens to the people if they go in and invade Rafa in the South where a lot of Palestinians have been cramming into that southern corner there's still a lot of unknowns when it comes to Benjamin Netanyahu and his Army's plans for how exactly they're going to evacuate more than a million and a half Palestinians who are seeking refuge in Rafa gaza's Southernmost city what was supposed to be known as the last safe place for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip now the Israeli Prime Minister says this plan is twofold the first involves this evacuation and the second involves the military operation as to how they're going to go in and defeat what he says are the remaining Hamas battalions in Rafa but despite all of the international criticism despite all of the condemnation about going into Raa the Israelis remain persistent on wanting to go in on the ground Israeli officials speaking anonymously to Israeli media have said that perhaps one of the ideas that's being floated is moving the Palestinians to KH Yunis but this is an area where a ground invasion is already commencing where there is Relentless bombardment and in Rafa there is Relentless bombardment air strikes and shelling that is already happening so it's not really known exactly where they're going to go and how but the Israeli Prime Minister says they want to move civilians quote out of inter you we got to J in and go back to we understand something has just happened some kind of strike or something where you are take us through what's happening there now yes Sammy in fact as we've been waiting for you to return back to me just to keep reporting about the latest update on the ground a sudden loud exploding being heard just a few meters away from Al Kuwaiti Hospital from our location right now it was a loud explosion that took place after a very intensive military movement for the Israeli surveillance and F drones on the vicinity of the Kuwaiti Hospital a loud explosion a loud fire had been heard inside this area we've been hearing the sound of the missile as it was hiding to the Target where everyone as you can see right now at the backy ground has started to rush to see what is happening because uh there is a a very big gloud explosion that is followed with more smokes Rising as you can see right now on the horizon of the backy ground we are trying to check uh to to see what will happen next specifically that the majority of ambulances of Al kuti Hospital rushed to the location of the targeting now the attack in fact happens in are right now we need to let you go to take with evacuees uh we are trying to be safe as you right now can see there is no any safe place in Gaza bombardment is in everywhere even in an area that supposed to be as a safe Zone we are wearing our helmet our vest right now people here were having a kind of a very active movement here in the streets because it's a it's a rush hour they are trying to take what everything that they are in a very desperate need for before they just return back to the evacuation centers that they are Sheltering in so the attack had been very loud as you can right now hear the ambulances are trying to bring if there's any casualties or victims had been resulted from the Israeli military attack and on the point which ham was talking about as you gather perhaps some more information of what's happening around you taric the threats of a ground Invasion that will that Israel will begin in Rafa what about the population there have they been informed anything about what's going to happen to them any evacuation plan where they'll go and so on well Sammy what you can see right now is a very tiny uh scenario of what might be expected more if there's going to be a military incursion a military incursion for Palestinians in the South means that there is going to be unrelenting intense of Israeli bombardment for residential neighborhoods as what we have been hearing within the past few moments and it means that there's going to be more Bloodshed among civilians and an incredible raise increase of casualties among civilians and what Palestinians are also are terrifying is the collapse laap of negotiations being made by qatan and Egypt between Hamas and Israel in terms to reach for a a ceasefire that might bring an end for the hostility and release of Israeli captives as well from inside Gaza but also Palestinians started to practically prepare for the day next like some families had evacuated to the uh Central areas of Gaza which had been also under intense Israeli bombardment others refuse to leave because simply they are saying we have nowhere else to go our house in the North being destroyed and we if we're going to return back to the north we will only live on the dees of our destroyed buildings all right thanks so much T our Zoom there
