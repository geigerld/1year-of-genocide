Israeli media is reporting that negotiations for a ceasefire deal with Hamas have stalled with the Israeli government deciding against sending a delegation to the latest talks in Cairo there had been hopes a deal could be in place by Ramadan after the White House said there was a framework agreement on the table for a six week ceasefire Al jaz's ham salute has more now from occupied East Jerusalem negotiations around ceasefire talks have stalled Israeli officials speaking anonymously to Israeli media have said that Israel decided against sending a delegation to Cairo and that's because Hamas did not release a list of names of all of the captives who are still alive this is something that came at the request of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who said that he needed this in order to move forward with these talks however Hamas has said that they're not willing to give up that kind of information until there is a finalized deal in place but what the term finalized deal means is quite elusive at this point Hamas however has said that their position Remains the Same and they wanted to reiterate that that they are looking for a permanent ceasefire an end to the war whereas the Israelis have said even if there is a six week pause in the fighting they are going to continue on with their military activities just on Sunday Israel's defense minister yoav Galant has said that under no circumstances will the war end until there is a total defeat of Hamas mediators are trying to bridge these gaps and Bridge sticking points to see what kind of concessions can be made by both sides in order to achieve a deal but Netanyahu himself has said that even though there are discussions around a ceasefire it doesn't mean we are anywhere closer to getting a deal ham Al jazer occupied East Jerusalem well Hamas meanwhile has clarified what it hopes to achieve from a pause in fighting before Ramadan although hopes of that happening have dimmed in recent days a Hamas spokesperson said a top priority is allowing more humanitarian Aid into the strip Hamas also wants Palestinians to be able to return to the northern part of Gaza and finally Hamas wants a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza well US vice president KLA Harris says Palestinians in Gaza are suffering a humanitarian catastrophe she's called for an immediate ceasefire to secure the flow of Aid and the release of the captives and given the immense scale of suffering in in Gaza there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks which is what is currently on the table this will get the hostages out and get a significant amount of Aid in this would allow us to build something more enduring so let's bring in Ramy kuri he's a distinguished public policy fellow at the the American University of Beirut and joins us live now from Boston Ramy always good to have you with us so look Israeli media reporting that Israel won't be sending this delegation to Cairo is this just a negotiating tactic or does this now dash all hopes of a ceasefire deal before Ramadan say that it's dashed all hope before Ramadan Ramadan is a March 10th so there's another full week um but this is a kind of hard ball as they call it in the United States really tough negotiation and but the thing is Netanyahu is negotiating with Hamas he's also negotiating with the United States and he's also negotiating with his Partners in the uh uh temporary government the war government and one of whom Benny Gant is in Washington having talks with American officials and Netanyahu did not want him to go but he went so uh there's a this is a you know six-dimensional negotiation not just Israel and Hamas but you have to really see the core issue as Israel wants some bottom line gains they want the hostages uh released and they want to be sure that no never again will they be attacked uh from Gaza and the uh and Hamas and the Palestinian people and government uh also want all their prisoners released and the guarantee that never again will Israel place them under siege so these are many many issues that come together yeah Ramy I mean given the terrible death and destruction we see every day in Gaza it does beg the question though then what is Israel's priority in this war is it to punish and kill the civilians in Gaza or is it to get the captives out most people think that their ultimate objective is to drive the Palestinians out of Palestine not just Gaza but also the West Bank um and and J East Jerusalem and they're doing it in many ways destroying houses refusing permits scaring people out uh choking the economy they've been doing this for 50 60 years uh that's the ultimate uh goal they want all of Palestine to be under total and um only Israeli Jewish rule that's what the Zionist project is all about and and they're pushing in that direction now much more openly than they ever did before they also used to do it surreptitiously but in the short term uh what they want is they want the hostages out and they want their uh Gaza Israel border not to be a place uh that is threatening to Israeli civilians Ramy uh the the sticking point then appears to be that Hamas won't provide this list of the living captives it insists on an end to the war while Israel on the other hand says even if there is a six- we pause the war will continue afterwards so where will the concessions come from Ramy well again you have many different issues uh the number of will they give them list the first uh uh ceasefire they didn't give a list they just said there'll be so many people released woman children they but they didn't give a list of names uh so list is a new demand and it's not apparently a government demand it's netanyahu's own uh demand that he made at the last minute there's issue of how many Palestinian prisoners in Israel will be released for each hostage there's a question of will this be a a ceasefire for six weeks and then the war will the bombing of the genocidal bombing of Gaza will continue I mean Hamas has no interest in a brief pause and then they're re subjected to this incredible assault um on them and killing civilians who lining up to get humanitarian Aid I mean the barbarity that is coming out of the state never ends uh Ramy just a final thought to you I mean it was just yesterday that the White House was quite optimistic that this framework deal was on the table now we have the vice president kamla Harris calling for an immediate ceasefire but the us though Ramy seems powerless in this war and Washington is becoming even more isolated in its support for Israel yes the US is getting hurt as a nation as a country in the world uh it is showing itself to be as it seems to have been for the last 40 50 years pretty much doing whatever Israel wants it to do with very very rare exceptions third of all you've got now a historic new development which is the Palestine issue is a domestic political electoral issue and what happened in Michigan last week and what might happen next Tuesday on super Tuesday is a big shock to the big scary shock to the Democratic party that they might lose these swing States and because a bunch of people not just Arab Americans or Muslim Americans but African-Americans Hispanic Americans students Progressive Jews labor unions a whole Coalition that had always been the core of the democratic party is now saying we're not going to vote for you Biden unless you do this immediate ceasefire so you've got that new element uh as well it's a very multi-dimensional Dynamic and nobody has a single hold on on the whole thing Ramy Curry always good to get your thoughts and your analysis Ramy thank you very much indeed for talking to us thank you
