we can now speak to ARA Damon who's the founder of inara that's a nonprofit organization that focuses on on helping children who need life saving or life altering medical treatment in war Tor Nations she's joining us from Istanbul thanks for your time with us on Al jazer so you know November 20th is World children's day and it comes this year amid Israel's war on Gaza the statistics are that one out of every 200 children in Gaza has been killed by Israeli attacks in the past six weeks why are we see such a high number of children being killed and wounded in this war do you think well a part of it is just because of the sheer density of the population that exists there and it is a very very young population that is also very well known and part of it is because well despite the fact that this convention is meant to be protecting children's rights we're seeing them being violated on a daily basis and not just on a daily basis but frequently uh every single time per day because children are not being protected because children are being denied the right to Food Water Sanitation and health care you know that that clip that you aired there earlier with that little boy talking about what he wanted to do I think that's what makes it so difficult for those of us who are involved in these organizations that are specifically focusing uh on trying to get treatment to children because we do know that while of course we don't have the capacity to change what has happened to these children we do have the cap capacity and the expertise to allow them to restore and regain hope the big problem right now of course is that we are unable to access razza we're unable to access those children who need the services that we can provide yeah so as you're saying there are of course the short-term needs of children as well as their families can you just elaborate on how big those needs are right now and what can be done to meet them well I mean first of all when it comes to the needs this is unprecedented look I'm I'm also a journalist I've been in war zones for the last 20 years I have never seen anything like this of this scale of this magnitude and neither has pretty much anyone else who works either within the journalism or the humanitarian space we had for six weeks one of our founding board members Dr Hassan abua on the ground in Gazza during all of this and he has come across thousands of injured children and when we say an injured child we're not just talking a simple injury we're talking very complex uh injuries that happen in this kind of of landscape we're talking about children who have uh Burns multiple fractures who have dust and and debris caused by blast that is just embedded into their flesh who are not being able to get these wounds properly uh cleaned out and then you have the children who are receiving medical treatment as well as it can be provided on the ground who are going to need multiple surgeries over the course of years and this is what people need to realize is that when the dust finally does settle at some point in time because it will that is when the real work is going to begin in terms of trying to restore these children's ability to not just function uh but also their ability to regain agency over their own life and by that I mean is that's just it for forgive me but I wanted to ask you about in fact about the long-term impact of this war on children on sort of the mental and psychological impact that it has on them look we we've seen this in in other War zones in the past we've seen what happens when a child does not receive a medical treatment and that child is effectively relegated to a life in the shadows the same goes for a child who does not receive the kind of mental health support that they need to be able to process this in inexplicable trauma these kinds of injuries the injuries that emerge from this kind of a battle Zone when we're talking about the medical side of it we're often talking about very complicated injuries we're talking about treatment that needs to last and be planned for over the course of years these are not kids that we're going to be able to put in for a one-off surgery they're going to need multiple surgeries and as they grow they're going to need additional surgeries as well the mental health impact of all of this is is something that is perhaps to a certain degree not not focused on uh sufficiently enough because those scars are quite potentially even more difficult to overcome than the medical ones because what is happening to these children is just so irrational so severe that if it is not properly addressed if that trauma the fear the pain if a child is not given an Avenue to be able to process that it calcifies inside them and it hinders them it prevents them from actually being able to see a life beyond the trauma it hinders their ability to as I was saying regain agency over their own life and realize that they can and should and deserve to have something more than what their past and their present is currently being defined by and this also is not something that can be resolved with you know one activity or one session this is years and years of work and so what is needed right now is for everyone to recognize that we all need to be ready to make years long investment in the children of Gaza and and just to look at this sort of The Wider context for a moment because I know that you wrote a piece uh and you said in it that you covered the battle against Isis in mosul and gaza's challenges will make it look like Child's Play what do you mean by that and what are the major differences that here there's quite a b bit of of differences because mul is not Gaza and and Isis is not Hamas to a certain degree what we're seeing right now in Gazza has by far eclipsed anything that we've seen in mosul look mul's death toll at the end of it and Isis was literally holding families hostage at gunpoint in buildings as the US Le Coalition and the Iraqis were dropping bombs on top of them that death toll was around 9 to 11,000 and that is a battle that lasted for 18 months Gaza has surpassed that and we're in week six another big difference also between both of those battlefields is The Siege mul was not besieged ever in the way that Gazza has been besieged when civilians were able to get out of the battle space they were able to access humanitarian assistance and at no point in time were things like Electric electricity water food cut off from them entirely what we have in Gazza right now is war being waged on multiple fronts you have the war that's being waged in the complete and total Siege of Gaza you have the war that's being waged and the Very deliberate attempt to prevent humanitarian aid from Crossing to people in need that is causing vast amounts of unnecessary suffering uh and death and then you have one very big reality and that at no point in time can someone in Gazza actually escape the Battle Zone and that completely changes the dynamic when it comes to how the military chooses to move forward and chooses to carry out its actual Ground Battle right and I believe very strongly that there is big mistake and trying to attempt to simplify the situation by comparing Gaza and mul to each other and without access to Gaza uh for organizations like yours as well as other humanitarian organizations how concerning and worrying is that it's absolutely terrifying because you don't know what to plan for and so what you end up doing and this isn't just us this is everybody who is trying to respond to Gazza you end up trying to set up plans for option A B C D there are trucks and trucks and trucks of humanitarian Aid waiting the aid is there this is not an issue of trying to get everybody together to try to get the aid in place the aid is in place it just can't get across the border there are field hospitals that are ready to be set up but there is no decision on where those field hospitals can actually be set up there's structures and systems that we're all busy trying to build up in terms of how do we get an injured child out of Gazza into a medical facility that can actually treat them only we can't access that child and we don't know at what stage we are actually going to be able to access this child so you end up trying to plan for multiple scenarios or for a combination of what one of those scenarios might actually be and I have to say it is absolutely gutting because I have spoken to and and seen videos of multiple children who have gone through horrific injuries who whose legs have been amputated and they're asking their parents how am I going to do all of these things how am I going to go to school how am I going to spend time with with my friends how am I even going to go to the bathroom on on my own and I know that at inata we have the capacity to be able to help them and say actually you are going to be able to do all of these things it's not going to be the same as it was before but we can give you the capacity to do all of this only we can't say that to this child or the parent right now because we don't even know when we're going to be able to get in and if at that point in time that we are able to get in if that child still going to be alive all right uh we'll have to leave it there AR Damon thank you so much for speaking to us from Istanbul
