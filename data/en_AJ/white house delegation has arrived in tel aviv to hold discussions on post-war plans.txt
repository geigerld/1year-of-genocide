I want to go to Tel Aviv now we've been reporting that there's been another barrage of rockets fired at Tel Aviv from Gaza alzer's Imran Khan is there alive so Imran clearly Hamas has not lost completely its ability to fire Rockets what can you tell us well I can tell you that Sirens have been going on off in the southern communities just outside of the Gaza Strip uh throughout the morning about 2 hours ago we heard a very large explosion in the background we're hearing that at least one rocket was fired over borian International Airport just outside of Tel Aviv that was intercepted by the Iron Dome defense system this is a real message from uh Hamas that on day 59 of this war they can still reach as far as Tel Aviv in the last 48 hours we even saw Rockets uh reach a suburb west of Jerusalem as well so clearly Hamas have this capability now the Israelis are saying uh that they have control of the north and Central parts of Gaza but we are hearing that rockets at least one rocket was fired from the the north of Gaza which goes to show you that they may not have the control that they keep telling us that they have Imran if we can pivot to the latest diplomatic move and I'm going to ask you the same question that I will then ask kimbery hit our White House correspondent in Washington DC and it's about this American delegation that has arrived in Israel today this is the delegation of the vice president and her National Security adviser they're in Israel today on your end what is the reporting on what they're and H on on what what they're trying to do is one but also more importantly on your end how Israel is likely to receive their message well the trip is very clear um the National Security advisor um for Cala Harris uh is here to discuss the the day after what the Americans want to do is put pressure on the Israelis to start thinking about how they conduct this war for what happens when the shooting War finishes now kimy hit uh my colleague will get into the specifics of that at the time but how is this likely to be received in Israel well they'll take it with a pinch of salt um Israel knows that America is its only true friend in the world it's the one country it can rely on to back it up it gets uh 3.5 billion a year in military assistance from the us alone since October 7th that's actually gone up the Americans are supplying them with 57,000 artillery shells and 15,000 bombs including 2,000 bunker Buster bombs those are the kind of things we saw used in Afghanistan and Iraq uh against military bases so there is a complete support militarily uh for what um these Israelis are doing certainly when it comes to the type of weapons but politically speaking um the Americans want the Israelis to change but the Israelis have always maintained they are going to conduct this war in the way that they see fit Imran Khan reporting from Tel Aviv thank you very much let me take that conversation over to uh Kimberly hit our White House correspondent you're obviously standing by in Washington DC on your end of this delegation this is the VP sending her National Security advisor after after she had some pretty strong words uh you know addressed to Israel uh what do you think the Americans are trying to achieve here couple of things uh first of all as Imran said they're trying to figure out who's going to govern post-war Gaza and uh what we know is that they're trying to have a conversation with the Israelis about a revitalized Palestinian Authority and that is something that the Israelis have already indicated they're very lukewarm to and so the United States is also exploring an option of perhaps what an international governing body might look like so this is the start of what is expected to be some very lengthy conversations and as uh Imron mentioned it will be vice president kamla Harris's National Security team led by Phil Gordon uh he was with her over the weekend as she met with Arab leaders and now this convers ation is continuing with the Israeli counterparts now uh as part of this conversation very quickly serel it have five components and I call it the five NOS uh the United States says that essentially what they're hoping postwar Gaza will look like will be uh five principles no forc displacement for Palestinians no reoccupation no blockade no reduction of territory and no use of Gaza as a platform for what the United States calls terrorism so they do have uh kind of a formulation of what they want it to look like but of course uh the Israelis have said that they have their own ideas and trying to get those to meld is the challenge absolutely kimbery Hut reporting from Washington DC thank you very much for that Kimberly
