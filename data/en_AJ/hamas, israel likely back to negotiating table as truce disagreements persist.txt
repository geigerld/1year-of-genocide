the US Secretary of State has arrived in Tel Aviv where he's expected to discuss the terms of a potential deal between Israel and Hamas to end the war on Gaza Anthony blinkin says that he wants to broker an extended pause to the war in Gaza he's on his latest visit to the Middle East where he's been meeting with leaders across the region blinkin has also held talks in qatar's capital Doha and the katari foreign minister says that he's optimistic that an agreement is Within Reach hash better reports it's been a week that Hamas received a proposal Qatar the key medior hopes could lead to a new deal that may end the war in Gaza free Israeli captives and allow more Aid into the strip qatar's prime minister Minister of Foreign Affairs is confident an agreement is Within Reach we have received a reply from Hamas on the general framework of the agreement regarding the C captives the reply includes some comments but in general it is positive however given the sensitivity of the issue we will not go into details we are optimistic and we have delivered the response to the Israeli party nice to see you US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin remains cautious he will have to convince the Israelis to accept hamas's terms but the Us official refrained from talking about a ceasefire referring instead to a pause we're also determined to use any pause to continue to pave a diplomatic path forward to a just and Lasting peace and security for the region that is the best way the best way to ensure that October 7th and the tragic loss of life by Israelis and Palestinians is not repeated Hamas which controls Gaza says it has responded positively to the negotiators Qatar and Egypt but insists the deal must result in a permanent ceas fire the proposal for a possible agreement was presented to the leader of hamas's political Bureau is in Doha but it's the group's leader in Gaza Yahya Sina along with alasan brigade's Commander Muhammad daif who have the ultimate say over any possible deal by pushing for an agreement on Gaza the US officials are keeping their eyes on the broader goal convincing Saudi Arabia the most powerful country in the region to establish ties with Israel the Crown Prince reiterated Saudi Arabia's strong interest in pursuing that uh but he also made clear what uh he had said uh to me before uh which is that in order to do that uh two things are required uh um an end to the conflict in Gaza and a clear credible time-bound path to the establishment of a Palestinian state but many remain skeptical they accuse the US of siding with Israel Iran and its allies warn if the war in Gaza continues the Middle East risks being mared by instability Hashim jazer all right let's uh bring in Rory Chalin joining us from occupied East Jerusalem to tell us what the next few hours will look like for Secretary of State Anthony blinkin well he's got a lot of diplomacy ahead of him first of all he's going to be meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu then he's going to be meeting with the Israeli military Chief of Staff hery halevi then he's going to be meeting with the defense minister yav Galant uh and after that uh he's going to be meeting with the president isak Herzog following that he's then going to rala to the occupied West Bank and he's going to meet be meeting with the Palestinian president Mahmud abas so a lot on his plate what he will be discussing uh along the way is the Paris agreement this deal uh and more specifically what hamas's response uh to that deal has been and he'll be trying to get a a read from the Israelis about whether this is is acceptable in any way to them now we know that this Hamas response has been passed through the ceries to the is uh intelligence agency Mossad uh and that it's being studied by the negotiators what we don't know is what is in that response the Israelis know it the kataris know it the Americans know it we don't but we have and I'll reiterate what hashen was saying in his report there what we do know is hamas's main demand essentially is that any ceasefire agreement ultimately will result in the end of the war and the end of Israel's uh Siege of of Gaza now the ceries are optimistic that this deal is you know something that that can be worked with the Americans slightly less so uh if you hear blinken he's saying that a deal is necessary and possible Biden is saying that he thinks that hamas's response is slightly over the top and if you look at the Israelis and what the Israelis are saying well they are significantly more negative than that uh and they think that this deal at the moment is a non-starter why is that Rory talk to us a little bit more about the Israeli response to any potential deal well basically because you have this huge Gulf between the Hamas position and the Israel position the Hamas position is that the war will end with the culmination of the SE fires and the exchange deals and the Israeli side of things is to say no way like the war for Netanyahu goes on until Israel has achieved its War goals and let's remind ourselves of what those War goals were the eradication of Hamas as a military threat to Israel basically to kick is Hamas out of Gaza uh or uh to degrade them so much so that they cannot ever result in a threat ever again so you know you can see that there is huge Gulf a huge gap between those two positions and Netanyahu and his government his coalition government are pretty unified on that the Israeli military is pretty unified on this so politically and militarily in Israel you have although there are many differences about many many different things you certainly do have agreement that the war will not finish with these these ceasefires so so that's where we are and that's where the Americans are going to try and bring two sides together uh and get them to some kind of uh agreement that that they think is going to reorder the Middle East uh and give say the Saudi Israeli normalization deal a chance of getting back on track again as we heard in hash's package there his report the Saudis are saying well this is contingent on a two-state solution it's contingent on a Palestinian State and again that something that Benjamin Netanyahu for most of his political career has been actively trying to prevent happening all right thank you Rory challeng reporting from occupied East Jerusalem we'll now cross over to West Jerusalem and speak to manim Klein who's a professor of political science at barlan University Welcome T jaer thanks for your time so as blinkin now has arrived in Tel Aviv what will you be looking out for as he takes up uh this issue of a potential deal uh with uh with the Israelis good morning uh it it depends on how far assertive blinkin will be and which kind of stick he will use on Netanyahu definitely there is a huge gap between Biden Administration and the Israeli government Netanyahu is unwilling to end the war and is unwilling is far far from being on the same page with Biden Administration regarding the establishment of a Palestinian State and the also there are thoughts in the Israeli Administration to expand the war north wise against healah sometime in the spring so all these issues are combined all together right and Netanyahu yes yeah so look I mean you said it depends which stick blinkin is willing to use is he willing to use any sort of Leverage at this point or I mean talk us through the options on the table for the US Administration on how to deal with Netanyahu and his coalition government today as it as the war stands today regarding uh the war on Gaza the Biden Administration can express publicly not through Thomas fredman its its stance and blame netan for sabotaging and the uh the American effort to help Israel he can make it uh at the moment he choose to send messages through Thomas fredman in the New York in the New York Times uh Biden is Biden interest is not to lose the elections against Trump at the moment he it seems that he's about to lose so the his uh his interest is to actually to use the stick and to beat netan netan interest is to play on time and to mislead bid then to promise something and then regret to go for a partial deal and wait for Trump win the elections netan does not want to dissolve the government netan does not want to make a deal a prisoners exchange that will force the radical right-wing parties to leave the Coalition and then impose on netan early elections in which it seems from public opinion polls that is going to lose right so what you're saying is Netanyahu it's very possible that Netanyahu stalls for simply for his own political survival definitely and and it seems that the American Administration prefers to see somebody else in prime minister office in Jerusalem what are you basing that on but it it seems to me that this is the this is the American preference through the messages coming out from the White House through Thomas fredman and the talk of the White House about the two-state solution and the Saudis normalizing its its relation with Israel depend on the establishment of a Palestinian state or a clear commitment of the Israeli government to to this goal of a Palestinian State just just very briefly do do you know I mean you say that the American administ ation would want to see someone else in that position um who I I assume that they they prefer a c Central life candidate like gun who is the who is a leading person in Israeli public opinion polls okay thank you manim Klein thank you for joining us from West Jerusalem thank you
