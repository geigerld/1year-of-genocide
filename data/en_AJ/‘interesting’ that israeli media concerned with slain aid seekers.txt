well let's bring in Muhammad El MRI now professor of media studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies he joins me live uh on the set here good to see you again um I want to pick up again on Bernard's reporting there from occupied East Jerusalem where He suggests that a one form of discussion taking place now among Israeli opinion makers is the concern that some of them may have that this attack in Gaza becomes a pivotal moment around which World opinion consolidates and we've seen that with a number of countries speaking up now again calling for an immediate ceasefire we've seen it in Arab countries pointing the finger again at Israel for firing on civilians and that this is a moment when Israel gets forced into a ceasefire that it doesn't want can you see this as a pivotal moment a moment for change you know I think it's possible but I also want to to remind all of us that Israel has committed numerous atrocities over the past 5 months they've attacked hospitals they've attacked un shelters they've uh attacked schools University universities residential buildings and they've been condemned uh we've talked about the opinion polling data we've talked um on this set I've spoken with you about uh condemnations that have come in from from leaders in Europe and from the global South even the United States has gone on record in the past uh um sort of uh condemning some of Israel's uh uh actions in Gaza and so I'm not convinced yet that a massacre of around 100 people is going to change things when we've been averaging a couple of hundred people killed per day for five months it's a stockk singular event though and it happens at a moment in time when negotiations are taking place apparently in pretty Advanced stages towards some sort of a ceasefire if not a final ceasefire so it is tempting to see it as that sort of a moment of course it's all about the United States and the Israeli is apparently particularly concerned that this might be a moment that the United States uses to try and leverage them into a ceasefire any sign of a shift in the US position well I watched some of the remarks uh yesterday and uh it didn't look like it to me the the United States Administration is saying uh pretty much what it's been saying for the last 5 months after isra commits uh some sort of Massacre or atrocity so I'm not seeing evidence yet well you know we'll have to watch things over the next few days if if there's pressure from the International Community um you know leaders in Europe that's that's possible but the you mentioned the negotiations for a ceasefire the the the you know the sticking point there has always been the end game Israel has been adamant that it's going to effectively destroy Gaza it doesn't use those words but we we see what they're doing on the ground we we hear the rhetoric um coming out of Israeli political circles they want to make life unlivable they're trying to ethnically cleanse Gaza as part of their so-called greater Israel plan as long as that remains their intent there's just not a lot of incentive for Hamas uh uh to to agree to to agree to a deal sure it's possible right Israel doesn't mind waiting a few weeks in that sense right to continue its operation so it is possible that there is a ceasefire reached before uh Ramadan but something more sustained something permanent I'm still I'm still uh skeptical I mean it must be the case must it not that Israel even with that singular Vision recognizes that there is not an infinite amount of road down which it can travel that that road is getting shorter and shorter that eventually the pressures of an a coming election in the United States will bear on the Biden Administration and is already those pressures showing already and that eventually they will be reigned in well we would like to think so but U many people also said that Israel would be reigned in um after the icj hearings um a month and a half or so ago but in fact what they did was intensify their bombardment of Gaza in the aftermath of those hearings um I think now if you follow the Israeli media they're they're actually feeling quite confident looking at this recent poll by Harvard and Harris which shows that almost 70% of Americans believe that Israel is acting in self-defense that they're acting with restraint and so Israel is feeling confident that the us is going to continue to to back them right Muhammad Elm thank you for your analysis
