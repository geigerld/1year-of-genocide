Israeli opposition leader and former prime minister Yara laid has repeated a call for nanahu to resign ramping up pressure on the Prime Minister a day after he was heckled in Parliament by relatives of captives held by Hamas lapid says changing a prime minister in the middle of a war isn't good but the one in office is worse he cannot continue Gideon Levy is a columnist at harr's newspaper and he's joining us live from Tel Aviv always a pleasure to have you with us on Mr Levy nathany who's obvious critics aside just how much support does he have for his handling of the war the support shrinked dramatically but he still has his base and this base will be very faithful to Netanyahu but above all it's not only about the public opinion the majority in the parliament is still very solid and therefore all the are not realistic because I don't see you see you need four members of his coalition to quit the coalition to to change sides I don't see none of the members of the Coalition doing so in the coming future and if not all the talking about replacing Nan are quite Hollow we often hear that Netanyahu will not remain prime minister after this war would that be a reason for him to prolong it I wouldn't get so far I mean he's a very cynical politician no doubt about it but I give him still the credit that this for sure will not be his only consideration I I cannot buy it that he will do everything to prolong this war only for prolonging his his term I I refuse to believe in it even though there are many people people you know finally it's above what's deep in his heart and deep in his mind which nobody knows many things that that's his motivation I wouldn't take it so dramatically so extremely certainly he has spoken since the War Began about a very long War he said recently that they will fight that Israel will fight until the end but do we know what the end is or does he know what the end is that's the the $1 million question because neither him nor you nor me nor anyone knows what is the end game of this War I kept on saying this also in your network from from day one we went to this war with some kind of justification because the because of the barbaric attack on the sevens but without any plan how far do we go what are the goals are the achievable goals in which way are we ready to pay any price to achieve the goals are we going to enforce the Palestinians in Gaza to pay any price for achieving the goals including killings of thousands and tens of thousands of people I mean all those questions were never answered and therefore we continue now in an iner of of War without nobody knowing where do we go what are the goals can we achieve them when will we stop and everyone looks at Washington with a hope or with a fear it depends when will Washington put an end to this war what about the war cabinet are they on the same page about the objectives there's Netanyahu the defense minister another Minister Benny Gans a couple of observers are they United at least them in the objectives of the war more than it seems don't be wrong there is a big majority in Israel to continue the war including the opposition I didn't hear Mr laid or Mr Gans or anyone else who called to stop this war now none of them said so so we shouldn't get too much excited about an opposition in Israel to the war because there is no opposition to this war in is which should worry many Israelis Mr Levy it's uh very good to have your analysis that is Gideon Levy joining us live from Tel Aviv thank you thank you
