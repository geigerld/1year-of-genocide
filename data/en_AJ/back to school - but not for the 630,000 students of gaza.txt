this used to be a place of learning but now it's a place of Refuge families have came here from across Gaza seeking shelter from Israeli bombs children here are lucky to be alive but they know they are missing out on the life they should be living I recall the last day at school it was a Thursday we were supposed to resume lessons the following Saturday all of a sudden it was war now it's been almost a year and I am still out of school we were not able to finish our studies I miss my school too much throughout the building there are reminders of a lost education medium often thinks about a time when her day revolved around school now it revolves around survival supplies are short and she does what she can to help her family instead of lining up for the school day in the morning we line up for water for Relief Aid what can I say the first day of school was always a day to remember we spent the night before in bed with our school uniforms we were so excited it was hard to sleep at school we'd meet friends and classmates we'd also exchange a gifts in celebration of the first day instead of all that we woke up that day to the sound of explosions missiles killing blood massacres merciless bombing you name it Palestinian children in Gaza are now entering their second school year with no chance of being in a classroom the United Nations warned that depriving them of Education could cause long-term damage to gaza's children after months of death and destruction brought on by Israel's war on Gaza it would be easy to dispair but while people here have had to sacrifice many things there are some things they will never give up on I feel my children will have a bright future I believe my daughter will be a university professor and the boy a pilot I pray they will occupy the highest of all professional ranks I pray God will save them and all C and children enough with the war enough with it even in the darkest of times children still find moments to play and simply be children but to reclaim their rights to an education all they can do is hold on to hope and pray for an end to Israel's war hind Al jaaz Palestine make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
