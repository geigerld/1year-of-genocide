hello welcome to the program it's 18 GMT and Israel's prime minister says a date has been set for his military's ground operation in Rafa in southern Gaza that operation is what US President Joe Biden has previously called a red line Benjamin Netanyahu says he's received a detailed update on the ceasefire talks underway in Cairo while reiterating threats of the looming offensive meanwhile in Southern Gaza Israeli artillery fire has killed at least eight Palestinians in cunes civilians returning to the city have found little to come back to with many of their homes destroyed and at the international court of justice in the hag Nicaragua has accused Germany of aiding and abetting genocide being perpetrated in Gaza by supplying weapons to Israel let's go straight to Rory Chalin who is an occupied East Jerusalem Rory let's start with the Seas fire talks what is the very latest you're hearing well I think there has been cautious optimism uh in the aftermath of those talks those talks broke up uh earlier with the delegates uh heading back to their respective seniors taking a proposal that had been steered in large part by the United States now the cautious optimism I think primarily come from the Egyptians and the ceries uh with the cateres saying that this proposal looked to be a kind of three-phase deal uh with some of it focused or the first bit of it focused on humanitarian issues the Egyptians saying that the two main sides the Israelis and the Hamas had agreed on the kind of broad proposals but once you got beyond the Egyptians and the cies I think that optimism has started to fade significantly uh habas has been grumbling that the Israelis haven't really shifted uh on their longstanding insistence that the war goes on uh and that the Rafa operation uh will happen uh and uh that there will be no withdrawal fullscale withdrawal from Gaza to allow rebuilding to take place in fact one Hamas official in Beirut has even said already that that uh uh ceasefire proposal is being rejected by the GR group others are still saying that they're they're going to carry on looking at it and I think the Israelis are not particularly optimistic either y Galan who's the defense minister has said that there are difficult decisions uh and we have heard very recently from Benjamin Netanyahu the Prime Minister who has been I have to say non-committal right as you say uh we've just heard from him in the last hour or so he is clearly putting pressure on these talks uh what exactly has he said RI well there's clearly a lot of pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu as well there's pressure coming from the International Community most notably the United States which has taken a much much more active role uh in this round of negotiations than it has done in previous uh instances and Netanyahu is under pressure from the far right flanks of his own governing Coalition so yet yet again those far right flanks have uh restated their Line in the Sand essentially which is that if Benjamin Netanyahu signs up to a deal that they don't like then they're going to torpedo his government they're going to walk away from it and collapse the government which would presumably preempt early elections which the poll suggest that Netanyahu would lose now as you say Netanyahu has come out with a statement on these talks it's a non-committal one but he has talked about the Rafer operation let's hear exactly what he had to say just a short while ago today I received a detailed report on the talks in Cairo we are working all the time to achieve our goals which includes the release of all of our hostages and achieving complete victory over Hamas this Victory requires entry into Rafa and the elimination of the terror brigades there it will happen there is a date so what we understand is that prompted by the farri right ministers there is going to be uh a meeting tomorrow in Israel of uh the war cabinets plus uh an expanded Group which includes uh smotrich and it includes Ben gavier uh they we can bet are going to be putting pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu uh at least to uh to tailor whatever he signs up to so that it's in line with their expectations either that or not sign up to any deal at all so this peace deal that has been talked about in Cairo is still very much hanging in the balance indeed okay thank you for that Rory Chalin there for us an occupied East Jerusalem well we can talk now to paty Kohan she's out the state department in Washington DC where we've uh just been getting some new lines coming from where you are uh Washington saying it is still opposed to an Israeli ground operation in Rafa so clearly uh a bit of a gap here again uh between what the US is saying and what Israel is saying talk us through what you're hearing from the state department well the briefing is ongoing I was just in the room and he began by trying to express all the positive steps that they think Israel is taking opening up more border crossings and allowing more Aiden but at the same time they said Matt Miller this uh spokesman for the state department said we've seen this before it just needs to continue we'll be judging them on results uh but he was asked about this date for the Rafa Invasion and he said that the US to his knowledge has not been briefed or been told what that date was and he reiterated what they've been saying and what they've been saying to Israeli officials is that a largescale operation of Rafa is a bad idea that they would be extremely opposed to that because they said you they'd have to move the 1.4 million Palestinians who were told to go there after repeatedly being uh moved further and further south uh you'd have to find a way to get them out of the area safely and they've said in the past look there's nowhere safe for them to go everything is basically demolished so how would you provide for their food and their uh clean water and medicines uh so they again reiterated that it would be a mistake from their perspective to see a l large scale Invasion now that said it's a bit tricky because they're not saying Israel doesn't have to go after Hamas in Rafa they believe that that is a mission that Israel needs to conduct the question is how do they conduct they want to see very limited targeted attacks on Hamas Fighters they had a meeting a virtual meeting to try and figure out how that would work apparently it was rather heated uh but they will they say we don't want to see what happened in Gaza City or hanun you simply can't do a large scale Invasion when there's 1.4 million people trapped there and again it's been over the last couple of days we're hearing much tougher language Matt Miller saying the president himself has told the Israeli Prime Minister is Israel's policies need to change or ours will so tough talk not actually threatening any consequences uh but they are sending the message still that any large scale Invasion against uh the people in Rafa would be in their words a mistake okay thank you for that uh paty hhan there for us in Washington
