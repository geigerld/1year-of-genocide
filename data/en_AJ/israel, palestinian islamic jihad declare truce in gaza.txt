gaza is quiet on monday no israeli bombs no collapsing buildings no air raid sirens for now three days of bombardment by israel has destroyed homes and killed dozens of palestinians many of them children the cease-fire began late on sunday bringing relief and celebration we hope we will not have wars we are a people and we have the right to live our lives in gaza we don't want wars every year or every two days now we haven't even recovered from the previous war because israel says a hunt for leaders of the palestinian islamic jihad israel and its allies call them terrorists but the relatively small armed resistance group enjoys support among palestinians they affect heavy aerial and artillery attacks on neighborhoods in gaza and retaliatory rocket fire into israel egypt mediated the cease-fire between israel and the islamic jihad with support from the u.n and qatar because of this renewed aggression the qatari role was again as it always is with the aim to stop this aggression and stop the continuous bloodshed israel and islamic jihad both reserve the right they say to respond to future aggression assuring a decades-long conflict is far from over the zionist enemy had a clear and specific goal the annihilation of the islamic jihad movement and its military wing the al-qud's brigade today after the clash is stopped islamic jihad is clearly still strong minutes before the cease-fire took effect a flurry of bombs and rockets flew back and forth between gaza and israel before the skies fell silent people in gaza don't get to go back to anything like normal because they're still living under israel's siege that is a form of silent violence against every man woman and child in gaza 24 hours a day 365 days a year for 15 years so unfortunately it is fragile this is going to happen again i can't tell you if it's going to be in a day a week a month or a year but it's going to keep happening because israel enjoys total impunity for its crimes against the palestinian people let's cross over live now to imna said in gaza yumna how is that ceasefire holding now sammy well here in gaza while people are trying to get back to their normal lives uh many families are mourning and and uh in funerals of their lost beloved ones in the past air strikes uh others are in hospital with their injuries but uh the situation remains very complicated politically where it's a very cautious silence it's a very fragile ceasefire like you mentioned yourself i mean according to islamic jihad a political leader here in the gaza strip jihad and butch who we have spoken to they say that they have a an agreement and they have promises by egypt made on the release of bassam sadi and khaled awada and that is considered a promise for the cease-fire to be implemented in becoming a two weeks of time frame he said or as soon as possible on the other hand israeli internal security minister said that the agreement of the ceasefire did not include any um releasing of any high-profile islamic jihad prisoners that are in custody with israel so uh ziad nachala also last night in his presser after the ceasefire agreement was reached said that uh egyptian uh promises on releasing both basement saudi and khalil awada were made and the not releasing them is considered a breaching of this ceasefire that could take them back to uh or the group back to uh the attacks so uh basically it's it's it's a very uh complicated uh seize uh like very complicated silence and and um ceasefire agreement uh the situation is still very unclear uh it's still very fragile on the other hand uh un humanitarian coordinators here in the gaza strip investigating the aftermath of the israeli strikes the power plant has said that by 15 g it should have all the fuel needed to operate fully today at 15g all right thanks so much jumna the israeli strikes mostly hit three areas several people including children and an elderly woman were killed in the jobalia refugee camp in northern gaza israeli airstrikes targeted an agricultural area in khan yunus in the south also hit were sites in rafah along the border with egypt well those strikes killed palestinian islamic jihad member khalid mansour let's bring in now khalid abu hait he is the palestinian islamic jihad movement's media officer in lebanon joins us via skype from beirut there seems to be some differing narratives on what exactly was agreed so let me start with a very clear question in your understanding has israel agreed to the immediate release of palestinian islamic jihad figure khalid al-awada and the release in two weeks of basam assadi is that what you understand israel has agreed to thank you for having me the press and the press of uh last night the secretary general has mentioned in his press conference that there is an agreement has been reached by the egyptian and that agreement announces that have to be released today morning and is to be released in within two weeks now it's for the egypt it's for egypt to announce which one is right and which one uh is saying the truth and what the agreement really uh had uh in its uh points but as we heard from our correspondent there israeli sources are indicating that they have not agreed to release these figures what will it mean if if they are not released within two weeks what does that mean a return to conflict yes yes sure that was very obvious we have a very clear decision that without releasing khalid and bassam assadi there will be no ceasefire agreement that will be a break for the agreement from the israeli side and the fight will be continued let me just go into a little more detail try and clarify this there's a difference between saying we understand the egyptians or the mediators or the un will work towards the release of these two people you're saying that's not your understanding your understanding is not a vague promise to work for the release of a la walda and assad your understanding is that they will be released that is the agreement correct yes but if you remember uh the egypt the egyptian declaration has to be made yesterday at 5 p.m but it has been late until 8 pm or so on there was a difference between the situation between islamic jihad and the position of islamic and the israeli party islamic jihad asserted that without mentioning the release of khalid and the basanna there will be no ceasefire agreement so the egyptians have had to take that into consideration and they mentioned that into the announcement where is this agreement there has been no release of an official text of this agreement right yes now i think that uh it's in the egypt hands uh egypt has to say what was the agreement and how to deal with the situation this is not the first time that the israelis break the agreements uh we know that and we believe that bennett and lapid government had to make victory at the polls at the expense of the palestinian people at the expense of the palestinian blood this is not the first time the israelis governments go to this point now we have an agreement without it there will be no ceasefire we were very clear that we can stop or we stopped launching rockets and stopped fire ceasefire only on a condition that should be released soon i mean this morning and that bassam assadi should be released within two weeks or so on the the egyptians they asked and demand that not to be limited with one week and to make more time all right yeah let me jump in because time is running out you mentioned the launching of rockets how do you respond to the criticism that the launching of rockets this time hasn't really achieved much towards ending the occupation of the palestinians the israeli occupation of palestinians it hasn't contributed much towards ending the siege of gaza all it's done is possibly violate the laws of wars by targeting civilian areas in israel yes yes but we launched rockets against the israeli aggressive military operation declared against us we were but they're going towards civilian areas aren't they not just military targets sorry i mean the rockets are going towards civilian areas not just military targets we were not in a venture uh israeli forces kidnapped saudi from inside his home and killed there was no firing there was no battle israeli armies israeli army have made a massacre against civilians although they say that it was a military target you cannot target uh military officials and leaders when there is no battle and there is no fighting going on all right thank you very much for your time and for sharing your perspective thank you thank you
