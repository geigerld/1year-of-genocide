the US has sent a second carrier strike group to the Eastern Mediterranean the show of force has meant to deter Regional actors namely Iran and lebanon's Hezbollah from widening the war last week the US deployed a separate carrier international waters off Israel's Coast back in Washington DC US President Joe Biden was heckled by a pro Palestinian protester while discussing the situation in Gaza take a look oh saying well thank you whatever you're saying I'm going to say thank I can't hear you let's go live now to Heidi Joe Castro in Washington DC for us as we saw there Joe Biden being heckled by that Pro Palestinian protester is he likely to face more pressure particularly from his younger support base over America's stance with Israel maleen yes and in fact Biden already is just on Saturday there were 55 members of the US House of Representatives who sent him a letter along with uh SEC Secretary of State uh Anthony blinkin calling for the two to urge Israel to follow international law in its response to Hamas and not inflicting widespread harm to civilians uh now this was a letter that was signed by uh a number of house uh Democratic progresses but notably it was also joined by a few Democratic moderates uh who signed this letter as well and it was a sign that in this Congress that has really come out in favor of Israel there are some voices of dissent emerging though I have to note that this letter also unequivocally condemned in its words the terrorist attacks uh from Hamas upon Israeli civilians but we are seeing more and more of this sentiment In Pockets around the us including at some protests there was one notable one in New York in front of the home of the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer who's about to lead a delegation to Israel from Congress and this protest was uh held by uh Progressive is uh Progressive Jewish groups in the US and it resulted in about a dozen arrests including rabbis as well as the descendants of Jewish Holocaust Survivors that protest in front of Chuck Schumer's home in New York was to protest what they call the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza and now we have reports of a second US aircraft carrier entering the region is this an attempt at some kind of deterrence absolutely Ely and this is something that we had been expecting this is the Dwight D Eisenhower aircraft carrier which was already scheduled to deploy to that region it's on its way there already and today on Saturday rather came the official confirmation from the US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin that part of this Mission will be to uh go to the Eastern Mediterranean in response to this this conflict and of course its ultimate purpose there is to deter this conflict from widening it's a message to Hezbollah and Lebanon as well as Iran uh to not get involved in this any further than they have and of course it's joining the first US aircraft carrier that Gerald R Ford that is in that region for the same purpose already hardi Joe Castro there for us in Washington thank you
