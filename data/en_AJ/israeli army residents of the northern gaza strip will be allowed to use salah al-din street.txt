let me bring you a line that is coming out from the writers news agency at the moment which is reporting that the Israeli military says that it will allow Palestinian evacuees to use the main Gaza Highway South between 11 GMT and 1,400 GMT on Saturday so that is essentially within about 3/4 of an hour starting within 3/4 of an hour from now and then running for a 3-hour period after that that that's as much as information as we have at the moment we have of course seen um attacks and uh tank attacks on some of these routs south over the past few days as soon as we get more information about what's going to be going on with that and who exactly is going to be allowed to move South we're going to let you know
