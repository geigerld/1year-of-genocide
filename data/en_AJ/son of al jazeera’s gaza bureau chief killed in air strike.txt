welcome to the news hour we start with breaking news coming out of Gaza where alzer's Gaza bureau chief wild dudan Hamza has been killed in an Israeli strike directly hitting the car that he was traveling in while alad's wife son daughter and Grandson were all killed in an Israeli air strike that hit the house back in October also killed in the strike Mustafa tra who'd worked for AFP news agency Let's cross over to Han Mahmud who joined is now from Rafa in southern Gaza hany what more can you tell us about the attack on Hamza [Music] alud yes uh very very very devastating news indeed fe uh we were just uh earlier hours this morning uh we were in in the tent and it's just hard to imagine that he's he's he's gone now but uh Hamza with his colleague Mustafa abua worked for AFP and the another journalist that colleague of Hamza and Mustafa were out documenting the overnight attacks in uh on the road that connects hanun and ra when they were targeted by an air strikes and uh there was just a video circulating we we we just looked at the video we we could not believe that we were looking at the at Hamza and his colleague because uh in the earlier reports uh we reported about if people in a car were targeted and uh speculated that could be a family displaced family coming from hanun or to our shock it was was our colleague and um it just very devastating to see that Hamza is a a photo journalist and been working uh with our with the team since the beginning of of the war along with Mustafa have been documenting all the the tragedies and the destructions that caused by isra Relentless air strikes and and uh but to this point just nothing seems to be protecting anyone here not even the vest not even the helmet not even the job that they're doing very very shocking indeed we're still absorbing this we're still absorbing this of course honey I me we can hear it in your voice it must be incredibly difficult when you see a friend and a colleague earlier in the day and then all of a sudden you're confronted with the news that you have been obviously Hamza had been dealing with the death of obviously very close members of his family for the past several weeks H how was he coping with that in the conversations he was having with you it was it was very difficult with him Hamza had a great bond with his mother uh particularly and every once in a while he would be telling us about how much he he he he misses his mom and how much he he wished if she was still alive because he has so much to tell her to talk to her about his life his uh like his father situations he he wanted someone to be next to him every time whenever possible for him uh Hamza was a very uh very somehow discreet person who wouldn't open up to anyone unless he has he has built a good trust because every time he would break in and crying crying his heart out over the the passing of his mother and his uh his brother his his sister as well and his sister's son whole family and everyone's he he would be telling us how much void that created in in in his life there is life has no taste anymore because of uh uh he would describe when this war is over how he would go home and if the home is still standing how would we go home who would be checking on him who would be asking about his favorite meal or favorite uh presence in partic in special occasions I mean he he would catalog all of these things that uh a person who who enjoys a special bond with his family particular with his mother would be talking about and would be try to talk him because we know like if he if we are able to get him to close what be happen he would be more much more stronger to accept the fact that it's already happening and the best that he could be doing is to is to pray for them and be the good example the his mom always wanted him to be and uh never crossed our mind that he would be in he would end up in the same situation as his family and his his his siblings in the up with and uh our heart goes for his father who has endured so much uh not only his family member but also the extended family were 10 more of the larger the extended family D family were killed as well and also his his colleague and cooworker uh Sam Abu Daka and and other colleagues at Al jazer just hard hard to believe that this is this is happening again nothing seems to be protecting journalists and the job they're doing on the ground documenting all of these atrocities and crimes committed by by the Israeli military and of course honey while you're speaking to me we're seeing the very latest pictures of while uh at the side of uh his son's body with other colleagues and friends trying to console as you say a heartbroken father who has has lost a great deal and is one of hundreds of thousands across the Gaza Strip that has lost family members you touched on the fact that you know there is no protection for journalists there is no protection for anybody in Gaza right now despite the the the the title of safe zones given by the Israelis how difficult is it in your opinion right now to even designate any area in Gaza a safe Zone oh it's it's hard there there safe zones do not exist at all they only exist in the the Israeli military narratives it's just something for publicity that they use something that the that the Israeli mil military wanted to look good in front of uh the foreign media platform that they're doing everything possible or because the US has nicely asked them to uh not to kill civilians and without putting the pressure that would have caused the a practical impact or changed the course of the way they conduct uh this war it just way for them to to look much better while committing the crime there are no safe zones I'm we're we're reporting from the vicinity of this hospital and it's not safe and within the past few weeks we've seen how a sudden sudden air strikes took place within the vicinity where shrapnel it flew at a very high speed and hit the roof of our tent and almost killed one of our colleagues inside the tent so it just the whole narrative is false it's misleading and inaccurate and and it's it's fueled by by by a sentiment of of of of genocide when you when you hear an isra official military official describing an area like the central area as an over a crowded area full of terrorists this is this is a justification a pretext for whatever is going to happen next which is already labeling and and painting everyone as a terrorist including children women and elderly civilians largely so they it's a justification for the way to K them same thing happens to to journalists they're always labeled they they always targeted and attacked and it just it just happened to be their their bad luck that there's some good journalist here in the Gaza Strip are covering their atrocities and the crimes taking in place and and showing him to the world I think that's that's the fact that the military and so many people's opinion here that the fact they don't like that there there's so much good journalism going on covering these details tiny details of the world you don't like this fact and that's why uh journalists are under constant attack this is not the first time we've seen it colleagues their entire fames wiped out and of course uh again pictures that we being the latest pictures of while quite distraught obviously and one can imagine he'd be in that situation having lost his uh son again one of his fin one of his sons and all of his children hany you know as you were talking to me and our viewers would be wondering what that hum is we've been describing that hum above your head for n on three months now and it is an Israeli drone uh it's surveying the area they're incredibly threatening day in Day Out 24 hours a day yes indeed and I'm I'm standing right now and hearing this drawn I'm quite scared I'm quite scared because there is no terms to this war there's nothing is going to stop any official any soldier in the chain of command because the one who killed a 3-year-old in a building with her family can do anything because someone in the chain of thought it's okay and now they think it's okay and it's fine just to Target anyone to kill anyone the fact that this drone hasn't left the uh disguise of this particular area is quite threatening and risky and and often time we we we talk to ourselves like is it is it really safe to be out here and and doing these reports and and that these are questions that we we we challenge ourself and we try to give a sensible answer to what we're doing eventually we we come to a conclusion this is part of the the job that we're doing and it it has to be done because otherwise it's it the story won't be told and but the there is a highrisk involv in it particularly with a a a a drone that is either ATT attack drone or surveillance and it can be both a surveillance aerial drone and at the same time an attack drones uh conducting a aerial bombardment that's what we see in the the past few weeks here and in the central area and in the northern Gaza St in Gaza everywhere every inch is is risky every inch is dangerous and every inch there's a high possibility one can die and given that this place is overcrowded and packed a single air strike a single even with the with the smallest bomb can cause large number of death because we're looking at the a a sardine can right now everyone is packed in this area the vast majority of the population has been squeezed and and put in pushed into this small area hany just tell us a little bit more because we expect now u a funeral service to be conducted for wild Sun uh in in a few hours time burial space is incredibly difficult and also getting to these new established cemeteries is also difficult knowing there are snipers everywhere this will formal barrial procession do not exist since the the beginning of the first week of of the war people haven't been able to uh to conduct formal Proper Burial unable to offer the the loss prayer and Bo is just double grieving for people not only the situations are quite risky and and people are losing their loved ones and relatives and children but at the same time they're unable to uh to mourn them properly at least the the Mourning heart where people can hold for the last time their their their loved one their relatives and say goodbye to them and properly before they put them in the grave and it just the fact that no there's no burial formal proper burial site and for the past week's people resorted to burying people on the sidewalk or in the middle of the road in those little Islands or in the court yard of public facility like hospitals and evacuation centers and there are great of stories of heart BR breaking story of people who buried their loved ones in the back Courtyard of of the shipa hospital or the Indonesian hospital or in evacuation centers and those who who remained stranded in the war zone in Gaza northern part and inhan yunas could not bury their father or mother or loved ones they Buri them in the backyard of of their homes and and waiting for this to to settle in order to rest them in in peace in a in a better place but it's increasingly difficult even uh the the the kind of of of of mass that would would someone would look at to to participate in these processions is is not permissible given the difficulty of the situations and for the most part it's only exclusive to family members because it is risky to be in large Gathering out in the public in in either a cemetery or wherever where they decide to bury them uh but as of now we we're not looking at a a formal burial site it's going to be uh some somewhere temporary until they're able to to move them to a formal burial site and these were strikes that obviously hit W Sun uh early in in the morning as such but the strikes have continued through the night haven't they yes overnight and early hours of this morning in fact what Hamza and his colleague were doing they were at a sight of an over night uh attacks within the vicinity of they documenting the the the destruction the the great deal of Destruction that caused by the air strikes and talk to people who who were around the vicinity of the area displaced Palestinian those who uh who were pretty much scared of the situation have been displaced more than one time and to see what are their options right now to go where where to seek safety where to seek Refuge as the air strikes continue but they were at a site where more than 10 people were killed displaced Palestinians in inside residential homes and and in other areas as well the number gone from from 14 into now 18 in kanun for example for one entire family at the same time a massacre was committed in jabalia fuah fua area and abuba family of 60 people from one family old women and it children and elderly were reside taken shelter in one of the residential homes when it was completely destroyed and the number of people who are pulled from under the rebels as of now 60 people according to a sour from uh the Indonesian hospital but again we're talking about a hospital that is not functioning but at least the they count the numbers of those are being killed and there are still more more children more women under under the reubel so all of this confirm uh the The Narrative that there is no no single safe place in Gaza including the empty northern part obviously honey when you move away from the live position that we see you at to go and do your reporting as wildon would have done as well there are certain precautions and safety measures are always put in place as part of the uh Health uh safety protocols within the media industry you have your flat jackets which are also protect in theory protect you from the front and back with big very heavy metal plates I've worn them myself I know exactly how heavy they are if you're traveling in a car what sort of identification do you have around that car inside the car on top of the car that would have at least identified the car as as a media yes well we have a a set of rules here before leaving the tent you have to have your as long as you are doing your job here you have to wear your vest you have to put your helmet as well as if you go on a field you have to be wearing your your vest that says press the one that has a protective material in it as well as the car is labeled it says a press it says TV very very visible to who whoever is is watching or is monitoring your movement so the fact that all of this was obvious uh to the the drawn or the whoever conducted the the strike it's obvious that it was on purpose it was was done on purpose to to send a message to to to scare other journalists from uh doing their job and that's that's the outcome that the only possible outcome we're looking at people were in a car three journalist they had the car labeled by a TV and press they wore their vest they had all of their uh safety gear equipment on everything was done based on uh how how the book says pretty much following the rules uh just that did did not save them from doing that and I mean we seen the example with Sam when he was reporting un covering he had all of his safety gear on but that also did not uh protect him that doesn't say doesn't say that those gears are not required or they're not doing the job but at least they given the identification now the the problem is when the other side recognize you as a journalist you're doing your job and yet decide to go ahead with the with with the strike and push the button and put an end to your life that's that's the problem the problem is not in the the identification the problem is how you perceived uh uh by the Israeli military and how are journalists from Al jazer perceived I suppose it is the question we have to ask because if Wild's family have been targeted and we know that our cameraman uh from our sister channel from Arabic was also killed just a few days ago it does raise questions doesn't it about where we stand as an organization trying to tell the story on the ground one of the very few that can tell it to the international audience this well good journalism good reporting authentic and factual reporting is a threat a threat to Netanyahu a threat to his government a threat to the Israeli military who is heavily relied on Western media platforms and telling their side of the story their their their narratives and pretty much push for that narrative over and over and largely ignores the the pled of of Palestinians under these heavy bombs that's that's the problem so when you when you offer good journalism you are you are a Target because you uncover uh What uh the world largely hasn't heard in years about what's going on I mean the fact that it's always being label as the bad guys the terrorists the one who who have hate the one who don't like Jews that want all of this and and all the sudden uh good journalism and Reporting showing uh the other side of the story that in fact this is not what is happening the label is false the The Narrative is inaccurate and I think that's that's where it's becoming a threatening and um unfortunately people pay paying heavy price for for telling a a true story how difficult is it for you hany to actually understand the fact that you know as the as the days progress you hear more and more news not just about people in Gaza across of the whole strip you know suffering so very badly but then you know when you hear news of of somebody that you know so very well and you have to try and impart this news as you are to me and to our audience in in completely impartial way to explain the grief that really why is why is is feeling just as a father he he's like thousands of fathers in Gaza right now indeed then and just we are we we're feeling we're in the same position we have families we have children and we constantly worry about their their safety their livelihood and and we we seeing what what's happening to Al his family and and the fact that this is his this is third time dealing with with a tragedy uh a family member close family member is just it makes the whole situation even worse again the level of fear is great the risk is greater uh are we threatened yes it it we are threatened and we know we are at trisk we know we are a Target we know we are at any moment we could and and I'm going to let you into something I mean we had this conversation uh me and my family and we we talked about if possibly if something happened this is this is what you need to be doing because it it's imminent you can't because you you don't know what's going to happen you don't know if you're leaving you're you're home and coming to the tent safe you don't know if you're going back safe you don't know what's going to happen if you are going on a field work like what Hamza and and his colleague were were doing at earlier hours of this morning but it it just it's a real thing it's it's not something that we that we we brag about or something that we we were happy to show but it's a real Danger real risk real lifethreatening situations taking place every minute of our life and that's this is the uh the truth and it happens to be this way it happens to be in the most difficult situations ever uh and and that's the the the pressure that we have because between reports constantly word if it's not you could be my family could be a journalist being punished by his getting his family targeted like what happened with M asrai our colleague from Al jazer where his entire family more than 21 member of his family including his parents and Grandparents were killed and other children and women uh mammad Aban an audio engineer who was was was his family was targeted the entire family as well and so on it just it's either the the journalists becoming the Target or the family they the target to punish the journalist and to deter them from uh from doing their job and that's the war on all level the the level of killing the kind of of of the tragedy created all to deter Palestinian to their saying something anti occupation or anti-war or any of that of that sort just stay there for a moment tany let me just uh let our viewers understand the pictures that they're actually seeing right now here on Al jazer if you are joining us here it's 1325 GMT sorry uh 1025 GMT and the breaking news that we're uh letting you know about is that the son of wild dud our bureau chief of Al jazer uh in Gaza has lost his son due to an Israeli uh shelling of the car that his son and at least two other journalists were traveling in uh as they were uh reporting on a overnight story um within uh the Gaza strip uh wild wild that dude our Bureau Chief's family had also been targeted uh just several weeks ago his wife uh and several members of his close family had been killed a huge tragedy for him uh and for the bureau the pictures that you're seeing there are of him identifying his son's body um it will be taken for burial shortly these are the latest pictures coming into as I'm sure you can imagine um it's always difficult to get live pictures of those sorts of incidents straight away we been speaking to hanni Mahmud our correspondent uh who's also um been filling Us in on the background uh to Hamza uh hann's friend Wild's son um working for the AFP news agency for those viewers who are just joining us hany could you just let them know again why uh humza was in that car and what was the story that he was reporting on yes we all know R has becoming increasingly dangerous and risky not not only for for uh uh for local residents but but also for displaced families who've been evacuating for for the past few weeks coming all to ra is becoming packed overcrowded with so many people asleeping neither on the side walk or in evacuation centers or in the homeless because the area is is is running out of space and the fact that ra designated as a safe area for people yet there really military conducting these massive Relentless air strikes and and it's been equally if we compare ra to other parts of the G has been equally bombed and large number of people have been killed and tragically the vast majority of those who are killed happen to be displaced Palestinian just summoning into uh the the Israeli uh Nar native of of safe Zone just put a a huge hole in it that it's inaccurate it's misleading and and very contradictory to to what's going on uh on the on the ground but Hamza and his colleagues were doing field work documenting the the level of Destruction that was caused by an over uh an overnight air strike that targeted two residential homes on near the road that connects hanun City with with rafan it just the every air strike has an aftermath it's not only causing great deal of damage to and destroy the targeted home but also it causes severe damage to the surrounding uh area if you count five to seven residential homes become un unlivable unsuitable for people to to stay in and and that's the kind of of of documentation that we in our work with trying to to cover to see that it's not about just the house but the greater deal of damage to the point that have become increasingly consistent with with the Israeli Narrative of making Gaza uninhabitable making create conditions that life becomes impossible for people to even think back think of going back or staying here uh when when when the war is over all of this part of of of what's going on so they were they are do documenting these crimes and caused by the destruction more displacement more people are k more people under under the rebels when when they were targeted and their work put they put an end to their work because that that kind of documentation that for the Israeli military shouldn't be on on on TV shouldn't be uh going to Media because it's it's harmful to them it's harmful for the narrative because soon enough they're losing The credibility of of the many allegations that are being thrown and and and and they go un challenged that's the problem honey do stay with us uh we'll be back with you shortly uh in Rafa uh
