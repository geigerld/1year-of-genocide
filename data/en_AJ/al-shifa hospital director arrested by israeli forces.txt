well the alifa hospital director Muhammad Abu Salia has been arrested by the Israeli Army in Gaza a number of doctors are also among those detained 180 patients remain trapped inside the largest Medical Facility by Israeli forces meanwhile the Israeli Army ordered the evacuation of the Indonesian Hospital in Northern Gaza within the next 3 hours on Wednesday about 450 patients moved out of the facility but 200 more remain inside both medical facilities have been under repeated attacks by Israel Abu AUM is in Khan Yunis forest in the southern part of the Gaza Strip so T just bring us what more can you tell us about the situation with those two hospitals yes uh both hospitals are witnessing a very uh serious and even critical situation as the Israeli troops are still uh in circling and even in both significant uh control over the vicinity of the main to hospitals we're talking about Indonesian hospital andat hospital starting first with the Indonesian Hospital which has been informed by the occupation forces for the second time to evacuate the buildings from the patients medical workers and even from the displaced people inside uh in order to be later uh uh controlled by the Israeli forces now the majority of doctors and uh uh displaced people are still inside this medical complex as they had been subjected previously to separate Israeli air strikes which claimed the lives of 12 Palestinians and the number of medical workers have been also injured due to these Relentless attacks also they have multiply been subjected to Israeli fires by the Israeli uh Isel soldiers on the ground now uh this Hospital considered to be the main Central Hospital that is still uh operating in the north of the Gaza alongside with another two uh Central hospitals and what is really strange this time is that the arrest of doctors as Dr Muhammad Abu the director of a shifat medical complex has been arrested by the Israeli occupation forces and even today uh earlier two uh Palestinian bcts have been also arrested by the Israeli occupation forces and uh this gives a clear sign that there is no any impunity inside the Gaza Strip neither for medical workers civil defense Crews and even journalist as the attacks had reached all classes in the Palestinian Community meanwhile the sh Hospital uh has been also under the Israeli uh control for not more than uh one week and the situation there is completely dire as Israel is still even recommending uh patients and even uh displaced people to flee to the south of the territory as also the attacks on the south on the south did not stop during the last 24 hours which claimed the lives of around 200 Palestinians only in the last 24 hours and tet what's the mood there among people knowing that this uh ceasefire has now been delayed yes uh people inside Gaza Strip are really desperate and they were looking for just to a window of hope that would uh uh relatively mitigate the situation on the ground as they have been living under Israeli inter spamming for around 47 days as uh the uh qat and Egypt had largely mediated in order to reach a SE fire and to narrow Maps between Hamas and Israel they have delayed the uh the ceasefire till tomorrow in order to be healed due to some logistical issues that will be conducted within the coming hours as the uh cut reform ministers said that they are ADV they are reaching very Advanced uh uh levels in the uh talks with between both sides in order to release 50 Israeli hostages captured inside Gaza Strip and in return Israel from its side were released an number of Palestinians detained in Israeli jails including young children and women and what is really important for Palestinians is that they see that the humanitarian AIDS and the flow of the fuel to the territory will mitigate the inhuman conditions that they have been witnessing for more than uh 6 weeks of fighting and another part of Palestinians see that they would bring uh they want to have a real and significant change in term of having a longterm ceasefire that guarantee their return to the houses in the north and in central areas of Gaza City T abum in Khan Unice thank you
