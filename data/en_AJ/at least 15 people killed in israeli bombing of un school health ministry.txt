to Gaza now the spokesman Ashraf aludra from the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza is speaking and more than 70 with various and multiple injuries these are the only victims of the latest Massacre perpetrated by the Israeli pleasance on Alura horaa building most of them were women and children who were sitting unsuspected unsuspecting sitting in the schoolyard the missile the missiles H the bodies as a result many were Torn to Pieces collected their bones and fleshes in plastic bags the health Ministry suffered 150 of their paramedics killed 27 ambulance Vehicles totally destroyed including the two ambulance Vehicles heading carrying the Convoy of victims headed to to RAF of yesterday we reiterate that the Israeli occupation forces purposefully targeted 105 medical facilities 16 of which are now out of service in addition to 32 Prime Care medical facilities either for the lack and fuel or total Destruction hospitals in Gaza Strip are overpacked with patients victims of critical and complex conditions in addition to the morgs that is overpacked with dead bodies in addition to that we are losing lives every minute simply because we fail to intervene or provide the due medical attention as we speak the Israeli occupation forces continue to Target the the roads leading to the South whereby we are not able to transport those critically wounded victims who require to be transported you watching Al jazer that was ashaa the spokesman for the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza giving an update on the medical situation in there he was talking initially about the uh attack on the AL Alura School um he said many of the those who had died were women and children those who had been injured as well were also women and children we understand at least 12 of them um 12 people have been killed there he said 105 medical facilities had been hit 15 he said were out of commission hospitals in the Gaza Strip he said were overpacked uh the morgs were packed with dead bodies he said we're going to bring in tamut professor of public policy at Doha Institute for Graduate Studies who's been with us over the the last hour um it's just a chilling reminder as if we needed it just what the impact that these Israeli air strikes are having on the medical facilities but of course that's going to have a KnockOn effect in terms of the possibility of the spread of disease simply because there is no water and also of course if these medical facilities simply can't cope with the numbers of killed and injured that they're seeing uh Rob well I mean the the entire Health sector has collapsed it it it it has collapsed I mean we see uh hundreds of or even thousands of people taking refuge in hospitals they sleep in corridors inside hospitals this is this is a total dysfunctional Health sector I mean it has collapsed as we talk now so the ones who left their doctors their families people uh they took they took risk to be there it's their it's their values moral system to stay and and help you know and and it's but it's done it's de done and what Israel is doing now it's it's uh obviously it's um it's it's killing any it's it's it's cutting off people people from all basic Services people who are still who left in Gaza now who haven't moved South now will soon be left with nothing no water no electricity when I say electricity don't get me wrong it's Israel has cut electricity long time ago but there still some of them rely on solar cells to to charge their batteries their phones it's it's so and if the if if hospitals uh stop their operations because of lack of fuel then that's it they'll have to go south but again for me it's what really astonishes me is that again the the the the utter failure of the International System mainly un agencies you know to even intervene when it comes to helping Palestinians evacuate South if they have to evacuate south I mean it's it's I mean how would people do it in Gaza when they don't feel safe when Israel has committed so many crimes even on civilians fleeing to the South why other countries that have been in Conflict had mechanisms to help people uh leave from conflict rden areas to Safe areas through humanitarian corridors and when I say this I talk about like large convoys of buses with un flags with with with with guarantees then people might say yes we are we we can go south we feel safe to go south now but with this even not in place the minimum guarantees I mean the International Community even has failed Palestinians in their own dis internal displacement to give to help them and give them minim minimum protection and guarantees to relocate safely South that's also another Mass crime and another failure from the International Community it's a moral failure as well for the International Community um so I I I really I'm going to stop here but it's it's it's uh it's it's really overwhelming to see this and and and it's it astonishes me what the International Community H how it fail Palestinians so many times even in their own displacement that it cannot help them to display to be displaced safely under this this this the Israeli attacks tamam thank you for now you're welcome
