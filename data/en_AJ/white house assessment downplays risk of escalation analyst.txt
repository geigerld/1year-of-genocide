let's bring in Glenn Carl he is a former deputy National Intelligence officer for transnational threats for the CIA he joins us now from Boston Glenn remarkably Kirby literally just said that he didn't believe there were any signs an escalation is imminent in the region although what's happened in the last 24 hours doesn't help what what did you make of that well of course there were fascinating comments uh what I took his statement about not any signs to mean was a rather specific um illusion to what I believe would be there are no signs from the intelligence collected from the intelligence Community the military and the Diplomatic community of the United States that there are any counter steps uh in the works uh the larger assessment that there is not anything that has happened or appears to be in the works I think is true for the moment I think that it's a sound assessment that to state that all the parties which would be in this instance Iran um hisbah Hamas and Israel um continue to wish to avoid a generalization an expansion of the of the war in Gaza into a regional War but um Mr Kirby didn't address what I think is probably most likely uh which is that um Iran and secondarily and um uh Hamas specifically is really obliged to respond I think well speaking of intelligence and assessments Kirby also didn't give away much there despite Secretary of State Anthony blinkin earlier saying that the US had no knowledge of plans for H's assassination now this happened in a week in which the Israeli and American intelligence chiefs were literally sitting at the same table in Rome Iran has already written to the UN Security Council accusing the US of involvement in Han's death how much Credence do us denials have on the ground could us personnel and interests be at risk here well important subject your question uh really I think is based on what is certain to be we know to be a widespread view which is that America American intelligence Services certainly would know about an a planned assassination or assault but that is that is not true now I'm not sitting in any position to have firsthand knowledge of this now but I do know how the the US intelligence community and the Israelis specifically and other intelligence Services interact and the Israelis would never tell anybody however close an ally about a planned assassination that they were um had in the works and the Americans would not be likely to know uh so I I completely believe the statement that the US was not informed and did not know I'm also confident that if the US did know in advance from its own sources that it would have tried to dissuade or stop the Israelis from doing it but but I think that that is true it's also true however that no matter what I say based on my past experience or official American officials say in their capacities that a lot of people will believe that well Kirby is also saying that the US will defend its interests in the region against threats including those from Iran how far does its commitment to protect Israel go uh well there those are a couple of issues uh that you intertwine uh we've heard from tan already unsurprisingly that it holds America partially responsible for what Iran always characterizes as the American surrogate uh Israel uh so if there were some sort of act attack against American interests which largely need Personnel of facilities in the region or anywhere for that matter the US would certainly respond but I think again in such a way that it tried to avoid a generalization of the of the conflict if uh uh Iran or Hamas uh were to strike as I expect they will at some point in some retaliatory way against Israeli uh interests uh then I expect that the US would call for calm on all sides and try to stop things from escalating Glenn car a former deputy National Intelligence officer for transnational threats at the CIA always great to get your thoughts and insights Glen thank you so much for joining us on aler anytime make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
