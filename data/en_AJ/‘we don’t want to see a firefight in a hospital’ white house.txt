let's bring in Mike Hannah now he joins us from Washington DC Mike what's the reaction been there to the Israeli raid on Gaza alifa Hospital well we've just had a statement released quoted by several news agencies here in which the White House is quoted as saying that it does not support striking a hospital from the air and does not want to see a firefight in a hospital after the Israeli military said it was carrying out this particular particular Aid at alifa hospital now the official who made the statement is not identified however it's identified as a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council the official says that we do not want to see a firefight in a hospital where innocent people helpless people sick people trying to get medical care they deserve are caught in the crossfire hospitals and patients must be protected the spokesperson is quoted as say saying now this is an echo of something that President Biden said in the last 24 hours where he stated very clearly he believes that hospitals should be protected the United States is opposed to action being taken against hospitals so this all some 24 hours ago now we have this latest statement from the White House trying to get clarity on exactly who the spokesperson is being quoted by various news agencies all right well stay with us mik because Hamas is really a statement it says it holds Israel and US President Joe Biden fully responsible for the raid on alifa Hospital in the statement the group said the US essentially gave the green light for the operation when the White House said it supported Israel's claims that Hamas uses a hospital for military purposes well Hamas has again denied the allegations calling them a false narrative so M Hamas accusing the White House of essentially greenlighting the operation well let's just unpick this and take a look at the timeline in the course of the day we had the National Security advisor for the White House John Kirby uh briefing journalist in which he said that the US had received information or had got information that Hamas was using alifa hospital as a command node and possibly a weapon storage facility now he would not provide any detail saying that he did not want to get into the graner details of this intelligence information he implied that the information came from both the US's own sources as well as those of Israel but he made very clear that uh he wouldn't give any further details he refused to be drawn on what evidence he had what tangible evidence uh that he could provide to bolster this claim which is similar to the claim that has been made by Israel so in terms of the timing that we've seen a few hours after the state M by the National Security advisor to the White House you have Israel army launching this attack on alifa Hospital uh that is the background to it that is why Hamas is making the claim in turn that that statement by the National Security advisor constituted what amounts to a green light for the Israelis to begin this operation not withstanding what President Biden said in the past 24 hours and that is why we've got another White House official being quoted as saying that hospitals must be protected in Washington DC for us Mike Hannah thank you
