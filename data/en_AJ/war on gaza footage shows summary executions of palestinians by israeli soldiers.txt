we're going to begin this news AIS with videos emerging out of Gaza appearing to show summary executions of Palestinians by Israeli soldiers Al jazer has obtained the videos and let me give you a warning some of you might find them disturbing we're choosing not to show the moment of death in the videos they were taken around arid Street that's the coastal Road connecting North and South Gaza Israel has designated it as a safe zone for Palestinians wanting to move between the areas this footage is from June 1st it shows a person walking along the beach Israeli soldiers appear to have stopped them and moments later the person is shot this next video is set to show a group of Palestinians walking North on May 17th one of them steps out of the group and raises their hands in the air apparently showing that they're unarmed they're shot within minutes then the video appears to show soldiers coming in to take the person's body away and in this footage another person is standing in the same area with their hands in the air this is shortly before their shot by Israeli Soldiers the same then happens to another person later we're going to bring in Anthony Lowenstein he's the author of The Palestine laboratory it's a book on Israel's arms and surveillance industry he's joining us live from Sydney thank you very much indeed for being with us I I wanted you to help me out with some context first of all geographically um what's your understanding of where the safe Zone was at this time well the truth is there is no safe Zone as every viewer will know I mean Israel has claimed at various points in the last eight plus months that certain parts of Gaza were safe zones particularly in the last month or so for example where around 800,000 to a million Palestinians from Rua moved slightly away from the border um on Egypt but there was no safe Zone because those areas were also bombed so there are no safe zones despite what Israel claims and this set of footage that you're showing is just yet the latest example of the complete ality really and unaccountability of Israeli forces there without any kind of Rules of Engagement of course Israeli military says their Rules of Engagement if you ask them directly but as we've seen for a long time in Gaza and frankly long before October 7 those Rules of Engagement are lacks at best one of the um when it comes to situations like this one of the arguments that are or defenses shall we say that is in put forward by the Israeli military is that individuals would POS some sort of threat to the Troops or they were encroaching on some sort of military installation you've seen the pictures what's your interpretation would that argument stand up no is the short answer and it's similar to what we saw I think about a month or so ago also in alier from footage Drone footage of Palestinians unarmed who are walking in an open field nothing near a military installation who were shot dead a number of them and this is a fits into a long-standing pattern and almost certainly if Israel does respond to this they will say yes we'll investigate it was against the rules of engagement we deeply apologize but it's never goes anywhere and that's similar to what we've seen for example of huge amounts of Israeli soldiers documenting on Tik Tok and other social media platforms are there abuses of Palestinians the humiliation of Palestinians and the idea that there's a particular safe Zone I think also goes to the heart of what Israel's creating in Gaza which is large buff zones that in the current negotiations for a so-called ceasefire which appear to be stalled yet again there is a talk a demand from Hamas that all Israeli forces would inevitably withdraw in a reasonable amount of time but Israel has been creating for months largely out of the International Eye buffer zones where around 16 to 20% of Gaza has essentially being gobbled up by this so-called buffer zone and there's no suggestion for that they would ever leave that buffer zone essentially allowing them access in the North and the South of Gaza anytime they want when and if the war ends so the idea of safe zones are a myth tragically we are talking about a war zone and soldiers combat troops Under Fire um can be under significant stress is there anything in these pictures to indicate that the soldiers may have been responding um to a stressful situation look not that we're saying obviously it's possible to know exactly what happened before this footage and what happened slightly after but it fits into a long-standing pattern as I say of Israeli soldiers being trigger happy and this has been since October 7 along the Israel Gaza border for years we only have to remember a number of years ago the so-called Gaza March of return where thousands of Palestinians were shot many of them maimed forever for simply walking towards a fence in Gaza and huge numbers of alians were killed as well so yes Israeli soldiers would feel under threat that's no doubt true because it's a war zone but that does not justify any kind of killing of unarmed civilians nothing justifies that whatsoever Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly referred to the Israeli military as the most moral army in the world do these pictures reflect that I mean the idea that in 20124 the Israeli government and many it of its supporters claim that there's any such thing as a moral Army I mean the concept of armies by definition You could argue are immoral and what I mean by that is that if you look at the US military in the last 20 years Iraq or Afghanistan or the Israeli military in Gaza or the West Bank or frankly Lebanon in the last years immorality is the point Mass killing is the point Mass Slaughter is the point as we've seen in Gaza since October 7 the idea of having potentially 40 to 50,000 Palestinians killed the vast majority of whom are civilians no one really buys this argument that Israel is a moral Army its greatest backers and supporters might support that or believe that delusion but no one who's rational does and that's why in many parts of the world now particularly young people in the US Israel's image has tanked completely tanked and that's the problem that Israel is going to have moving forward atie L winstein we appreciate you being with us in Al so thank you very much indeed for your time thank you make sure to subscribe
