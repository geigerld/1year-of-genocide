moving on uh the Palestinian diplomats that have been urging world leaders to back an immediate ceasefire continue earlier I spoke to palestine's ambassador to the United Nations Riyad manso he called on the International Community to take immediate action to save civilian lives we appreciate what the Secretary General has been saying uh his statement is very much in line with What was decided in the 10th resumed emergency session of the general assembly he told us in a private meeting about a week ago that he is calling for a humanitarian ceasefire whatever that means but ceasefire is acceptable ceasefire is needed ceasefire has to be put in place and hundreds of trucks of uh humanitarian Aid including um Medical Aid uh food water and of course uh you need to have you know trucks of fuel in order to help hospitals to be able to function to take care of the wounded and uh the sick people and the babies in incubator and all the correct things that the Secretary General has you know emphasized and we hope that the security Council and the International Community not only listen carefully to what the Secretary General saying but also to honor it by implementing it and we salute him for that principal position and of course these are issues that we've been following through the conflict now you talk about the UN Security Council they have been convening behind closed doors a meeting called by China and the United Arab Emirates though there's no vote in any shape or form the issue of the ceasefire is very being very clearly debated and talked about what do you hope will come out of of this meeting well uh my understanding that there is a growing support for the call of a humanitarian ceasefire now as the Secretary General has articulated that we support this call and we hope that those who are not uh approving the implementation of that call to change their minds the situation is very dire there is a catastrophic situation in the Gaza Strip and the International Community has to elevate itself to the requirement of what is needed and the Secretary General is leading that charge he is correct he is right we should ablige him we should agree with him and more importantly we should Implement what he is calling for and there are thousands of truckloads of humanitarian assistance we need to see hundreds of them to start making it to the Gaza Strip all parts of the Gaza Strip the north the South and the midsection indeed and that has been a view echoed by uh many politicians diplomats and Aid agencies uh these past few weeks but I could just take you back the UN General Assembly very clearly voted in favor of a humanitarian ceasefire you're a seasoned Diplomat sir you know how the system works can I just ask you what the impact of that vote has been in the days after what sort of conversations you've been having with Sovereign diplomats from other countries about the way that they voted especially those that voted in favor of the resolution that you were pushing for I think that the fact that uh the general assembly overwhelmingly voted in favor by 121 votes against 14th in favor of that resolution which contained the the key component components of what the Arab ambassadors and the Muslim countries ambassadors pushed for mediate sees Fire Stop The Killing save lives uh allow for the uh uh you know humanitarian assistance up to scale meaning more than 100 truck loads every day and stop the mass transfer it's a crime against humanity all these elements including protection of the civilians were reflected in that resolution and the great majority of the community of Nations after 3 weeks adopted that resolution which means that that is the overwhelming position of the International Community there is a minority that is powerful that is not listening to this position and we have to continue with our efforts the efforts of the Secretary General until they also Al realign themselves with the position of the general assembly L and start implementing the content of that resolution Ambassador let's not beat around the bush when you talk about a minority you're talking about the United States what sort of pressure are you putting on the US or can you put on the US to listen to what you need I am not uh pushing around the bush you know I know that I am talking about that huge elephant in the security Council which is the United States of America it is the last you know herdle before us and before the International Community to convince them to find a way that they have to go along with the overwhelming position of the International Community because they are able to influence the Israeli occupying authority to stop these crimes that are taking place uh you know on the Gaza Strip uh it is difficult but still we are staying the course and we are compounding our uh uh efforts and pressure we are also thinking of a few additional ideas including ideas that South Africa is taking the lead in referring uh the issue of the investigation of the crimes uh committed in the security Council to the IC by a number of countries similar to what was done in Ukraine and to add the pressure through that you know uh additional uh uh uh method of adding you know to the pressure on particularly the United States and that and Israel also so that we can eventually see the implementation of the content of the general assembly resolution which is in line with what the Secretary General of the United Nations Antonio gues is saying as well you mentioned South Africa there sir um some countries certainly mainly Latin American and now we're seeing African uh countries withdrawing their ambassadors from is Israel just want to your reaction to this it's happened within the last few days it supports your position on the Diplomatic front does it really have an effect I think it does but what is needed is more of these steps uh countries at their National capacity are capable of taking steps that will you know add to the pressure on Israel to stop these crimes uh for example you know Oman uh suspended allowing you know isra aircrafts from flying in their own space uh that is also another practical step there are a host many steps that could be taken by countries in their National capacity beside withdrawing their ambassadors or severing diplomatic relationship with Israel and they have to start taking these steps so that they can maximize the pressure on Israel to stop these crimes committed against our people in the Gaza Strip because killing uh children and killing large number of civilians is no justification for anything killing 10,000 Palestinian civilians and around 25,000 injured and destroying 50% of the building is in the Gaza Strip and starving uh in a collective punishment in an entire population destroying hospitals depriving them of having the necessary elements for saving lives are all crimes against humanity and who whoever commit these crimes should F account face accountability and uh face you know the punishment that they deserve for committing such crimes well let's cross over to Christen slum standing by for us at un headquarters where a security council meeting is in session behind closed doors U the security Council Kristen we're finding it hard to come to an agreement on a humanitarian pause or a ceasefire resolution I mean when do you think we might hear movement on this well there's not a lot of reason for optimism here the Security Council is holding its sixth meeting in the last 30 days on the subject they're on their fifth draft resolution and have yet to find agreement uh the meeting uh seems to be wrapping up we may have more information in a while but there's no call for vote no resolution that's been put forward this meeting was called by the United Arab Emirates and China in response to the attacks on Sunday of the alifa hospital near the alifa hospital uh the attacks ongoing on the jabalia refugee camp uh China and UAE two countries that have been calling for an immediate ceasefire but that language is tricky for many in the security Council and uh coming up with wording that all 15 members can agree upon particularly the five permanent members who have the power to veto something that they don't like has been an issue we know the United States um vetoed one resolution early on that called for humanitarian pauses because it didn't have uh enough language about Israel's right to defend itself in it since then they've really taken up the language of humanitarian pauses and advocated for pauses going forward saying a ceasefire uh would be too blanket for for uh Hamas to be able to regroup and rebuild itself and reattach Israel um but supporting efforts to get Aid into the country other countries now seem uh to want something stronger and again it takes a minimum of nine countries and no veto from one of the permanent five for anything to pass and clearly we're not there yet we'll continue to follow what happens uh at the UN Security Council with you Christen Simi there for us at the UN man bashara is Al senior political analyst also following events with us here in Doha a fifth draft resolution at the UN wording veto no veto is exasperating on the Diplomatic front and for the public at large watching events unfold no matter what their position is they tend to think diplomats just can't seem to get their act together what what is the matter with the people that we elect into Power absolutely there's something deadly about it all like literally deadly U the bureaucracy and the and the extended discussions and the differences among the member states both in the UN Security Council and at the general assembly is just so frustrating and uh and even when that all said and done right either the United States is going to vet to it or it's going to be so meaningless that the United States might allow it to pass but then Israel will probably violate it and accuse Hamas of having violating it so while we could have something meaningful a bit too late but I'm not sure how effective it's going to be in the end of the day because let's all remember that uh there is no greater violator of of international law and un resolutions than Israel it has a history 50 60 years history of of uh not abiding by un resolutions including un security resolutions I mean there are resolutions from 1967 1973 uh resolution uh 247 and 338 that talk about Israel's withdrawal from occupied territories or from their occupied territories and nothing happened since so really all in all this is this is uh you know this is commendable I guess and it'll be symbolic but unless this is followed with some serious effort on the part of of the countries in the region and Beyond to render it more applicable and actionable I think it will remain to be meaningless and talking about the future can hardly be you might say formulated when they can't deal with the present and we're seeing two senior us officials in the region we've got the Secretary of State and the head of the CIA hopscotching around the Middle East listening to Regional leaders being in Regional capitals and hearing not only just the frustration but the real anger within the Middle East right now an anger that hasn't been seen for decades absolutely the thing is though soel it's this is not just a classic diplomacy this is sort of uh you know 18 19th century diplomacy because the US the United States dispatched two at the same time it dispatched its aircraft carriers and Naval um armadas to the Eastern Mediterranean and dispatch it stop foreign policy officials and CIA director to the region so this is gunboat diplomacy really more than classic diplomacy in the sense that the United States is telling its allies to be at ease notably Israel and it's putting its detractors on notice so this is this is a threat and an ultimatum to the countries in the region this is not just a friendly visitors to the region trying to advise and and be advised and and and you know take on constructive diplomatic work in the region this is gunboard diplomacy of threats and ultimatums and and and and in fact threats of war in the region and that is confronted by uh you know diplomatic anger on the parts of a good number of Arab governments and certainly the Arab streate is perhaps in the vertue of imploding in certain Arab countries looking at the much wider perhaps issues of the way diplomacy Works how much does this undermine the US's position of being you know the policemen of the world when you have countries such as China and Russia you know and growing economies that are also you might say pushing their muscle in a way that says we are more than just an economic power we are also political power we're seeing countries align themselves more so with China for example than ever before H how much of a of a fissure is there developing here you know the whole point of us involvement in the Middle East this time around was to say you know we need to end this thing we need to create some kind of a process towards a px americ and an American peace in the Middle East so that so that the United States can kind of redeploy out of the region in order to focus on China and Russia and to focus on great power politics but unfortunately the Biden Administration has boxed itself behind the netan government and the Netanyahu government is proving to be absolutely Reckless and absolutely warmongering in the in the in this in this in this issue and clearly they are embarking on genocide in Gaza and it's making the Biden Administration complicit and that apparently is threatening a wider Regional War so the same Biden Administration that promised to end the forever Wars that started decades ago in the Middle East is embarking it seems on yet another adventure with no clear consequences or end games it's maddening the way the United States has box itself in instead of being the grownup in the room and to be able sort of to manage those complicated issues and to be credible uh mediator or sponsor it boxed itself in behind Netanyahu and now it's probably going to pay the price for it we shall see what does happen for the moment Bashar there our senior political analyst thank you
