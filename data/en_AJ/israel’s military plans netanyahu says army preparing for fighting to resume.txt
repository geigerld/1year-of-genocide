for now the guns of War are quiet Israeli soldiers picnic on tanks and bask in the last of the year's fading warmth before them lie the ruins they've made of Gaza The Scorch Rubble of 48 days of Destruction but everyone knows Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli military are not finished yet this much has been said repeatedly when he visited troops in Gaza over the weekend and again on Wednesday by in the last few days I hear a question after this phase of returning our abductees will Israel return to fighting so my answer is an unequivocal yes there is no way we are not going to go back to fighting until the end this is my policy the entire cabinet stands behind it the entire government stands behind it the soldiers stand behind it and the people stand behind it everyone is making what they can of the lull gaza's dazed civilians search for for who and what has survived Hamas and the Israeli military are preparing for the fighting to come Israel's defense minister yov Galant has said that once the captive exchanges are done the war will resume as he put it with intensity and that at least two months more fighting is expected Andreas C is a defense Analyst at the school of security studies King's College London he explained to me what shape the next phase of this war might take the more int fighting is most likely just around the corner for the IDF um and so I think they would probably start seizing Gaza City overground then they will have to decide whether they will immediately shift Focus towards the South and hunas uh or whether they are going to go after the tunnels I suspect they will probably not go after the tunnels and just try to smoke them out little of this is good news for Gaza civilians 80% of gaza's population has displaced most to the South an estimated 14,000 Palestinians have been killed already the US still backs Israel but there are signs the pace of killing is making even the White House uneasy quite frankly we continue to urge and will continue to urge the Israelis as they conduct military operations to do so with the utmost care for innocent civilian life Israel knows the support it has from Western allies is waning but domestically it must show that its military objectives are being achieved anything less than destroying Hamas could be seen as failure and gaza's civilians will continue paying the price Rory Chalin Al jazer occupied East Jerusalem make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
