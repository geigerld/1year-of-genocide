a report by the charity Oxfam says Israel is blocking Aid to Gaza in spite of a ruling by the international court of justice in January the court told Israel it cannot continue to bombard displace and starve the population under its obligations to the genocide convention the Oxfam report says the International Community has failed to challenge Israel for systemically undermining Aid deliveries and that Israel has uh made bringing in Aid so dangerous and dysfunctional that agencies cannot respond to the scale of suffering let's bring in Hassan barari professor of international Affairs at Qatar University Hassan the first thing that jumps out uh to me when I read that report is once again making crystal clear that Israel with the way it's behaving with humanitarian Aid not allowing it in at the pace and volume that it is needed is in flagrant violation of international law it's not just the ruling of the international court of justice as oxan points out it's also un Security Council resolution back in December yeah well this is an indication that the Israeli government doesn't um give any attention to these yeah all the security Council or even the international law uh as long as they can't continue the war the the one they want the pace they want I mean they don't care I mean this is obvious it has been proved time and again uh that the Israelis have one strategy is to undermine the uh the aid to the Palestinians in order to bring them to the brink of famine so that they will probably leave Gaza and the the scenario put by the Israelis from the g go is to kick the Palestinians out of Gaza I think this is part of the strategy of course they deny that what what they do of course we will not come like in public say yes we want to expel the Palestinians well some have some some farri right members of the Israeli cabinet have uh I believe it was SMR who has uh who has invited I believe with the words using invited gazin to use opportunities to leave Gaza not only SM and even Gallant the Minister of Defense at the very beginning he said you know you guys can't leave no electricity no water nothing I mean he was like threatening them that you know Gaza will not be a place for you to live so this is the strategy of the of the Israelis I think we have to look at the broader image here is the demographic balance I mean probably one of the the head and agenda of the Israelis is to make the Palestinian less and L in this uh area that stretch between the Mediterranean and the river because as you know now the Palestinians are more the majority of the the Palestinians so they want to be the Israelis want to make them the minority maybe this is also uh part of broader strategy uh so um denying them food and and water sugar and flowers is also you know is to kick them out of Gaza I think this is this is a strategy I wonder what you think of the the the Convoy of trucks that we just showed so it's the second day that we see a convoy of trucks not that many we're talking about 19 yesterday 18 um sorry 12 the day before um trucks carrying flour other essential uh um essential items from Southern Gaza to the north and it's the first time in months that there haven't been any incidents because previously we've seen them be attacked pretty systematically what do you make of this is this a Band-Aid just good for Optics it's is maybe in Israel's interest to allow this or is this a blueprint perhaps for increasing Aid to the north I wouldn't see it as a blueprint I would say that it's it shows one thing that it's doable if the Israelis allow this so there's nothing can impede it other than the Israeli bombardment this one thing second it's a drop in the buet so it's really not much it won't make a huge difference the only way is to have so why is it happening why isra is you know I think they're responding a little bit to the American pressure because the Americans have been saying you know the Israeli should allow and even uh the Senate majority leaders uh he was saying you know n need to step down so I think there are a lot of pressures coming from the Americans and I this this is a way of mitigating the pressures um appearing as if Israel is doing its best in order to make their lives easier but I think this is a drop in the bucket and it would not won't make a huge difference so mostly for the Optics then in your view uh all Aid agencies say that in order to Surge Aid to the Palestinians surge Aid into Gaza there needs to be a ceasefire it so happens that ceasefire negotiations will resume today in Doha uh do you see that do you see a ceasefire as a possibility as a result of these negotiations of it is of course I mean depends on the Israelis well you say of course but we've seen them break down so many times I'm say it's a possibility but I'm not saying that's going to happen simply because the Israelis have their own conditions and they want only the first stage of the deal where whereas Hamas wants three stages so I think there a lot of disagreement among them I think if the mediators can iron out these differences and come up with a common ground probably we're going to see if a ceas fire a temporary one at least a temporary one my question is more do you do you believe in a ceasefire anytime soon because we've seen these negotiations we've seen optimism expressed sometimes by the US sometimes by qari mediators although not in a long time and then they've all broken down I can't I can't see a temporary one yes okay yeah temporary yeah of course temporary because the Israelis need to continue the war because this is also a domestic need for Netanyahu it's not only he want to defeat Hamas it's about his own political survival so putting an end to the conflict right now and have a permanency Fair would probably be the final nail in his political cff Hassan barari thank you very much for joining us in the studio this hour thank you yeah
