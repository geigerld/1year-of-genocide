right let's take a look at some of the day's other news now and Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a rare overseas trip he's in the United Arab Emirates for the first leg of a trip that includes talks with regional leaders he's expected to visit Saudi Arabia later on Wednesday and host Iranian president Ibrahim REI back in Moscow on Thursday Putin's been bolstering his Partnerships with Gulf Nations as Russia faces growing isolation uh by the West well I'm joined Now by uh alzer's diplomatic editor James Bay who's with me on set James well you can tell us more about the visit but it's it's one of the few places he can go to isn't it yeah I mean remember there's that arrest warrant for um for transferring Ukrainian children from the international criminal court and so there are many places that the Russian president wouldn't feel safe to visit he didn't feel safe to visit uh South Africa last year when he was going to go for the brics summit but these two countries he's visiting UAE and Saudi Arabia are not signatories to the Rome statute and so this is a place that he can go and he seems to be pretty delighted that he's on the ground in Abu Dhabi some of his statements talking about um the um unprecedented high level of relations between the UAE and Russia right now saying that the UAE is the main trading partner uh for Russia uh in the Arab world well remember UAE is also pretty close partner with the US so I'm not sure how this will be seen in Washington because clearly they would like other nations to be imposing sanctions on Russia and yet there's a record number of tourists and a record amount of trade going on between Russia and UAE and he's then going on to meet Iran's Ibrahim RI not in Teran though in Moscow first a trip to Saudi Arabia um which is important because I think the other part of this is OPEC and OPEC plus and oil and Saudi and Russia have been working very very uh close closely together where some other members of the OPEC plus grouping um do not have the same view but they've been trying to restrict the oil's Supply to keep the price high it's certainly something that Russia wants and Saudi Arabia uh wants at this stage but yes you're right then he goes um from Riyad back to Moscow uh to see uh the Iranian president which is somewhat odd because he could have just flown to Tran they've obviously decided he didn't want to go for to tan for some reason or other but important uh discussions there um because as you know Western Nations accuse Iran of directly supplying missiles and weapons to Russia for its War uh in Ukraine and of course also important given Iran's position um with the with the war on Gaza which will be I think an important subject of discussions in Abu Dhabi in Riyad and then in mosow when he meets the Iranian president to to what extent James is this an effort uh on the part of the Russians to sort of reconstitute Ute their foreign policy their diplomacy in the Middle East and be part of what happens next here oh I think I think it's definitely the president of Russia trying to prove that he is an international player and um you could only look at the war on Gaza despite the devastation for the people of Gaza and the bombardment in Gaza as a good thing for Russia in terms of Rehabilitation diplomatically um they can talk about that war they can talk about the US what they say is double standards uh by the US and they have long-standing role in the Middle East they're not the main player but they're part of that group the quartet that everyone forgot about um and so Russia says it wants to play a role and a much bigger role internationally James Bas diplomatic editor thank you so much
