demonstrators are on the March heading towards the United Nations attempting to keep the plate of Gaza front and center this event was organized by a coalition of 140 Community groups student groups healthc care workers socialist groups the focus of the event and the focus of many speakers at a rally proceeding this March has been the breakdown of the Health Care system in Gaza many of the speakers pointed out that uh over 300 healthcare workers have been killed in Gaza only six out of 36 hospitals are functioning right now and barely functioning at that there's a shortage of medicine a shortage of anesthesia for surgeries and many of the people who came to participate in this event told me that it was the images of children in hospitals in particular uh that drove them to come out and take part in this event I it just my heart breaks when you see an image of a child on on a table with his skin falling off and no relief for that child it's like that has to stop it has to stop now the message overall from this and from the speakers and from the participants has been for a ceasefire a ceasefire now and they are carrying that message throughout the streets of the city uh to various locations today and I should point out that this is actually only one of uh a few events that are planned in New York City alone today in New York City Christ salumi Al jaaz make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
