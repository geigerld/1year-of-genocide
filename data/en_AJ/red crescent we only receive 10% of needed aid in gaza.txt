far is a spokesperson for Palestine red Cresent Society she joins us live from rala good to have you with us so first of all let's start with some of the most pressing needs right now seem to be simply finding something to eat tell us what people are facing in terms of finding food right now in Gaza good evening Sammy thanks for having me we at the palestin red crescent are extremely worried regarding the Israeli evacuation orders for Palestinian in Hanes where should people go there is nowhere left there is no safe place RAF already in RAF there is no room for everyone and shelters are already packed the situation is extremely dangerous in hunis there is a ongoing shelling that is happening all the night and there's thousands of people who are still there who who don't have any place to go to yesterday thousands of Palestinians who are taking shelter inside the Palestine red Cresent at Chu inun they have left towards RAF while at the same time thousands others came in to take their places I spoke to one of my colleague who his family still there in the Palestine atq in Kan yunes and he said despite the dangerous his family are not going to go to rafah because they don't have any place to go to and that means they gonna stay in streets another colleague he has already evacuated from his home in Gaza at the beginning of the escalation and he is now with his brother home they have packed up everything but they haven't left yet because they don't have anywhere to go to and they only wish to stay safe wherever they are as for the humanitarian needs every single place in Gaza every Palestinian now over 2 million civilians are lacking food water and everything they don't have access to nothing and now in Rafa even the situation is just worsening being a Palestinian means that you have to choose now between the Bad and the worst impossible decisions are being taken by all of Palestinians because simply they don't have any other solution or choice to take do we have any idea how many people right now have headed towards RAF it seems to be the focal point for a lot of displaced Palestinians do you have any idea how many people are are living rough there so basically as I mentioned thousands have already fled from hanun towards RAF but at the same time thousands others are still there in hanun they don't have any option to go they don't have family members to go uh to be with them and as I mentioned shelters are already packed and there's no uh way or no space left for anyone on top of that many people they will have they will be in streets because there is no space left and everyone is lacking food water and everything as you know the Palestine red crescent is even receiving the humanitarian Aid via Rafa Crossing uh border from the Egyptian red crescent our teams are still working to receive Aid however since the beginning of the escalation and up to this moment what we have received is the is is barely a 10% of the needs it doesn't scratching the surface what we have if I can jump in if you're getting only 10% of people's needs how long is it before perhaps we start seeing starvation people dying from from lack of food do you have a timetable it is it is one of the major concerns now literally people if they are are not going to die from the Shilling and the bombardment Palestinians will be died because of hunger now it's a huge struggle for every Palestinian to have food for his family and children none of the families even have days weeks I don't have accurate estimation regarding the situation but from what we see on the ground most Palestinians now are struggling even to have a one meal with very basic things it's just a miracle to have food for your children and your family and as I said it's just something really hard even the internal Market the market after over two month of continuous escalation and the blockade on Gaza and only just very minimum humanarian Aid is getting in so the internal Market is almost empty when you go to any grocery store or whatsoever what you can find it is only empty shelves the only thing that is available is like some vegetables and because of the situation prices have went so much high so even people can't afford buying vegetables or what is available because they have been for over two months with with no work with no money with no salary or whatsoever taken into consideration that most Palestinians in Gaza are working on a daily basis all right we'll leave it there thanks so muchal far
