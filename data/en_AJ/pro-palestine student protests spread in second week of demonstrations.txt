well we have a team of correspondents covering this story for us in the US in a moment we'll be live in Atlanta with Phil LEL but first to John henin who's at the City University of uh New York so John what's the situation there at the moment tell us what's happening well after more than a week of this there's a sense of normaly like you would have at say a refugee camp if you look around uh all of these tents remain those are where people live and sleep by day and then if you look over on the other side um behind this Monument here uh you've got speakers one after the other Who come out and sort of encourage people remind them why they're here uh and the entire time they're trying to make sure the police don't come in and sweep this all away and the rules are different at each camp we went to Princeton University earlier today they tried to play by the rules there they didn't put up 10 uh they wore masks because they were worried about being identified they don't want to be kicked out um and they didn't use microphones because that's against University rules but here and at most other camps they simply don't play by the University's rules and that's kind of the point of an occupation earlier we spoke to Linda sarur she is a well-known Palestinian American uh uh speaker and she had a lot to say about what she thought about what these students are accomplishing here's a sample these young people are reaffirming and demonstrating that the tide is shifting on Palestine that the Palestinian people have solidarity not just across the United States of America but across the world and these young people stand in a long tradition of student activism against the war in Vietnam against South African apartheid and now for freedom and justice for the Palestinian people so we had 100 students arrested at nor Eastern University at hundreds over the past week or so I was at the January 6th protest I didn't see anybody get arrested there do you think there's a double standard here they're absolutely is double standard in American law enforcement and also uh with these University presidents I mean we are watching young people here who are engaging and safe and peaceful protesting they are young people that you don't even have to agree with but they live in America in a democracy and they have every right to freedom of speech and they are being brutalized by law enforcement who could be using their time for something else and in fact the fact that we are suppressing young people across this country only further emboldens them and continues these types of encampments and work for justice for Palestine do you have any idea why not one major university president is supporting these students and these demonstrations unfortunately the way the university system is set up it they are beholden to their donors um instead of being loyal to their students the students are what make these universities universities are supposed to be a place where we have an exchange of ideas where we hear multiple perspectives that we decide where we want and what position we want to take and the universities have demonstrated that they have taken a side and it is the side of genocide the side of occupation and these young people are rejecting that because they don't want that to reflect their values which are equity and Justice and freedom for all so this has become the rhythm of daily life here um and they live at risk of arrest at all times uh about a 100 people uh were arrested in the in the past 24 hours there have been over 650 people arrested over the past week or so but when that happens and when they clear out these camps the students simply rebuild in the same place as they have at Columbia and New York University or they build elsewhere as we saw earlier at Princeton John hin thanks very much for that well meanwhile Phil LEL is at Emory University in Atlanta Phil describe the scene in the at osphere there at the moment well I would say it's less protest and for one of a better word it's more Festival like at the moment I mean just 30 seconds ago we had Bob Marley we had Stevie Wonder playing there people here with their dogs it's very much a positive uh Gathering and that's very much by Design the organizers have very publicly said on social media you know bring a blanket bring some food bring something to drink uh and just make your presence known this is not something where they want the police to be involved they don't want any arrests they want people to be here in a positive way uh projecting their thoughts to the people of Gaza and doing what they can in any way to help so that would be a complete contrast to what we saw on Thursday of course in exactly the same location where we saw those officers from Emory police from Atlanta police state troopers here uh arresting some 28 people including students and faculty members uh professors uh one Professor for example was taken into custody as well so a complete difference and there is a very small police presence I mean it's very hard to SWOT a police officer here at the moment uh you really have to look hard because they are very much keeping their distance and we're told by organizers that they've been given until midnight before there's any kind of police action to take place I'm going to talk now to a graduate student NE Patel um nether Your Role here is I guess less organizer and more like a liaison role between the students and the university how's that been going it's been going really well um so I'm currently president of our graduate student body and it's just been so nice to see all of our students who I've worked so closely with this year come together we've got our like Med students who set up a first aid kit our law students have uh showed up as legal observers and the community is really just coming together um to Rally in support of each other so how are they feeling after Thursday I mean Thursday was quite a traumatic experience for a lot of people yeah I I myself was actually here Thursday morning when it all went down and it was it was absolutely traumatizing um it was terrifying but again it doesn't compare to what people in guaza are facing right now and we all recognize that and we've come back together to reshare shft the the idea to what we want is for emry to commit to a full divestment of Israeli aparti and cop City here in Atlanta and that's what we want the focus on how do you sort of realistically see it playing out because term ends quite quite soon the protesters say we're going to be here every day come rain or shine no matter what it sounds like the University's got no um it's not planning on changing its position so who blinks first I think the university is going to have to um this is not just something that students decided Thursday morning this something we've been asking from the University since October um and divestment efforts on this campus go back to South African apartheid so this is not new at all and I think it's time that the university starts to listen because them not listening is really what's causing harm to our community all right n Patel thanks very much well speaking of the University's position the president of the University Greg fenver he is the man who on Thursday defended the police being here he said that the protests were largely organized by outside influences and he's been facing a lot of Demands for him to go in fact on Friday uh one faculty held uh vote for a motion of no of no confidence in him at the moment he's not signaling that he's going anywhere but his position is to according to a lot of people here looking increasingly untenable so it's obviously having ramifications closer to home as well as the wider issue highlighting what's happening in the Middle East at em University in Atlanta for us there Phil thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from algera
