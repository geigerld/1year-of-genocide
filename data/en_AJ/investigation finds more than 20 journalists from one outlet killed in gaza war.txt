the Israeli military has denied targeting journalists working for media organizations based in Gaza that follows an investigation by the UK's Guardian newspaper that says some members appear to have been considered journalists working for media Outlets controlled or affiliated with Hamas as legitimate military targets It quotes a senior Israeli spokesperson stating the Army does not distinguish between working for the media outlet and belonging to hamas's Armed Wing the Israeli military denies the allegations the committee to protect journalist says at least 103 Palestinian journalists and media workers have been killed since Israel's War Began nearly 30% worked for Outlets linked to Hamas journalists working in Conflict areas are protected under International humanitarian law well let's bring in hamda Salud for more on this hamda is joining us live from Aman Jordan because Israel government has banned Al jazer from reporting from there Walkers through the investigation first hamai the comments and backtrack of the Israeli military well this all began when the guardian began investigating essentially a gray area that the Israeli military has when targeting Palestinian journalists in the Gaza Strip working for Outlets that are based there now it came after a senior person who was a spokesperson for the Israeli military said essentially there is no difference between working for a media outlet that is affiliated with Hamas and being a fighter in the alasam brigades meaning that he went on to elaborate that there is no differentiation for the Israeli military between hamas's polit political and Military Wing now this then prompted the Israeli military to release a correction and a retraction saying that these are not the official standards of the Israeli military and they do not Target civilian objects but it is worth mentioning that the reality on the ground has shown a much different story as part of this investigation it found that at least 23 members of the AL AA media network based in Gaza were killed now the Israeli military as part of their statement gave the guardian a list of six journalists that had been killed and said they were quote members of Hamas without providing any sort of information or intelligence saying that this was based on their findings but not providing that proof this is a pattern we've seen from the Israeli military accusing journalists of being fighters in Palestinian organizations but without providing any sort of proof or evidence to those claims right and Israel's Army has maintained their position hamda from the beginning of the war that they do not intentionally Target journalists but more than 150 journalists and media workers have been killed in the conflict so far what is their justification for this 152 journalists and media workers have been killed since the beginning of this conflict it is the deadliest conflict to four journalists in in history and the Israeli military has never once given an admission of an unlawful killing of a Palestinian civilian or even a journalist they maintain that they go after Hamas targets Hamas sites but when they are on the ground targeting these densely populated areas journalists included now some legal experts say that perhaps this is part of Israel's strategy to remove the Palestinian journalists who are there to not bring us the stories on the ground that we see every day as we know foreign journalists are not allowed into the Gaza Strip unless it is through Israeli Army imeds where they control what the media sees they're not allowed to go on their own into Gaza so this is something that is still of the conversation but the Israeli Army maintains that they are not targeting journalists but again this is the deadliest Conflict for journalists indeed H thank you very much that's hamda salut live there in a man Jordan because again the Israeli government has banned Al jaaz from operating in Israel make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
