human rights groups have accused Israeli forces of using the chemical white phosphorus in Gaza and Lebanon Amnesty International says it's verified videos showing white phosphorus artillery shells being fired by the Israeli Army into civilian areas in Gaza its use in densely populated areas is considered a war crime white phosphorus is used as a smoke screen or as a weapon it ignites when exposed to air and it can burn through flesh causing horrific deformities we're going to bring in Donatella rera she's Amnesty International senior crisis advisor and she investigates war crimes and human rights abuses she's joining us now from Dhaka thank you very much indeed for being with us um how do you gather the evidence for this first of all uh with the verified videos and uh still images uh showing the Israeli positions located just north of the Gaza Strip um near theot where um we saw um in images taken by um G photographer um Israeli military position with a hitzer a 109 hitzer uh that fires 155 uh millim shells artillery shells um and with uh artillery shells containing white phosphorus uh uh at the ready and at the same time we've verified videos showing uh artillery shells um being air bursted with white phosphorus uh over Gaza City in at least two uh different locations now the Israeli military may say that um although they haven't commented on this that they would be using it as um uh as a smoke screen for example which is one of the uses it it can be put to what is your interpretation of the pictures that makes you think that it was actually be used being used in a different fashion um of course uh white phosphorus uh can and is often used as a smoke screen but that is um uh a use for the battlefield and uh not for areas that are populated by civilians densely populated with civilian the Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated territories in the world so uh white phosphorus should not be used uh in the gasa strip where there are uh so many civilians uh and and this is the areas where we veryify the videos in Gaza City um the harbor area and the zun neighborhood uh these are areas that were full of civilians so we're not talking about some uh locations which are a battlefield devoid of Civilian population do you have any evidence uh to suggest that anybody has actually been harmed by this uh we do not at the moment and we have not suggested that we do uh we note of course that the medical facilities are under terrible strain uh and so we you know we have not heard of of any civilians having been harmed at this stage um the fact with white phosphorus though and we saw that very clearly when white phosphorus was used with devastating effects previously in the 2008 2009 uh conflict when it was used it took sometimes for for doctors to recognize the burns as having been from white phosphorus because at the time the Israeli authorities were denying having used it in the meantime patients died white phosphorus can remain alive um hidden under soil or Rubble basically it it burns at a very high temperature when it comes into contact with air so um I myself so in Gaza at the time um white phosphorous soaked wedges that had been um airburst from artillery by Israeli forces into Gaza that were hidden under sand under soil and then uh children and and other passers by kicked them accidentally as they passed days and even weeks after and of course as soon as those came into contact with air they reignited and that's how people got burned I understand amnesty is continuing to collect evidence of this what do you want to be done with the evidence that you've brought pulled together well this is just one of the one of the uh concerns one of the violations that we are uh investigating um you know we're investigating uh indiscriminate bombardments that are continuing to kill uh civilians in very large numbers uh entire families are being uh killed um by bombardments on their homes uh where the inhabitants of those homes and the neighbors are killed and injured in very large numbers uh and so this is uh you know part of the evidence that we are collecting of course the first uh and most important and most crucial steps that needs to be taken is that such attacks that are so disproportionate and indiscriminating nature must stop immediately because the number of victims every day is is enormous and and secondly uh of course those who are responsible for committing violations of international humanitarian law some of which amount to war crimes should be held accountable Donatella rera is amnesty International's senior crisis advisor we appreciate you being with us on Al M thank you very much indeed for your time thank you
