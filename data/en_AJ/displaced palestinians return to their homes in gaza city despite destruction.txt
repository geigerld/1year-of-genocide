for many their home is more than just a place it is a testament to their identity and resilence the land carries generational ties memories and a sense of belonging that is not easily relink I stay here because my soul is tied to this land my father passed away here especially after what happened in 1948 when they told refugees to go promising they would return in a matter of days they never did even after more than 75 years we were born and raised here we will live and die here Palestine will remain our land this North is our North despite all the bombings flyers and attempts to displace us we will stay steadfast here resilient despite the siege and famine and everything that has happened we will pitch our tents and stay here despite the hardships because This Land is Our Land for money the sentiment of having nowhere else to go is not just an emotional declaration but a stark reality choices are severely limited by the lack of resources many families live in poverty their financial means insufficient to facilitate even re relocation humanitarian aid though critical often Folds short of meeting the basic needs of the population this economic straight jacket forces families to remain in their homes despite the danger make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
