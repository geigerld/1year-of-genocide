it's 13 GMT that is 4 P.M in Gaza there's been no letup in Israel's bombing campaign the Gaza Health Ministry says at least 700 Palestinians have been killed in the past 24 hours and the humanitarian crisis is growing in central Gaza Israeli air strikes have targeted a market in the nerat refugee camp dozens of people have reportedly been killed and injured it was the only Market left for people to buy supplies in the north power has been restored to the Indonesian Hospital which went dark after running out of fuel but the ministry has warned that a total collapse of the health system is imminent and more Palestinians have been killed in overnight air strikes on the jabalia and ashati refugee camps authorities say many of the casualties there are women and children since the War Began on October the 7th nearly 5,800 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza according to the health Ministry it says Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank have killed 96 Palestinians there in the past two weeks and in Israel the government says more than 1,400 Israelis were killed in hamas's military operation AET B begins our coverage the moment an Israeli strike hits near alifa Hospital in Gaza City staff rushed to help the injured carrying them on stretches to the already overcrowded Hospital there's been no letup in Israel's bombardment and no end to the screams and cries that follow some are people calling for help others are grieving the realization that in an instant loved ones have been killed then there's a frantic attempt to leave before another strike but there's nowhere to go first we took shelter in the mosque we received a warning from the Israelis that it will be shelled then we gathered in one of our extended fam's home we received another warning with instructions to head south as we headed to the South the bombardment continued so we decided to go back and if we die we die at home hospitals are running out of medication and fuel to operate the generators putting babies in incubators and ICU patients at risk and they are at full capacity two to a bed patients in corridors some even treated on the floor Palestinians are desperate for Aid nowhere near enough has been allowed in the destruction is immense and Palestinian families who have been displaced time and time again now find themselves once more without homes Assad bag Al jazer let's get the very latest now from the Gaza Strip hany Abu Isa is standing by for us in KH yunas first though we'll go to yumna as in Gaza City outside alifa Hospital uh yumna a spokesperson for gaza's health Ministry told one of our teams that hospitals have now run out of everything and can no longer treat the injured you're at alifa which is the largest hospital in the Gaza Strip what are you seeing well what I can see here syel is that the shipa hospital is going into a really an overwhelming situation where the entire Hospital from the inside uh we're talking about receptions we're talking about corridors and we're talking about uh definitely all the Departments and rooms of the hospital they're completely packed with patient what the hosp with patients what the hospital has done in these few several hours is that they have uh uh tried to clean up this area here which is in the front yard of the hospital and as you can see every now and then we are receiving the hospital is receiving uh injuries and casualties but the hospital here has told us clearly that it has completely run out of everything including fuel medications medical supplies and all they have is a hospital fully packed with injuries and a teams and medical teams that are completely worn out and overwhelmed by the amount of injuries that are coming every now and then the hospital is running some of the Departments that are still operating on solar energy panels it's also using uh some of the private fuel that it was able to bring from other private uh sectors here and uh and uh uh Distributors these were the last sources of fuel for the hospitals in the Gaza Strip leading to a lifethreatening situation for over 130 premature children in their incubators and over 120 patients in the ICU units who are now threatened to lose their lives once these two sections are completely out of power yumna were you able to find out whether alifa any ever received any of the Medical Aid that was brought in over the last two three days well the there were a lot of news about this issue really uh the Red Cross was saying that yes they're going to be Distributing the uh uh medications on all uh hospitals but then and also the they said that the the hospitals will be getting the Medical Aid through the Ministry of Health but what a shifa hospital itself has confirmed for us is that until now they have not received any of the medications uh from the aid that has entered the Gaza Strip a shifa hospital was running and operating by the supplies that it already had and were in its stores and now they have completely run out of any supplies stored and waiting for any Aid they can get thank you very much that's yumna reporting from Al shifa Hospital the largest in the Gaza Strip that's in Gaza City in the north of the strip I want to go now to the south of the strip Han Abu isba was standing by you're in kanun again in the south are you able to make out where Israeli bombardments are happening in the strip at the moment yes well the Israeli a strikes continue to pound the southern part of the Gaza Strip really intense 24 hours have been the bloodiest since the beginning of the Israeli military uh attacks on the Gaza Strip the worst of these attacks happened during the midday in the central part of Gaza Strip but Camp uh the the close toat market near to a relatively large shopping mall a residential home was targeted and completely destroyed uh and in addition to the causing so much damage to the shopping mall next to it leaving uh at least 20 people uh killed and tens of other people in seriously injured now this is the only Market left in the central area for people uh to uh to buy their their their food uh I mean without the market it will be very difficult for people in that area to find Food Supplies it's important to uh mention that theat camp is is a very busy area and after people were ordered to evacuate the northern part and Gaza Strip it even become more busy with large number of people Evac evacuated uh to it earlier this morning in the city of RA particularly two densely populated neighborhoods Al Jan neighborhoods and T sulan A group of residential homes were targeted and destroyed completely without warning and people were inside uh so far we're talking about uh close to 55 people have been killed but with more people under the rubbles the number is expected uh to to to rise up uh as we speak there are still air strikes going on covering the entire Gaza Strip from the northern part of Gaza namely the city of bhuna borderline City all the way to the South uh to Rafa City and honey is there any Aid left from the few trucks that did make it into Gaza over the past 3 days it was 54 trucks total any Aid left from that well we we so far we know the the the trucks the humanitarian a trucks have been allowed into the Gaza Strip but there is a dispute over uh the mechanism and the process uh it's going to uh be taken in order to deliver those Aid uh with the statement coming from the Ministry of Health that the entire Health System uh collapsed in in all of the hospitals across the Gaza Strip is a proof that none of the aid it makes it to these Hospital particularly two large health facility aifa hospital complex in in Gaza City and the one I'm reporting from Naser Hospital uh we're waiting for a statement from the hospit ner Hospital Administration about the serious lack of medical supplies and materials needed for immediate medical intervention to save lives we did walk in the corridors of the hospital and uh it just the scenes are heartbreaking horrific and you just make you you can easily jump to a conclusion that the system is already collapsing there evacuates inside the corridors of the hospital taking it as a shelter in addition to fully packed rooms with patients yeah absolutely and we got details on that uh from yumna who was reporting from Al shifa Hospital in Gaza City just moments ago Han abua thank you very much for the very latest there from hunis
