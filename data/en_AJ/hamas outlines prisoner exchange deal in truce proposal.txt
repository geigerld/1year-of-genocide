let's bring in villm Marx he's live for us and occupied East Jerusalem so villm firstly what more do we know about hamas's latest proposal well Elizabeth Reuters the news agency has been reporting on a version of the proposals that they say they've seen and essentially it splits the offer the requirements into two stages Hamas saying that they would be willing to release the women children elderly those who are unwell from inside guard as well as female Israeli soldiers that have been held captive there for 5 months or so now they've said the second stage would involve discussions around a deadline both for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza as well as a permanent ceasefire and they said at that point all remaining detainees on both sides would be released that first stage where some of the captives inside guards would be released in return for 700 to 1,000 Palestinian prisoners so that's what Reuters have seen in proposal I've reached out to half a dozen officials from Hamas this morning trying to get more details on top of that I've not yet heard a response from them the Israeli government the prime minister's office released a statement saying that quote uh this was Hamas continuing to hold to unrealistic demands but they did say that both the war cabinet and the slightly larger security cabinet would be meeting today to discuss those proposals okay Wellman as efforts continue to find a ceasefire agreement so too do the killings of Palestinians what is Israel saying about the latest deaths of people waiting for food at the Kuwait intersection in Gaza so the Ministry of Health in Gaza reported that 21 individuals have died 155 were injured during what they say was Israeli military gunfire directed at people waiting for Aid trucks at a roundabout in Northern Gaza the Israeli military this morning with a statement to us saying that the reports that they attack dozens of Garin at an a dist distribution Point are false they said they are assessing the incident quote with the thoroughness that it deserves okay and William you're near one of the entrances to Islam's third holiest site for the first Friday prayers since the Muslim holy month of Ramadan began what is the situation there in terms of security and [Music] restrictions so right now it's as you can probably hear around me relatively calm it's several hours until the main prayers will begin the Israeli authorities say that there are 3,000 police officers available in The Old City for days such as this we have seen several checkpoints involving Israeli police getting up to where we are here there are no restrictions theoretically on people from occupied East Jerusalem or Palestinians inside Israel from coming here to pray but there are age restrictions on those traveling from the occupied West Bank other than those age restrictions they also have to apply in advance for permit to come here they have to travel through checkpoints after 4:00 a.m. this morning they have to be back in the West Bank by 5:00 p.m. we've been talking to people over the last hour or so coming here successfully from nablas from Bethlehem from Janine but telling us just in the last few minutes that there are many other people trying to cross the checkpoints from the occupied West Bank who are either being delayed for long periods of time or being turned away Willam thank you very much for that for now that is Will marks joining us live from occupied East Jerusalem
