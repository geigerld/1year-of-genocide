now Israeli forces have carried out air strikes in towns in southern Lebanon the Army released this video showing blasts from their fighter jets among the targets was Hezbollah infrastructure and a military post it comes ahead of hezbollah's leader Hassan Nala's televised address which will take place later this Friday let's go to Hena who joins us now live from Beirut firstly Zena bring us up to date on these latest Israeli strikes on the border well the cycle of violence continues along Lebanon and Israel's border it is entering its fourth month Israel carrying out a series of air strikes targeting what the Israeli Army says are as well as military infrastructure Fighters launch sites uh but as of late Israel really has been stepping up its attacks the intensification of the conflict if you like the frequency yes it's still confined largely um along the 120 km border 4 to 5 km deep on on each side of the Border but what Israel is trying to do is put pressure on the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah it wants Hezbollah to pull back because it believes that is the only way the tens of thousands of Israelis can return to their homes in Northern Israel when the conflict started when Hezbollah joined the battle against Israel to help relieve its Ally Hamas in Gaza tens of thousands of Israelis were evacuated from that area so what Israel wants to do now is restore security Hezbollah is refusing to do that it says that it will not discuss anything along the border until the attacks Israel's attacks on on Gaza stop now the United States and other Western countries have been trying to reduce tensions along the border to try to ensure that the conflict does not widen or expand but undoubtedly we have seen in recent weeks a gradual escalation along that border and Zena interestingly we are expecting a speech from the uh head of Hezbollah Hassan nasah in the next few hours this comes just two days after he made another significant speech uh what is the feeling about what he's expected to say yes in just under two hours the second speech since hamas's number two and hamas's highest official in Lebanon Al aruri was assassinated in what was believed to be an Israeli strike in Beirut Southern suburbs in the heart of hezbollah's stronghold on Wednesday uh nasella called that a crime and said that it will not go unpunished promising retaliation but he also said that uh you know the the the conflict along the border will continue to remain calculated he said yes Hezbollah is ready uh you know if Israel were to launch a full scale assault Hezbollah will you know fight back with no limits with no restraints but on Wednesday he said that he would be providing more details about um you know the state of play if you like in the South that he would be addressing the families of those who have been killed the people who have been displaced the latest figure show nearly 880,000 people who live in southern Lebanon have been displaced from their homes so maybe this speech will be more for the domestic audience the supporters of Hezbollah and just the general public in Lebanon to explain you know hezbollah's limited engagement because it is costly for this country in terms of people being displaced their livelihoods Hezbollah has lost more than 140 men so in the next in less than two hours we are going to hear from him and you know he's likely to explain more about hezbollah's role in this ongoing conflict Z there in Beirut thank you
