we'll bring in our senior political analyst mwan Bashar joining us here in the studio so obviously I mean Algeria will be hugely disappointed being the ones that put forward this draft resolution mwan but on the point um about the US this resolution was really widely supported by all UN members so does this move the US vetoing the resolution isolated even more at the UN oh yes absolutely I think generally speaking the United States has grown more isolated around the world including after Ukraine but nowhere is it as isolated as it is on the question of Palestine because at the end of the day the United States is still a prosperous leader in the world it's a mighty country it's a rich country and uh you know with with tens of bases all over the world it's it's just it's present and it's popular in many countries when it comes to Palestine it has brought on itself isolation in order to be at the service of Israel and in this case at the service of an Israeli government that is basically genocidal that's fanatic that's Neo fascist that Biden himself is demanding that this government changes and at the same time he goes on the United Nations and defends this government and shoots down a very simple and Noble idea which is the right of self-determination the inable right of s of a people now it was what it has has become Petty when the United States you look at at the 193 countries around the world and you say the Palestinians that helped establish different countries in the Middle East itself the Palestinians who are some of the most educated people in the world with the highest literacy the Palestinians who were able to build a society and an authority under occupation those Palestinians are not ready to have a state really so the justification for the American decision is just false and transparently so now there is this understanding that the Americans tried to push quite strongly that they support the idea the principle the vision of a Palestinian state but this is not the time but as the Palestinians have been saying again and again when is the time I mean since 1993 the Americans have been making the Palestinians and the Arabs promises that they never fulfill for three decades the United States supervised sponsored a peace process between Palestinians isans and it always took the Israel's line it was the Israeli lawyer the Israel advocate in the negotiations and now once again it insists that it's only the United States that can bring about a two solution and peace in the Middle East except this time they want to they want to have more Arab countries pay higher price in order for Israel to be satisfied this genocidal Israel should be rewarded for its genocide with more recognition more Aid more sponsorship more arms and more diplomatic protection this doesn't make sense for much of the International Community and for those people who are voting today 12 of them I mean how do you explain what sheab was just talking about a moment ago when he was saying that the US was actually threatening to pull the funding from the United Nations if this vote were to go ahead why is this so concerning for the US what worries them about this it's the thing uh that has to do when it comes to do with Israel in the Middle East as I was mentioning earlier it's my way or the highway that's the United States and its PX American in the Middle East so when it comes to its interest and Israel's interest things have to be done the American way otherwise the United States will veto wherever the resolution a and will send armadas to the east Mediterranean and will in fact get involved in yet another war or at least in a military campaign as we've just scene few days ago when they got involved militarily in the Middle East in defense of Israel I mean suddenly the United States also dragging along the UK and France and so on so forth the old Imperial Powers the Old Colonial powers are back in the middle east fighting for whom for what why now so it's this this this idea this phrase this American phrase you know it's called inside baseball my way or the highway basically says either I run the show or no one's going to run the show either I will be managing the party or I'll be the party pooper basically and that's what happens at the United Nation now why is this at at this critical moment why is this important and why it is reckless on the part of the United States it's because the support for Palestine is across the board around the world in the world societies and among the world governments the governments who don't dare it's just because they've been strong armed by the United States the absolute majority of people and countries the unit in the in the world today support the pales in fact the Palestinian cause has never been popular around the world just when Palestine itself has been suffering more than ever before in its history just look at what's happening in Gaza in the West Bank in Jerusalem and so on so forth so uh what are we to make of then the numbers that we saw today is it significant that we had countries like France for example vote in favor of this resolution oh absolutely absolutely as we've heard from our correspondent the fact that a good number of countries now who usually abstain voted for tells you that the UN Security Council is the terror Council in the words of the Israeli Ambassador and by the way because we we you know we broadcast this we are responsible as Al jazer we broadcast this stuff and sometimes or not sometimes a lot of times politicians lie right I mean they lie for their countries especially with diplomats that's what they do their job is to sometimes lie for their country but not one thing the Israeli Ambassador said today was correct not one thing factually and otherwise everything from how countries become independent how countries became accepted in International Community how Israel became accepted as a member of the community after it committed Terror and genocide in Palestine in 1947 to 19 49 it was accepted as a member it wasn't just doing some Terror actions here and there it was committing genocide in Palestine and it yet it was recognized as a member of the United Nations most of the countries in the South who gained their independence from Colonial Powers did so but with the use of force only a few gained their independence peacefully because the Imperial Powers decide to be you know this it's time to go so everything he was saying to day was just humbug total BS but it passed but be that as it may Israel is totally isolated like the United States is totally isolated and apparently con isolation is a bit contagious between Israel and the United States what you worry about here is that the United States is too important of a country around the world it is too important of a country it is a superpower and it does have a huge role to play in the Middle East and it is sad it's a sad day when the Biden Administration boxes itself in behind the Nan government vetos again in the United Nations security Council when the United States supposed to be leading the way for a true peace based on the recognition of Palestinian rights for self-determination all right Maran thank you so much well make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from
