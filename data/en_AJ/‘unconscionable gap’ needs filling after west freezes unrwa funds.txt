well the head of the agency that's Philip lazarini says the move is more Collective punishment inflicted on the people of Gaza in a statement and mentioned the ruling by the international court of justice ordering Israel to take immediate action to make sure that Palestinians have their basic needs met it warned that that is only possible if unua as the largest Aid agency in Gaza is allowed to do its work Israel has said it wants to get rid of from the Gaza Strip the agency said it would be immensely irresponsible to sanction it for the alleged actions of a small number of its staff especially at a time when so many people are displaced and are in desperate need of help let's take this on I'm pleased to say we have Chris gunnis who's a former spokesman who joins us on Skype from London and Chris before we get into this briefly I just want to try and understand how inw funding works because it is funded almost entirely by voluntary contrib butions from UN member countries so when Nations say they are temporarily pausing additional funding what exactly does that mean additional to what does it does it mean that all funding is paused well it means that the humanitarian work which is the work that's immediately been done in Gaza as the commissioner General pH has made perfectly clear is now under threat unra is saying that it has funding to deliver these life-saving services for just a matter of weeks perhaps a month after which the food distributions the medical the fuel the water all of the housing that unra has been given to a million displaced people in its shelters across the G strip all of that is under threat but perhaps more important in terms of the funding what we're actually seeing is a coordinated political attack on unra the Israelis have made clear Israeli former official has actually said that we cannot we being the Israelis cannot win the war in Gaza unless unra is disbanded so you know what clearer signal do you want so the volun contributions as you say they have to be increased massively my message to the Arab world is particularly the gulf is where are you because they're making billions all the time each day on oil revenues a tiny fraction of those oil revenues would see unr's financial problems disappear overnight and this unconscionable Gap in fing which has been inflicted by these Western governments that would be filled very very quickly so yes the funding is desperate yes humanitarian services are under threat some of the most desperate people in the Middle East are now facing starvation they're facing famine and the Arab states need to step up the plate so tell us Chris if you would what unra funding actually does what does it provide and what would the will the impact be of you know within a month as you say those major funders uh withdrawing their contributions what would the impact be it's a matter of life and death is it yes well put simply um and very simply there are two main funding streams in unra there are the core Services the core budget um and that goes mainly to a huge education department unra educates over half a million children across the Middle East Syria Jordan the West Bank um Gaza um so there five of those fields in Lebanon um so don't just think of unra as being in Gaza unra is providing these life- saving and humanitarian human development services across the Middle East but then there's the emergency budget so you know anra is doing these core Services which in times of Peace it can get on with but then suddenly there's an emergency like we've got today in Gaza Andra has basically to carry on trying to maintain these core Services which is a huge responsibility in and of itself while suddenly having to deal with all these other these other problems I say problems I mean there's a an a genocide taking place um in Gaza so that that's the real problem for onra that in times of Peace its core Services would be you know ticking over although under real Financial strain but it keeps having to turn its hand to deal with these emergency situations as we're now seeing in Gaza and that's the real problem for the agency but to make clear this isn't a funding crisis this is an existential crisis brought on by a coordinated political attack being driven by Israel make no mistake about that all right I'll come on to that in a sec but when you say it's not a funding crisis so I'm a bit confused within a month won't be that serious F crisis but fueled by political considerations right okay so Israel as you know says un perpetuates the refugee crisis obstructs peace and serves as a civilian arm of Hamas what do you say to that a state which is waging what the icj is and it says is a suspected genocide for that government that state to accuse unra a h agency of perpetuating the conflict seems somewhat problematic to accept um but let let's let's be clear about this um that accusation is part of an Israeli dream that by getting rid of unra you will suddenly get rid of the Palestine the 6 million Palestine refugees we serve that is not true what perpetuates this Refuge problem is the lack of the parties particularly Israeli obstructionism to allow the Palestinians to have their own State because let's be clear the Palestine Refugee problem un's mandated responsibilities towards these people is grounded in that problem that would go away if the refugees are granted all of their rights within the context of a two-state solution all of those rights including the right of return all of those would be resolved if we could move towards a just and durable solution in the context I don't know whether people want to say one state two State no States take your pick but it's got to be a durable solution at that point when the Israelis in particular but also the Palestinians get together and resolve the overall crisis the Palestine Refugee problem will be resolved in the context of that that is when they will be given a just and durable solution and at that point unra can pack up its bags and go it is the lack of that Solution that's perpetuating the crisis not anything to do with onra Chris we'll leave it there thanks for that Chris gunnes former and Royal spokesman thank you
