well Majed alans is the spokesperson for qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs he told Al jazer that Qatar hopes to see the ceasefire extended further as the provision in the original agreement suggests 10 uh hostages will be released every day and that would translate into an extra day of pass so we have from Hamas confirmation now that 20 extra hostages will be released in the next two days and on the Palestinian side that would mean that uh from Israeli jails you'll have threefold of that number so 60 Palestinians will be released from Israeli prisons and the same parameters of the agreement that applied and these four days will continue when it comes to humanitarian Aid and the PA in uh in the fighting it is a very hopeful moment for us that we can build on that momentum to increase the number of hostages being released but also to uh prepare the ground for more sustainable truth through the negotiations that are taking place as we have seen we began this mediation process here in uh in Doha right after the 7th of of October and we have made a lot of accomplishments starting from then we've moved from a point where there was absolutely no chance for mediation where there is there was a refusal for mediation to both parties now every day agreeing on the list and having hostages being released daily and we have reached a stop of fighting that is going to extend into uh almost a week uh now and I think we have to build on uh on that to make sure that we move forward obviously we are working with what we have the conditions of the negotiations are not uh positive conditions although the commitments we have received over this agreement are very are very positive and the implementation as we have seen although very difficult and at times it was a bit delicate but we were able to uh Mo through the agreement the four days and extend it now for these two days the team working here from Doha in the operations room has been working day and night nonstop relentlessly to make sure that we have this momentum and we build upon it and I'm quite sure that the team will have more work to do now as we H go on to these two extra days well Iman Khan joins us live now from occupied East Jerusalem Imran so what more can you tell us then about this latest Israeli captive release and of course this possible extension to the ceasefire well the captive release eventually went very smoothly that may well have encouraged the Israelis uh to uh accept the fact that there is an extension to the ceasefire officially but there's been no official announcement the closest we've actually got is a statement from the government press office it says the government has approved the inclusion of 50 female prisoners in the list of prisoners elegible to be released in the event that a release of additional Israeli hostages is carried out that's the closest we've got to an official confirmation of this 2day uh ceasefire also we've heard that a list of 10 names have been given by Hamas to the Israeli prison Authority uh those 10 names will be Israeli captives that will be released in the coming hours that's not been officially confirmed but it has been reported by Israeli Army radio so those are the two things that are giving people hope that the ceasefire is actually going to hold for the next two days the Israeli government has actually been clear they've said as long as U captives are being release then the ceasefire can be extended under the same conditions as it has been for the last 4 days now uh normally we see prisoners being released around about 4:00 local time so that's a crucial time we'll see if things happen around uh then but certainly it looks like everything is in place for more prisoner releases today more captive releases today um Imran and so this extension is only for two days so what more has the Israeli military been saying uh about their ground offensive once the ceasefire extension is over well it's a very interesting thing you just heard from Majid alansari there who's hopeful that the ceasefire can be extended we also have been hearing from senior Hamas leaders who are hoping that ceasefire can become a more permanent truce that is not the language that you are hearing from Israel Israel says that it will continue the war on Gaza um as soon soon as they decide that they want to as soon as they decide that Hamas aren't releasing any more pleases they have a stated aim of going in and destroying Hamas both politically and militarily but there's now talk of going into the South the south of the Gaza Strip was supposed to be an effective safe zone for Palestinians the Israelis uh through various media Outlets through various trusted uh reporters that they have are briefing that Hamas now have an operation and controlling Command Center in the south of Gaza and that'll be the next Target obviously that's incredibly alarming for the International Community particularly because as I say The South was supposed to be this safe zone now there isn't really anywhere that's completely safe for Palestinians in Gaza The South was supposed to be safe and now the Israelis are briefing that that could well be next all right Imran Khan live for us there from occupi East Jerusalem Imran thank you
