journalists and independent investigators have been locked out of the Gaza Strip Palestinians there are up against an internet and electricity blackout making online access and news on the ground very difficult to come by social platforms have become a refuge for those able to get online to find and share information however in the last two weeks we've also seen a wave of disinformation hate speech as well as Shadow Banning and content takedowns by social media companies all of which are disproportionately affecting Palestinians helping us to make sense of what's Happening online is marwa fataa she's with the digital Rights group access now marwa thank you for speaking with us today happy to be here let's start with the total Siege the Israelis have imposed on Gaza you've monitored you've documented how information blackouts are used in a time of War how concerning is what we're seeing in Gaza right now uh Palestinians in Gaza are under a Complete Siege and there is of course a near complete information Blackout um during Israel's uh bombardment campaign of the Gaza Strip um two of the three main telecommunications lines or companies in the Gaza Strip have been bombarded um people are relying currently on only one line of communications with internet and Telecommunications disruptions um and that means that people in Gaza are not able to access information not able to check on their loved ones they're not able to seek life-saving information and they're cut off from the world um they have fewer and fewer opportunities to share and tell their stories and to document human rights abuses and and war crimes internet shutdowns provide a convenient cover for perpetrators of atrocities of Human Rights abuses uh to commit those in in the dark uh to cover the trails of their crimes uh and to um impede or hinder any future possibility of accountability and and Justice in the first half of this program We examined some of the genocidal rhetoric that's been coming from Israeli officials and other Israeli figures how much of that language are you seeing being mirrored online the Cs for violence the unverified claims there is a barage of um hate speech incitement to violence content that is uh de humanizing of Palestinians islamophobic content um anti-semitic content and that is all circulating unfortunately uh with little moderation uh from social media companies there are of course many utterances from Israeli officials on social media um that shows their clear intent on committing genocide including for instance most recently uh by prime minister Netanyahu on formerly known as Twitter that this fight and this war is a war between children of lightness and Children Of Darkness between humanity and the law of uh of of jungle and it raises a question about to what extent social media companies are complicit in entertaining and housing and amplifying uh these genocidal um rhetorics that are clearly in violation of international humanitarian law and international law in General on that Point since hamas's attack on October 7th we've seen the Israeli government flood social media with ads with graphic and provocative imagery what are you seeing there on that side of things and how willingly have these online platforms played host to Israeli government messaging since hamas's attack on on Israel on October 7th um the Israeli government has launched a social media campaign I would say an aggressive social media campaign to um shape the narrative and the conversation online um we've seen for example the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs had run up to 86 ads on YouTube uh some of which shows indeed graphic content um equating Hamas to Isis and also showing the the impact of of the attacks and it's clear that you know paid targeted advertisement uh has become a weapon of War governments that have the resources and the capacity to produce uh such material can use these Platforms in order to spread War propaganda and in this context to justify the collective punishment of Palestinians and um war crimes and War you know crimes against humanity that we see unfolding before before our eyes Palestinians are also saying that social media companies have been taking down their content threatening to close their accounts some say they're being shadowbanned outright tell us what examples you're seeing and are these acts of censorship on these various platforms affecting voices on both sides we've seen users accounts being shut down including very notable users and journalists whose voices are very important there's also been arbitary decisions uh made and when when it comes to removing content one major concern that is repeatedly being reported is the so-called Shadow Banning and whereas companies don't really use that term um I've witnessed it myself uh and I've seen many users reporting it that you know their their content is being uh demoted uh down ranked the engagement with this content is is significantly reduced in comparison to other content not related to Palestine unfortunately we thought that in 2021 we've settled matters as in it was clear um that this systematic and discriminatory approach to moderating Palestinian content has been exposed um there's no way for platforms to G gasl light users or Civil Society organizations that this is uh just the result of a technical glitch which surprisingly we don't see in other crisis like when Russia invaded uh Ukraine we have seen actually proactive uh statements from different companies uh uh stating their unwavering commitment to upholding ukrainians right to freedom of expression such commitment to human rights have not been extended to Pal iians despite of what companies claim the users's experience and the reality of what we've uh documenting uh States otherwise marwa fataa of access now thank you for speaking with us today here at the listening post thank
