thousands of people are rallying outside the US and Israeli embassies in the Jordanian Capital Aman it's a show of support to Palestine following Israel's air strike on alahi Baptist Hospital in Gaza on Tuesday the Jordanian government has declared 3 days of mourning several Pro Palestinian marches are expected across the country Islamic parties have called for a general strike Osama bin Javed joins us from Aman what's the latest on your end Osama well as you've been seeing these scenes where the protest uh number of protesters have been swelling in the last few hours we were there last night at the Israeli Embassy as well where there was a large presence of the police who were trying to push back these protesters trying to prevent them from entering the Israeli Embassy compound uh it is similar scenes there there's a smaller protest at the US Embassy as well but the but this is where the flash pointed here in the uh Jordanian Capital Aman where people want to go and vent their anger at the Israeli Embassy we spoke to a former Jordanian MP as well last night she told us uh that this the presence of the Israeli Embassy is hurtful and in her words shameful for jordanians and Palestinians living here because they do not want to talk to Israel while there are in their words massacres being committed uh on Palestinian soil you've heard from the Jordanian foreign minister earlier as well saying that this Summit which was supposed to happen today in Aman between the Americans the jordanians the Palestinians and the Egyptians is no longer going to take place here because what he calls massacres that are being committed by the Israeli government so as you said this is not just a protest in one spot there are sporadic protests that are happening across Jordan a country which is home to more than 2 million Palestinian refugees okay the meeting between Arab leaders and Joe Biden has been cancelled but surely there must be some behind the scenes uh diplomatic activity right what's going on on that front well we're hearing that there is still lines of communication which are open amongst all of these sides but there's been very categoric rejection by both the jordanians and the Egyptians that they do not want the displacement of another uh Mass migration from the Palestinians from their lands into either Jordan or Egyptian territories and that is something where they are clear that they do not want to open their borders uh for these people to be displaced because as I said there are more than 2 million Palestinian refugees still here who do not have the right to return to Israel so this is going to be one of the most difficult things that getting these parties to agree on whether if they want to take some Palestinians from the other side or to allow in Aid and that's where the two sides uh seem to be uh stuck on where the Arab governments have been asking for a cessation of hostilities to allow in a to the besieged Gaza Strip whereas President Joe Biden has been pushing uh the Arab leaders to use their influence on Palestinians for hostage release and maybe some sort of opening over the borders for people to flee from Asama bin Javed reporting from Aman in Jordan thank you very much
