well Israeli police have broken up a protest by demonstrators who are trying to block humanitarian aid from entering Gaza at least 18 protesters were detained at the karabu salum Crossing on Israel's border with Gaza they've been demanding the release of captives now previous protests in the same place have resulted in trucks filled with Aid suppliers being forced to turn back well let's speak to Hamra Sal Hood she's across this for us from occupied East Jerusalem H as we were saying earlier there have been a string of protests that we seen at that Crossing but this time people actually detained just how is this all actually affecting the supplies making it into the strip well look these protests have been going on for several weeks now and at their maximum capacity you're looking at around a 100 demonstrators here mainly right-wing protesters some of them from settlements and also even family members of some of those being held captive inside of Gaza now they're saying that the Israeli government should not be allowing Aid to go through the Kim Abu salm Crossing in the southern part of the country they're saying that it's quote immoral while there are still captives being held in Gaza now Israeli police have declared some of that area military zone due to these demonstrations because protesters were even bringing tents in hopes of camping out all night Israeli police say they have removed around 40 protesters from the area raining 18 of them and the goal again is for them to block that aid from going into Gaza essentially wanting to starve the population the aid going through we already know is quite minimal and on some occasions those protesters have even succeeded in blocking those Aid trucks from getting through into the Gaza Strip and stay with me H because I want to ask you about a report that's out in the Israeli newspaper haret and now they're reporting that the government of Benjamin Netanyahu is pushing ahead with a large illegal settlement in the occupied West Bank now hars are saying that 650 homes will be built just a few meters away from Palestinian houses south of occupied East Jerusalem and farri right Israeli activists are reportedly involved in that development we know that Israel has continued to build on Palestinian land even though those settlements are illegal under international law H just how are people in Israel reacting to this report in horret well our teams have been speaking to one NGO called IR amim who have been documenting illegal settlement expansion and human rights abuses specifically in occupied East Jerusalem and here alone you're looking at around 17 different settlement plans that have been really constructed since October the 7th four of which have been approved so the total for the 17 is around 8,000 housing units and in occupied East Jerusalem it would be 3,700 that are still that were already approved and this is a process that usually takes a very long time there is a lot of bureaucracy involved with municipalities of different towns Etc but in occupied East Jerusalem in a town called umbas you're looking at around 650 housing units that are going to be built there now what this NGO is saying that essentially since October the 7th it's been unprecedented how many settlement approvals there have been and that's because they believe the government is using the guise of this war to try and FastTrack a lot of these illegal settlement plans while everyone is essentially focused on the war so while all of this is ongoing these settlements are not just in occupied East Jerusalem but also across the occupied West Bank and it is worth noting this is the most rightwing government in Israel's history who has been quite the proponents for illegal settlement expansion and they're even saying they want them in Gaza this is something we've been hearing repeatedly from these members of the far right but as far as occupied East Jerusalem it's an incredibly sensitive issue as the Israeli government is now expanding these illegal settlements H there with all the latest for us from occupied East Jerusalem thanks HDA
