let's just remind our viewers uh what they're witnessing it's just gone 14400 hours GMT 4:00 in the afternoon in Gaza and this is breaking news coming out of central Gaza with one of the worst Israeli air strikes since the offensive began a number of residential buildings have been destroyed in the jabalia refugee camp early indications uh and witness testimony say potentially at least 50 people have been killed hundreds more have been injured uh you can see a stream of the people here already entering uh one of the overcrowded and overstretched medical facilities uh and the pictures are pretty disturbing let's um cross over to hany Mahmud who's our correspondent in the south of gazin Khan Unice Communications with Central Gaza are quite sketchy right now hannie what more are you hearing about this particular well I was just watching uh a video uh that about the early early recording of what happened just about half a minute and it it looked from the video looked like there were a group of residential homes very close to each other as my colleague safwa described it's one uh one square kilometer we're talking about a very densely populated area with at least at least uh more than 100,000 people live in that area like uh houses are on top of each other there's no space roads are very narrow so when an air strike or like a group of air strikes take place in that densely populated area the damage is it great and it it it definitely affects the surrounding area which explains uh why there are so many people uh killed right away in this in this attack now that's the only the only uh video that we we got so far from that area we're waiting for more more reports and more evidence photos and videos of this massacre uh a communication networks is still disabled we find it very difficult uh to talk to people to send the text message and receive text message about what's happening and I believe there is a reason uh for for that uh lack of communication or disabled communication is just to uh just leaving Gaza or taking Gaza Off the Grid so people know what's going on in that area and as what happened in the past few days when Gaza was complete a black out and in the next morning we woke up on massacres everywhere in the northern part in Gaza City where we seen one entire family alul family for example 42 people were killed from one family in a sh a refugee camp I think this is a replica of what happened in the past 3 days it's it's happening again and there's a fear it will extend to other areas and hany there has always been this question about whether ambulances and medical staff can get to the scene of these incidents when they themselves are also a Target both from the land and from the air what sort of problems do medical emergency services face when trying to get to these locations especially now that there is this ground offensive in central Gaza well for first of all in terms of logistics uh I mean the ambulances vehicles are are Target are targeted by the Israeli air strikes but there is another uh another problem with of how to get to these sites or or or in terms of which road to take Israel uh Israeli air strikes has has have turned Gaza into a maze of rubbles so a road that takes you 15 minutes to the targeted sides because there so much rubbles on on the road will take you 45 minutes or 1 hour to get to the targeted SES which is in enough time to to for people under the rubbles to die or for someone who is bleeding and not being saved properly this is the the the tragedy of what's going on Gaza turned into a pile of ruins and with with withr you for a second because we need to go to the Ministry of Health uh and they have a press conference in carun let's just listen to them now one ton of explosives to destroy block six in jabalia refugee camp completely this District consists of houses and buildings next to each other and they are old and they include and they host hundreds of citizens the occupation War PL have destroyed this District completely with six us made bombs thrown to these places thrown on these people and every single one in this District have lost their lives and have been wounded the first figures 400 Mars and wounded and such a new brutal Massacre committed by the Israeli aggression in Gaza Strip the Israeli occupation is continuing these massacr and expanding the ground aggression on Gaza during the 24 uh last hours Israeli occupation entered through different front the first the Northwest Front of Gaza they entered this region and they have

these areas and they reached the Lan area Alama area Northwest Gaza Strip the occupation forces in this particular part is committing massacres is shelling houses of the people and the occupation in another front entered the south of Gaza and they arrived to Salah Street and they have isolated Gaza into or divided Gaza into two parts and this is increasing the humanitarian catastrophe our people
