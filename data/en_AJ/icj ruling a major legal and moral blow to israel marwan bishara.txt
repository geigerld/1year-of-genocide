Al jaaz senior political analyst M Bashar who's with us here in Doha so we had Daniel Levy the president of the US Middle East project he's also a former Israeli negotiator he was saying that this ruling is a landmark legal case it it it is a uh marks a specific moment in the way that Israel is regarded in legal terms uh by the rest of the world in Practical terms what does this ruling actually achieve if it's not enforcable although it is binding um you know the court the icj is the world court it's not the world government no matter what the ruling is it wasn't going to enforce it even if the ruling is biding this court the 15 judges don't have a police force don't have an army don't have military they don't have money they don't have anything with which to enforce any decision right it is the United Nations me members notably security members National United Nations security Council Members that can enforce any such so it doesn't matter what this court comes out with in the end of the day they will not reinforce it right I mean that's very simple in fact this court in 2004 also made an opinion about the aparted wall in the West Bank and it judged it to be illegal and should be dismantled 20 years ago the wall is still there it has not been dismantled because Israel and the United States would not dismantle it right so the court did Issue an opinion on the wall 20 years ago and the wall is still standing and Israel is still an occupying power in the West Bank right as it is in Gaza so I think what's important in this ruling is that it is a huge success a victory for South Africa even though it does not have immediate wins for the people in Gaza in terms of the moving or you mentioned the UN Security Council there is there a an argument that suggests that given the circumstance that you talked about does this give some more weight to cases or or um applications that are made to the UN Security Council that might actually sway the decisions of those that might actually as Patty was just explaining put the US in a very difficult position almost right into a corner when it comes to actually using its veto in favor of Israel as has done in the past I think in many ways uh Rob the idea today that these 15 judges from 15 different countries the world's highest court have decided based on evidence and based on United Nations agencies that they will put Israel on trial for genocide moving forward that moral weight of this court of that judgment based on evidence of the past 100 plus days will have huge effect on the psychology and the moral standing of those countries who have been supporting Israel unconditionally the past 3 four months how they react AC you know based on that that depends on how expedient they are how narrow-minded they are or how much they feel themselves to be men and women of History right that they are on the right side of History because here as you said and as Pat stated that some of the ruling some of it right in effect does Echo some of what the unit some of the United States has been warning about you need to stop the indiscriminate bombing you need to you need to uh leasen the civilian casualties and so on so forth but that's not where the importance of this Court's ruling is the importance of this ring uh this Court ruling lies in the fact that they suspect there's a plausible evidence that Israel is carrying genocide against a people so it's not just about war crimes and it's not just about avoiding civilian casualties they think there's a plausible proof plausible evidence plausible evid that Israel is carrying genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza so that must then provoke or invoke a certain move on the part of those who support Israel and those who do not support Israel because pressure is going to start building up by the Western public opinion on Western States at the United Nations security Council to call for a ceasefire and I think different countries from the global South are also going to start putting pressure on their Northern Partners right to start putting more pressure on Israel because the the the the the icj is not just making rulings in the abstract I mean as I said it's a moral legal blow but in effect they're they're telling Israel we want to hear back from you in a month time it's like Israel is on probation already it's like Israel is on parole already that you need to come back and tell us and show us how you are respecting the things we are telling you so Israel is a suspect Israel is on trial and not just on trial for this and that insignificant thing it's on trial for genocide Mar thank you very much indeed we're going to be talking to you again in about half an hour's time but for now thank you very much indeed Maran Bashar
