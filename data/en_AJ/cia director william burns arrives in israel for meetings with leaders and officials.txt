Israeli officials say CIA director Bill Burns has arrived in the country for talks on the war on Gaza and the efforts to secure the release of captives he's expected to meet with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as senior defense and intelligence officials John hendren is with us live from Washington DC and John of course CIA director Bill Burns is one of a long list of US top officials to visit Israel what does he hope to achieve that's right Burns is just the latest Us official to arrive in Israel we're not seeing a lot of pictures because as the intelligence Chief uh they don't take a lot of pictures of him but uh officially while the CIA says it doesn't comment on the director's whereabouts a Us official speaking on condition of unanimity says he is there to visit a number of countries in the Middle East and to talk to world leaders and to talk to intelligence officials and he's expected to be discussing not just the situation in Gaza but also captive negotiations uh and make an effort to cooperate with members of those countries including Israel to to deter State and non-state actors from widening that conflict and he's expected to be there to reinforce intelligence sharing you may recall that the US is using Reaper drones over Gaza to gather intelligence information so the CIA would likely be involved in analyzing and distributing that data um for goals he's also probably going to be pressing the same goals that we've seen President Biden and Anthony blinkin the Secretary of State uh press while he they were in Israel and that is a pause for Aid to go through to Gaza a more targeted approach that would minimize civilian casualties and an effort to expand intelligent sharing between the two countries there he's likely also to go to Qatar where they'll be uh talking about um trying to get those captives out and also to Egypt which is key in getting humanitarian Aid out of that region so uh he's got a big portfolio there but it's really very similar to what we've seen other us officials press all right for now John hendin live in Washington DC many thanks for the update
