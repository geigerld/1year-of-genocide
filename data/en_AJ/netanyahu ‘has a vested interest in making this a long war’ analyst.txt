well joining us now on set is Muhammad Elm he's a political analyst and professor of media studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies good to have you on the program the the big question mark at the moment is what the Israelis are talking about is this operation in Rafer and how it's actually going to physically manifest itself self militarily that's the question isn't it at the moment I think so I I think that uh the Netanyahu uh government is is still preparing uh to to go into to I think that's still the most likely scenario uh there are some analysts who think that this is more sort of just political uh posturing but I happen to think that it's more likely than not that they are going to go in with some sort of a major operation um into Rafa uh it remains to be seen how they'll Faire if they do uh Hamas has According to some recent reports been able to uh be quite successful on the recruitment front uh as the war has has gone on Palestinians many some Palestinian men have have seen that they just don't have anything to lose and they've they've now uh joined in the fighting um and also Hamas has seen an uptick in uh weapons they've been able to use uh sort of repurpose many of these unexploded bombs there are thousands of unexploded bombs uh on the ground uh in Gaza um and Hamas has been able to repurpose those and now they're using those as weapons so uh what seemed like a crisis maybe a couple of months ago in terms of Manpower and weapons doesn't seem like it's uh as much of a crisis anymore so Israel may may have its hands full in Rafa and of course Rafa is still under attack we are still reporting uh what we hear and see uh with our correspondents on the ground and we know there is a limited operation which the Biden Administration seems to be able to deal with right now but the level of response has you might say increased over the past 72 hours at least right well I think there was a certainly an initial shock on Monday when uh Israel rejected the the ceas fire I think the United States expected that Israel was going to fall in line um is the US is kind of acting as a uh a proxy for for Israel in many ways and this was the agreement that was that that all sides had signed up signed up for Israel rejected it there was an initial initial shock now the US has temporarily paused this this shipment as a way to sort of signal to Israel its displeasure um on the other hand the US is kind of talking out of both both sides of its mouth I listened to the press conference uh tonight with Matthew Miller at the state department and he's still saying that there's Ironclad support for Israel and he did use the word Ironclad and now he's softening his tone a little bit on Rafa he's saying that the US only opposes a major operation in Rafa he also changed his previous discourse about ham Hamas he used to say that U Hamas uh uh needs to um surrender completely right and now he's using a slightly different discourse with regards to Hames so you see the US sort of softening its tone on it can use the Nuance of language can't it for the international audience but for the domestic audience it doesn't work so easily because Biden's poll numbers are dropping protests continue across University campuses and in major cities where those demonstrations continue you know Matthew Miller can say whatever he wants at the podium and so can President Biden it's just not winning people over is it it's not Biden is struggling right now with the polls he's losing in all seven swing States according to uh the website 538 uh 39% of us uh college students say they are pro Palestinian now only 11% say they are pro uh Israel uh more college students are saying they uh support or sympathize with Hamas than sympathize with Israel uh and there are all kinds of polling data that suggest that Biden is in a lot of trouble in November that might be one reason why they're putting a little bit more pressure on Israel these days I think Biden realizes he may well lose this election in November which is what happens mammad Al Master it's good to speak to and get your analysis thank you for joining us make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
