British foreign minister David Cameron and his German opposite member analina bbok have called for a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza the wrote a joint article for the UK's Sunday times in it they say we must do all we can to pave the way to a sustainable ceasefire leading to a sustainable peace the sooner it comes the better the need is urgent Israel has the right to defend itself but in doing so it must abide by International humanitarian law Israel will not win this war if its operations destroy the Prospect of peaceful coexistence with Palestinians too many civilians have been killed the Israeli government should do more to discriminate sufficiently between terrorists and civilians ensuring its campaign targets Hamas leaders and operatives let's go live to Sonia GGO who's in London for us so is this any different to what both governments have been saying previously Sonia well I think it indicates really the most marginal of of changes in tone rather than that of substance of course uh what is written in this editorial as well uh very much as a continuation of previous messages that have been put out by the British government by Rishi sunak really which was to call albeit for humanitarian pauses to get humanitarian Aid in an urging caution uh with that mounting civilian death toll it doesn't really shift uh decisively any kind of change of tactics certainly on the part of the British government here what it is doing though however is echoing really the concern that is being voiced out of Washington DC with the president uh uh Biden saying that the indiscriminant bombing in Gaza is costing Israel international support and this is an issue for the for the us as well because they see this conflict or they want this conflict to be over within a matter of weeks and given what was said uh by the uh Israeli defense minister last week that he he could see this going on for months that is a very much a cause of concern but of course it rests on those three tenets where they see that uh first and foremost that Israel has the right to defend itself uh secondly that more humanitarian Aid does need to be sent into Gaza and that the third point is that there has to be a political solution in in trying to bring about the two-state solution here as well now the cause for concern here is the fact that the Israeli government Ben benan Netanyahu has very much has been said seem to be said that the two-state solution for him is not an option for him considering that he said that he wants Israel to have security control over Gaza and this is of enormous concern certainly in Western powers in the UK and the us as well because that is the only form of solution that they see that can uh end this current conflict uh for now and also in the region that for them is not a solution that they're going to back away from so this is more about putting pressure additional pressure on Israel rather than a substantive attacked away from their previous statements Sono and London Sonia thank you very much
