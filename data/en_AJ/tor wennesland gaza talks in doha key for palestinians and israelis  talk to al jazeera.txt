world the Palestinian Israeli conflict has been a key dividing line of international diplomacy for decades ever since Israel's foundation in 1948 disputes have revolved around the occupi Palestinian territories human rights violations and the fight for Palestinian self-determination this struggle contrast with the conflict's escalations and the statehood and security concerns of Israel leading to repeated cycles of violence negotiations and humanitarian crisis in 1994 following the signing of the Oslo Accords a special coordinator was appointed to oversee the un's various programs and efforts in the occupied territories the special coordinator for the Middle East peace process faces the daunting task of navigating a political landscape AP where the very process of peace is frequently questioned contested and even disregarded as the ongoing war on Gaza nears its sixth month International organizations say the scale of the humanitarian crisis has reached unprecedented levels civilians and humanitarian Aid workers continue to be targeted attacked made homeless and killed with the backdrop of genocidal assault and suffering the role of the special coordinator becomes ever more critical find out more as the un's special coordinator for the Middle East peace process tour wesland talks to Al jazer to Welland un special coordinator for the Middle East peace process thank you for joining us here on Al jazer we have a war in Gaza that has now gone on for more than 160 days more than 30,000 people killed more than half of those women and children i' last to ask you about where we are right now because there's talks about a fresh ceasefire at the same time there's talk about an offensive on Rafa how do you judge this moment oh it's a very uh important moment uh we are in a terrible situation where the war need to come to an end as fast as possible uh we are seeing what's going on on the ground on a daily basis and we have a lot of questions unresolved uh that is in Focus here in DOA over the next days and week I am hopeful that the two sides and the mediator will succeed in finding a way where we can have the release of hostages and of course in the ongoing activities on the ground so let's talk about those two things the possible Rafa offensive but first those talks that are going on here in Doha the last ceasefire last of a week it was in November my understanding of these talks is they're trying to get something that's longer about six weeks I also understand that the plan would be for female sick and elderly captives held by Hamas and other groups in Gaza to be released in return for a large number of Palestinian prisoners is there anything more you can tell us about the the framework here the only thing I want to say is that it's planned to go in phases I will not go into any details uh on on these issues that's uh I'm here to talk about that and the UN role in all that and the humanitarian part of uh this I really want to see uh the file move forward because the situation on the ground is terrible so what is the UN role with regard to these talks as I understand it you're not actually at the table are you on the sidelines I'm talking to the involved parties all of them for the UN and for the whole of the humanitarian system we have since the beginning of this war been in constant uh contact with the relevant parties to up our deliveries we need to do that for all sorts of humanitarian reasons and we particularly need it uh if there is an agreement to start this process of the release of hostages I do not think that the war will come to an end at all and it's not realistic unless unless this is happening lots of people will be listening to your words very very carefully including people in Gaza so answer me this question how close in your estimation are we to a new ceas far I am hopeful but I can't give uh a timeline for that that is to be decided uh in the next days and week but at the same time as you know the drums of War are being being sounded from Jerusalem and Tel Aviv prime minister Netanyahu says he's finalized his plans battle plans for an offensive on Rafa now that's a place where about 1.4 million people are Sheltering the many of them have fled from other parts of Gaza how worried are you I'm deeply concerned we cannot have an operation in Gaza with 1 million or more people in Gaza and we cannot be able to use the access Roots into gasa we have if this is taking place so it is for the responsibility of those uh who are going to conduct military operation uh to take that into consideration now prime minister Netanyahu has also said that hamas's latest offers ahead of these talks are ludicrous do you think the talk of the Rafa offensive could be part of a negotiating tactic I'm not willing to com uh comment on that at all and uh everybody is looking uh after how to present themselves and I will not uh make any judgment on that whatsoever let me give you a quote from the Israeli Prime Minister we will operate in Rafa this will take several weeks it will happen those were his recent words given the severity and brutality of Israel's Onslaught over the last five months we have to take his words seriously don't we I always take the words of the two sides seriously and uh that also goes for uh prime minister netan with regard to this operation they keep talking about in Rafa the Israeli military say they're going to set up humanitarian Islands now we've heard this before we've heard them set up safe zones and as your boss the UN Secretary General Antonio gues has said there are no safe zones at all in Gaza so what should people in Gaza make of this humanitarian Islands quote well they will have to decide themselves I can assure you one thing that is that the UN is not going to facilitate that but what the UN is going to do is to serve the people where they are with what they need to have isn't the other problem with a Rafa offensive the fact that Rafa is currently the humanitarian gateway to Gaza that's where the aid has been coming in through and it is only a trickle of aid but if there was an offensive even that trickle might stop I said that to you and uh there is a clear consensus in order to facilitate uh the needs of the people on the inside we need Road access into gasa anything else is uh just a fantasy and we need more access than we have and we need more access points independently from whether this is happening in Rafa or not this is the only viable way to resume uh the humanitarian deliveries and the needs of the people in uh Gaza to be met as you know there's been a new assessment announced of the humanitarian situation in terms of food security the so-called IPC classification has come down it says that famine is imminent in Northern Gaza between now and May and Your Own Boss the Secretary General of the United Nations has said this is a man-made famine it is in fact an Israeli made famine isn't it well let me put it that way uh we are aware of this we have been waiting for this assessment to come it only underlines one point very clearly that we need to be able to get into Gaza with more from more access points and fast as you say getting Aid in any other way by than road is inefficient the US has been airdropping Aid we've had a ship arrive but that ship's only got about seven trucks of Aid um the equivalent if it had come by Road why is more Aid not getting into Gaza and to me I mean I've been trying to study this and I've been asking colleagues of yours from the United Nations about this for all five months and the only conclusion I can come to is Israel is deliberately preventing more Aid coming in the main arterial roads are fairly much inaccessible they are rundown and uh they need to be kind of upgraded we cannot use this road for convoys after convoys into the delivery points in addition to that the whole area is very crowded uh and the Law and Order is breaking on the inside so the delivery uh on the inside is very very complicated and that that is the reason why it is taking time to reach to the delivery points so that needs to be uh uh that needs to be addressed and we are in these discussions on a daily basis but you talk about the Law and Order point and you can understand that if people are starving their children are starving they're going to try and intercept any truck they can find that might have food on it isn't one of the problems the fact that when those trucks have had security convoys when they've had police accompanying those trucks the Israelis have targeted them listen it it points to one fact uh and that is that there need to be an authority that can actually protect the humanitarian delivery the way I see that is that we need to get that in place fast it needs to be a Palestinian Authority it cannot be security companies or anybody else we need to get that uh in place as soon as possible and for me uh that that uh is a point that has to do with politics we now have to start talking about the politics of what's going on and the politics on how to kind of move forward and that politics is to have a Palestinian Authority on the ground that can address these issues protect the humanitarian delivery and by doing that protect the destiny of the people people that are on the inside I'd like to talk more about that later in the interview about the Palestinian Authority and potentially about the two states solution but just getting back to this point because I know you've been doing a lot of negotiation on this humanitarian Aid there could be more Crossings open couldn't there Israel is the one that's preventing that there could be more inspection staff there could be clearer inspections there was a story recently for example a whole truck was turned away because there were some dates on the truck and isra said that the stones in the dates could be used as Weapons this is this is maddening isn't it listen I cannot go into the details on all these stories that are out all the time my well they come from Aid agencies who are well well well they're probably true I think yeah well I mean my point is something else we need to get these Delivery Systems improved so we can deliver faster and safer you said you can't comment on the little details special coordinator but Israel is picking up on these little details that's why it's stopping entire trucks coming through and that's what's preventing in some cases people from getting the food and medicine they need well I can tell you the main problem is that we don't get enough in and we don't get enough quantities in from different points of Entry that is the key that is the key challenge we have uh and that is something we need to address fast uh given the circumstances on the ground and the statements that are coming from different sides on what may happen on the road now you went last month to Gaza I know it's a place you visited very many times before but this was the first time you visited Gaza since the start of the conflict how did that visit affect you I've never seen anything like this because some of these areas were not populated at all in the western part uh of the strip and I went all the way up to derbala and I'm just kind of underlining that the congestion is massive the accessibility to the points of delivery is superbly complicated uh on both the main roads and we need to have uh an understanding for that because it is possible to run stuff to gasa on a highway but there is no Highway inside gasa to get these things safely out did what you saw with your own eyes look like the result of a carefully targeted military action consistent with legitimate self-defense what I saw was a humanitarian chaos in the South uh and there is no other way to describe it uh I saw desperate people being put in a desperate situation and they will continue to be in that situation up until the war stops and even after for a long period of time this is unbearable to see it's unbearable to handle and that is why you need there is a need for taking rational decision to get it stopped if we weren't talking about the tragedy the unfolding tragedy of Gaza we probably would be talking Would we not about the West Bank because the situation there is the worst it's been in recent memory over 400 Palestinians killed since the 7th of October last year was a record year of deaths of Palestinians killed by Israelis and if you look at the figures this year they're even greater than last year how concerned are you about what Israel is doing on the West Bank I've been racing the red flag on this issue repeatedly in the security Council and obviously my concern is absolute we have had a development of flash points at the West Bank with armed clashes incursions we have had an expansion of settlements settler vience demolitions and everything that makes uh the life at the West Bank miserable in addition to that we now have a restriction of movement that is being imposed that is really hitting the daily life and the economy uh on the West Bank in a very very serious way this is the other side of the problem this is the other side of why politics is needed and why we need to get out of it uh and and the Palestinian Authority is uh squeezed into a corner and the International Community with their interventions even if uh they've taken actions against settlements or settlers have not been able to change this are they talking Tough Enough on settlers and settlements on Settlers the number of settler attacks seems to continue to rise I'm told your latest un figures say an average of four settler attacks every single day and the Israeli military aren't doing anything about this they seem to be involved in some of these attacks and on settlements I believe from November 2022 to November last year it's the highest number on record since you started monitoring about 24,000 new housing units again as has been going on for decades Israel is changing the facts on the ground making your two-state solution for further and further away by building on what is supposed to be a Palestinian State the politics of this is deliberate it's negative and it's destructive uh it has been going on it's still destructive it's negative and it has been impossible to stop it I clearly see that the International Community is very clear on this unanimously and now there are accidents being taken by capitals and donors that are very clear giving a signal here I really hope this will work because the situation for the people living at the West Bank is like it is and we can never find a solution if we are creating more and more flash points faster and faster we are building settlements faster and faster and it's implemented this is the policy of the current government and they have speeded it up even more and I can only say that this is to be condemned it is undermining any serious attempt to have a political solution to this conflict or even getting in a Direction Where We can address it uh rationally okay well let's move to the possible political solution and and the way forward for all of this we've discussed let me read you a quote from your boss the Secretary General Antonio GES we want to see the creation of conditions that will allow the Palestinian Authority to assume respons posibilities in Gaza and that is in our opinion the solution to allow for a two-state solution to become reality so let's talk about those two things one by one first the the reinvigorated Palestinian uh authority to take over how is that going to work the Palestinian Authority themselves won't want to ride into Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank as it were will they no but here I think the International Community need to stand up to make Palestinian Authority an authority that can be respected first and foremost by its own people and also to take upon themselves the responsibilities both in gasa and West Bank isn't the fundamental problem here though the fact that the current Israeli government and prime minister Netanyahu don't agree with this plan of yours and it's also Secretary of State Anthony blink's plan for the Palestinian Authority to take this key role a new as he says reformed and revitalized Palestinian Authority prime minister Netanyahu doesn't want the Palestinian Authority there and he wants to keep an ongoing security presence of Israel in Gaza that's the fundamental flaw in your plan isn't it no it's not a fundamental flaw in the plan of the International Community it's a fundamentally flaw in the policy of Israel now we have a humanitarian crisis in Gaza but again we need to get the politics to get these things fixed 3 months ago I had your humanitarian colleague um Martin Griffith sitting in the chair where you are now he said all voices need to be heard I quote the voice of Hamas and other organizations which have been involved in the Palestinian Universe need to be heard we need them to be given the opportunity to tell us their views about the future do you agree that Hamas which is not just a military and political organization but a social organization that needs to have a role too I take due note uh of what was said uh from ramala very recently about the conditions for moving forward and who should have the legitimacy to have a role in any government it's very clear that you cannot on the back of what has been going in Gaza and on the back of 7 October immediately accept uh the organizations that were a part of that to run into a governance situation that that will not fly it will not fly with the Palestinian people it will not fly if you're going to set up a system that can work with the International Community the discussions on how the Palestinians are going to uh decide how to kind of manage and uh discuss their own Internal Affairs I leave for them to do but it's not going very well they've announced a new Palestinian prime minister um who is 69-year-old Muhammad Mustafa an experienced econ IST not doesn't have a lot of political skills needed some observers say and already all of the other factions say he's not the right man for the job you still have mmud abas as the leader 88 years old some would say well past his cell by date he had a four-year term and he's now in the 20th year of that term I mean this isn't what Palestinians would want if they went to the polls is it the Palestinians will have to go to the polls when they can go to the polls that is not now we need to have a bridge now where we can reset the system so it can function institutionally but I will say following we will as an International Community have to support a strengthening of that system coming into place that is how it is that is how it will be and that is how we will move forward we will not decide whether this government will last for long or for short but we will definitely do whatever we can to get this to work because because we have no other choice as we've said the aim still is a two-state solution now every month you brief the UN Security Council and as I'm mainly based at the UN in New York I listen to that briefing every single month and I listen to you talk about a two-state solution I listen to the Palestinian Ambassador talk about a two-state solution I listen to the 15 members of the security Council mainly playing lip service to the idea of a two-state solution but there's one person who never ever mentions a two-state solution and that's the ambassador of Israel isn't this the problem you have that Israel and the current government the current prime minister they don't believe in a two-state solution go back to the time of Oslo prime minister netanyahu's question the whole ow process well just know after this war is coming to an end there is a new reality and we have to look at that reality and see what it takes I've never in all the time I've been here seen a divide as deep between the two sides as it is at the moment there is no kind of togetherness uh factors anymore and the reality of the whole thing is that Palestine and Israel will be separate for a while and they need to find the crumbling way back to what that re reality means I think there needs to be a reink on the way we approach the concept of a two-state solution after this war how exactly that will look like I cannot tell you now but I'm sure that we need to look at this realities from the perspective of a two-state solution there is no plan B to that ever presented in a credible way we need to look at uh the realities as it and find a new way of thinking on how the two states can live side by side in peace and security that is the point of departure then we have to discuss the details that's where we are today the diplomacy on this issue has for decades yes the un's there but it's been led by the United States isn't it clear now given all the money and weapons that the US continues to give to Israel the fact that the US representative in the security Council on three resolutions has raised their hands to stop a um a ceasefire a resolution that would have created a ceasefire that the US is not neutral they're not an honest broker and I've had on this program in the last couple of months president Lula D Silva of Brazil I've had Russian foreign minister Sergey lavro and they say no this needs to be an international approach the US they shouldn't be leading this anymore well um what what I will say is the follow in I am as a Norwegian Diplomat fully aware of the Norwegian involvement and the American involvement in this process and others uh that have been involved in support of a two-state solution but how about bring back the quartet I mean you had this body which was the US the EU Russia and the UN maybe expand it throw in China throw in the Arab League and have a proper International approach rather than letting secretary blinkin do all the running well you know as well as I do the geopolitics of this world uh and you know because of that why it doesn't happen very fast this has to do with a much broader picture than the one we have uh in front of us Gaza and the West Bank and that would continue for a while until we can get it set back again at the moment I must say that I'm very uh in support of any major initiative from members of the council and others that will work on the line of trying to set up a different direction of the negative trajectory that is on the ground that is the politics of today it seems to me that all parts of the International System on this conflict right now are sounding the alarm you have the Secretary General of the United Nations using that very rare power under the UN Charter article 99 to convene the security Council to demand a ceasefire that didn't work you have the international court of justice which is so concerned about uh genocide uh that it passed what is called provisional measures which Israel has completely ignored and now you've got the IPC warning that a famine is imminent what is left what's going to stop this war let's go back to where we are today Doha let's go back to what is to be discussed here over the next day and week this is a key to getting to a different place from where we are now it's a key for uh the Palestinians in Gaza it's a key uh for Israel and the war will only stop if we manage to resolve uh the issue of the hostages and getting end to this atrocities that we are seeing on a daily basis happening it is very desperate for any Diplomat who is trying to do a serious job in getting these things fixed and not succeeding whether you are American un Secretary General or the special coordinator or anyone else we need to look at this differently now we cannot allow this to slide we have to kind of do better and do more in that perspective it will be a political mobilization uh that will matter and it will be our ability to address and help the people that are suffer suffering on this uh situation whether they are family of the hostages underground in Gaza or whether they are desperate civilians in hundreds of thousands sitting stuck in Gaza the way they are just now un special coordinator to wesland thank you for talking to Al jazer thank
