intend to Pilot a Rochdale Revival at his victory party in Rochdale George Galloway was already promising another win at a general election later this year in a constituency with a 30% Muslim electorate his focus on Gaza alongside local issues W him nearly 40% of the vote a mandate he told Al jazer he intended to use I believe I'm speaking for millions of people in Britain whose hearts are broken whose guts are wrenched by the slaughter in Gaza and they are under represented to the point almost of invisibility in the British media minutes earlier and nearly 300 kilometers away Rishi sunak gave his first ever live address from the Downing Street Leon the focus what he called poisonous efforts to divide British Society MPS do not feel safe in their homes long-standing parliamentary conventions have been upended because of safety concerns and it is beyond alarming that last night the Rochdale bar election returned a candidate who dismisses the horror of what happened on October the 7th who glorifies Hezbollah and is endorsed by Nick Griffin the racist former leader of the BNP he also urged tougher policing of pro Palestinian protests drawing a line between demands for protection of civilians and what he said were calls for violent had Galloway dismissed that as Party politics in an election year from a prime minister he didn't respect there's been much discussion of how much can be read into wider British politics from what's happened in Rochdale byelections frequently give rise to atypical results this one particularly exceptional in that the two main parties were beaten into third and fourth for labor widely tipped to win the upcoming election it was a slow motion disaster from the moment it disowned its own candidate last month for airing anti-israeli conspiracy theories about the October the 7th attacks Galloway only won because labor didn't stand a candidate I regret that we had to withdraw our candidate and apologize to voters in Rochdale but I took that decision it was the right decision the election of a politician like George Galloway in a constituency like Rochdale with an issue like Gaza to the four was always going to attract attention the intervention of the Prime Minister has only heightened that Gaza likely to be high on the agenda in the coming months through to the next election at least Harry foret Al jazer Rochdale make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
