hi I'm Steve Clemens and I have a question does Israel have an endgame for the war in Gaza let's get to the bottom line Israel has been pounding Gaza for more than a month ever since the Hamas surprise attack of October 7th resulting in more than 1,400 Israelis killed and another 200 taken hostage at this point more than 10,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces about half of them children today the narrow strip has been split in two and most of its 2.3 million civilians have been displaced by the non-stop Israeli shelling the humanitarian situation on the ground has become dire food water medicine and fuel shortages are reaching catastrophic levels and the United Nations said more of its Aid workers have been killed in Gaza than in any period in the history of the United Nations all of which brings to mind the famous quote of General David Petraeus from 20 years ago when US forces were invading Iraq he said tell me how this ends the death and destruction continue but what's the endgame for Israel today we're talking to Congressman Seth Molton a Democrat representing Massachusetts and a veteran of the Marine Corps who served in the Iraq War Congressman Molton thank you so much for joining us look you serve po terms in Iraq you know what war feels like and sees you saw your friends die you saw civilians die and you saw enemy combatants die I'm just interested given your experience of that what frame should we be considering as we look today at the crisis between Israel uh and Hamas in Gaza well first of all let's just acknowledge war is absolutely horrific War should be avoided at all costs and the worst part of war is when innocent people die and innocent people always die in war and we saw innocent civil uh civilians in Israel massacred barbarically by Hamas and now we're seeing innocent civilians in Gaza killed every day in Israeli air strikes this is a horrible tragedy I think the important context to look at this war though is that this is not a force onforce War like Russia versus Ukraine or the United States versus Germany in World War II this is a real counterinsurgency where the fight is not just to defeat Hamas for Israel the fight is also to win over the population so that Hamas to win their hearts and Minds you do have to win their heart how is that going from your you know early of a month into this War I don't think it's going very well to be candid and and look I look at this from the perspective of I want Israel to defeat Hamas I want Israel and Palestinians to live I want Israel and Palestine to have peace I want Israeli citizens is Palestinian citizens to not have to worry that uh they're going to get killed in their sleep but to get there I do think you have to defeat terrorists but you can't recruit more terrorists in the process and the number one way to recruit teror to the cause is to kill innocence well you wrote a very powerful and interesting piece um of the likes that I haven't read out there about war and conflict relevant to the Israeli Gaza crisis um in CNN.com I highly recommend that people take a look at that article but in it you talk about mist's math tell us about that so General Stanley mccristal famous counterinsurgent um American General in Afghanistan he talked about how there's this what he calls Insurgent math and he estimates the equation to be for every one civilian that you kill you recruit about 10 terrorists so in other words if Israel every one civilian let's foke on that one innocent person of whom thousands have now been killed uh we know because over half of the 10,000 are children so innocent right there but tell us how many insurgents are created this is a problem so so Israel has a math problem and it's measured in human lives if they go in and they say we're g to take out this one Hamas terrorist but in the process they kill just one civilian well by general mist's math you've just recruited nine new or sorry 10 new Hamas terrorists to the cause that means you recruited 10 you killed one you're plus nine that's not moving in the right direction if you want to actually take out this terrorist organization you as you kind of look at your experience there and and it's something that I I think you acknowledge is very very different that the density of buildings of people um wildly different than a place that's like stacked up with people like London today it's like going through and trying to find you know the bad folks amongst a lot of good folks you how do you process that and and I and I want to acknowledge I was very taken with your comment that you called in a bombing rate on a school you you flattened a school so it was a difficult decision to make uh um but here's the context that was so different than than Gaza we knew that there were no civilians in in that neighborhood to the best of our knowledge all the civilians had evacuated that's because we in many ways conditioned the battlefield we made sure that civilians had a way to get out uh we went into this building uh where Americans had already taken uh several casualties and then my Marines my platoon took casualties as well and I was faced with this decision uh do I continue fighting the stairs where they're rolling grenades down at us or do I pull the Marines out and drop a bomb on the building to take care of the threat the insurgence but also wreck a school a school that we would have to rebuild if we wanted to win back popular support and I made the decision I said this is not worth more Marine lives so I Dropped a Bomb but then the tough work started because after we finished the fighting in NAA in 2004 we spent months and months rebuilding the city rebuilding the city so that we could rebuild trust with the Iraqi people who by the way much like the Palestinians they didn't want to be living under terrorists but they weren't sure they could trust Americans we had to earn that trust you you also cite General Mattis and something he said which I found really interesting he said I want the military to be looked at as the enemy's worst enemy but as the people's as there there would be no better friend that's right and I found it very interesting to hear those we're not talking in those terms right now we're caught in Rage we're caught in Emotion but even President Biden acknowledged that rage the blindness of Rage can be a bad place to start so I I'm just interested in how you see through that and how do you Orient a military to be No Worse Enemy and no better friend well this was our first Marine Division motto but it wasn't our motto when we went into Iraq when we went into Iraq we didn't understand the consequences of of killing civilians we tried to avoid it because it's the right thing to do but we were just trying to defeat the Iraqi Army it took us years to appreciate to realize that we were in a counterinsurgency campaign where it was just as important to win over the civilian population as it was to defeat uh the enemy so General mtis introduced that motto to to tell every single Marine uh that you had to prove every single day that your enemies would find no greater foe but at the same time if you put your trust in us if you put your trust the United States Marine Corps you won't find a better friend that was really important to this whole concept of winning over the civilian population and what struck me is that um we would spend often much more time focused on the no better friend part than on the No Worse Enemy I mean we might spend days uh rebuilding infrastructure uh working with Iraqi politicians and then and then we might spend a couple hours at night going on a on a raid to take out a few terrorists when I later worked for General Petraeus it was the it was the same thing he would agonize over restoring power to parts of Baghdad in fact he sent my small team of Marines once on a mission into enemy-held territory a place where Americans didn't want to go for the sole purpose not of taking out terrorists but of fixing a power line because he knew it was so important to win over the support of the of the civilian population by showing you could deliver Services you know I just went back and I sort of did a search of news headlines of military during the Iraq War during Afghanistan and I found one um with this is a someone you probably know uh who is the the former head of us Central Command Frank McKenzie who said a Cabo drone strike that killed 10 civilians which they thought was part of terrorist infrastructure was a tragic mistake children were killed and came out on television admitted the mistake publicly I have the article for that it may be too early in this war to see that but how much does confession apology recognition of those mistakes publicly fit into the hearts and Minds strategy it's a good question Steve I think it matters a lot and and again I'm not saying that we always got it right uh the message I'm trying to send to to the Israelis who have every right to defend their country every right to defend their civilian population every right to take out terrorists just as we did after 911 the message I'm trying to send is learn from our mistakes because in the early days of Iraq and Afghanistan you would never hear the US apologize for civilian casualties but as we came to appreciate how important it was to show the civilian population that you can trust us you can work with us we're a better alternative to the terrorists as we came to appreciate that we were much more candid and open and honest and transparent and part of that is being willing to mistakes now now Seth publicly you're out there on this but you said in this time of conflict we need to begin thinking about end games you need to Envision other things you need to think about hard and Minds I'm just interested in how this is playing with your constituents and also this town you know how are are are you getting criticized for this or are you being applauded for your well I me first of all I always get criticized pretty much no matter what you say you're going to get criticized but no I think uh in many ways people realize that um that what what I'm trying to do here is is not just sort of find the middle ground but but really stand on moral principle because there are strong moral reasons why we don't need to see innocent Li uh upended or or ended in this conflict but there are real military reasons as well so you can be the staunchest supporter of Israel and I am a staunch supporter of Israel of the Israeli state of Israel's fundamental right even responsibility to defend its citizens while also saying if I want Israel to win this war they've got to be more careful they've got to minimize civilian casualties because that's what we learned in Iraq and Afghanistan now the president and his team that President Biden has called for a pause a ceasefire you've called for humanitarian corridors you've called for various Dimensions to try to give you know people who are innocent and opportunity to escape this hell uh that they're in right now um how do you think that's going well look there's a little bit of a battle over words here uh a lot of people I get a lot of calls in the office saying why won't you support a ceasefire I mean first of all Israel is not going to agree to a ceasefire and if you just they made that very clear they made that very clear but you know the Secretary General of the UN has called for a cease fire lots of others have called for a ceasefire the Arab world that was normalizing in in large part with Israel through the Abraham Accords has also called for a ceasefire we have said we understand Israel is not going to call for ceasefire look also a lot of Arab leaders really want Hamas taken out and that's something that that may not resonate with the Arab street but is a reality in this complicated part uh part of the world the Middle East uh but but here here's the reality Israel is not going to agree to a ceasefire and on top of that a ceasefire really would Empower samas all Hamas allow them time to reconstitute uh so what we what we need fundamentally is not a ceasefire or a humanitarian pause both terms that suggest we're going to take a break from the fighting but then we're going to go right back at it the way we've been doing it no what we need is a civilian evacuation that's fundamentally what we need and that's another lesson that we learned in Iraq and Afghanistan but the lesson the civilians in in Palestine have learned is once they evacuate they don't get back in so that's one of the big concerns if you talk to Palestinians on the other side of the equation those that have gone into Jordan others in times of Crisis they can't get back into uh lands they once had so what do we do with that fear and and is there some negotiation some deal that get civilian evacuation but doesn't result in them not being able to get back into Gaza um into their homes no it's a great question um and what we what we did uh in fuia for example the second time Marines went into fuia they had evacuated about 90% of the civilians so only 10% of the civilians in that entire city were left uh when the Marines went in went in everybody there was tied into the to the to the they made the decision to stay and fight and so the Marines took them out part of that part of the way we were able to facilitate that uh civilian evacuation is by promising the civilians the residents that they could go go back that they would be able to return so you have to have this plan you have to be able to lay out your endgame you talk to your Israeli friends and folks that you've talked to in the US government said that's a very key part because right now what's happening is the IDF and other folks to say hey move South move down and yet as people have moved South particularly refugee camps they've continued to get bombed in places where they were told to go because of a commander being somewhere allegedly or others and so the broadside is how do you how do you get some element of trust that where they're being sent to go is something that's not not going to end up getting them killed so I've called for not a ceasefire but a civilian evacuation I've also called for not a humanitarian pause just a temporary sensation but a humanitarian surge where you don't just bring in the minimum amount of Aid to Southern Gaza you bring in the maximum amount to show the people that if you evacuate if you move out of the North into the South you'll not just get a small bit of Aid you'll get a lot in other words it's really worth it for you to make this journey to leave Hamas behind certain Senators like Senator Chris Murphy Senator Chris Van Holland have begun to move and said we need to have some oversight of how the weapons that that the United States has now provided to Israel are being used um the White House has rejected that thus far and said we don't want to impose any limits on those do you think there should be some limit should I I think the world looks at the United States as a Defender uh of Israeli security and security needs but should there be constraints on what Israel can do with our partnership Steve you know everything I've been calling for in this debate and in in our conversation uh today uh preserves innocent life it fundamentally helps innocent Palestinians it also helps Israel win it helps Israel defeat Hamas and I think that what we what the president has been trying to do here is stand staunchly by our Ally our most important Ally in the Middle East that's that's Israel allow them to defend their their territory but help them do so in a way that that is not only morally successful but militarily successful as well and I do think that the president is looking for ways to exert more influence over the Israelis to to learn those lessons the same lessons that I'm that I'm describing that we learned in Iraq and Afghanistan one of those probably the most Paramount being you have to explain the endgame you have to have a political solution to something that is fundamentally a political iCal problem you're not you're not just going to solve this by military means that means being able to explain to the Palestinians what their future is it also means by the way nyah's got to be able to explain to his troops what they're fighting for because I think his soldiers know that if they just go into Gaza and leave it a smoldering mess at the end of the day they're going to be right back where they started well that's a Forever War so are we looking at the ingredients today of a Forever War right now on the ground we have the ingredients of a for ever war and that's not a recipe that any of us want so I think that for Israel's success well that's also the recipe where a a a a dad a mother cannot go out and justify and think about why their child was killed battling in that if you have a Forever War Without End you know we don't want any innocent 5-year-old Palestinian kids dying in this conflict we also don't want innocent 5y old Israelis dying in this same conflict 20 years from now when they're still fighting it I'm just interested with you have such Insight what does this do in terms of trauma for the Israeli Nation but also for a Goins and Palestinians who have for decades been locked in a vice I I mean Steve I know so many amazing Americans some of the greatest Americans I've me ever met in my life who fought heroically in Iraq and Afghanistan and are still haunted by it they made it home but they're tremendously hobbled by post-traumatic stress and that's going to be a reality for Jewish citizens of Israel it's going to be a reality for Muslim citizens of Palestine it is going to be a horrific reality for everyone who's caught up um in this conflict and it's one of the reasons why at the end of the day we all have to be align for peace I had a guy on the show recently who said hey President Biden got 20 trucks of humanitarian relief in at the beginning of this he says a low-level State Department staffer can be counted on to get 20 trucks this is the president of the United States who got 20 trucks of relief which is pathetic I mean I mean part of the question is is is Joe Biden being made to look pathetically weak when it comes to interactions with Israel over this no I don't think so um I mean uh Israel has gone through the greatest National tragedy in its history and President Biden uh made them significantly delay their ground assault to try to influence them on how they' they carry it out I think this could be a lot worse if not for president B Biden's involvement today what do you think the geopolitical dimensions of this are Seth um when we talked last we talked about the Ukraine war in Russia and the failure of deterrence you worry about Asia the signals that some of these send around the world and there are concerns now that China is is testing the dashboard of America's attention span across things is the world sensing America is distracted sort of off off its uh game that it can't handle this many of hot conflicts around the world I think we're showing the world right now that we can that we can handle this number of conflicts but but there are real risks there are real risks there are real risks that the conflict in Gaza expands dramatically into a regional war in the Middle East there are real risks that the message that SI Jing ping takes from from looking at Ukraine is the Americans aren't going to stick with their Democratic allies and Putin might eventually win this war and that means I can get away with starting a war in the Pacific over Taiwan so there are real risks and and for everyone who's quick to criticize the United States and different things that we do in different parts of the world it's also important to understand that the United States is is pretty much holding this all together we're preventing a regional war in the Middle East with our presence we're preventing Vladimir Putin from rolling over Ukraine and rolling right into uh into a a European war with NATO and every single day we're sending a message to SI jingping and China do not invade Democratic Taiwan don't start World War II in the Pacific let me ask you about prime minister Netanyahu if you were to have a conversation with him about what an endgame would look like and he's come out and said that every aspect of Gaz and security is now going to be in Israel's hands um I don't want to just critique prime minister Netanyahu I want to understand what's the pathway to getting to something where both sides can see hope during a time of Rage really on both sides can begin looking at something that looks like a sensible endgame because somebody's got to begin doing that what would you counsel him to do in this moment I would say Mr Prime Minister I understand how Furious you are I understand how angry your people are but the right thing to do for every Israeli kid the right thing to do for every Palestinian kid is to find a new solution a political endgame that both sides can believe in that both sides where both sides can find peace and that means you've got to convince Palestinian innocent civilians and Israelis as well that there's a better way I think that's a two-state solution but it's a reinvigorated two-state solution it's a new commitment from a prime minister who's been fundamentally opposed to a two-state solution for a long time to actually make it happen the United States is no longer looked at by many Palestinians and also Arabs as a fair broker in that I've been watching turkey and and uh uh president erdogan and his strong support both of Hamas but of the Palestinian side of the equation turkey's a NATO Ally of the United States is there an opportunity there you could actually reshuffle the traditional players that have been trying to negotiate a deal and and try and look at turkey's better impulse pules as as a a defender of interests on the Palestinian side and the United States on the Israeli side or do we still need to maintain I what I would call a fiction that we can be fair to be fair to both sides well look I think a lot of people rightly ask Seth I mean how can you just advocate for a two-state solution when this hasn't worked for decades I think one of the things that's changed in the Middle East is you now have Arab states places like Saudi Arabia the Gulf States that actually want to have dialogue with Israel I mean Israel has been pursuing peace uh with his Arab neighbors let's turn that into action let's turn these agreements into real differences on the ground I think that if Israel finds a way with our help to get Arab States involved in a two-state solution ultimately ensuring its success that's more believable for everybody Congressman Seth Molton of Massachusetts thank you so much for joining us today and sharing your candid views thank you thank you Steve so what's the bottom line grievance es Drive rage and rage drives killing and the demonization of the other the latest bout of Rage between Israelis and Palestinians was triggered by Hamas surprise attack on Israeli military and civilian targets but history just didn't start on October 7th in Justice for Palestinians has been simmering for many decades and combined with deep polarization within Israel there were many factors that led to this explosive situation now rage is gushing and my guest today a former soldier with experience says that leaders need to be leaders they need to see through the rage they need to find ways to articulate this for their citizens an endgame a reasonable even if painful equilibrium that gives both societies a chance to reset it's almost impossible to talk about a peaceful future now but it's a vital part of leadership that's something that Palestinians Israelis Americans everybody desperately needs and that's the bottom line
