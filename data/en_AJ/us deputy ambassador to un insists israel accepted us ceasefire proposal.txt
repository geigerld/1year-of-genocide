well the US is trying to shore up support for a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas proposed by President Joe Biden last month it is putting this latest draft to the UN Security Council for more on this let go now to Gabrielle alzando who is at the United Nations Headquarters in New York and Gabe do we have any idea of what is actually in this draft resolution yeah we've seen the draft and uh we know exactly what's in it this draft resolution we are being told now uh is going to go up for a vote in the security Council around 19 or 20 GMT that's 3 or 4:00 New York time around that time for him when the security Council convenes in the afternoon now this us draft resolution is just a little longer than a page long and it really is comes in three parts if you will part one of this uh resolution calls for a ceasefire immediate ceasefire release of captives particularly women elderly and wounded in exchange for the release of some Palestinian prisoners held in Israel it calls for the Palestinians to be allowed to return to their homes including in the north and calls for a ramp up of Aid including housing aid uh for Palestinians that no longer have a home to go back to after stage one uh this resolution draft resolution by the US calls for a permanent IND hostilities uh in exchange for the release of all the remaining captives and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces and then the third stage is a multi-year uh reconstruction plan for Gaza now the big question is uh the first stage it lays out 6 weeks uh for that first stage to be implemented if it is not implemented within 6 weeks uh they say that this will continue on uh this uh plan will continue on as long as negotiations to implement stage one continue on as well now we caught up with the uh us Deputy ambassadors he was here at the UN about an hour ago and this is what he had to say about this draft resolution we expect to be voted on later on Monday this proposal is the best opportunity we have right now to bring at least a temporary Hal to this fighting uh to be able to get um more assistance in get hostages released and all the other things are included in the proposal so we want to work hard to get that done and this proposal Al gives us the best opportunity to do that yes there'll be differences of opinion on you know which side wants this and which side wants that but overall this proposal I think is the best realistic opportunity we want to put pressure on Hamas to accept this deal uh so far it hasn't uh accepted this deal so that's why we want to have this resolution because we think right now we're on the you know uh we're on the cusp of doing something very very important and so we want to see it done and that's why we're working so hard to try to get everybody on board Israel has informed normally accepted it either even though it's supposedly their Israel's accepted the deal it's Hamas Hamas needs to accept this deal now we don't want to speculate on what's going to happen with this vote later on Monday but it's clear that Russia and uh China have expressed some concerns about previous language and previous drafts uh they've said in the past that it should be an unconditional ceasefire full stop uh not tied to anything else uh and that's spend the uh opinion and the view of Russia and China and some other Security Council Members as well quite frankly uh we did catch up with the Russian Deputy Ambassador she was walking into a meeting here at the UN earlier this morning as well we asked her as her country reached a decision on this draft resolution she said basically no comment you can imagine that there's probably uh talks going back and forth between Moscow and New York between uh the Russian Mission as we speak so we do not know how this vote will go but clearly uh this will be a very important vote that we expect here at un headquarters later on Monday and certainly is we will be keeping a very close eye on how that plays out that is Gabrielle alzando for us there in the UN thanks so much well more on this we're going now to Thomas Pickering who is a former US ambassador to the UN Jordan and Israel he joins us from Washington DC thank you very much for being with us sir uh first of all you seem like the perfect person to talk to right now as we wait for this uh draft resolution to be put forward by the United States will this go the same way as we've seen the others go and be VTO how do you think it's going to play out it's a great question and thank you for having me on and at the moment there is enough uncertainty about how this would come out to say that we're in a classic situation the security Council where in fact we have increasing confidence that we can bring along the vetos uh that are at this point Potential from either Russia or China or both or the alternative is that they will have to bear the responsibility for interrupting a process that at the moment seems to offer one of the few hopes for an end to Carnage in the region the rebuilding of stability the protection of human life the return of host and the release of any the stakes are large uh in effect using the security Council as a leverage point is a risky proposition but not one that has been abandoned by the US in the past with mixed success so I say keep your eye on this space anybody who tells you they know how it's going to come out is to be listened to but skeptical about indeed as well as being an ambassador to the UN Jordan and Israel also understand you the former ambassador to Russia they obviously will play a very crucial role here what do you make of how or how do you believe that they might vote here I think it's very difficult to tell they're guarding their public record on how they're going to vote on this uh in the past at Good Times in the security Council uh we wouldn't have taken a resolution to a vote without assurance that we would not face a veto in bad time which is certainly characteristic of what we have to do now between the US and Russia for a whole host of reasons it is hard to know and I've sketched out for you how and in what way the council might be used as a leveraging question in order to in effect uh separate Russia further from the International Community uh should they produce a veto at this particular stage and cast the responsibility uh for the death and destruction and humanitarian danger that they might lead to certainly on Moscow I want to um just turn now to the other big diplomatic move over the last few hours uh with the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin who has just landed in Israel we heard from him as he left Cairo he said Hamas continues to show extraordinary cynicism quote basically blaming them for a lack of a deal what did you make of uh of those comments in particular and how helpful are they in actually trying to get a deal across the line I think there was some hope that Egypt could play a more useful forceful role in bringing Hamas along along with Qatar where Hamas resides in one form or another uh blinken uh the secretary has made it L clear that he did not reach a success in bringing Hamas along uh the resolution Security Council I think had as its initial purpose if it could be passed a further leveraging Point further pressure on Hamas and further indication that if we can't get that through persuasion and diplomacy we can get it through security Council action and perhaps international support for the uh plan that president President Biden unruled yeah just going back to uh the proposed vote uh at the UN Security Council later today I mean is it relevant at all because we've seen uh so so much division within uh the UN Security Council in recent times especially compared with uh the general assembly which has so far backed ceasefire deals pretty much from the very beginning of this war is it relevant this vote in the next four or 5 hours the simple answer to that question is general assembly resolutions are kind of advisory Security Council resolutions put together in a particular framework uh of the language are seen to be mandatory and people who are members of the security Council are obliged to accept him others believe everybody is obliged to accept them uh I have in one way or another attempted in your with your question s to deal with the issue of if a resolution is not mandatory can it still reflect influence of the International Community and in the general assembly if there is a very large majority then countries move at their Peril because maybe the next step will be sanctions and other kinds of steps taken uh further to pressure those who are hesitant like Hamas at this stage to join in the resolution Hamas has a problem of course it wants a permanent ceasefire now uh the The Proposal proposes in stage two something that moves very close in that direction but it counts on a accurate completion in six weeks of stage one before you get there so solving those differences has not been possible obviously in the negotiating framework at least in so far as we can tell now uh whether they will be resolved before uh 3 4:00 this afternoon eastern time is uncertain but as I said the US has two options in pursuing a resolution uh one to get a mandatory resolution successfully and use that as a pressure point the second is to get uh enough support uh even if one or a number of the permanent members veto the resolution uh both to shift the blame on those individuals but also to use as much of the unanimity as they can uh to conin Hamas that it's time to go along like you say we will be keeping a very close eye on how things unfold over the next four or five hours that's Thomas Pickering former US ambassador to the UN Jordan as well
