to be able to hear the waves without the buzz of drones or loud fighter jets is a good day in Gaza as the 4-day pause in fighting began some took the opportunity to breathe fresh air without the threat of an incoming Israeli strike we are very happy because we weren't able to go anywhere for so long and now we can finally play in the sea but not all of gaza's 2.3 million people could afford the rest fite from the pain thousands walk to the already overpopulated southern region overlooked by Israeli snipers those who tried to return to the north were shot we ran for our lives from Ruthless bombardment despite the current truth we cannot go home we are still gripped by fear I am staying with more than 60 people in a school but we cannot go back to the north under any circumstances most of Gaza has been pummeled into debris entire Bloodlines wiped out the ceasefire was an opportunity to revisit destroyed homes or what's left of them Israeli snipers prevented people from digging Graves so that the truce at least they will get burials hospitals roads schools government buildings no longer exist hard to imagine how anyone will be able to return Israel's Onslaught means no hospital in Northern Gaza is functional many found hammers were no match for layers of concrete as they tried to recover the bodies of loved ones they lost a lack of fuel and destroyed roads means thousands of Palestinians remain buried under their own homes with colleagues killed and Equipment destroyed Aid workers are appealing for international search and rescue teams to come and help hallu the ceasefire was also an opportunity for Israeli captives to be reunited with their families 150 Palestinians in exchange for 50 Israeli captives in choreographed videos released by hamas's on Wing the kasan brigades fighters said goodbye to their prisoners goodbye goodbye but media interactions have been tightly controlled by Israeli authorities since the first interaction by this captive who was released last month my mom is saying that they treat them kindly and it's the opposite on the other side Palestinians who have been released from Israeli prisons have told everyone about their ordeal wiam isra Muhammad shuk have all talked about mistreatment abuse denial of communication medication and Basics such as food and food remains a major concern in besieged Gaza because only a fraction of required humanitarian Aid has been allowed inside a few hundred trucks each day are a welcome relief but it's not enough and will run out soon he's hopeful he will be able to go back home to school to his class but all of it is gone now a 48 hour extension means fewer burials but despite it being temporary gaza's hundreds of thousands of children know they will at least survive for two more days Usama B Javid aler make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
