want to go back to Rob Reynolds who's on the outside of the encampment uh he's been bringing us up to date from the if you like the police action on his side uh Rob tell us what is going on now right now the police are pushing the protesters back they're quite close you can probably see as they step aside the uh police in their uh clear plexiglass helmets and visors they've been moving this group of people uh steadily backwards uh and getting reinforcements uh from uh other other contingents of police and periodically they will stop and then they will move forward and push uh it doesn't seem that they've arrested anyone yet but they're getting quite close to where we are right now so we'll see if they if they make another move forward the uh number of protesters who are are still there linking arms and trying to hold a line has decreased greatly as the police have moved forward [Music] um we're just looking at some pictures from Reuters here on the other as you're talking to us and we can see we just a few moments ago we saw police officers carrying some sort of weaponry and aiming it at barricades I don't know what kind of Weaponry that would be um but it does look as though they things are beginning to get more tense because it looks as though somebody has perhaps been firing maybe a fire extinguisher or something towards the the police uh from the through the barriers and the police have seem to have stopped whatever action that they're that they're doing at the moment Rob do you get any sense from where you are that there are more police coming to back up the officers the lines of officers that are already there I think that there are plenty of police where I am right now to be honest and they've just knocked over a bunch of protesters um so we're slowly stepping backwards as well and I think the police are moving through now uh they're definitely clearing out this area those Flash Bank still going on going off all over the place moving back and police are saying move move move the pro uh protesters are pushing against the police police have their batons out poking them in the arms and in the sides rob you mentioned before you hadn't seen anybody being arrested is there any indication that they might be about to start arresting people we're hitting us we're not hitting them back no not arresting people yet just pushing them back trying to disperse them moving them step by step backwards with the constant concussion of those flashbangs um the uh the weaponry that you mentioned Rob that could be the um the the devices that are used to launch these flash Banks also to launch um uh chemical irritants tear gas or other types of gas it's not always actually tear gas but um those are they look sort of like guns but they're not actually rifles that may be what you've s you've seen I don't think that the police are using live fire at all I heard anything like that we're just trying to push these people back and remember these people that we're seeing here this is not the encampment we outside the encampment but these are people who are supporting the student protesters in the Gaza solidarity encampment yeah Rob we're just seeing pictures at the moment of a couple of people who been taken to one side of the uh from outside the encampment they've been secured by zip ties and they're currently kneeling on the ground I don't know whether they're being processed by arresting officers but they're being held at the moment tell us again you said that it was beginning to get uh more tense where you are tell us what's happening well uh the police are succeeding in pushing applying pressure and pushing these protesters back steadily uh from uh the line that they formed uh and you can see now here police are moving forward Rob this just back to what we were talking about before peaceful protest peaceful protest yeah sorry to interrupt Rob there's a delay on the line um this brings us back to what we were talking about before where the police are one would imagine very aware of how many cameras are trained on them at the moment and how they are going to their behavior in this situation is likely to be judged absolutely they I mean they're seeing our camera and uh of course everyone in the crowd has a camera in his pocket or her pocket and they're all recording as well so now this police line has passed through our position we felt it was best to uh not uh uh keep in front of them we're behind them now and you can see that they are pushing these protesters steadily backwards I think they will be trying to get them off campus Al together if that's possible we're just seeing some aial pictures now applying a lot of physical pressure yeah we're just seeing some aerial pictures Rob there's quite a lot of smoke that's coming around from the entrance to the that encampment whether it's come from the the residue of the fire exting extinguishes if that's what it was it might be the residue of the the flashbangs as well do give us a sense if you can of the the the mood and the atmosphere amongst the people who have come there to support the protesters how worried and concerned are they about this uh they seem to be generally pretty Ang angry um the people are shouting you know that they're peacefully protesting and being uh being roughed up by the police um and they are demanding that the police uh you know keep their hands off their our students as one their chance was um so this group of people is definitely um being uh very resistant to the police pressure uh their mood is pretty frenzied I would say right now this is a this is a high intensity High emotion moment and and you can just see how it's going there and you can see these police officers is uh just a lot of them and they're all in their protective gear there's a young woman in the front there being pushed steadily backwards people are filming with their smartphones and it's it's really it's quite a scene it's quite an amazing scene some of the officers in the back of this line with their um zip tie uh plastic handcuffs at the ready Rob tell us about the kind of people that were making up the crowds who were outside the encampment those who were there to supports those inside the camp a mixture of students and people from outside uh even ran into a couple of people that I'd met on other stories um some people who were wearing uh clothing with sort of anarchist uh symbols on them uh others uh who were wearing a lot of people wearing cfas um but these are people people who are very often um uh I guess uh often uh involved in protests because they they appear to be uh uh very used to this type of a confrontation with police one of the questions of course over the last few days is who else has been joining these protests on both sides uh of the barriers what's your interpretation of the people who have been there is there any indication that those who are supporting the protests are also the crowds there are also including people who are there possibly just to have a fight with the police because of course we have seen that elsewhere around the world yes that's certainly possible it I would say yeah tell us where to go just getting some uh from the police there to stay out of their way um certainly that's that's possible but I I think that the more striking um group of people who came not from this community not from this campus not from the student body or any of the faculty were the pro-israel uh rioter frankly who uh appeared here on uh uh uh more than 24 hours ago to violently attack the student encampment those people were definitely from somewhere outside of this community and they were bent on committing violence now um I can see a great deal of smoke over there as well let's just look over here if we can key and this is again this is closer to the uh this is the actual encampment a corner of the encampment itself and I can see lots of smoke uh Rising there you can probably see it yourself so this this the police appear to be steadily making their way through the encampment I no longer see the large Palestinian flags being waved that I saw all evening uh some of the boards in that sort of Palisade have been pulled down and we're going to try to get it little bit of a better Vantage Point Rob to start to try to look inside the the tent the uh the the camp itself Rob we have a shot here which is top right of our picture which is closer up to to the gate there closer to where you are we have seen officers there who have been firing those weapons you were talking about the ones we were discussing earlier that seem to be firing those weapons into the crowd as you were talking about unlikely to be obviously live fire it's very unlikely to be live fire it's very unlikely to be of anything of deadly force but certainly used in order to push the crowd back we're seeing more smoke uh being fired I think towards the the the police officers there again it may be fire extinguishers that are being fired there's a huge plume of it that's uh come over now but this is this is really the moment that it has been building up to for the last several hours as you've been telling us that there's you know we've been leading to this this moment of tension at which something essentially had to give after a a standoff for such a long time exactly uh this is this is the the climactic moment when uh the the police force use of force and the determination by the University Administration and other officials to uh solve this what they see as a problem uh you know this is what what is happening now um uh those uh projectiles they maybe they're probably non-lethal projectiles sometimes called rubber bullets that is uh a term that uh belies how uh painful those projectiles can be if one of them hits you they're they're about this big and they're they're hard like a hockey puck so that would be no fun to get hit with uh and uh uh police are are um allowed to use those of course and those would be used in preference to any uh live fire I think live fire would be used only in very extreme case if police thought that they were their lives were being threatened is not the case here Rob we're going to leave it there for the moment we can see some shots also on main screen there uh where we can see some more people who are being uh at least taken away their hands are being bound by zip eyes um we don't yet know as I say whether or not they're being arrested and processed they may just be removed from the the crowd we're going to try and
