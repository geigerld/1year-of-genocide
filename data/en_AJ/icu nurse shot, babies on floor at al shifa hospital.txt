well I'm joined Now by mads gilbertt he's a medical doctor and activist and he's also worked in the alifa hospital he joins me now from Cairo Dr thank you for joining us again on Al jazer I understand you are currently in touch with colleagues can you tell us what the situation at alifa is like now we knew the blackout was coming but not necessarily the strikes or the snipers well I think there are two aspects now important to understand number one they are surrounded by Israeli armed hes are shooting at the hospital we learned this morning snipers were shooting through the windows and into the staff uh we also learned that one nurse was killed in the neonatal ICU now they have I just got a received a message from Dr Marana abusada who is one of the senior surgant and he says 38 neonates moved now to cardiac surgery unit in main operating theater in open space not more in incubators because oxygen generator was damaged by fire uh strikes yesterday no electricity about 600 inpatients 28 ICU adults two of them in ventilators they are in the emergency room and u i i got this picture of the uh babies who should have been in the incubator there are no lying on the floor and the cic units and they are covered with some blankets in order to avoid hypothermia these babies should have been they they should have been in the Inc incubators of course and they risk death three of the neonates are dead and there are 39 now lying on the floor with blankets around who are at high risk of death so this is uh not an it's not a difficult situation it's a a horrible situation and um of course the this points to this humanitarian total failure and I'd like to underline one point more now we talk about the fire and the attacks on the hospitals and we need to discuss that and stop that but we have to understand that most of the the most serious problem now is 1.5 million internally displaced without water and food people are desperate and you know you can't live long without water they even taking water up from the streets and they're drinking sea water with sugar in so this is a massive failure of the international humanitarian Society who should have been there with water it's getting colder in us now they sleep under open air they don't have blankets for the children 1.5 million civilian Palestinians out in the open with no water and no food and the attacks on the hospital now the struggle or the fighting goes on in the north there is no no possibility they tell me to access the wounded or the dead so we will not have updated numbers on the killed and I get a flashback to the sa and shatila Massacre which was done in complete darkness for three days and I wonder where are the journalists I haven't heard from the Al Al jazer journalist in the north for many days and I'm very fearful that the there is an ongoing Massacre which will not be covered and we will not be able to see it but in alifa desperate situation no oxygen no food no water and of course absolutely no security for patients and staff doctor when you and I last spoke Ju Just a day or so ago you were telling me that when you've been there when when you worked there for 16 years you saw no Hamas military operations anywhere near the hospital facility what do you make of Israel's claims now its operations around the facility now I I have to be honest with you I'm sick and tired of these claims that there is H an Hamas Command Center we as I've said a hundred times we have never seen it we have never seen any high ranking Hamas people in shifa we've been able to ro freely all around I've never seen anything nor have my International colleagues um and um I don't think um the Israeli Army has any moral standard because the Playbook of war the Geneva Convention and the hog convention clearly states that hospitals are protected objects even if there should be some military personnel so these are the claims and they don't even need these claims because they have bombed rantisi theyve bombed n Hospital they've bombed the uh Al hospital without any claims of any Command Center so they seem to be attacking Healthcare as a part of their strategy and we know that from 16 years they've always been attacking Healthcare doctor what do you understand about the restrictions on on movement around alifa at the moment our correspondent earlier was saying that doctors can't even move from Department to Department why restrict people from moving within the facility why shoot through windows I think you should ask that question to the Israeli military uh officers and the chief of staff and Mr netan and most of all you should ask President Joe Biden why are your troops on the ground supported by the United States shooting and killing health personnel in the hospital when they try to save lives I'm not the one who should answer that question it's actually the Israelis because they are the perpetrators and also I think it's it's prudent to ask why are you not allowing water and food in is this a genocide in slow motion the answer is yes and I think the responsibility the complicity rests on the shoulders of the American politicians and the president and on the European politicians and their leadership who are Whispering some small protest this has been going on for four weeks now people are dying hour by hour people are starving people are thirsting in 2023 when is this going to stop Dr mad gilber there a medical doctor and activist who's also worked in alifa hospital
