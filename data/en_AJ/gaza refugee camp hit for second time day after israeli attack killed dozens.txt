all right I'm we must now go to jabalia some breaking news where there's been another strike another bombing there we're looking at the latest pictures this is a refugee camp in Gaza uh jabalia refugee camp in Gaza that was already hit yesterday that led to a massive loss of life and now we're seeing the latest pictures coming out showing the aftermath of what we understand to be another strike on this refugee camp after as I said a massive loss of life that was inflicted well within 24 hours all right let me see if I can uh bring in our guest back into the discussion sorry I had to bail out of our interview uh because we've got some breaking news here about another strike on jabalia refugee camp and as you're probably aware this is the second strike in 24 hours we had reports of a massive loss of Palestinian civilian life as well as according to Hamas the loss of some of the Israeli captives their lives in this bombing looking at situations like this how is this going to impact the claim the the legal basis of a claim that these operations are simply in self-defense it's going to be harder to make that case it will be harder but Israel can make it and it will depend on the circumstances of the particular strike I don't think that a court is likely to hold it proportionate uh if one uh alleged terrorist leader is killed uh and 50 innocent people are killed I don't think a philosopher or a lawyer would say that that was proportionate but you would have to look at all the evidence and no doubt Israel would say oh he could have gone on and killed hundreds more the court would also look at whether it had the alternative it's entitled I'm terribly sorry again I I have to cor up to my my sincerest apologies but we've got to go back to this breaking news situation now we're getting more details coming in and I believe we can go to alzer's correspondent he's of course a correspondent of Al jaaz Arabic where we can listen in we've got translation condensed together in a very small area and above all the concrete is not that strong some of these buildings are made up of many stories once shelled by the Israeli war planes not only a single building but the entire quarter is reduced to debris as you can see residents are running for their lives others are using bare hands in an attempt to rescue their relatives and families who are still trapped under the rubble as you can see the streets are narrow and it is very difficult for ambulance to access and many of the residents also prefer to stay home and refused the forceable transfer by the Israelis entire buildings are not fit for housing let alone that many of those those who had lost their homes in the past air strikes have taken shelter with their families or neighbors as a result if another building is targeted the number of victims is likely to double the Israeli war planes have stricken minutes ago and are expected to continue in the coming is uh has targeted this area with a barrage of missiles wave after another as stated earlier the war planes are carrying out intense wave of shelling using multiple missiles not a single or one or two and it seems that these missiles are of different sizes and weights they are heavy missiles Beyond one or two tons each these types of missiles cause deep craters and they massive large scale destruction as you can see entire buildings are leveled to the ground and deep craters are coed in the ground people are using their bare hands to rescue their relatives and families who are buried under the debris and above all no one could ever imagine that this deep crater was once a densely populated Residential Building the Israeli occupation forces are using these types of lethal weapons these types of heavy missiles even targeting small buildings residential buildings and that's why the aftermath is huge and the number of fatalities and victims is extremely large even multi sto strongly built buildings are reduced to ruins a pile of dust many are still trapped under the debris if you look at the volume of Destruction you can never imagine that these once were residential buildings Standing Tall it is clear that the Israeli occupation forces and war planes are using different types of heavy missiles different types of lethal weapons this particular Camp refugee camp in jabalia came under a number of strikes not only today some families lost more than 40 or 50 members of their extended families living in one buildings this area is the focus of the Israeli war planes it was targed by a many waves of intense indiscriminate Shilling using different types of heavy and lethal missiles as a result not a single building but the entire neighborhood the entire quter was reduced to dust we are expecting to that there are still hundreds trapped and buried under the debris especially that many of those who had lost their homes in the past have taken shelters with their neighbors or other extended family members and all those inside those buildings are no doubt not only killed but also Torn to Pieces we have been informed by many of the paramedics and sever defense rescue teams that after many air strikes they find body parts scattered all over the neighborhood sometimes they find different body parts hundreds of meters away this is yet another wave of air strikes by the Israeli war planes in discriminately shelling Residential Building leveling them to the ground with their residents underneath as I said jabalia refugee camp it is not the first time to come under attack it seems that the Israelis are knowingly trying to cause the maximum scale of Destruction and to cause the highest number of victims death or injuries in an attempt to force people to leave to the South and this comes as the Israeli planes also dropped some leaflets warning gazans to leave people did not even pick these lifet they turn the Blind Eye to them and they are adamant to hold their grounds that's why we see the highest number of victims at least as we speak at this moment even those who took Refuge to the center and south of Gaza Strip were not spared I assure you entire families their names were wiped off the register total families whole families were killed and many were injured this comes am made a total collapse of the health sector the Indonesian hospital was overpacked with maximum numbers of those killed and others injured we I have also since morning listened to pressers from Ala hospitals and the Turkish hospitals that is treating cancer patients they all announc that they are almost ran out of everything even fuel in a few hours they will come to a total grinding halt all right we can now bring in on the phone ham Dan he's the spokesperson for Hamas first of all tell us what you're hearing from your sources about the casualties in this attack on jabali refugee camp well uh from our sources we are talking about 400 marital more than 100 under the r and the injuries are in a very bad situation so we expect AR rise of them number of the maranam people and can you tell us earlier we had a statement from H Hamas saying that there were a number of captives Israeli captives and foreign captives who've been killed in the first strike on jabalia do you have any idea if this second strike has caused more casualties amongst the captives well till now we can't talk about that uh uh definitely because you are still counting the the numbers and people uh we are still trying to find the people under the rubble so maybe at the end of that tomorrow we can talk about the exact numbers maybe some names but till now we can't talk about that in a definite or exact numbers and names how many captives do you have left at this point do you know I I can't give you a number because exactly we don't know uh how many were there uh under the the bombing uh some of them were moved here or there so we don't know exactly whether they were moving or not so I think it's better to wait a little bit and we will know and that that brings us to say exactly that when we said that those captives are uh treated like hostages uh sorry like guests not like hostages uh it it shows uh that directly when they bomb the houses of the people there is a very big chance to kill some of those people of those captives because they are not in jails they are not uh with the war prisoners I mean the army they they are just with with with normal people in their own house in their houses so this is why there is ities and people were killed through those strikes not to underplay the massive loss of Palestinian civilian life that we are witnessing but also I want you to tell me what this attack not only does to the Palestinian civilian life what does it do to the prospects of a deal with Hamas to release more of the Israeli and foreign captives that you have these repeated strikes on jabalia and other civilian targets well the strikes and the civilian targets targeted by the Israelis is not part of um keeping those captives or the war prisoners it's a process it's in fact it's a process done by the Israelis to make more pressure on the leaders ship of Hamas and on the militants in the field and is it making a deal more or less likely well I think it will make it less likely because continuing killing the Palestinians you may kill most of those captives which maybe with Netanyahu it's spit up but killing more captives uh that will complicate more the issue killing the Palestinians is complicating the issue and I here I have to say that nyaho is not fighting the war of Israel he's fighting his own War because he knows well after this war he's going to jail this war make an end for his political life so he's trying to complicate the situation making more longer as he can it may create chances for him to escape from the jail so I think he's trying to gain more time for his own purpose and this is why I think it's not likely to achieve this kind of M there is a need for a pressure on Netanyahu and this pressure must be done by the United States no one else we know that there is another diplomatic process going on in which qar is mediating we've seen the Rafa border open today for a limited number of Palestinians is there likely to be another agreement involving all the parties Hamas Israel and Egypt in order for more Palestinians to leave and also for Essentials fuel water and other Basics to enter Gaza well there is there is a very big Force done by Qatar in order to achieve that bringing in the essential needs including medicine and uh uh fuel but till now that is opposed by the Israelis and they are trying to undermine all those efforts we know that all the parties accept that effort and they are reacting positively with that except the Israelis so we are we are in fact we have said that clearly uh yesterday when abua came to the media and he said we informed uh the mediators that are ready to release some of the captives in the coming few days he said that according to the efforts of qar uh but I I'm still thinking or believing that the the one who is undermining all those process or trying to undermine the process is the Israeli side let let me ask you what will it take from your perspective what are hamas's demands in order to release the captives you have what are you asking for on the table well it was clear our position is to allow all the essential needs to enter to Gaza including the fuel and the medical uh needs uh and uh there was a clear uh position we need time to bring all the people together sending them uh to the mediators to take them through the Red Cross this is why the Israelis are trying to uh undermine the process they they they don't want the essential needs to go through rafaz and also they they prefer to continue their bombing to Gaza instead of giving some time to bring those people together they thought this will at least make the Palestinians in G they have some breath uh they they they they don't want the Palestinians to breathe they want them to keep under the all the time until the military operation is ended which I believe it was in the first few days uh not as good as they expected all right we'll leave it there thanks so much Sam Haman for talking to us I'm joined Now by safah he's in Gaza but he's using an international SIM card so he can actually speak to us because we know the communications have been spotty in Gaza today sofat this is a very densely packed refugee camp in a very densely packed civilian area talk us through first of all what you know about the aftermath of this strike no safad if you can hear me talk us through the casualties well we just news about new bombardment and alja neighborhood which is one of the crowded neighborhoods in jabalia refugee camp it's uh it's the opposite of the yesterday I mean in terms of directions uh yesterday one was in uh southeast of jabalia but to day one is in the north west of jabalia refugee camp we we are trying to contact our uh sources and our relatives in jabalia but because of the black we could not reach or get more related information all right sa we're going to come back to you in a little bit
