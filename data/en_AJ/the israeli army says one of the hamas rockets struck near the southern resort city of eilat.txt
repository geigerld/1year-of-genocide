the Hamas has fired two powerful Rockets towards Israel the Israeli Army says one struck near the southern Resort city of aat about 220 km from Gaza it is the longest range attack by Hamas since fighting broke out on October the 7th the group has claimed responsibility and there are no reports of casualties at this stage Israeli media is reporting that another rocket exploded in midair near the northern city of hia Teresa Bo is live for us in ashad that's about midway between Tel Aviv and the Northern end of the Gaza Strip Teresa what's the latest where you are well every day there's Rockets being fired from Gaza uh towards Israel and most of them are intercepted by Israel's defense system the iron doome some of them can be deadly though in this case what we know is that alasan brigades announced in in a statement that they launched a Rockets towards the southern city of aad that's over 300 km away from where we are that's the longest range that a rocket has gone so far the other thing that we've been hearing is that the Israeli military claims that they have foiled an attempt to infiltrate Israel from the sea apparently there was a shaft with Palestinian Fighters that Israel was able to intercept they were coming out of Gaza two Palestinian Fighters were killed during that operation according to Israel and this is happening while there's been hundreds of thousands of soldiers that have been deployed all around this area hundreds of Tanks all in a way located outside of gasa getting ready for this anticipated ground operation that's supposed to be happening soon it's not clear yet why it's being delayed it could be the over 200 uh captives that are currently being in in Gaza that the negotiations are ongoing also the influence of the United States that is increasing military assets in the region in case that there is a broader conflict what is what's been going on is that this delay has also tensed the relations between the government and the Minister of Defense while the minister of defense is saying that the troops are ready to go in the government in a way is not giving the order and that of course generates lots of tension here in this part of the country meanwhile the air strikes that we have seen continue in Gaza one after the other with mounting civilian C casualties an enormous humanitarian crisis in the in the country right now with you know our colleagues reporting on the desperate need of Palestinians living there it's not clear yet what type of an offensive it's going to be whether it's going to be a massive offensive or Special Operation rats that's something that we've been hearing just a few days ago there was a special operation not far away from where we are one Israeli soldier was killed during that special operations in inside Gaza and that's why in a way what shows how challenging this whole operation could be alaz is Teresa Bo reporting from ashdod thank you very much Teresa
