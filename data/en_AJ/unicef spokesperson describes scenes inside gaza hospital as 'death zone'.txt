let's now go back to the ground in Gaza now where Israeli strikes as you've been hearing have intensified 300 Palestinians have been killed in the past 24 hours I'm joined Now by James Elder he's unicef's Global spokesperson he's currently in conun in the southern part of the Gaza Strip James I understand you've been traveling around the strip both in the North and the South can you tell us what you've seen I tell you what I've seen in the last hour here at Nasa Hospital hospital is is death and destruction the hospital it's it's Panic uh because everywhere you turn there are children with third degree burns with shrapnel with brain injuries with broken bones there are mothers crying over children who look like they are hours away from Death there are medical workers who who run from wounded child to wounded child there are bombs that have been that have been Relentless this is a hospital it's it's it seems like a death zone right now James we know that the hospital situation has been dire all across the strip what sort of Aid is getting in at the moment you're talking about people being crammed in there are they receiving any supplies to help there is no way you can say that the aid getting in is a meaningful amount it's simply not possible under this level of bombardment no Aid today able to go to the to the north you know UNICEF wh onra getting Aid to the North over the past days that hasn't happened food water food water medicine is what we keep trying to do and continue to try to do that but the the the amount that is required is not possibly enough and that then speaks to the second threat that these people are facing and that is one of disease I talk to doctors all the time that the bombardments are a very real threat to children they are killing children pretty much as you and I speak the secondary one now is disease we risk seeing just as many children and and I shuted to say that die from a lack of water a lack of protection a lack of Sanitation on the ground that is the reality just in this hospital now as I walked around and had people grabbing onto me saying please stop the War I had children holding my hand with empty bottles of water in a hospital seeking water that's the level of desperation and we are well aware it's what needs to be met for that to happen how about they stop sending in rockets and allow us to send in supp Li well let me ask you about something else that's compounding the situation there James we've been hearing about these leaflets being dropped in kanun people who've been ordered to move being ordered to move yet again so many observers have been talking about how part of Israel's strategy is forcing people from their homes forcing these families with their children to be mobile what has that done to the social fabric there smashing it smashing a beautiful society that is utterly rich in warmth and generosity and culture it is it is being smashed it is it is like they're playing a game of chest and moving people from place to place it's not a game and it's ending in massive numbers of children being killed these so-called safe zones this is a very important false narrative that is being shared these so-called safe zones are moving people to Tiny pockets of land that is stand where there is no water there is no sanitation there is no protection from the elements these are not safe zones these will be zones of death they are not scientific they are not rational and they are not possible and I think that those people who are calling these safe zones are well aware of that it is callous and cold it is calculating and we need to call it for what it is otherwise we are going to see an addition to the thousands and thousands of boys and girls who've been killed the hundreds here now screaming with wounds of War we're going to see the same numbers now killed by disease James you've been talking to children in the hospitals there playing with them during the ceasefire when there was a brief moment of respite what have the children been telling you what two two one one thing I really noticed today I hadn't been here yesterday just in 36 hours the Panic levels have multiplied yeah many more people crying many more children now just just just shaking holding my hand but not in the same way not to play but just to hold to hold someone again this can can you be safe so when I talk to them they line is simply again stop the war take us somewhere safe as a little boy said to me there please where is safe tell me where is safe now what to tell him that it's this false narrative I can't I can't tell him that these creation of safe zones are death zones so you now see the fear and the trauma we talk so much of trauma that is taking root in this entire generation and all you need to do is to walk around and see those children as they shudder from the bombs as they look to their brother who's lost an eye or got horrendous wounds this is trauma this is what these children a generation that we probably haven't seen since the horrors 65 years ago this generation that offers so so much the 21-year-old medical student I spoke to who bought her stethoscope and her coat and wants to go and be a doctor but said right now doctors are only burying people she wants to save people the young man I met in jabalia who learned perfect English and electrical engineering from the internet and build himself an electric bike and sells good and repairs people's solar panels for free this is the youth these are the PE the children of Gaza who are being killed this is a generation being decimated in body and in mind James I can hear the anger and the frustration when when you talk to me from there I understand you're a father yourself can I ask how what you've seen there in the Gaza Strip how has that affected you as a parent every story here any any person not for me just as a parent any decent person will have their heart broken into pieces by the stories of children because everywhere you turn they have them and because they're so articulate because the literacy rate here is so high so you combine a child or a Young Person's you know big heart with a beautiful brain and they can articulate how their dreams are being crushed very clearly that is is devastating it to me it would be embarrassing to speak of my own feelings here I can leave this place yeah I can leave they people cannot leave here they are not they are they are not safe so and you know for me for me to talk about my own situ a let's talk about the 100 United Nations colleagues I've got the 100 people who more than unra colleagues who have been killed the largest number of United Nations workers killed in a war in the history of the United Nations in the history of the United Nations in a seven or eight week period this whole thing is immoral it will surely be seen to Illegal it be illegal it is as I walk around there now it is a blood bath I feel these safe zones are trying to prepare a narrative for continued massacres of children silence is complicity we have to know that there must be some people who have sway here they need to know their silence is complicity so yeah for me and I'm I'm sorry that my my my voice and emotions um probably mean I speak too too quickly it is it is utterly devastating to see and as UNICEF we continue to do everything we possibly can but we know we know full well until they stop the bombs there is a futility to that and that is that is infuriating James Elder there unicef's global spokesperson speaking to us from the ground in the southern Gaza Strip thank you so much for joining us on Al jazer James and and sharing your work and your
