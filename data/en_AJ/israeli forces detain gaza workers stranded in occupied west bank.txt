Israeli forces have raided a school just north of Hebron in the occupied West Bank dozens of Palestinian workers from Gaza have been Sheltering at that school and they had been unable to return home since the war broke out and Israel closed the Border let's get more on this from Nida Ibrahim who's in rala for us in the occupied West Bank nid what happened to that school why was it raid well let me just give you some context about those workers who have been kicked out from their work and they've returned to the occupied West Bank some of them returned to ramala when the numbers started increasing the Palestinian Authority was trying to move them in different locations to provide them with shelter and provide them with the uh food and and everything while they're watching the difficult scenes of their families that are taking place because of the bombardment in the besieged Gaza Strip now what happened overnight is that an Israeli that the Israeli forces have raided the school that they were Sheltering in in habon and arrested 30 of them so according to many of those workers who have been in ramala they've been scared of that that the Israeli forces would arrest them there's no uh uh for them they don't know why they're being arrested some of them have lost their families already in the bombardment so you can imagine the amount of fear the amount of pain that they're in because they're away from their families and watching their news only on TV so we are not sure why they've been arrested but we know that the Israeli forces have arrested also other people in habron and they say that they uh have been affiliated with Hamas so you can imagine the intensity of the situation and the feelings of those workers who cannot go home but also are being arrested while they are in the occupied West Bank nid we're also getting reports of a Sittin happening what can you tell us well there's a weekly sit in by the families of Palestinians prisoners that takes place for years now that has been taking place on Tuesdays but now it's taking a bigger importance because the families are saying that they've received news from some Nos and some human rights organizations working here saying that there's a limited access to electricity and water for those Palestinians who have been detained in Israeli jails and indeed we've seen Israeli politicians talk on Israeli media saying that they're going to cut electricity cut water to the Palestinian detes withheld by Israel and as the numbers of those Palestinians increase now we're talking about 600 people since the beginning of the escalation who have been rounded up by Israeli forces you can imagine that more families are worried about the futures of their sons they're not sure how uh their their living conditions are and we've been reporting in the past that some of those Palestinian prisoners say that they've been subject to torture so they have been subject to humiliation so it's really hard now for Palestinian families because they're not having visitation to their sons to know what's happening inside the Israeli prisons but there's a lot of fear and that's why the Palestinian families are protesting now to kind of shed light on the issue of prisoners they fear that while eyes are on Gaza that the Israeli forces are going to be imposing more restrictions and more measures against Palestinian prisoners n Abraham reporting from ala in the occupied West Bank thank you very much
