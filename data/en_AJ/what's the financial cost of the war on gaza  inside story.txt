feeling the heat of the war on Gaza Israel says the fighting is costing it millions of dollars every day and the devastation in the strip is unprecedented so what's the real cost to both sides and what's the impact in the region and globally this is Inside [Music] hello and welcome to the program I'm Tom McCrae a depleted Workforce the closure of schools and businesses and now spiraling military expenses economists warn the cost to Israel of its war on Gaza will be unlike anything it has experienced in decades Israel's declaration of war more than three weeks ago following a surprise attack by Hamas has jolted Global Financial and energy markets now International financial institutions say the ongoing conflict will have bigger more severe risks for the global economy we'll be discussing those issues with our panel in just a few minutes but first this report by Cara Le day after day Israel's devastating attacks keep coming under siege by air sea and land Gaza faces a humanitarian and economic catastrophe but as Israel escalates its military offensive the war on Gaza is also hitting its own economy since Hamas launched its operation more than 3 weeks ago Israel's stocks and currency have fallen many of its businesses and schools remain closed and International Airlines have canel flights now its government has been forced to roll out a major wartime stimulus program that's expected to raise public debt already three credit rating agencies have warned Israel's creditworthiness could be downgraded with the S&amp;P Global ratings agency changing its Outlook from stable to negative that hasn't phased this man Israel's Finance Minister who says he doesn't yet have a full assessment of the cost of the war after announcing the national budget was no longer relevant the cost of war is expected to increase Israel's near $500 billion economy is one of the most developed in the Middle East it's expected to contract by 5% in the final quarter of the Year known as the nation for startups it's tech industry that accounts for 18% of its GDP and half of all exports is suffering production at a major offshore gas field that's reported to provide 70% of the country's energy needs has stopped and its currency has lost value against the dollar almost every day for the past 3 weeks hitting an 8-year low with a cost of War at around 246 million doar per day the indirect costs are expected to increase exponentially it's a very difficult situation it's a war uh uh people are uh lots of people have been drafted in the Army and left the job market uh there's there are uncertainty there are concerns uh that reduce people incentives to invest both uh outside money coming to Israel and and internally US president Joe Biden has pledged an unprecedented funding package for Israel but the fate of that request rests in the hands of Congress the World Bank has also warned that the global economy is at a dangerous juncture and facing what it called real risks Cara leg for Inside Story let's bring in our guest now in West Jerusalem is manim Klein professor of political itical science at Balan University he is also the author of lives in common Arabs and Jews in Jerusalem Jaffa and Hebron in Colchester is Natasha Linate US policy and foreign policy specialist she is the Deputy Dean in the department of government at the University of Essex and in Alexandria Virginia is Yousef Mania head of the Palestine Israel program and Senior fellow at the Arab Center a warm welcome to all of you thank you for joining us here on Inside Story maim if I could begin with you uh first of all we heard that it's costing Israel 246 million us a day how big is the financial burden on Israel as it carries out this war the Israeli oper War operation cost a lot I'm not an expert on security F Financial issues but uh the imagine that the whole economy is STO the tens of thousands of productive people are recruited and deployed along the borders so the whole economy is in hold and the Israeli shekel is losing VAV V the American dollar so it's a huge huge burden on Israeli economy what what was maybe uh cannot be re repair or be be come back within a short period Natasha we've heard economists War warn uh it's saying that the cost of Israel will be unlike anything it has experienced in deca ades do you think that the people there and the government is prepared to pay for this war in the long term are you speaking of the government of Israel yes I I think based on what Netanyahu has said that they are incredibly determined uh and that there's no turning back uh from what I've heard it's been described as their own 911 if you were to compare uh the US spent two trillion the war on terror uh in response to 911 so when there's been a trauma often governments get behind sometimes incredibly expensive uh War efforts uh to to address the the trauma that the public may feel whether that is wrong or right but that seems to be what has happened in the past and of course this has incredibly um detrimental effects on civilian death toll uh and escalation uh but I can imagine IM the resolve is quite strong Yousef we've seen the humanitarian toll uh that the people in Gaza have had have had to Bear over the last several weeks but what about Hamas in particular I mean where does it get its money from and its arms and presumably those are now getting reinforcements into the strip obviously is not going to happen because of the blockade uh and the closure of the borders completely what happens from hamas's perspective about having to continually defend itself against Israel from here well I think the short answer is we simply don't know we don't know where this is uh going we don't know how it's going to end uh we don't know what Gaza will look like if there if there is a uh Gaza at the end uh of the uh Israeli campaign there if you listen to some of the statements from Israeli officials talking about Annihilation talking about making Gaza a place that is unlivable um it's it's uh it's hard to to really imagine what uh what this place will look like when they are done we've seen massive bombardment with a huge percentage of the uh structures in Gaza being uh decimated of course this leads to to uh large scale depopulation as well um and there's no clear sense of when the people who lived uh in those places will be able to go back to their homes and if they will be able to go back to their homes so we're talking about a um a completely different uh Paradigm than the one that existed prior uh to October 7th in Gaza which itself uh was an a humanitarian crisis to begin with and an extremely desperate situation for most of the people uh that live there so um it's it's it's simply not clear what we do know is that the costs will be extremely high and those who are the most vulnerable in society will um bear the the the brunt of it man we know that uh the US has backed Israel wholeheartedly uh since the beginning of this war and it gives roughly $38 billion a year and there is another financial aid package has been proposed uh by Joe Biden's Administration how dependent is Israel on the US when it comes to this war obviously today we're talking financially so from a financial point of view from a financial point of view Israel is not only financial point of view but also on security wise Israel is fully dependent on the United on the United States also politically in the in un institutions um so Israel cannot let's say uh distance itself too far from the United States Israel must get now emergency uh Aid to maintain the war to continue the war and Israel must continue getting us financial aid and political help a backing actually uh the day after the key question is when the day after starts when we count the day after when when the war ends where will it end with the ceasefire will it will it end with Israel's evacuating occupied reoccupied Gaza STP Nobody Knows the Israelis it seems that the Israeli Administration has no a plan for the day after nor a definition when the day after starts I want to stick with the United States uh here for a little bit because they are so integral uh to all of this now uh the Biden Administration put together a $1.5 billion National Security package that includes military and humanitarian assistance for conflicts in Ukraine as well as Israel uh it uh said 14.3 billion of that is for Israel but now that there is a new Speaker of the House Natasha that uh the Republicans are now saying that they will put forward a bill that only focuses on aid for Israel how complicated is this all getting from a political point of view and getting money to Israel I think in terms of getting money to Israel because the Republicans are so adamant that they do want to support Israel and you see not just the Republican Elites but Republican support for Israel amongst uh the the public is is quite High uh and they're they're going to ensure that the aid that whatever military aid we're giving well whatever Ukraine needs may be up in the air uh Aid to Ukraine is probably not going to be up in the air they're going to try to push that through and you're seeing that there is some convergence here with Biden who has been a fairly pro-israeli president asking for 14 billion as you mentioned uh and the pressure really will be more on what happens in the war in Ukraine uh as Israel starts to need more Precision guided Munitions artillery rounds and shells this will going to come at the same time that Ukraine might be needing more sophisticated weapons as well and whether or not the US can produce both of these uh for both countries at the same time is is unknown but I think what we're seeing here with the the political climate in the US with the Republicans in control of the house and a more right-wing speaker uh Mike Johnson than than even in in the past if that's possible uh Israel would be the priority over Aid to Ukraine youf you're obviously in the United States and we have seen uh shows of solidarity rallies there for Palestinians uh despite the United States support of Israel what is the sense there uh in terms of long-term financially backing Israel here I think one of the important lessons from what we're seeing here in the United States in terms of the um uh dwindling support for um financing the Ukraine war is that Americans have become quite tired of supporting endless uh military engagements that they don't don't quite understand why they are taking place or why they are so important and now you know well over a year into the the you know uh war in Ukraine um uh more and more Americans are saying why are we doing this why are we spending money on this and I think you know while there is of course a tremendous political support for Israel here in the United States uh this is a message that you know Americans themselves are are are not not going to want to engage their tax dollars in an open-ended way especially when there is no clear objective no clear endgame in sight uh when it comes to uh what Israel is doing uh in uh in Gaza and I would say that you know we spoke a little bit earlier about some of the the costs here and Israel's Reliance on the United States you know the the Israelis fought a War in 1967 against multiple State armies and at that time of course they relied on on Western Arms but they didn't rely on Direct American intervention and today we see Israel you know needing effectively two if not more American aircraft carriers um to Stave off two non-state actors and so I think Israel has become more reli you know more more uh you know dependent on the United States today than it's than it's ever been and the costs of this are not just going to be economic they're are going to be political costs and policy costs uh as well that I think are going to reshape the way um Israeli policy makers thought about much uh of their of their you know security situation and their economic and political relations as well Natasha just briefly there's obviously going to be uh an election in the United States next year how big a part is financial package to uh Israel going to play a part in that election do you think I'm not sure it's going to play a huge part because we see other issues becoming more important whether it be the fight uh for democracy if it's a Biden Trump uh contest or issues related to inflation or issues related to The Border Americans have typically not prioritized foreign policy issues in in voting as much as some of these other domestic issues um but we'll have to see how things unfold I mean at the moment though much of the International Community is asking for a ceasefire and and very concerned conc erned about the plight of innocent Palestinian civilians the polling data that we're seeing in in the US is showing that Biden is in step with much of the public um you have even 72% of Democrats saying that they feel protecting Israel is important aspect of American foreign policy and 80% of of Republicans and only 18% of Americans thought that the Israeli response has been too harsh uh so I think it's possible if the war goes on and becomes very expensive it could be a drain there could be some fatigue but as long as US troops aren't directly involved I don't see this being a huge issue uh in the 2024 election because it'll be overshadowed by other domestic issues of course okay thank you I want to get back to point yeah of course Yousef yeah because I I do I I do think there are complications here especially when you look at sort of the demographic breakdowns and some of the the polling on this issue uh there are some key demographics that the uh Biden campaign needs to have strong turnout in particularly younger Americans who see this situation very differently than uh their their older counterparts um and I think that this is going to be a a real challenge for a Biden reelection campaign uh and add to that of course an Arab and Muslim Community here in the United States uh which is uh outraged over the Biden administration's approach to this so far and when you consider how narrow elections are here in the United States and how key constituencies can make massive uh differences in very specific States um it it it becomes a significant problem for a election campaign that relies on a large and diverse Coalition uh like the Democrats tend to do and rely on significant youth turnout as well so while the overall public opinion polling is supportive when one reads between the lines there are uh significant alarm Bells political alarm bells that should be going off in uh Biden Campaign Headquarters yeah I want to get back to uh the sense inside uh Israel now manim is there a discussion going on in Israel at this point in time a concern over how it will be able to pay for this war we've seen the Finance Minister come out and say that this year's budget is no longer relevant the S&amp;P Global r agency has downgraded the economic Outlook from stable to negative is there any discussion about this at all only limited discussion there is a growing awareness of the compensation of the the huge amount of money needed to reconstruct the destroyed kibuts and towns adjacent to Gaza Street they they are destroyed uh and add to that the evacuation of those places tens of thousands of people not only near Gaza street but also in the north along the Israeli libanon border so the people living in distance of up to five kilometers in the north were asked by the government to evacuate and go to hotels that they the government funds for them temporarily of course so much depend depends how long the war continues whether the War uh expands also to the north a second front opens between Israel and Lebanon add to that that this functioning Israeli government the Israeli government performance are very very poor due to to different causes and reasons um but but the the performance are very very full only in the last few days the Israeli cabinet appointed a coordinator for rebuilding the the the South the the kibuts and towns in South Israel so it will take much time and uh the Israelis will learn while walking and uh I I I don't know how it will end up no Natasha we heard a little bit there about a potential uh second front opening what would be the consequences of if Israel is forced to fight uh Hezbollah in the north as well as Hamas in the South well I think it would be catastrophic and of course it would be incredibly difficult for the Israelis to have to do this but I just worry about the War becoming even more internationalized Wars that become more internationalized of course have much higher civilian death toll and they go on for much longer uh I mean this would be the last thing uh that that we would need of course at a moment when we're trying to get a ceasefire to attend to the uh civilian uh casualties and humanitarian crisis uh facing Gaza where they're struggling to get food water and electricity uh and just basic needs met and if if we then get into a second front uh this will put a strain on any kind of effort to do this but then we also see that when International actors get involved uh the death toll just Rises as I mentioned yeah Yousef there's obviously the occupied West Bank which is another issue here obviously people in Gaza are living a nightmare at this point in time and there's the financial impact that this war is going to have inside Israel but what about for those Palestinians trying to earn a living in the occupied West Bank how difficult is that now and will it continue to be in the future yes well there's there are parts of the West Bank including in uh area C where some Palestinians live where the economic situation has for many years been more desperate than the economic situation uh in Gaza which is something we don't often hear about and can't really wrap our heads around um but of course the the military occupation in in the West Bank is debilitating for uh its uh economic prospects and um really deprives uh billions of dollars uh worth of economic growth from the the Palestinian economy in the West Bank you know since October 7th uh things in the West Bank have become have become much much worse um Israeli settlers uh who received additional arms uh from uh their supporters in the Israeli government have carried out numerous attacks against pales Ians in the West Bank this is uh something that has been escalating uh in uh recent months and years prior to October 7th uh and there is uh elevated violence against Palestinians now uh in the West Bank with over a 100 Palestinians that have been killed by their soldiers uh or settlers uh since October 7th this comes at a time where violence against Palestinians in the West Bank was at its highest point uh since um International organizations like the United Nations have been keeping track of of the statistics there on these things so the situation uh is extremely volatile uh and you know we talk about the possibility of a of a northern uh front there's of course the real possibility that there is massive destabilization in uh the West Bank as well um and we see a a spread uh of this across the entirety of the map not just you know uh outside outside of of Israel and Palestine but inside of it as well Natasha I'm sure that you've seen uh some of the huge protests the relies of uh solidarity for Palestinians that have been taking place right around the world I mean for example in London we saw hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people take to the streets and one of the main things that they are calling for uh is the UK to stop uh funding stop supporting Israel how much pressure is coming on these Western governments to pullit support of Israel and what consequences will that have do you think well there's certainly protests going around around the world not just London but are also uh in the US as well uh from from people uh upset about the government support of Israel and and wanting to take a tougher stand or at least in trying to pressure Israel to to respond with more restraint in in Gaza uh and to get some sort of ceasefire and to attend to to the needs of innocent civilians uh but whether or not that actually results in a policy change you know we've seen there have been many protests over conflicts over time if you look at the big picture it often only just to small changes of course there's counter examples where something actually works where the protest movement um is able to influence government but if we were to look at all of these different episodes of protest and and applying pressure on governments uh governments ultimately end up doing what they feel they need to do of what is their best interest uh in in these particular moments minim we've got a minute or two left I just want to ask uh for you to to sum up the sense of what it is like there in Israel does it feel like everyone there doesn't really care about how much this war is going to cost that they are willing to pay whatever price it might be as long as Israel wins whatever winning looks like the W the winning looks like um getting R completely from from Ham Hamas I I think that this is unachievable uh Israel can get rid of Hamas leaders but Hamas as an idea or an social welfare institution or employee in in Gaza as ad ad ministration that runs government agencies in Gaza it will be impossible and to to to destroy it will be a big mistake if Israel follows Bush junr policy in Iraq uh rooting or creating a chaos in Gaza will backfire Israel it's counterproductive Israel must think seriously how to cooperate with Gaza not how to destroy Gaza street but the Israeli mindset is is implementing Revenge yeah H very anger and frustrated without thinking politically on the day after okay thank you so much for your Insight we
