well early I spoke to toor wesland the UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process I started by asking him if you thought a ceasefire could happen soon in Gaza I cannot give you the timing for that but what I can say is that uh I have been working on this now since the immediate aftermath of the startup I met with the uh for minister in CYO Wednesday in the first week to have the assurances of Egypt's involvement in assuring humanitarian access to Egypt into the strip what the Egyptians have done is to provide for that capacity and uh now my I've sent my humanitarian coordinator there to follow that up and uh see is on the ground as we speak what does that mean are are you hopeful that soon Aid will be able to enter Gaza well we cannot have an effect distribution of Aid in gasa in the middle of a war we need the space to get that in and get it distributed to more than 2 million people on the inside so that is what we have been working on into the nres over the last uh days and that com Contin it do you think it's going to happen anytime soon I think it's going to happen and I hope it will happen as soon as possible well let's bring in now Palestinian journalist Han abuba who joins us now live from Khan Yunis in southern Gaza good to have you with us and you might have heard there the comments of the un uh special Envoy for the Middle East peace process talking about hopefully Aid coming in soon it can't no doubt it can't come soon enough tell us what people are facing right now in terms of the need for basic Aid like water do they have even water at this point in Khan unun M okay well uh thank you uh well the the situations right now are are just Agra aggravating due to shortage of essential needs we're talking about water supplies and food supplies and and medical supplies the three important essential needs for human survival uh I'll give you just an example of of people that I just talk to it takes them half a day a little over half a day just to get a few bottles of water and only to drink them I'm not talking about the luxury of having water running water where they can take showers and and wash wash their faces or brush their teeth none of this is present at all we are talking about only drinking water and in in most areas in the Gaza Strip from the northern part all the way to the South the South that was designated by the Israeli Army as safe place for for people to evacuate to has the same serious problem as the northern part now without a humanitarian passage or humanitarian Corridor as the UN Envoy describe it uh I think we are we are HED to a h humanitarian catastrophe in in the coming a few days if it's not already happening in some parts of Gaza all right and uh as you're talking I just want to point out stay with us for a second I just want to point out to uh our viewers we're looking on the left side of the screen of scenes really picking up in bayut we understand that's a demonstration taking place close to the US Embassy has bah called for a day of rage and we're seeing things apparently getting ready heated up and we can see Security Forces lining up there trying to contain those demonstrations so clearly what's happening hany in Gaza is moving the Arab Street at this point tell us a little bit about how people are coping now we see for example after the strike on alahi Baptist Hospital a lot of Civilian casualties being rushed to other hospitals but they were already running low on Basics do they have fuel electricity oh that that's right I mean hospitals across the Gaza Strip are running beyond their capacity I'm aware a shifa hospital is running five times Beyond its capacity other smaller hospitals like the one I'm I'm reporting live from it's a three times be Beyond its capabilities uh to accommodate patients let alone casualties of from from air strikes what the what the incident did it it created an outrage across the world I know there is a widespread condemnation of the attacks uh on on on the Baptist Al Hospital in the Gaza Strip what's important to point out the hospital was was sought by many people who were asked to evacuate the northern part and the and Gaza governorate and took it as a shelter to protect their families so what they did literally they sat in group by evening time each family gather its family members and sat in group either to have a little chat about the war or whether they were going to be safe or not or have us whatever food they had at that moment uh the the attacks shatter any sense of security to Palestinians so from where I'm reporting right now the hospital has been a sight for the past two hours a sight of two two major elements one that it creates a sense of anger and tears and sorrow for people remaining family members start pouring into the hospital collecting dead bodies of their family members who died died in the in the air strikes earlier today the other elements of the hos of of the scene here is more people despite knowing the danger involved in taking hospitals as danger as dangerous uh because due to the fact that a hospital that was uh taken care and and sponsored by by by a church was targeted and and and most civilians who were there uh were were killed despite that people are still thinking that it might be safe enough for them and not sleep in the streets so that's that's how it it it's a kind of ironic but this is the reality of how people are are thinking about right now all right thank you so much Hanny for relaying to us the situation there in the south of Gaza and we are continuing to look at those live pictures coming in from bayout where it seems like Security Forces is playing something of a cat and mouse game with protesters gathered in the Lebanese Capital we saw them firing tear gas trying to disperse demonstrators angry at the Israeli strikes particularly the strike on the hospital last night following which hasah called for a day of Rage we're certainly seeing a lot of angry seats playing out in Arab capitals like Beirut
