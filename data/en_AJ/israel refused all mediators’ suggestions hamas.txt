we're going to speak to Osama Haman he's a senior Hamas representative he's joining us on the phone thank you for being with us um in order to be able to get people back to the negotiating table the impression I get is that that there are going to have to be many more guarantees given by both sides but of course Hamas plays a key role in that what guarantees would you be able to give to ensure that Israel would stop its current attacks well in fact there is no need to talk about the guarantees from the Palestinian side including Hamas because we are the side who are is being attacked every day all the time we were we are bombed by the Israelis our civilians are being killed and the Israeli side who undermines all the efforts which which was uh uh going through in the last few days in fact every day in the last seven seven days of the temporary ceasefire Israel was uh acting in a way to undermine the whole process they attacked a few days ago they keep the fly the the air jets in the air two days ago and in in every day they are making the more pressure on the Palestinian side in the last night yesterday we were talking about the extending of the tber ceas fire we were very clear uh about some options which was uh uh suggested by the mediators we accepted three suggestions but all those three suggestions were rejected by the Israelis so what can you ask about more than this we were and we are still positive towards all the efforts but the Israelis who undermined all this and I think they relay on the support of the United States especially after the visit of blinkin to the region MH I understand that Qatar and Egypt as well as the us but particularly katat and Egypt are working hard to try to restart some sort of negotiating process have you been in contact with Qatar and Egypt with regard to that negotiating process uh yes we are still connected and we heard from both Qatar and Egypt that they will continue their efforts uh we we we supported that and uh we we've told them both that we are ready to be more positive but we have to be sure that the will of the United States is really to have to make an end for the Israeli attack against the Palestinians and against Gazza because everyone knows that the things were going with some obstacles but when blinkin had his uh last visit to the region with with his uh uh statements it was clear that the the the the the situation will be changed and that happened directly the the next day can I just be clear on what you're you're saying that you're acknowledging the efforts being made by Qatar and Egypt but if I understand it correctly you think it's the US which really holds the key to getting a ceasefire back on track yes we we believe that the United States is undermining the the process also and they are trying to get more benefit from this temporary cph and from the efforts from the Egyptian and the K side I think they are the most important key side who can make an in for the Israeli attack against G they can at least tell the Israelis enough is enough if you contined like this we will not send weapons to you we will not protect you in the Security Council but they are still protecting them in the security Council they are still giving them the the green light to uh continue their attacks against GDA by saying they have the right to defend themselves and everyone knows according to the international law the occupier has no right to talk about selfdefense because he is the occupier he is the attack the attacker this is the international law if the United States respect the international law Israel has constantly said that Hamas uses Palestinians as human Shields given the level of intensity that we're seeing from the bombardments from Israeli military uh at the moment what can Hamas do to try to protect Palestinians in Gaza well as everyone knows the Israelis uh built all what they are doing on lies they have lied they have said that the hospitals are the centers for the militants of Hamas and it's the control center for the militants they took over all the hospitals they destroyed a shifa hospital and they found nothing they destroyed Indonesia hospital and they found nothing in fact they knew that there is nothing but they were lying in order to create a case which can uh convince the International Community that they have the right to do this now everyone knows that they are lying they are still talking about hamash using the civilians as Shields what about the Israelis who are attacking the civilians on purpose no one is talking about that no one is talking about bombing uh buildings with civilians no one is talking about bombing the the the the schools which raise the flag of the un uh where don't there is no militance there not according to Hamas but according to the intern to to the United Nation so I I I want to say that the Israelis are lying they are talking about that everyone knows that they have no evidence because this is not a fact it's only a lie the one who is using the the civilians to make pressure on Hamas and on the Palestinian leadership is the Israelis by killing more and more civilians including women and children we are now several weeks past the attack of October the 7th looking back at what has happened over the following weeks after that attack is Hamas still convinced that it did the right thing on October the 7th well uh the question is supposed to be is the Israelis are still convinced that they have to continue as an occupiers for the Palestinians is the International Community still convinced that he's supposed to prot protect Israel as an occupier is the United States still supporting the occupation for Palestine killing the the the will of the Palestinians to have their own dependent sovereign state with Jerusalem as a capital the Palestinians are defending themselves they can't do nothing more than defending themselves when they are attacked when they are being killed when they are Under The Siege when there are thousands of their children women in the Israeli jails what they are supposed to do they have either to defend themselves or to accept that and die in silent we will not die in silent we will resist the occupation we will do our best to to defend our national goals to liberate our nation and the question is supposed to be what about making an end for the occupation what about the liberation of the Palestinians from this incubation they holding of captives had given Hamas leverage in this conflict we have released many of those uh those captives how much leverage does Hamas still have in this conflict well I I believe we are not talking about the the situation as a leverage we are talking about the situation as a trive from the Palestinian side including Hamas to survive facing this occupation who is threatening the Palestinians with a nuclear bomb as it was said by one of the ministers in the cabinet this is the threat which we are facing and I assure you the bombardment in the last 50 days is twice double the hoshima nuclear bomb this is what we are facing and this is what we are trying to protect our people from so we have said from day number one the 8th of October that those captives they are not prisoners they are not war prisoners like the soldiers we are ready to send them back they are not in the hands of Hamas but we are ready to bring them from everywhere and to send them to their families the one who said no was n he expect that he can create a story about that everyone know was watching the the people who were released how they were feeling conf how they were talking about the treatment of Hamas while and on the other side the prisoners of Hamas in the Israeli jails are being treated badly six of them were killed in the last 60 days and all those prisoners are under a very hard situation this is what we are talking about uh Hamas is not trying to have leverage Hamas is trying to protect the Palestinians and on on their way to have their Liberation and their building their own independent state Haman is senior Hamas spokesman thank you very much indeed
