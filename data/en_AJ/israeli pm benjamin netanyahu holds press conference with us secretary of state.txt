and thank you to the American people for your incredible support for Israel in our war against The Barbarians of Kamas I thank you in English I want to thank you in Hebrew as fighting who is determined to evil forces from one hour to another we hear about the stories of horror and the stories of Bravery stories of horror say everything about them and the stories of Bravery say everything about us and this bravery will win Mr secretary your visit is another tangible example of America's unequivocal support for Hamas has shown itself to be an enemy of civilization the massacring of young people in an outdoor Music Festival the murder of parents in front of their children and the murder of children in front of their parents the burning of people alive the beheadings the kidnappings of a young boy not only kidnapped molested hurt attacked and the sickening display of celebrating these Horrors the celebration and glorification of evil President Biden was absolutely correct in calling this sheer evil Hamas is Isis and just as Isis was crushed so too will Kamas be crushed and Kamas should be treated exactly the way Isis was treated they should be spit out from the community of Nations no leader should meet them no country should Harbor them and those that do should be sanctioned Tony my friend I say to you I say to all of us there will be many difficult days ahead but I have no doubt that the forces of civilization will win and the reason that's true is because we understand what is the first prerequisite of Victory it's what you just said in our meeting moral clarity this is a time a particular time a special time that we must stand tall proud and United against evil Tony you are taking that stand America is taking that stand thank you for being here today thank you America for standing with Israel today tomorrow and Mr Prime Minister um I'm grateful to be back in Israel in this incredibly difficult moment for this nation but in fact for the entire world if you'll permit me um personal aside I come before you not only as the United States Secretary of state but also as a Jew my grandfather Maurice blinkin fled pilgrims in Russia my stepfather Samuel pizar survived concentration camps aitz doow maid donic so prime minister I understand on a personal level the harrowing Echo that hamas's massacres carry for Israeli Jews indeed for Jews everywhere I also come before you as a husband and father of young children it's impossible for me to look at the photos of families killed such as the mother father and three small children murdered as they sheltered in their home in kubats near Oz and not think of of my own children this was just one of hamas's countless acts of Terror in a Litany of brutality and inhumanity that yes brings to mind the worst of Isis babies slaughtered bodies desecrated young people burned alive women raped parents executed in front of their children children in front of their parents how are we even to understand this to digest this and yet at the same time at the same time that we've been shocked by the depravity of Hamas we've also been inspired by The Bravery of Israel citizens the grandfather who drove over an hour to a cubots Under Siege armed only with a pistol and rescued his kids and grandkids the mother who died shielding her teenage son with her body giving her life to save his giving him life for a second time the volunteer security teams on the kibbutzes who swiftly rallied to defend their friends and neighbors despite being heavily outnumbered and we're lifted by the remarkable solidarity of the Israeli people demonstrated in the long lines of people giving blood in the hundreds of thousands of reservists who've mobilized some rushing home from abroad people around the country opening their homes to fellow citizens displaced from the south the people of Israel have long and rightly prided themselves on their self-reliance on their ability to defend themselves even when the are stacked against them the message that I bring to Israel is this you may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself but as long as America exists you will never ever have to we will always be there by your side that's the message that President Biden delivered to the Prime Minister from the moment this Crisis began it's the message that I and my other colleagues in the government have delivered to our Israeli counterparts on a daily even an hourly basis it's the message that I bring with me to our discussions today and it's what I'll affirm when I meet with the members of Israel's newly formed National Emergency government we welcome the government's creation and the unity and resolve that it reflects across Israel Society we're delivering on our word supplying ammunition interceptors to replenish Israel's Iron Dome alongside other defense material for shipments of US Military Support have already arrived in Israel and more is on the way as Israel's defense needs evolve we will work with Congress to make sure that they're met and I can tell you there is overwhelming overwhelming bipartisan support in our Congress for security here in Israel and everywhere we will reaffirm the crystal clear warning that President Biden issued yesterday today to any adversary state or non-state thinking of taking advantage of the current crisis to attack Israel don't the United States has Israel's back we've deployed the world's largest aircraft carrier to the Eastern Mediterranean we bolstered the presence of us fighter aircraft in the region we're providing other support as well we continue working closely with Israel to secure the release of the men women children elderly people taken hostage by Hamas we're pursuing intensive diplomacy throughout the region to prevent the conflict from spreading and I'll be doing that over the course of my trip in the coming days too often in the past leaders have equivocated in the face of terrorist attacks against Israel and its people that's why we've been adamant with all countries in the wake of these attacks there is no excuse there is no justification for these ATR you heard the Prime Minister say it this is this must be a moment for moral Clarity the failure to unambiguously condemn terrorism puts at risk not only people in Israel but people everywhere look at what just happened individuals from 36 countries killed or missing in the aftermath of hamas's attacks Europe Asia Africa the Americas no region has escaped hamas's bloody reach anyone who wants peace and Justice must condemn hamas's reign of terror we know Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinian people or their legitimate aspirations to live with equal measures of security freedom justice opport opportunity and dignity we know Hamas instead of promoting the well-being of its citizens rules repressively and dedicates the resources it has to Terror tunnels and Rockets we know Hamas didn't commit its heinous acts with the interests of Palestinian people in mind we know Hamas does not stand for the future that Palestinians want for themselves and for their children Hamas has only one agenda to destroy Israel and to murder Jews no country can or would tolerate the slaughter of its citizens or simply return to the conditions that allowed it to take place Israel has the right indeed the obligation to defend itself and to ensure that this never happens again as the Prime Minister and I discussed how Israel does this matters we democracies distinguish ourselves from from terrorists by striving for a different standard even when it's difficult and holding ourselves to account when we fall short our Humanity the value that we place on human life and human dignity that's what makes us who we are and we count them among our greatest strength that's why it's so important to take every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians and that's why we mourn the loss of every innocent life civilians of every Faith every nationality who've been killed tragically the number of innocent lives claimed by hamas's heinous attacks continues to rise among those we now know that at least 25 American citizens were killed we joined families in Israel in the United States around the world in mourning their immeasurable loss nearly 15 years ago my stepfather who I alluded to earlier Samuel pizar came here to yadvashem to perform the mourner's prayer that he wrote to a company Leonard Bernstein's thirdd Symphony kades reflecting on the Unspeakable Horrors that he'd endured as a boy in the Nazi concentration camps he wrote that man though created in your image and endowed with the freedom to choose between Good and Evil remains capable of the worst as of the best of hatred as of Love Of Madness as of Genius in this moment where evil hatred Madness have once more taken so many innocent lives we must stand together resolve to confront what is worst among Humanity with what is best we must provide an alternative to the vision of violence and fear nihilism and Terror presented by Hamas that is what the United States will do standing with Israel working together with its people and all those in this region Who Remain committed to the vision of a more peaceful more integrated a more secure a more prosperous Middle East thank you very much the United States standing with Israel the message of support from the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin who's visiting Tel Aviv today he said we will be by your side always be by your side to the Israeli Prime Minister after the uh recent events the uh Hamas attack on Israel on Saturday which was followed by Israel declaring war on Hamas the uh uh prime minister of Israel for his part saying that um he thanked Americans for their support to the people of Israel and said he was determined to beat the evil forces one way of or another comparing Hamas once again to Isis which we've heard a lot in the past six days and said Hamas should be treated like Isis was treated let's bring in villain marks in Tel for us so vill we heard there from both leaders from Anthony blinkin and and the uh forign prime minister of Israel he they have met but there are more meetings I understand between blinkin and Israeli leaders talk to us about his schedule and what the US is hoping to achieve during this visit visit well a deeply personal set of Reflections included in that speech by Anthony blinkin the US's top Diplomat he will be meeting with a larger group of Israeli officials in the coming minutes I expect uh that will involve some members of netanyahu's cabinet and also subsequently a meeting with Benny Gant the former Defense Minister who of course has now joined an emergency government and together with Netanyahu and his defense minister yoab Galant will be integral to the prosecution of this conflict that Israel is now IM mesed in one striking element of that speech made very very clear by blinken was the need for Israel to follow all possible precautions to avoid civilian casualties something we've unfortunately seen several several hundreds of times over the course of the last few days inside Gaza I imagine that will be an issue that the United States stays focused on over the coming days and weeks as I'm sure many others in the International Community will do as well in terms of his schedule following those conversations with members of the cabinet he will then be meeting with the Israeli president isak Herzog also here in Tel Aviv before for traveling to meet with some family members of US citizens who are currently either missing or kept captive inside Gaza okay vilim for the moment thank you very much let's bring in our guest now tamame carm's professor of public policy at doha's Institute for Graduate Studies a specialist on conflict resolution and international Aid Tam as vill my correspondent said there we heard a very um personal statement from the US Secretary of said a deeply personal statement and very emotive language being used by both leaders by both Netanyahu and blinkin what do you make this uh well it's good for them I mean but for me where I see it it's a very infer rating speech uh that has uttered disrespect to human value human rights uh the chance of people to be treated equally no single mentioning of the 1,300 civilians by large that that that are being or were massacred in Gaza and and the The Continuous War now and massacring happening in Gaza total disregard for the other side the other Narrative of the story a speech full of uh misinformation uh narratives that you cannot sub support with any evidence heard again these things that we've been hearing the past few days Israeli babies legally behead but there's been no proof of any of this information it's just coming from Israel and the isra the soal Guardians of democracies uh of this beautiful Globe we live in uh cannot prove it I would say the best way to go leave it to the experts you have an international court of justice bring the court of justice let it investigate atrocities on both sides Palestinians are open for this the Israelis should be open for this why not to collaborate with an independent un body and give it a mandate to come and investigate not only this war everything from A to Z and then present its report to the International Community if the US is so Keen about uh respecting human lives for for everyone not for Israelis as we said now then then go go this path he did he did mention towards the end of his speech uh uh blinkin that civilian lives had to be uh preserved on both sides briefly mentioning the Palestinian like sidebar exactly that we're not we're marginal we're very marginal for them um secondly I'm not surprised from the speech uh and the way it it it was delivered it's an uh it's it's an elections year in the US you have the Democrats who have uh we're dealing with many challenges internally with a rising uh Republican Party Party Trump is back on the stage he's his rankings are high uh to be honest I failed also approach for Ukraine they have a crisis in Taiwan so the Democrats now this is their chance their chance is to become more Israelis than the Israelis and to go after the Israeli electorate and voters in the US to get their support so I also I could link this to that it's it's but but in total in total it's so depressing it's so inhumane and I think if there is any legitimacy left to the US in this region after this speech I think it's totally eroded I know Arab countries Arab regimes government they're silent we know the reality but on the popular level the street when you talk when you use this speech when you talk this language when you disregard the other totally and you uh you just spread lies and misinformation without any evidence people will have a moral stand and at end at some point this will materialize into something bigger even so this is not peace building this is not conflict resolution this is just increasing hatred more Wars more conflicts and it's it's it's just ugly and it's in inhumane so just to look at this from one side yeah t we also heard from the Israeli Prime Minister about what might come next he said very vague again about what the plan is going forward for Israel he did say however that the next few days are going to be very difficult what are you expecting in terms of Israel's ongoing response they said they want to crush Hamas to root out Hamas from Gaza is that something that's achievable today uh as we talk I mean if I mean Gaza is already experiencing It's Going Through Hell literally I mean literally now so I I don't know what more can they inflict on Gaza the entire strip is being whipped out uh massive casualties yes ground through ground sending like you know ground troops to invade Gaza of course it's it's possibly they will do it uh to what extent again it's more or less there is some vagueness level of vagueness that we don't hear a clear message a clear goal on what what's the future of Gaza is it toppling Hamas or is it weakening Hamas to an extent that it will never raise up its head again and it will be so overwhelmed with a devastated uh marginalized Gaza for the last for for the next coming 50 years I really don't know what's what's what's the deal and I and the deal for sure involves Regional part right the Saudis are there theatis are there the Egyptians are there they're very key player and whatever's whatever is going to happen in Gaza it will affect them and and and we hear that the Egyptians also are not very uh satisfied or happy with what they hear from the Israelis and they have serious concerns right so it's again I think now at this point netan is talking to his people he has a very angry Israeli society that uh and this speech and this language and this emotions serves this purpose it's just more or less like you know uh bringing bringing the society back and U and and trying to project leadership in times of Crisis but he's weak he's done he's done it's just opion poll today of Israelis who thought at least 56% of Israelis think that he should resign and have criticized his mishandling o of this crisis and the Palestinian issue overall you talked about the region and I do want to talk about the regional Dimension because we're getting some lines coming in just now that Israel has struck Damascus and Aleppo airports this is quite worrying it's quite concerning because we've already seen some movement on the northern border with Lebanon and now also uh it would seem Syria how how high is this threat today of a regional contagion it's it's very high but and and and it's hard to predict if if this will evolve into a regional war or it will just remain focused on Gaza it if it remains focused in Gaza Gaza will will U uh uh Gaza will pay the highest price for sure if it turns into a regional War I can assure you this speech will totally change the one we he now if hisbah enters the game Syria supported by Iran that's again I think it's an Iranian decision to give U to to decide whether to give a green light to hisbah and Sy to hit back or not but if this happens then the entire narrative and discourse will change because it will not be about beheading kids this misinformation or Isis or whatever then it will be the the region versus Israel and we will see new discourse of politics so but at this stage we don't know it's we don't know certainly a very concerning situation Tam Caro thank you very much for the moment
