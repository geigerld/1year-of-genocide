draft resolution has not been adopted this was a third attempt to get Aid into Gaza abstentions and this was the fourth the draft resolution has not been adopted Russia China and the United Arab Emirates voted against a resolution drafted by the United States meant to present a unified position on Israel's war with Gaza the final product doesn't reach any way the most basic standards of quality it still does not contain a call for a ceasefire it has no condemnation of arbitrary attacks on civilians and civilian objects in Gaza and there's no denial of the actions of forced movements of civilians the United States and the United Kingdom voted against Russia's draft the United States could not support yet another Russian resolution that was put forward with no consultation that failed to reflect the realities on the ground it is disappointing that Russia would rather try and score political points and further divide this Council than address the current urgent needs of Israelis and Palestinians the Russian draft echoing the UN Secretary General humanitarian organizations and the Arab League called for an immediate ceasefire the US draft for humanitarian pauses with neither of them succeeding the elected members of the security Council are vowing to try yet again with their own version Christen salumi Al jazer the United Nations
