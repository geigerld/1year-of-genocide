let's get the reaction then of Hamas and speak to Osama hamdan who's the senior Hamas spokesman he's joining us on the phone thank you very much uh Mr hamdan for joining us on Al jazer so the US president there saying that a temporary ceasefire in Gaza could be reached in a few days what is your reaction to that how realistic is that from hamas's point of view well unfortunately I I don't know how uh President Biden came up with this conclusion because the paper which was uh introduced by the American side in Baris didn't show any real world to achieve a ceasefire it was closely most closely to the Israeli position and um and anyway prime minister Nan yahu had said that there was no any kind there was no kind of an agreement with the American side on a ceas fire so I I I I am wondering why he is saying that and how he's saying that how he came up with this conclusion did did so did President Biden's comments come to you as a surprise did you receive an official proposal for a deal or not well there was no no official proposal as an American proposal but was delivered after uh uh the late Baris meeting and uh it was the the paper which was delivered after this meeting was an American ideas about what uh is supposed to be discussed nothing more than this okay well Al jazer we've been told that this deal would include uh the exchange of 400 Palestinian prisoners for 40 Israeli captives held in Gaza um can you confirm any of this was this part of the deal will Hamas agree to a deal that will allow uh for the release of 40 captives held in Gaza well this is the main problem how the Americans are thinking we are are talking about the ceasefire we are talking about uh the Israeli attacks to stop the Israeli attacks against the Palestinians we are talking about the starvation in Gaza how to make an end for this everyone heard Gallant at the the 9th of October talking that he will prevent food water anything electricity to the Palestinians in order to make them surrend for the Israelis so it is a will to do that starvation in Gaza and the Americans are talking about the The pronal Exchange we have to talk about the most important essential issue to release the prisoners in the open air jail the biggest open air jail in the world Gaza he has to release the people in Gaza to let the food come to them to to to to eat because we are talking about certain people who have died by starvation in the northern part of Gaza this is what how we see the hypocracy of the American Administration they are talking about releasing some Israelis while hundreds of thousands 2.4 millions of Palestinians are starving in Gaza what is hamas's main demand today Mr hamdan uh what would you uh agree to uh in order to have a a deal right now with Israel and make a a ceasefire a reality uh in Gaza in the coming days well we are we are the only side who is talking about the is fire while the Israelis are talking about Theos and the Americans are still talking about Theos our paper which was introduced for the mediators and for through them to the Israelis and the Americans talks about the ceasefire it talks about the lift of The Siege on gazda it talks about the the the the the Reconstruction of gazda and talks also about the prisoners exchange no one can talk about just only the prisoners exchange we have to start talking from making an end for the the the the suffness of the Palestinians as I have said in the most biggest open air jail in the world so Hamas today wants a ceasefire as you say not a pause you want a LIF of the siege of Gaza as well Mr hamdan we have almost 30,000 Palestinians who have been killed and who are under a lot of pressure today they are starving babies are dying malnutrition what are you willing to compromise on on on you know where can you be flexible to allow the the suffering of Palestinians to stop well I have to remind you that those Palestinians have been killed by the Israelis and those Palestinians are starving by the Israelis and by the hypocrisy and the support of the United States Administration so if anyone is talking frankly about making an end for this suffness for this King you have to make an end for the Israeli attacks against the Palestinians this is why Hamas is standing very sharp we want to make an end for the occupation and attack against the Palestinians because you can't guarantee the end of the suffness unless the incubation is ended this is why we are standing in this sharp position because Israel is killing the Palestinians for the last 75 years and no one is saying that everyone is asking the victims to be CM while they are being slaughtered this is a real hypocrisy in the American policy so so one last question Mr hamdan so is a deal near or not could they be a ceasefire in the coming days we hope to have a ceas far but it seems to me that neither Biden or Netanyahu are willing to do the the same thank you for talking to us AMA hamdan is Senor Hamas spokesperson joining us there on the phone well let's get the Viewpoint from Israel now and bring in Zan basravi from the Israeli Viewpoint I should say and bring in Zayn basravi who's in ramala in the occupied West Bank what are the Israelis saying uh Zay to to these hopeful comments from Biden well it seems as though at the moment the only thing Hamas and Israel seem to agree on is contradicting the US president Israeli officials spent much of the day downplaying these very as you say optimistic remarks from US President Joe Biden regarding ing a potential timeline for a ceasefire in the war on Gaza and in the last few hours we've heard from The Office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a statement he has said that quote since the beginning of the war I have been leading a political campaign aimed at curbing the pressure to end the war prematurely he says and on the other hand also getting support for Israel and in the statement Netanyahu goes on to quote a poll saying that Israel continues to enjoy widespread support support in the American public Netanyahu clearly signaling that as long as he enjoys American public support as long as Israel enjoys support in the US public sphere he does not have to do what the White House or what President Joe Biden says with regards to curbing the conflict or trying to be bring an end to the war in Gaza and just on Sunday on the US talk shows Netanyahu was also quoted as saying that deal or no deal and assault on Rafa on the besieged area of Rafa where so many people are Sheltering so many displaced Palestinians are Sheltering that will carry on regardless of how the deal does or does not go forward zann thank you for the update Zayn basravi live for us in ramala
