the un's relief agency in Gaza is warning that it will be forced to Halt all operations if Israel doesn't allow resumption of fuel supplies to the besiege strip the organization says that it could happen by Wednesday night when it is expected to run out of fuel the doctors in Gaza say that the health sector in Gaza is already at the point of collapse Julia Tuma is director of communications for unoa that's the United Nations relief and works Agency for Palestine refugees in the near East uh you're joining us from occupied uh East uh Jerusalem Juliet thank you for being with us update us on how much longer unra can keep going yeah thanks um the coming few hours are really really critical as we continue to push to get an urgent shipment of fuel supplies into the Gaza Strip if we do not get this shipment tonight tomorrow morning Thursday morning we are going to be forced to take very tough decisions depriving people depriving the communities that we serve from humanitarian assistance in the Gaza Strip very tough decisions can you elaborate on that well if we do not get fuel we are not able to drive our cars and deliver assistance we are not able to drive our trucks our meaning the United Nations trucks and go to the border and pick up the very little Supply that is coming through the borders we will not be able to send wheat flour to the bakery so people will not have bread this is for many many families the only thing they're eating right now uh medical facilities will not be able to operate water pumping station will not be able to go on it's a chain fuel for Gaza is is life and that chain is going to be interrupted if fuel doesn't come in and with that life for so many people will be interrupted as well will be cut short so you say this is what happens if you don't get fuel in the next few hours you know as I do that Israel has said there is no fuel going into the Gaza Strip they have not wavered on that they have not changed their mind since they posed a total blockade on Gaza do you have any hope of seeing fuel as you say in the next few hours no is always hope and equally there is need well do you have any information that there might be coming in I don't I don't so we just keep calling because the coming few hours are very critical remind us how many people are living in eroa schools and Facilities 600,000 people uh and the number continues to increase uh they have sought Refuge because they were forced to flee their homes uh in around 150 Andra facilities including many of our schools that we run in the Gaza Strip we turn those into shelters but we were forced to open other facilities that were not meant to shelter human beings like we have around 8,000 people living in a warehouse where we normally store our supplies I mean in that warehouse the conditions are absolutely appalling we have reports that 400 people for example share one toilet we are very very uh worried about the the spread of diseases among people who are Sheltering in our facilities because they're overcrowded because when we plan for the worst in in at anra we plan for four times less the number that we have right now in our shelters yeah we reported earlier what eroa has been saying that currently you're at four times the capacity that Uno is built for because of a sound issue I actually missed that critical number Ju Just the number if you could repeat it the number of people who are in unra various unra facilities at the moment 600,000 people okay uh specific question for you about the fuel the Israeli military spokesman Daniel hagari and you will be well aware of this has accused Hamas of stealing petrol from unra he said quote petrol will not enter Gaza Hamas takes the petrol for its military infrastructure can you speak to that is has Hamas is Hamas stealing or has Hamas stolen petrol and fuel that was earmarked for the United Nations agencies I can confirm that there was no looting or stealing of any of our supplies including fuel from can you do you have any idea on where that might be coming from I mean I don't want to get you to speculate but you we do need to address this cannot comment on on that I'm not in a position to comment on a statement or a tweet I cannot okay I completely understand it but equally I think you'll understand that I have to ask you the question so again it Bears repeating you're telling us none of the aid that goes into Gaza and that is destined for the United Nations goes into anyone else's hands am I correct about that yes because we are a neutral humanitarian organization we are what we call Direct implementers we have 13,000 staff members on the ground they take those supplies and they distribute them or use them for the benefit of the communities that we serve we have a very very tight scrutiny system that looks into to how is humanitarian assistance used for the benefit of the people that we were mandated by the general assembly of the United Nations to serve and can you guarantee that since you're in a territory where you know that is at War can you guarantee that none of the aid for the UN goes anywhere else we have been on the ground in Gaza for more than 7 decades we have staff members who have been screened themselves we have system in place for monitoring and evaluation and for um and for investigation we have reports that go to our donors on how the money is used and how the assistance is used we have been working in the Gaza Strip for more than 70 years now and this is how we've done it and we are direct imp implementers it means that the assistance that is given to people is given by United Nations workers who have themselves gone through a screening Juliet Tuma director of communications for unoa the United Nations relief and works Agency for Palestinian refugees in the in near East you told us 600,000 people are currently Sheltering in your facilities and you're going to have a major breakdown in what you can do if not a total stop on what you can do if fuel doesn't come into the Gaza Strip uh in the coming hours we thank you for your time today
