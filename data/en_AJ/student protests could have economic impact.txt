joining us here in the studio is Tamar kmut he's an assistant professor of public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies good to have you with us so what would the implications be of such a a boycott movement touching giants like Google Amazon Microsoft uh Sammy the implications would be significant uh especially on the long run if the momentum uh keeps uh uh going uh when it comes to this um but for me the human factor is the most critical Factor let's see who are these students these are students of IV league universities Elite universities most of them these are the universities that that provide the pipeline of employees for the same companies we're talking about the future leader of these companies so it's a critical juncture we're talking about a significant event to see these IV league universities rebelling against the establishment against the corporates so this might not be confined if these students are successful this kind of boycott divestment effort might not be confined entirely to classrooms and universities if they succeed of course of course because they're highly correlated with the workforce with the economy so and and when we see students who stand on principled values on ideas you cannot buy this buy this with money you know it's it's hard because this is a value system you are in conflict with an entire value principle system that this these students represent but ham do you really think they can succeed here given the forces they're going up against it's not going to be an easy battle but the train has left the station Sammy this is a snowball now it's a moving snowball and all what we wish for is for it to grow and grow and then we see a a huge shift in public opinion and a new realities is forming you know against this oppression uh talking about things spreading are we already seeing the protest at least spreading geographically now going more Global so interestingly um uh uh I think Europe uh h the first or early demonstrations and protests and now we see a huge shift I mean that the momentum is going to the US the US has become a center and because of the US uh symbolism and it's it's its positioning on on the world mapping I think now it's it's spreading all over the globe you know so we see it in Europe we see it in Australia and I think we'll see more and more I mean of course there's so many countries who already took a principal position to support Palestine China Russia other bricks country Latin American countries we don't we don't see they're demonstrating because their governments have took the right stand so but the problem is with the governments and the politicians who took the opposite stand or the wrong stand on this by protecting Israel so it's good to see this these students you know protesting and trying to put pressure on their governments to end this Bloodshed T bear with us for a second cuz talking about positions the politicians taking a position let's listen in to what Bernie Sanders had to say no Mr Netanyahu it is not anti-Semitic or pramas to point out that in a little over 6 months your extremist government has killed 34,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 78,000 70% of whom are women and children it is not anti-semitic to point out that your bombing has completely destroyed more than 221,000 housing units in Gaza leaving more than a million people homeless almost half the population Mr Netanyahu anti-Semitism is a vile and disgusting form of bigotry that has done unspeakable harm to many millions of people but please do not insult the intelligence of the American people by attempting to distract us from the immoral and illegal War policies of your extremist and racist government how significant is it when we see prominent us Jewish figures telling Israeli officials off for how they use the an anti-Semitism charge it is significant and and because of whose Bernie Sanders is I mean Bernie Sanders specifically represents uh he's a leader of a progressive movement uh of of especially of the young voters especially in the Democratic parties uh the Democratic party and I think there the the fact that he's saying this bluntly uh and accusing of insulting the the American people and even the Jewish people by saying this I think it's significant because it will just uh uh add more uh momentum to to the entire movement and historically let's remind everyone the Jewish people Muslim people Christians in this part of the region especially in pistan never had an issue of of of a problems of coexistence the problem of Zionism and Zionism is the problem here and this is something the US politicians have tried to deflect by equaling usism with anti-i anti-Semitism criticizing Israel with anti-Semitism and that's totally wrong the problem is with Zionism as a not with Judaism especially in this part of the world all right thanks so much Tam kmut bless
