Zone as the Israeli genocide War enters the eth month the Palestinians namely the gazans are reeling under starvation lack of Food Supplies lack of medical supplies the spread of malnutrition among children dehydration and fatalities not only as victims to bombardment but due to starvation and outbreak of diseases L alone the contamination and pollution caused by the overflood of sewage water many dead bodies are still trapped underneath the let alone many other dead bodies are still strewn on the roads the destruction of gas's infrastructure the absence of fuel has resulted in total sensation of sewage Network system as a result the sewage water has overflood without any possibility to treat or dispose of this water and with the rising temperature outbreak of diseases and epidemic has become a on the ground civil defense teams all across Gaza Strip are being targeted by the Israeli cupation forces total Destruction of all its heavy equipment as a result the civil defense is no longer able to remove the debris or recover the dead bodies buried underneath according to the international LA and human rights Charter famine cannot be used as a weapon against civilian population according to article 54 of the additional protocol to Geneva Convention forth Convention of 1977 that property infrastructure and basic necessities of Civilian populations must be protected it is prohibited to Target destroy or hinder the transportation of medical supplies or Food Supplies or to Target Farmland livestock or their produce it is also prohibited to T and or

officials can be prosecuted and brought to Justice including those who impair the delivery of relief Aid the practices and policies imposed by the Israeli occupation forces on the population of Gaza Strip can be characterized and called for criminal liability and we demand the immediate cease of hostilities on critical installation or Siege to deny the delivery of relief AIDS in a report issued in March n 2024 has come to the conclusion that famine is imminent un unless the Israeli hostilities are brought to an end and the civilian population are granted full access to food medicine and other basic necessities that's why why it is required to restore Health Service facilities clean water and sewage installations including electricity to the civilian population since March hostilities against the civilian population by Israel continued despite the fact that some humanitarian Aid was delivered to the northern part of Gaza Strip it is yet not sufficient to cover the people's need or meet their dire need for food we the undersigned we call the United Nations and the Palestinian Authority to declare Gaza Strip as a famine and pollution striken Zone as populate pollution and diseases are on the outbreak this declaration must be adopted by the Palestinian author as well as the United Nations together with the local Regional and Global community and an emergency plan put in place to address these issues to allow the unconditional delivery of relief Aid into Gaza Strip and above all bring all those responsible for the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity be brought to just we call on all human right activists and all those in support to sign this petition in order to be presented to both the Palestinian Authority and the United Nations until Gaza Strip is fully declared a famine strien Zone Long Live Gaza thank you just a note for you we have collected hundreds of signatures and we hope that this number will reach thousands if not million

being here today and your uh the full coverage by the mass media this is expressive of our consciousness of the Grave danger hovering above above Gaza gazans and the entire region it also reflects the significance of the message the appeal launched today from here to urging the International Community particularly the United Nations to immediately act and declare Gaza as a famine strien Zone in order to help whatever or and whoever left from among those in Gaza and instead of bringing the Israelis War crime genocidal War into to an end the Israelis continue to defy the international criminal court the international court of justice and the entire Global Community continuing with their genocide War the most heinous of which was witnessed the day before when civilian tents were bombed by the United States made missiles where we reiterate that the United States is an accomplice in this crime as they continue to support Israel and provide them with weapons and arms and above all total political and diplomatic cover let alone the military and financial support for the Israelis to continue to perpetrate killing and destruction among our people in Gaza the international humanitarian law stipulates and provides for protection to civilian populations under occupation and population civilian population at the times of war the human rights Charters all of which without exception Safeguard human's Right to Life Health Care and food including portable water the international Declaration of Human Rights was clear in its wording including its 30 articles the international Charter
