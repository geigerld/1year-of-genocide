Israeli defense minister says troops pulled out of Gaza to prepare for future operations including an offensive on Rafa now earlier the Israeli military said it had withdrawn most of its troops from the canun area in Gaza leaving behind just one Brigade and this is the devastation they left in their wake Israel says the pull out is in order to recuperate and prepare for future operations it comes 6 months after Israel launched its war in what the international court of justice says is a plausible case of genocide the assault began after Hamas attacked Southern Israel on October 7th killing more than 1100 people and taking over 200 captive now since then Israel's bombardment of the strip has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians nearly half of them children and another round of ceasefire negotiations is set to resume in Cairo on Sunday delegations from Israel and Hamas are expected to attend well meanwhile domestic pressure is piling up once again on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over his handling of the war in Gaza now these are live pictures from West Jerusalem thousands of anti-government protesters are demanding the return of captives that are held in Gaza now 6 months since the war started they say the ceasefire negotiations are not prioritizing captives lives okay let's bring in Rory chellin who is is at those protests and Rory uh meanwhile you know it's another night of as we've seen there uh anti-government protests how big an effect are they having is Netanyahu impervious to domestic pressure as well as the international pressure that we have seen him under in recent days well so far he seems impervious to domestic pressure he referenced domestic pressure in the speech that he gave ear on today where he said that the protesters who have been taking to the streets of Israel for weeks and months well for half a year now since October the 7th well they should be focusing their attention on Hamas not on uh trying to unseat him as a prime minister there are two different strands of protests going on at the moment in this country one is the Strand that I'm at at the moment now these protesters aren't necessarily calling for Netanyahu to step down this is about bringing the captives home this is about getting their loved ones out of Gaza and back to their families these protests have been going on uh week after week month after month since October the 7th the other strand of protests going on at the moment uh is the anti-government protests and that is much more political what they want is for uh elections to happen as soon as possible uh and elections that all the polls suggest that Netanyahu and his coalition government would lose earlier on this week we saw for the first time those different strands of protesters coming together there were big protests in Tel Aviv uh at the beginning of the week three nights of protests and in Jerusalem as well that some of which ended uh fairly violently with heavy-handed policing certainly uh going on this protest this evening at the moment much smaller than those uh at the beginning of the week uh and at the moment it seems that the police are standing off there's no violence at the moment but we'll see how that pans out and Rory Israel's finally confirmed they will be sending a delegation to Cairo for another round of negotiations what more can you tell us about their ability to actually negotiate this time around well this delegation is a high level delegation it includes the head of mosad uh the foreign intelligence service it includes the head of shinette uh the domestic intelligence service and representatives from the military as well they are going we understand to Cairo uh to take part in those talks this evening with what has been reported in the Israeli media as an expanded mandate now what that means is they are going actually with powers of negotiation in previous rounds of Cairo talks the Israeli delegations have gone essentially with very fixed parameters dictated to them by netanyahu's government they were there to to monitor to listen but essentially to do more than that and then to come home this expanded mandate might suggest that there is growing momentum for some sort of deal some sort of agreement uh you know the framework for that would have to we'd have to wait and see uh how it pans out um there is still a huge Gulf of course between the Israeli government's position and the Hamas position uh Netanyahu was speaking earlier on today and he was saying that it's not Israel that's standing in the way of of a deal of a hostage deal it is Hamas let's listen to what he said earlier on today Hamas hopes that the pressure from outside and inside will make Israel surrender to these extreme demands it will not happen Israel is ready for a deal Israel is not ready to surrender instead of international pressure being directed at Israel which only causes Hamas to harden its positions the pressure of the International Community should be directed against against Hamas Washington has also been weighing in on the troop withdrawal here's what White House National Security Communications adviser John Kirby had to say a short time ago it's hard to know exactly what that tells us right now this was just an announcement that they made I'd certainly let them speak to their operations uh as we understand it uh and through their public announcements it is really just about rest and refit for these troops that have been on the ground for four months and not necessarily that we can tell indicative of some coming new operation for these troops they've been on the ground for four months uh the the word we're getting is they're tired they need to be refit
