well so we continuing to follow developments out of Tel Aviv thousands of people have taken to the streets there they are there in protest yeah so they've been demanding that the government accepts the ceasefire proposal announced by US President Joe Biden now this deal includes a six weeks ceas fire the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the return of all the captives in a press conference relatives warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might try to stop this agreement from going ahead now they have called on Netanyahu to come out and publicly support it the extremists in the Netanyahu government are opposing this deal they have allowed the minority extremists to attack President Biden they want the war to go on for an indefinite period of time these people would sacrifice even the captives Eisen Court Gallant this is your last chance to make sure that Netanyahu doesn't destroy this deal I hear your voices tell the citizens that you support this deal and that includes putting an end to this war well Israel has banned Al jazer from reporting from inside the country so instead we are in the Jordanian Capital Aman Sara kyat reports from there this time they don't just mention prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu they're mentioning those are in the war cab cabinet as well as Gaddy Eisen Cott he's one of The Observers of the war cabinet saying that you need to take this deal they say it provides hope for them uh because there is still 125 captives that are still held in the Gaza Strip and they know full well that the longer it's left the more those are likely to be killed those ones that are still there they even mentioned that in their statement but interestingly we've just heard now a statement from uh Benny Gant who's actually fleshed it out a little bit more certainly more than the statement we heard earlier from uh the prime minister's office and in this uh statement he's saying we're committed to advancing uh the hostage release proposal and he's also called for an immediate War cabinet meeting to convene as soon as possible with the negotiating team that's been trying uh to bring back a deal it's interesting also because the head of the negotiating team just a few days ago was actually CR criticizing the Prime Minister and there seemed to be a bit of a debate between both where the Prime Minister said that there had been some lies that had been shared with the media and that's actually not what had happened the head of that negotiating team implying that uh the Prime Minister himself was trying to stop uh that deal from going through and that's certainly a sentiment that a lot of the families believe and that's also because he is under a lot of pressure from those far right ministers itamar benir bezel smotrich they're the ones that want to see Israel resettle in Gaza they want to go back to the Year 2005 when Israel was already occupying uh the Gaza Strip and they're certainly the ones that have implied that Palestinians should leave voluntarily so it's those inflammatory remarks that have almost landed of course as the number of deaths that we're seeing Gaza landed Israel in the icj with a order against them and certainly that's something that Joe Biden referred to as well saying that this complete Victory this notion of a complete Victory is only going to isolate Israel further the people that you're seeing now in that Square live they know that and that's why they are calling on me more people to join them and they want the protest to be outside the homes of those uh uh ministers that are in the war cabinet but also the other ministers that are in this coalition government and just a reminder again that the Israeli government has banned Al jazer from reporting inside the country we are instead based in Amanda we continue to follow all of the developments including these protests that are taking place right now in Tel Aviv as people try to put pressure on the government of Netanyahu and of course the Prime Minister himself uh not just uh those who are on the extreme right of his cabinet but also the Prime Minister himself to accept this proposal by the US [Music] president M Le's brother or was taken captive on October 7th or's wife was killed that day speaking to Al jazer a bit earlier Michael said that he is hoping for his brother to come back home today feels a bit different we we as families feel a bit more hopeful and we crossing our fingers it will be real this time you as far as I know it was an Israeli proposal and I believe uh that they will go for it if Ras will agree to it and well I know that they how much they they wanted I think that they they understand as much as all of us that there's nothing more important than getting back the hostages so I believe that they are doing what they can to bring them back we choose to believe that uh what was presented presented is the real uh offer and that is what is going to happen if uh Hamas won't play games and agree to it well it's not just the general public that you see here out in protest Israeli opposition figures have also come out they are urging Netanyahu to accept the ceasefire plan one which US President Joe Biden initially described as an Israeli proposal Laura Khan has this report now
