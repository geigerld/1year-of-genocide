well one of the Israeli captives who's been released by the armed wing of Hamas on Monday evening has been telling her story your Chev lifshitz is one of two elderly women released for what Hamas says were humanitarian reasons their husbands though remain behind detained in Gaza their release followed mediation efforts from katar and Egypt well let's speak to Alan Fischer he joins us now from occupied East Jerusalem Alan one of those captives as we as we've been saying has been speaking out about the trauma of her capture and also what it was like an in detention how is all that being received yok liit gave a fairly graphic description of her more than two weeks uh after being captured by Hamas it was a Saturday morning the 7th of October she was near her home very close to the Gaza border when she suddenly saw men coming across through a hole in the fence a fence that she essentially said wasn't worth the millions of dollars that had been spent on it so suddenly she was bundled onto the back of a motorbike and was heading to Gaza and very graphically she explained her journey there I went through hell something I didn't think human beings would do to one another I have never gone through anything like it in my life they arrived at the kibuts and kidnapped us taking us to surrounding Fields the young man beat me and hurt me and they took my watch and jewelry they were riding motorbikes and took us to the entrance of a tunnel when they arrived they told us that they believed in the Quran and wouldn't do anything bad to us we walked through the tunnels and reached a large Hall where about 20 people were gathered then they separated us and took one group to another room there was a doctor with us another Doctor Who Came every 3 days and the nurse who examined us and gave us the same medicines that we get at home we were accompanied by a young man on a bike whose hands and legs were injured and who deserved Mercy they provided us with everything we needed and were afraid of diseases spreading they were also very friendly and shared their food with us Alan we understand that Netanyahu today has also met with the French President Emanuel macron how's that visit being seen the latest in the world leaders to make their way to show their support for Israel he met with the Israeli president and then one-on-one with Benjamin Netanyahu and then an extend extended meeting with both sides bringing in their advisors what was interesting is that macron president macron said that the alliance that was put together to fight isil could be reassembled and brought on to fight Hamas that might find some opposition in the International Coalition there's certainly a huge reluctance among the Americans to bring anything close to boots on the ground here in uh in either Gaza or elsewhere nearby it it's something that Joe Biden has been incredibly clear about but president macron will be one of only two Western leaders to head to rala to meet with Mahmud abas the president of the Palestinian Authority Mart Ruta the Dutch prime minister was there yesterday uh I mean Emanuel macron said he would only come if there was something that he could do if travel was useful well he's now got to convince mmud Abbas that the plan that he is proposing would be useful to the Palestinian people and useful to Israel a very tough task at any time Alan fiser there with the latest for us from occupied East Jerusalem thank you Alan
