50 days into the war in Gaza our Focus this week is the propaganda at play Israel should have the upper hand but doesn't and it shows the death toll amongst journalists covering this story is unprecedented 53 and counted the UN special raur who has issues with the way this conflict is being reported a temporary SE fire finally came into effect this past week pausing Israel's Onslaught on the Gaza Strip for 4 days while hostages taken by Hamas were exchanged for Palestinian Prisoners the information War however continues and like the battlefield this fight is a mismatch given the media tools that Israel has at its disposal and the largely uncritical treatment that it gets from international news outlets and yet Hamas has been more than holding its own producing a different kind of propaganda often diminished or dismissed by Western media but which resonates in the Arab world and with more and more people in the global South the Israeli government clearly realizes that International opinion is turning against it it has tried to make this story all about the horrors of October 7th rather than what came before and what has happened since because asymmetry aside Decades of occupation and apartheid followed by a war of Vengeance that has killed so so many Palestinian civilians are proving to be a tough cell 48 days of Bloodshed later a truce lasting 96 hours between Israel and Hamas has come into effect giving gin some room to breathe temporarily the first pause in the fighting since October 7th clearing the way for a hostage Swap and the delivery of humanitarian Aid into the Gaza Strip in the information War however there is no ceasefire in sight the Israeli military has been cramming online spaces full of spin claims of Hamas command centers beneath hospitals this room is an operational room that had communication with electricity and a copy of Hitler's mind comp supposedly randomly found in some Palestinians home Hamas has been producing its own propaganda some of it looks like it's of a video game featuring the Daredevil tactics of its Fighters punctuated with monologues from Hamas [Music] spokesman the two sides have produced a barrage of competing claims purported accomplishments on the battlefield and ultimately narratives the battle for public opinion in this conflict is greater than normal the amount of international engagement here is disproportionate even to the size of the conflict and both parties are very keen on getting their message across we know for example that Israel has within its military a division whose sole job it is to monitor social media at the same time there's also a lot of propaganda on the Palestinian side when it comes to Hamas um its message is defending itself for uh some of the actions in October 7th but at the same time legitimating its resistance to the occupation and setic colonialism that exist in Palestine and its message is coming across in their world in Palestinian Society very powerfully Israel would never admit defeat in an information War but its actions suggest this one is not going its way this past week at the UN Israeli diplomats played a 47 minute long film called bearing witness on the attacks on October 7th the atrocities committed on that day which included footage from hamas's own cameras the video is more than 6 weeks old but the Israeli government knows that its disproportionate inhumane bombing of Gaza since has swung Global public opinion against it that there is no way to defend the killing of more than 5,000 Palestinian children so it's best to roll back the BL rewind the tape and make the story about October 7th and Hamas it's important for Israel to reiterate and demonstrate the brutality of hamas's attack for several reasons one of them is that there are still a large number of people who don't fully believe that Hamas deliberately killed civilians on October 7th and by displaying this footage it builds the the legitimacy of the case but there is another objective hamas's actions on October 7th were different to its other actions in the past this was something more sadistic something more theatrical in the way that the violence was conducted and broadcast to the world and broadcasting these videos showing them to the world is part of building the legitimacy of that argument when it was first aired to uh journalists in Israel people left the room and and they were sick because it's incredibly graphic and it's it's horrifying but despite the fact that Israel has this ability and it has all of this sophisticated social media and propaganda it does look like they're losing this war and it's the reason why Israel is having to show oven over the 47 minutes of uh horrific uh documentary content the Israelis have this problem that they're being perceived um right as engaging in brutal disproportionality and killing large numbers of civilians it is a war of Vengeance and prime minister Netanyahu has said this on several occasions when admits that this is a war of Vengeance he's giving the game away another mistake in messaging much like hamas's mistake of claiming they didn't kill any civilians prior to Friday's ceasefire both Hamas and Israel were posting combat videos when that content finds its way onto international news outlets the Israeli videos are usually treated as information whereas hamas's content due to its status as a terrorist organization gets labeled as propaganda these are Hamas propaganda videos from the perspective of its Fighters One Hamas voice you will rarely if ever hear in Western media coverage is its military spokesman Abu oeda an anonymous presence with a reputation for defiance through messaging that often includes a call to Arms he has developed a huge following among Arabic speakers most of hamas's social media output was on the messaging app Telegram but its account there is now banned still the videos it posts get shared by its supporters and Affiliates on Telegram and other platforms from there it makes its way onto Arab News El clats for the Arab world Hamas presents a a hope for Liberation it's a national movement it's legitimate there's a willing ear to hear those who are doing the fighting in the Arab world the other important component of ABA that he's generally covered with what we call inam in Arabic the Palestinian uh scarf it actually highlights the importance of voice instead of the image of the face itself it makes it a collective voice of resistance he is a masked figure uh almost a RW Shack test onto whom viewers can project their own desires their own expectations someone who in his anonymity represents whatever you want that movement to be Hamas is also adapting like all organizations to the Modern Age of digital journalism you have a figure here who appears to be charismatic to be dynamic energetic and I think to a degree that explains why people would prefer to listen to him than a spokesman sitting in a suit at a Podium who may have been around for 50 years with nothing to show for it Hamas and its analy have been very very good at combining the nationalism the Islamic commitment and the Revolutionary ethos and Charisma a lot of those speeches are not really aimed at the West they're not really aimed at the United States or or Europe they're aimed at the Arabs and the Muslims and they've been medium effective they've had a certain flare for those who identify with the concept of resistance Warfare does not get much more asymmetrical than the kind Israel is waging on Gaza a nuclear Nu Power bankrolled by American Funding pulverizing 2.3 million people locked in an open air prison Israel is also far better equipped to fight an information War it has a military unit that specializes in psychological warfare and a formidable presence on social media there are dozens of Israeli news outlets compared to the one News Network Hamas controls alud which broadcasts in Arabic however the most persuasive case being made on behalf of Palestinians in Gaza is not coming from Hamas it is the impact that gazen journalists have had under the most dangerous conditions imaginable exposing the horrors of Israeli bombardment their work keeps going viral traveling the world and it is a primary reason why in the battle for hearts and Minds Israel has been taking a beating the information war is far less a symmetric than the military campaign the scenes coming out of Gaza are placing enormous pressure on Israel and if you look at other parts of the world particularly the global South South Asia India China Latin America Global and Regional television stations and newspapers in those parts of the world it is the Palestinian message that I think is more widespread more compelling to local audiences than the Israeli message and I think that is a source of real concern to the Israeli government we are witnessing the rise of an anti-war movement across the globe new people are learning about the Palestinian struggle the horrific reality of Palestinians and how they Liv I don't think for now Hamas is interested in engaging with mainstream Media or in spreading its messages in the Western World the Arab world sees in the palestini fighter a hero they see a hope for the end of the occupation and that's why it resonates deeply this past week has been one of the most devastating for journalists in Gaza that in a war that's already been described as the deadliest period on record for the news media minak shiavi is here with the details Richard the toll on journalists during the war in Gaza has been like nothing we've seen in decades that is according to groups like cpj the committee to protect journalists and reporters Without Borders known as rsf the cpj described October as the deadliest month on record for journalists since the organization began tracking stats back in 1992 and that was before at least 11 journalists were killed in Gaza in the span of the past 10 days including belal jadala who ran a media training and press Freedom organization called press house Palestine he was reportedly struck by Tank fire as he attempted to flee the Israeli ground Advance into Gaza City this happened just a day after two other journalists cameraman Huna selim and reporter sari Mansour working for the Hamas Affiliated News Network KS TV were killed in an air strike numerous journalists including Al jaz's own have received direct threats from the Israeli Army Israel has threatened Al jaz's correspondent in Gaza yumna Alid telling her and her family to leave their home or risk being killed along the Israeli Lebanese border where fight wrting has persisted since the early days of the conflict reporter Farah Omar and cameraman rabi al-mamari for the hasbalah Affiliated TV News Channel al- mayadin were killed in an air strike Israel said it was destroying Terror cells along the border but both the Lebanese government and almadin TV say journalists are being deliberately targeted the total number of media professionals killed so far in this war now stands at 53 46 Palestinians four Israelis and three Lebanese the ceasefire will have temporarily stop these numbers Rising but it is only scheduled to last for 4 days as rsf has said journalism is being eradicated in the Gaza Strip as a result of Israel's refusal to heed calls to protect media Personnel thanks Mina in recent weeks there has been an alarmingly small number of official voices calling for a ceasefire in Gaza one exception has been Francesca Alban an Italian trained in international law she is the United Nations special raor on the occupied Palestinian territories and she's been vocal in one interview after another on the need for journalists to remember the context in this story and what international law says about the rights and responsibilities of the occupier and the occupied long before October 7th Alban was the target of smear campaigns and calls for her dismissal from the UN not one for being silenced she has gone in the other direction chastising the UN for its inaction and Alban has implored the media to do better telling journalists they have a lot of homework to do the necessity of reclaiming a more Humane narrative is categorically imperative both to protect Francesca Alban joins us now miss Alban you've been on a media blitz ever since October 7th you are no stranger to the sensitivities around this story but tell us about some of your interactions with reporters and editors since that day the assumptions that journalists have on this story what's it been like for you uh hi Richard uh it's uneven because I have to say that there are there have been a few journalists who have really tried to do um good job good coverage asking me sort of neutral questions to appreciate the facts but mostly I've had um a difficult experience with uh mainstream media in the west because I found I found myself in the uncomfortable position of being challenged on how I would call things or how I would report on things no it's not a Trope it's really real so it seems not to understand what I'm saying there is an aparti regime no I'm serious there is an apartheid regime it's domination this is not a Trope this is international law I mean it was not my intention to to challenge journalists but it seems that they really wanted to to to to challenge my way of looking at things which I found disturbing because again excuse me but I'm I'm here to report on on things that I've analyzed verified triangulated and yeah I found it a bit surprising that relates to something that you've said about today's political landscape you say it's marked by historical Amnesia traditional media plays a critical role in that and then many people are living in an alternative reality what do you mean exactly by that yes yes Richard because this is not just a conflict and calling calling it just a conflict is a is a Mis Noma because this is an occupation that has been ongoing for 56 years so very limited uh consideration for that but also very limited consideration for the enduring trauma that ALS also the Palestinians have in themselves because um while there is recognition for the the the tragedy that the Jewish people have lived through and through across centuries that culminated in the horror of the Holocaust there is very little recognition of what the Palestinians has had endured as a people since 1947 since the and and through the creation of the state of Israel they were never allowed to to a closure and again this is not about Hamas this is really the Palestinian as a people as they try to resist a violent occupation in the occupied pal Palestinian territory there is no Hamas military presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem and still over 200 people have been killed by soldiers and armed the settlers do you see any connection to it in uh in mainstream media I don't think that there is a fair objective any impartial representation of the relationship between the Israelis and the Palestinians and the Palestinians are the ones who are blamed and smeared including when they try to protest in Western Europe or to be in solidarity with with the Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territory Palestinians have heard the calls as we have from Israeli officials and voices in the Israeli media for what amounts to ethnic cleansing of Gaza as a lawyer are you surprised by the evidence that they are willingly providing of what appears to be the intent to commit what are in fact war crimes there seems to be this sense of impunity over their words it's surprising yes because the Israelis have never been so explicit in admitting responsibility for specific incidents one of the things that were absolutely shocking was the the bombing of the jabalia refugee camp because the Israeli Army knew that there were about 400 civilians Palestinian civilians in including hostages and nonetheless the camp was bombed heavily and hundreds of Palestinians were killed hundreds were injured and the number of hostages was reportedly killed in that case so yeah they've been quite outspoken about their intention including calling for the Erasure of Gaza the flattening of Gaza the same time what I found more surprising is the kind of denial and this is the what I call the alternative reality that people living in the west there are almost 15,000 who have been reportedly killed and and and in politicians in the west are still debating whether a a permanent ceas fire should take place or not so yeah this I find very surprising we have seen before what happens to people when this this Fury becomes becomes popular and this genocidal call that we have heard from politicians and and military leaders in Israel is also Amplified in various groups in Israeli Society so in the face of this madness as someone who has seen genocidal horror happening in other parts of the world I say it's clear that this has this has is taking the Israeli Society to a very dark place and this is why I say in the interest of the palestin both Palestinians and the Israelis This Must Be Stopped you've faced a lot of criticism um for some of the things that you've said and you faced some of that criticism prior to October 7th some cases you've been defamed pressure groups have been on your case to resign what kind of things are they saying about you are they succeeding Miss Alban in making your job more difficult look these groups and they I mean they're all connected one way or another because they say exactly the same things that are repeated exactly in the same way some sometimes sometimes in the same sequence over and over and the accusations against me are that I'm an anti-semite that I am Pro Hamas and I support terrorism Franchesca Alban is someone who pretends to be neutral uh neither her position nor her own background have anything to do with impartiality I mean these are false allegation that gives enough uh to me to take J legal action and it has also happened to my predecessors is it succeeding I don't think so because eventually more and more people keep on asking me to to speak and to speak out wherever I go uh speaking to governments or speaking to the media of record people know people tell me or let me understand that the situation is better known that it would seem in the public debate but there is a lot of censorship and self-censorship because people don't want to be confronted with the allegations I I have to face on a daily basis which in my case don't distract me I keep focused on what I have to do but I think that it's necessary to tackle this issue at the global level because it's uh it's now also the weaponization of anti-Semitism and the level of smear against anyone who utters a word of criticism against Israel and everyone who UTS a word of solidarity with the Palestinians face such a huge and evil uh um campaign I mean I also spoke with you know human rights defenders in the Pacific Islands where they say well you we Face even arrest and detention if we come out and protest in solidarity with the Palestinian people against what's happening in the Gaza Strip so there is a crashing of freedom of assembly a crashing of freedom of expression and of the right to protest that it's absolutely unprecedented at this global level and of this scale Franchesca albanesa un special raor for the occupied Palestinian territories you're up against it uh we understand you're very busy we're very grateful for the time that you've made for us today thank you Richard you've been watching yet another full edition of the listening post on the war on Gaza our seventh straight in 17 years of doing this program monitoring the global media we have never devoted so much coverage to a single story we make no apologies for that given the awful attacks of October 7th the war crimes that have taken place since and that will presumably resume once this temporary ceasefire ends we will continue to provide wall-to-wall coverage of this story as we would for any case of genocide unfolding before us we'll see you next time here at the listening
