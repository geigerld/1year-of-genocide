now on the Israeli Lebanese border conflict because Hezbollah and Israel have been urged to abide by UN resolution 1701 which ended the 2006 War it bars Hezbollah from operating between the Lani River and the blue line The Unofficial border with Israel now Israel was instructed to remove all of its troops from Lebanese territory however neither side has ever fully complied with the resolution since October the 7th has and Israeli forces have exchanged fire on a near- daily basis the armed group says it will only cease hostilities if Israel withdraws from Gaza more than 60,000 people have now been evacuated from northern Israel after months of crossborder attacks and more than 90,000 have been displaced in southern Lebanon last week the Israeli Army killed a senior Hezbollah Commander Talib Abdullah the group responded by launching an unprecedented barrage of rockets into Northern Israel Elijah mager is a military and political analyst and joins us now from Paris good to have you with us on the program real concern that the fighting to the North of Israel is now the new front so it's no surprise the US has dispatched yet another Envoy to find a way to deescalate the situation between Israel and Hezbollah but using those Lebanese politicians in the middle is anybody going to listen thank you for having me well no nobody is going to listen unless Israel stops the uh crimes against humanity and war crimes against the Palestinians in Gaza and that was very clear message that was forwarded to the US Envoy Amos hwain by saying stop the war in Gaza and everything will stop and it is not in the interest of the Israeli to see the war ongoing when the Israeli military spokesperson uh Daniel haar General Daniel hagari said that Hezbollah has launched 5,000 rocket Mage and drone Israel had 5,000 reason to start a war on Lebanon but it is not in its advantage and not in its capability to open two front particularly when the Lebanese front is not that easy to conquer or even to attack without having a very strong uh fireback on the Israeli Army society and even existential threat to Israel while the military's Focus might now well be the areas of Northern Gaza they have to a certain extent advise the Israeli government that there's very little left for them to do in Gaza so they should pivot the political establishment doesn't think as you say uh that is the right move when do you think there will be a time to draw the line under Gaza for T Aviv well the front on Lebanon is costing the Israelis a lot it is really uh degrading the reputation of Israel more than what it is already by what the Israelis have been doing in Gaza nevertheless we have also heard from the Israelis that they will continue the operation in the next two weeks in RAF because they have exhausted all the options without without reaching any of the objectives stated from the beginning the resistance the Palestinian resistance is still very strong is engaged with with the Israelis in the North in the South and in Rafa inflicting heavy casualties on daily basis that the Israelis are recognizing there is no point in reaching any objective in Gaza at the moment and this is where we've seen the military and the politicians blaming one another the politician are saying to the military you're not managing to achieve the objective and the military are telling the politician you have given up given us objectives that are impossible to reach at the end of the day we have signals from prime minister bamin Netanyahu that he is going toward the deescalation and perhaps start a negotiation with Hamas because he understood that he's reaching a deadline and a deadlock and indeed it what we're hearing even from the American Envoy in Lebanon is this line that Hamas have to accept the deal Hamas have to accept the ceasefire yet Hamas have told Al jazer they've told various news outlets they have accepted the Biden deal but the narrative that the Americans keep projecting is that they haven't and that Israel has accepted it yet Israel is still bombing Gaza you're absolutely right we've heard hamash twice saying that they have accepted the deal we have heard Biden saying this is an Israeli plan and he is forwarding an Israeli plan not an American plan but it is approved by the Americans we have not heard Israel saying this is our plan and we accept it overtly on the contrary we've heard bamin nany saying where there are many inaccuracy in what Biden has forwarded which is an Israeli plan that Biden spend 80% of his speech trying to convince these Israelis of a plan they have forwarded now there is a point here that Biden said in the Israeli plan that there is a ceasefire that should be established that the war should come to an end because the Americans are still protecting the Israelis they're not acting against Israel they're telling the Israeli we've giving you enough time to do your War to Massacre whoever you want to destroy Gaza and you have failed to achieve your objectives time to sit around the table and perhaps we can try to deter Hamas in maybe switching their arms on the humanitarian support or on the reconstructions but that is depending on the war that bamin Netanyahu is conducting that is his personal War afraid of falling with his government so the time of ceasefire is important to initiate the negotiation and this is what the Israelis are fearing in the power today because that means the end of the war or at least the sensation of hostility and I think the Israelis are trying to find a way where Benyamin Netanyahu can remain in power and perhaps getting rid of ban mrid and very briefly then uh Elijah I mean how do you think the sort of conversation that you have in Israel generally is that they continually need a foe and if gazer is nearly finished is the new foe the ongoing fight with Hezbollah in the north and can they really maintain this and will at some stage Israel's allies become tired of supporting Tel Aviv in their ongoing narrative that they are the victim and that they need to be protected well killing 37,500 of which 16,500 children in Gaza and the total is mainly civilians that is far from being a victim particularly when when the ICC is considering um the uh arrest warrant against netanyahu's defense minister you have gallant and when Antonio guz the UN Secretary General it listed blacklisted Israel along with Isis Al-Qaeda and Boko Haram considering them as terrorist that is really significant now they cannot maintain a war with uh a many war with Lebanon so we cannot imagine a bigger War how devastating is going to be exactly what uh the general Breck said if nany who goes to war with Lebanon we would wake up one day like a holocaust an atomic bomb has exploded in the center of Israel we shall see what happens certainly in the coming hours OB very delicate times in the Middle East Elijah mager thanks so much for joining us from Paris make
