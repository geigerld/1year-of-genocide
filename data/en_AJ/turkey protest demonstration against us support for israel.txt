well thousands of people are gathering in southern turkia to protest against America's support for Israel the demonstrations taking place in the city of AD the location of one of NATO's largest air bases in the region the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is due to attend talks with turkey as foreign minister in the capital Anora on Monday well for more on this wrestle s joins us from Anora and wrestle what can we expect from blinken's visit there later today well uh the the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is expected to arrive in Ankara tonight and tomorrow in the morning he's also scheduled to meet his Turkish counterpart hakan fidan however there is a huge discontent here in Ankara just recently we have seen that President erdogan increasingly started to use a very harsh language accusing USA accusing Israel of committing the the the the the war crimes and president ardan explicitly said that the USA is complicit here is just giving a green light to to to Israel to commit all of that war crimes and violate the international law and just after this kind of language that has been used yesterday we just seen that turkey has recalled its Ambassador for consultation so just days before the the October 7th president erdogan and prime minister of Israel were expected to meet so the relations were just recently restored and the the the the the The Diplomatic ties were recently restored however now the relations between Anar and T Aviv between turkey and Israel are almost about to break down so tomorrow there will be a meeting between United the the Secretary of State anony blinkin and the Turkish uh the Turkish foreign minister however according to the reports that are coming there's not going to be a joint pressure and that is quite important we do not know whether this came from Turks or the American authorities but in anyway if there was a a joint pressure it was expected to be a huge uh public rebuke for uh Secretary of State and that's why probably they wanted to avoid it because as I said there's a huge discontent here in Ankara and just speaking of that discontent Russell can you just tell us how large this protest has become at the NATO Airbase there as of now we know that all across turkey there have been thousands of the cars joining a convoy that is organized by International humanitarian relief foundation and now they are still heading to the South the city of Adana which host inck Air Base so inck air base is one of the largest NATO bases in the Middle East and is primarily used by the US Air Force and it also host more than 1,000 US Air man so it's a b calculated Place symbolically very much important just yesterday president of the foundation said that they are going to Pro protest in front of that air base to force the USA for a ceasefire and also to stop the ongoing Slaughter in Gaza so that is very very much important as I said because the organizer as I said is the international humanitarian relief this same Foundation was the foundation that organized Gaza Freedom flotilla in 2010 in an intention to break the Israeli sea blockade over Gaza six wessels by that time sailed from Istanbul and had over Gaza and in international waters Israeli uh forces raided onto that on on that ships and killed 10 American and Turkish activists and that has been a turning point in Israeli and Turkish relations we have seen a decade of very very deteriorated relations so now interestingly the the the president of Foundation is even going further he said that they are planning to send another uh flotilla to Gaza but he's asking president uan this time the Turkish Naval forces to be involved and to protect that vessels whether that's going to happen or not however as I said here the organizers are trying to put a tremendous pressure on both American and Turkish governments to stop the war in Gaza okay thank you so much for that wristle that is wristle c for us in Ankara
