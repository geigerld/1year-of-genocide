control of the quantity and quality of the medical supplies and other relief AIDS entering Gaza as a result the entire Health sector stands unable to provide the necessary medical treatment to all the victims as a result of the lack of medical Crews clinical beds and above all medical appliances and supplies as we speak we are attending hundreds of victims on the floor without anesthetic and with very mediocre means the hospitals all across Gaza Strip are more than helpless as a result of the total absence of medical resources and human cater the Medical Teams the injured are bleeding to death as a result of total absence of medical attention in addition to that the Israeli occupation forces purposefully and wellfully targets the remaining medical facilities in the north of Gaza trip in order to bring him to their knees and force the residents in the north to move to the South and here we reiterate that the remaining hospitals in Gaza Strip are overwhelmed as a result of the huge numbers of victims in addition to that they are lacking the most basic medical equipment and supplies we reiterate that the mechanism whereby victims are transported outside Gaza remains inferior as a result hundreds of them are losing their lives the lists of patients and victims who were supposed to be transported outside Gaza Strip these lists remain going to and fro at the end of the day the number of victims allowed to leave have already died as a result succumbing to their wounds in addition to that very few number managed to leave Gaza STP for medical treatment abroad the total number

fresh water and proper hygiene as a result many communicable infectious disease are spreading we appeal to the consciences of the free men all across the world to do to do all what is needed to put an end to this genocide war on Gaza and the gazans and we call on all the parties to work towards providing a humanitarian Corridor whereby medical supplies makeshift hospitals Fuel and volunteer Medical Teams from outside are allowed in and victims transported outside we call on the UN and the world health organizations to work genuinely to pressure the Israeli occupation forces to release all the medical team members already detained we are seing an effective Global mechanism whereby the more than 1.5 million gazin displaced gazin are faced with total Annihilation we seek proper mechanism to their rescue and to their help thank you you've just been listening to Ashraf Al kudra who's the spokesperson for gaza's health Ministry and he was giving uh the daily updates that the health Ministry

explaining that only 412 injured uh 412 patients in the in gaza's hospitals have managed to get out and to seek treatment outside of Gaza and he was saying many more have died uh because they were not
