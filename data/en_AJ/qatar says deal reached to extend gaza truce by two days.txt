all right well I'm here with James baz our diplomatic editor uh and James we have now I understand had confirmation from both katar and Hamas that there has indeed been an extension for two days in the ceasefire of course all of this was hypothetical now this seems to be the nearest confirmation we've had so far that this will indeed happen this is important news and as we were hearing earlier on it's come at the same time as I think they've nailed down the exact um numbers and names of those that are going to be exchanged in the coming hours that was taking some time but it seems that both of these things have been done at the same time the Israeli um prime minister's office informing the Israeli families uh some 13 um captives to be released in the coming hours we think 33 Palestinians so that's the completion of the 4day agreement and now we have two more days so we potentially I think we don't know the numbers but we potentially have about 10 um captives Israeli captives each day released and probably potentially about 30 Palestinians on either side so an important development and this of course means that the bombardment in Gaza does not start again because if we hadn't had this deal at 7 a.m. Gaza time just a few hours from now then the bombardment would have started um so it is resite further respite for uh those on the ground in Gaza it also means that more Aid can come in and although the aid the UN and the red Cresent and others say is not enough every day means they can start to replenish the stocks in Gaza particularly the fuel to try and get desalination plants going to try and get hospitals going to try and get some of the most basic facilities that are needed to keep Palestinians alive not just with hospitals but with the real threat of disease the real threat of starvation that been warned by by Aid agencies and the UN so this is good news for everyone it seems at this stage okay James spay our diplomatic Ed there thank you very much for that well let's go to TK Abu aom who's in carun and TK we have had now confirmation just a few moments ago that there will indeed be an extension of two days this will have come of course as huge relief for the people in Gaza absolutely that's true as th those two days came after four days of truth that had been agreed between Hamas and Israel under Qatari and even Regional uh uh supervision and mediation now Palestinians are are really now happy they start now again to move because they were asking about the possibility of the extension for further days of ceasefire on the ground in order to also uh come back again to the normal lives but it's also important for Palestinians is that there is going to be a much more guarantee of of Flo with humanitarian Aid due to the fact that this two days of ceasefire additional ceasefire had been clearly under the same terms and the same conditions related to the release of hostages between both sides and also to the uh to guarantee the flow of the humanitarian AIDS into the Gaza Strip now uh uh what had been enter to the Gaza Strip during the last couple of days in terms of the humanitarian AIDS considered to be limited with the needs of the territory but what is also important to mention is that there is no any of the fuel that had been delivered to the north of the Gaza Strip This is according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in their territory but generally a sense of relief Comfort had been now spread among Palestinians as they now have been confirmed by the katari foreign Ministry that they are had agreed uh and even reach a kind of extension for the Seas fight between Hamas and Israel on the ground which means that there's going to be additional two days clear of Relentless Israeli attacks without any destruction or even injuries reported in Gaza Strip yeah right yeah so Aid is going through for now of course tck um given that we have this now two-day extension the hope is that a continued Aid will go to those that need it most particularly potentially in the north of the Gaza Strip too uh generally the north of the Gaza STP this this area had been completely deprived from the humanitarian Aid just before the time of the ceasefire that had been healed earlier between Hamas and Israel meanwhile they were running low completely on fuel water and even they canot have any kind of delivery of uh uh fuel to to this area due to the Israeli prevention of the entry of a fuel and gas into the territory now it's it's maybe it could be allowed to the reach of the fuel to the uh north of the territory but till this very moment there's no any confirmation from local authorities inside the Gaza Strip that there is going to be much more Aid in terms of fuel that will be delivered to the north of Gaza Strip but generally these kinds of a humanitarian Aid considered to be important as the north of the Gaza Strip uh was uh experiencing very dangerous uh humanitarian uh circumstances due to the ongoing blackout of electricity the absence of the humanitarian AIDS and now those people who are still inside the north of the Gaza Strip they are in very desperate needs for the for this humanitarian AIDS which will relatively help to aggravate to to mitigate the aggravating a humanitarian crisis in particular in this small isolated area in the north of the territory all right T many thanks for that TK AB zoom in car unun there well back uh with James baz our diplomatic editor here in the studio and we were saying a short while ago this breaking news that we have indeed have confirmation from Qatar key mediator in all of this that have Hamas has agreed to a truce to be extended by two days this is vitally important vitally important step as we've heard from uh uh TK abuo it means a lot in terms of aid but it also means a lot in terms of captives too it means a lot to the people of Gaza and it means a lot to families on both sides who are watching every single development here this will be more um women I think most of the children have been released um uh but but there may may well be many more children on the Palestinian side but in terms of the Israeli captives we're not sure how many children there are left um we think that um in the coming hours maybe even now behind the scenes the latest transfer will be about to take place and we know how that works now it's a transfer after Qatar with the help of Egypt has done the mediation it's a transfer that takes place uh with the international Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza they will take the people out probably to Rafa not NE necessarily to Rafa and it's 11 that we're talking about tonight but then the extension is two more days and we assume that the two more days will will fit the pattern that we've seen up until now so it'll be about or at least 10 released in terms of Israeli captives held in Gaza each day and then three times that in terms of Palestinians so about 30 at least Palestinian prisoners uh will be released so that then takes us um for to to a total now period of truce of temporary Ceasar of six uh days so that that means that now the people of Gaza unless there's any violation by by any side have a breathing space until 7 a.m. on Thursday morning Gaza time as Tark just said it means more Aid trucks can come in the UN I think really feels it's not got enough Aid in yet uh to sustain the people of Gaza given how no fuel was allowed in for such a very very long period until literally just hours before uh the the pause in the bombardment um they're hoping they can make a dent in a really desperate humanitarian situation in this time I think it's important to also add that this latest information is also being confirmed from the Israeli side on Israeli media from the Israeli leadership as well an indication of the kind of tireless mediation that's gone on behind the scenes while this 4-day process was in action yeah you saw in hashim's report that Command Center that Operation Center here in Doha katar in many ways the lynchpin of this but that doesn't mean there not other players who've been very very important to what's been going on uh notable as I say as the international Committee of the Red Cross because they do the facilitation on the ground they don't actually want to be involved in the negotiations they want to keep themselves completely neutral so that on the ground they can operate and be trusted by all sides and that's what they've been doing um getting the captives out of Gaza Egypt has a key role because Egypt controls the only gate to Gaza that is not controlled by the Israelis so Egypt has an important role there and Egypt of course has the longest standing peace deal with Israel so it's the Arab nation that probably has the best um way ways to deal uh with the Israeli side and of course you've got lots of other foreign governments but notable among them putting pressure I think on Israel sometimes uh and some restraint on Israel is the United States which has been um very closely involved as well and Kar has a very good relations with the United States as well all right James many thanks for that James Bay our diplomatic editor there
