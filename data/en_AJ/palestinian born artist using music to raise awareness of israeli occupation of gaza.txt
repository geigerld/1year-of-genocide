now music has been used around the world to raise awareness about the Decades of Israeli occupation in Palestinian territory and none have done it better than musicians of Palestinian origin San lant is one such musician who's using his music to raise awareness about what's happening in Gaza we'll talk to him shortly but first here's a snippet of his popular song from Gaza with love is to be always where you come from except when you're on at the C she can meet me up in London she let me cuz I came from love well salivan joins us now live from Los Angeles great to have you with us it's a great song it really shows your feelings for Gaza what are your feelings now when you see what's happening there thank you for having me um the feelings I think is a collective feeling especially coming from the diaspora Collective feeling of Despair um you know we built a music studio in razza this year and to to receive WhatsApp messages of that studio being destroyed for no reason pictures having um no communication with our friends and family back there I think is a collective feeling of Palestinians abroad and um just truly truly I mean you know I think we've all seen videos of anded and B just these Heroes living in Palestine and in Gaza um seeing these families I think it was two days ago families and just families move in South and you you you look at this and sometimes as a Palestinian I ask myself how can the world sit and watch this happen but it's quite simple I think because uh in order to watch this and be okay with it and to see ethnic cleansing live on Instagram you need to think we are subhuman and the West has been doing this this tactic of demonization of dehumanization for a very long time my mother is a French Algerian and you know the French and the algerians the collective demonization of Arabs and Palestinians in Western media for the past 70 years is what leads us to the Israeli defense minister for example calling us human Savages Ben Shapiro saying things like Arabs uh no Israelis like to build and Arabs like to live in open sewage and bomb stuff you know when you see this kind of language it's very deliberate and uh deliberate in a way that makes it so the Palestinians are subhuman and this this you know Israelis are able to justify the oppression that we go through so it's just very despairing and how do you use your music and the platform that you have to counter that portrayal I think once again the um the dehumanization of Palestinians the deliberate demonization and dehumanization what I've seen is U music is a way to put a face you know and to tell the stories of people that cannot tell their stories these kids um that live in Gazza the children this the children that do not have names um and faces and stories that are not being told you look at the stories of the Israeli hostages on Western media and you ask yourself are we all worthy of the same uh of the same coverage of the same love and care and it's just truly truly astounding you grew up in Gaza what are your memories of the Gaza Strip I grew up in Gaza I only have um you know I grew up by the sea I um have memories of you know going fishing my father built a hotel called the D which is still there to this day and um you know scents smells uh you also obviously I mean I don't know if you can hear right now there's airplanes going by the sound of drones is one that is ingrained in my m forever and I think the sound of drones for any person living in Raz is is a core memory that these people live through and um yeah and your hopes and dreams for the Palestinian people and for the people of Gaza in particular what are they I think uh I Echo the sentiment of the Palestinian people when I say that we dream of a free Palestine a liberated Palestine um and you know just just to bring it back uh before before ahead of let's say you take out Hamas out of the equation and you know Israel does what supposedly it wants to do uh Hamas no longer exists Etc would you call this place this place is called the West Bank the West Bank has over 500 checkpoints um Jewish only roads you know uh Israeli settlers regularly go out and and burn olive trees in masses there's I think half a million of them there so we dream of a free and liberated Palestine s Lan really good to speak to you thanks very much for taking the time to join us here on Al jazer thank you thank you
