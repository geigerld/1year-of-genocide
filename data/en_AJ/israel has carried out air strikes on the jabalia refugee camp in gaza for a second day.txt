[Music] it's just gone 1300 hours GMT that's 300 p.m. in Gaza where Israel has carried out another attack on the jabalia refugee camp in less than 24 hours it's the largest refugee camp in Gaza on Tuesday more than a 100 Palestinian civilians were killed there in an air strike in the evening people were at the scene searching through the rubble to rescue family members there's been widespread International condemnation and Palestinian themselves describing the attack as a heartless War crime we'll have the latest from Gaza in a moment but first ased bag has this report they haven't even finished bearing the dead from Tuesday's attack and Israel struck The jabalia Refuge Camp again misery upon misery death upon death impunity upon impunity Palestinians ask what is left to bom here what will it take for it to stop it was already a graveyard in car unus they're buried alive the rubel of what used to be their homes is where they lie relatives look on helplessly this is not a rescue they're pulling out the dead for those who survive there's no space left in hospitals forced to stay in schools because the hospitals are overwhelmed where are the people supposed to go so many have died May God help them their situation is miserable what can we do hospitals are overwhelmed with the injured and the dead some children others are elderly and women some have a hope of a way out Palestinian Jew Nationals and some of those injured are being allowed to leave through the Rafa Crossing to Egypt under a kri mediated deal on Wednesday we spend here 3 months without any minimum parameter for the life no water no food no shelter nothing nothing we open our eyes on the dead people and we close our our eyes on thead people but it's nowhere near enough and so much more is needed in Gaza fuel food water medical supplies it's the fuel situation that is most critical hospitals are running out without fuel to operate generators the hospitals cannot operate Palestinians have been forced to adapt they're always praying over the dead in Gaza a constant stream of victims of those killed by Israel it's the children who have suffered most a childhood interrupted by War forced to learn about death before they can even experience life Assad Big Al jazer alzer's hany Mahmud joins us now from the RAF Crossing so first of all hany let's start with the latest strike the second Israeli strike on the jabalia refugee camp in 24 hours tell us about the aftermath of that yes Sammy well with them uh 24 hours two Relentless deadly attacks on a small refugee camp in jabalia City uh as just a small densely populated area and just within limited number of ours two deadly attacks leaving entire neighborhoods and entire blocks completely uh in in in rubbles uh the attacks came about a few two hours ago when uh eight8 strikes eight air strikes happening at one time bombs falling on on at least eight home residential homes close to each other destroying all of them uh people were not warned to leave those homes that were still inside and nobody give them a warning about the leaving or running for their running for their life so what happened a large number of people are reported killed in those Relentless air strikes uh we don't have the exact number yet and we've been trying for the past hour or so just trying to get our hand on the exact figure of people who have been killed in these air strike but due to disabled communication uh and and phone service were unable but I witness in the area uh they told us that there are the Deads are by the tens there there are large number of injuries as well that were rushed to the hospital the Indonesian Hospital the only remaining health facility right now serving the northern part and whoever remain from the residence in that area it's important to mention the hospital is still uh is already suffering from lack of medical supplies and shortage extreme shortage of fuel and and running Beyond its capacity and looking into just a few hours into the day and the hospital will be uh completely out of service according to a statement that was issued yesterday and Han just take us through who was allowed out of Gaza today well yes the the announcement came as of the late hours of last night where uh the Ministry of Health announced the coordination uh for 81 wounded Palestinians seriously and a critically wounded Palestinians uh to move uh to the egyp to the Egyptian side for median and more advanced uh medical uh intervention uh so far we've seen since the early morning the early hours of this morning ambulance ambulance is coming from the central area of the G strip namely the city of D froma hospital and from nasar hospital in the city of kanun and two more hospitals from Gaza and the northern part of shifa hospital and the Indonesian Hospital uh they start moving ambulance to uh the gate of the ra Crossing where where Egyptian ambulance were stationed at the Egyptian side waiting for the transfer of these uh wounded Palestinians uh so they can they can take them to a field Hospital established two days ago in The shik Zed uh City on the Egyptian side uh in terms of people who uh who hold dual citizenship Palestinian with the dual citizenship or uh foreign Nationals they were also uh uh asked and a list of name was published last night by the minister of interior and I believe it was coordinated with the Red Cross uh for uh limited number of foreign National not all foreign nationalities were informed to leave only limited number we know the American Nation holder of American citizenship uh and British and Canadian were excluded from this list and there are talks uh that they might be able to leave tomorrow or the day after uh after tomorrow but earlier this hour the scenes that the crossing very very chaotic as everybody uh is trying to uh just to run for his or her life at the Crossing you know people who were not listed uh their names were not listed were very disappointed and felt really sad that they could not make it out of Gaza today all right we'll leave it there thanks so much hany Mahmud let's continue this though with safat he's joining us now from Gaza safat your further to the north than hany is so take us first of all any update in jabali in terms of how many people have perished and have been wounded in this second attack well until now we are unable to get update from the Ministry of Health since they are they also uh are they are also finding difficulties in contacting uh the the Indonesian Hospital for the update as well but the the figure that they are talking about tens of people have been killed and injured in the latest Israeli air strike on jabalia refugee camp mainly in aluja neighborhood uh we spoke to uh my brother uh who who lives there he said that he heard eight explosions fired by the Israeli fighter jet on this residential area and which is part of the one of the most over populated areas uh refugee camps uh in in the pales in the Palestinian territories uh still uh the Indonesian Hospital received all the casualties that came or resulted from this uh uh this attack on on jabalia they have been appealing uh the they have been launching appeals for uh for sending the the injuries uh to Egypt and also appealing the private uh the private fuel stations to send them every liter of fuel they could to to save uh the lives of the injured people arriving to the hospital and safwat what we saw today earlier in jabalia was people were going through the rubble of the first air strike yesterday on jabalia them you know trying to reach some of the victims themselves becoming the target of a second strike that's targeting or that hit jabali refugee camp and those responders well well where you go and you find people digging under the rubble trying to to find um some object the casualties of some of the dead people who they believe they are stuck there the municip it uh and the the teams are deployed everywhere and try to take especially in the plan that they can reach but not the the places that under the Israeli fire wherever they go you you can find people digging and trying to find if there could if there are people alive there or there are dead people they they can bring under the reubel this is the case because simply the ministry the risky teams are they don't have the the proper capacities and capabilities to move their machines either because lack of machines or lack of fuels for operating these machines so the people they try to do that themselves and especially after or following every Israeli air strike this is the case that you wherever you go and find the rubel you find people trying to dig and to help if there is a chance to find people alive there or even to grab a a body of a people so they they can't bury it all right thanks so much that's s let's go to Alan Fisher now he joins us live from occupied East Jerusalem so we getting any Israeli official reaction to this latest strike on jabalia nothing official yet and that fits in with the pattern of what we saw 24 hours ago when it was several hours after what happened in jabal we got news from the Israelis that they said that this was an operation targeting Hamas operatives that they killed more than 50 of them and in particular they killed one Commander someone that they believe was involved in the planning of October the 9th this is an ongoing military operation so it's unlikely they'll say anything yet for a couple of hours but of course what we did get immediately after what happened in jabalia was International condemnation from a number of countries including Jordan and Egypt who called it unacceptable that Israel knew that this was a refugee camp and that by targeting Hamas there it would inflict numerous casualties and we have seen that in the figures that we've that have been displayed not just on Wednesday but today as well and Alan Hamas has been saying seven civilian captives were killed in that first strike on jabalia Camp uh Camp how is this impacting Israeli public opinion well there are those in in Israel who will tell you that that this war should not go ahead that the priority should be doing everything they possibly can to release those that are being held captive but here's the reality the Israeli military right at the very start said that they will go in they will Target Hamas they will destroy Hamas and if captives die during those operations that is a consequence of this operation so even though though there may be growing International concern and we've seen it from the United States who asked Israel to delay the start of the ground war it's been reported because they wanted negotiations to continue to free the captives we've seen it from other countries who've said that that was a priority it doesn't really matter Israel has already accepted that there will be uh people who are being held captive who will die in this operation Hamas has already said 50 have died add that to the seven that they've talked about in the last 24 hours and including two Nationals so while there is a body uh of protest against what is happening with the war in Israel the government has essentially said and the war cabinet has essentially said that doesn't matter their priority is making Israel safe and if that means the death of those being held captive they would like to see them free but if it means the death of those being held captive that is a consequence of War all right thanks so much Alan fiser
