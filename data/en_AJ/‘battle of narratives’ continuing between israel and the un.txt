all right let's bring in luchano zakara now he's associate professor of golf politics at car University thanks very much for joining us on set let's start on the actual picture inside G we've had these terrible anecdotal reports of children going hungry asking their parents for food that just isn't there now we have this report from the world food program warning that more people could die from the after effects of this war than being killed in the Israeli strikes it's it's a very serious situation we're looking at isn't it yeah it's a situation that they cannot be anymore I mean they cannot be denied even though numbers have been always controversial and some people United States Israel were not believing on those data because supposedly it's coming from from Hamas nobody can deny that the picture is already catastrophic that the the the the the the famine people starving is there that the hospitals are not working anymore that there's no way even to gather data about how many people died actually and how many children died and how is the situation uh with the restricted uh Aid coming to to Gaza nothing can be uh hided anymore and therefore this report is supporting now the evolution of of some decisions that they are taking at the international level well yeah and at that level at the UN Security Council we've seen a whole week of desperate negotiations trying to get the US finally to support a security Council resolution but it seems that the language has changed so much that it's alienated as Gabriel was reporting other members of the security Council apparently that the key issue is who has final say over exactly what goes in to Gaza initially under the wording it was going to be un agencies the US was concerned that that would take too much control away from Israel which says it wants to make sure that nothing that goes in directly AIDS Hamas um a is this version do you think going to get through and if it does what kind of impact can it bring to bear on the ground well I mean one thing is to to have to bury money is at at least for the first time United States able to sign something which is a drastic change compared with the the previous situation the last two months that they have been denying systematically anything even though uh a couple of weeks ago guz called for this article 99 so there's a slight change in US perception and US actions uh that is also helping Israel to to to change a little bit the the tone because Israel realized that now they cannot count 100% on the support in anything they do in everything they do so they need to change something that's why we also can see that Israel is also now renegotiating or restarting negotiations to to to to at least to liberate the other 35 hostages the situation is changing slightly because the public opinion worldwide is changing against Israel is increasingly uh pushing Biden to change its action ER even the media mainstream media in the US is reporting in a different way the conflict uh thrusting much more on the data that's coming from inside Gaza so the picture changed a little bit that is forcing uh Biden to change his position of course the resolution is not the same that what it was supposed to be one month ago but at least is changing something that is setting a precedent inside the security Council that the United States for the first time is supporting a resolution that this addressing or asking something specifically to Israel whether Israel will abide for that is another issue but at least there is a legal present that this is happening for the first time yeah well I mean on the issue of of the Israeli position we heard again from the president isak Herzog who was from a different part of Israeli politics from the Prime Minister Benjamin nety much more mainstream and yet he talking to a senior French politician was really laying the blame at the un's door saying that these agencies should stop complaining and that they could enter three times the amount that they'd been entering into Gaza if they just got on with it they're saying well hang on a minute there is so much bombing coming from the air that it's not safe I mean what do you make of the Israeli and un positions actually there on the southern border well actually this is a battle of narratives and the Battle of wordss who's blaming I mean the game of blame who's blaming why this is not happening uh Israel keeps repeating that they are concerned about killing civilians and they are concerned about allowing uh uh Aid to enter into gasa I mean the international agencies and other governments are blaming Israel for controlling the gate the the truth that actually Israel is controlling the gate there is no other way to enter Gaza without the the control is of Israel whether this United nationes resolution security counc resolution will take that control from Israel I don't think so I mean isra will never allow that to happen neither United States would allow this to happen but I think that there should be more uh uh diplomatic efforts conducted by both un and Israel to guarantee that the the the the center in Gaza is not helping or is not um harming Israel in a way that Israel would withdraw from this uh this support of this uh resolution otherwise we will come back to to zero again indeed all right thank you very much Lan zakara appreciate it
