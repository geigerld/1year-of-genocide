the living now live alongside the dead displaced several times by Israeli taxs and evacuation orders these Palestinians are forced to pitch tents in a symmetry sometimes leaping next to the grave of a person buried I swear that I have seen a lot of dead people I live here in the cemetery and I see dozens of bodies every day I suffer too much our life is non-stop suffering but even the GM accommodation may be temporary with Israel's war showing no sign of ending they could be forced to move again at any moment we move every day from one place to another displacement has almost killed us we don't have money moving is expensive we urge Arab countries and Muslim nations to help us to stand with us we need a solution con yunus has been completely destroyed we ended up living with the dead in the cemeteries God only knows how we survived shs were coming towards us from everywhere we live in a graveyard we share the space with dead people the living conditions here are only fit for the dead there's no running water no toilets nothing that can bring a little Comfort a cemetery is supposed to be a final resting place perhaps the lucky ones will be forced to move once again and survive the Unlucky ones will be buried with their tents when stood make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
