well members of Israel's war cabinet have toured Northern Gaza they've been meeting soldiers taking part in the ground offensive on the Strip Israeli military video shows defense minister yov galland and emergency Minister Benny gun talking to troops Alan Fisher in occupied East Jerusalem for us I understand that prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been speaking in the last few minutes or so what's he been saying just in the last 15 minutes he's gone into a cabinet meeting in Tel Aviv he addressed the media as he often does on a Sunday he said that the war exerts a heavy costs and there's just simply No Escape from that and that comes after what has been a very difficult week weekend in particular for the Israeli Army what was interesting was v h next he said we do not yield to International pressure we have made this decision to continue the war alone now he said something similar in the past but given his conversation with Joe Biden on Saturday evening that and Joe Biden said that that was a a a private conversation rather than being on the record with a lot of the redout there will be questions about exactly what was said in that conversation now there'll be question marks about whether or not Joe Biden put more pressure on the Israelis to try and move to the next stage of the War sooner rather than later we've certainly heard it from us officials over the last two weeks this was Joe Biden weighing in just the day or two before Christmas and perhaps Benjamin netanyahu's comments reflect perhaps an a of frustration with Joe Biden that's something that may well come out over the next 48 hours or so and he said they will continue fighting uh until they reach their War goals which of course is to eliminate Hamas to return all the people who are being held captive and to create a situation where Gaza no longer poses a security threat to Israel Alan all of this coming after uh more Israeli soldier deaths what are you hearing there about that well even just in the last hour we've had confirmation that another Soldier died uh on Saturday that takes the number of Israeli soldiers who died in operations in Gaza over Friday and Saturday to 14 we know how some of them died four were killed when they were hit by a guided missile in their armored vehicle we know that a number were uh killed by explosive devices and there has been intense fighting in both northern and southern Gaza and so this is part of the ongoing operation by the Israelis uh what is clear is that while they say in Northern and Central Gaza they're exerting a level of military control they are still fighting very fiercely in fact the Israeli Army spokesman said on Saturday evening that they were were finding some of the situations uh quite intense uh and there were Fierce clashes in some places we are being told that not only are they Street to Street or building to building they're actually face to face but the fact that 14 Israeli soldiers have died in the last 24 48 Hours certainly adds a new light to Benjamin netanyahu's comments as he went into that cabinet meeting about the price that Israel is having to bear for launching this war in Gaza Ian thank thanks very much Alan Fischer in occupied East Jerusalem I want to bring in AKA Eldar he's a political analyst he's joining us now from Tel Aviv thank you very much indeed for being with us um is Israel's military reflecting the reputation going by what is happening on the ground in Gaza that it had before the War Began actually uh last time that uh Israel had to pay with so many fatalities was in the war in southern Lebanon 18 years ago uh this is uh very different from the yipo war or the Six Days War um the Israeli soldiers have actually to fight from house to house it's an open very crowded area uh to be very careful not to Target one of the hostages like what happened uh last week and uh to avoid Friendly Fire 20% of the fatalities in the in this war were Israeli victims of uh their colleagues who uh were not sure if uh what they see uh around the wall or in the in the house where Palestinian militants Hamas militants are hiding are their colleagues or an ambush of the Hamas um the uh question should be um what Israel can do to avoid it to avoid more fatalities and to do this Israel will have to strike more from the air and this of course will cause more fatalities of Palestinian innocent Palestinian and your reporter just uh mentioned the number of fatalities and then Israel has to look outside to the International Community to the United States to the UN and how long can Israel uh afford in in uh the international Arena uh to take this kind of criticism that it's taking now given that that what You' just said is that in order to draw try to avoid the the level of Israeli um fatalities increasing it would have to continue the aerial bombardments which as you've mentioned is predominantly against what the Us and other foreign governments are demanding um how difficult a situation is Israel's military particularly but also its political Wing um finding itself because it has to balance the deaths of Israeli of young Israeli conr conscripts in the main against the longer term objectives uh indeed Rob uh you have to ask yourself why now why didn't Israel do this boots on the ground in the uh previous escalations uh in Gaza and uh the answer is October 7th the Israeli public opinion uh is willing now to uh accept more fatalities and we are we didn't mention thousands of uh Israelis who will be handicapped who lost their legs or lost their hands and uh we are talking about maybe more than 2,000 Israelis young Israelis and um this is a kind of a war of Revenge that Israel at this time the Israeli public is willing to sacrifice because they believe that this is what it takes to put an end and to make sure that uh the massacre that happened uh in in October will not happen again and the other thing is that uh prime minister Netanyahu has managed to convince U I believe too many Israelis that in order to get the hostages back you need to use more power this is the only language that the Hamas militants understand and uh let let me forgive me for interrupting you but I want to I do want want to ask you about that particular point the the goal had the stated goal as Alam was mentioned before was to of the Israeli military and the Israeli government was to destroy Hamas and get the captives back um destroying Hamas to those of us watching outside seems to be coming increasingly difficult and is Ping putting a larger number of Israeli soldiers at risk because the strategy appears to be changing on the ground but at the same time that almost seems to put to one side the determination to get the the the captives back and yet the pressure within Israel seems to be to get the captives back first is there a disconnect in the Israeli government particularly about the goals of what they're trying to achieve well as the lobby of the families of the captives has have stated yesterday in a rally in Tel Aviv uh is that the government does not put the uh hostages the fate of the hostages on top of their agenda that actually what they say is that netan doesn't care about them and uh I believe that uh the time is running uh and time is you know the the clock is ticking against the captives it's now winter and they're freezing there there are old people there are young women there and uh every day that passes we know that uh What uh we have to add to the number of uh soldiers uh who are victims of this war we will have to add to the list another victim of October 7th one one more captive two more captives and uh uh the Israeli public now really believes and this is changing because we will see more and more demonstrations believes that there is no other way and as long as netan this is very important is getting a green light from the United States there are no sanctions uh what we get is in the best case is a call for human humanitarian Corridor and to stop uh the air rates but you know the boss the big boss President Biden is telling the Israeli public that Netanyahu is doing what needs to do AKA eldo from Tel Aviv we appreciate it thank you very much indeed for being with us thank you Ro
