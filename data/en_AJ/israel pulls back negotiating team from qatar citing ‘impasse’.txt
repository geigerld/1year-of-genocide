Israel is pulling negotiators from its intelligence agency mosad out of Doha it's blaming a deadlock in negotiations with Kari Representatives let's get more on this developing story from Ali Hashim who is live for us here in Doha so Ali what more are you hearing on this well a statement by the Israeli Prime Minister's office indicated that he is uh pulling out the uh Israeli delegation the Mad delegation that's uh that was taken uh part in the negotiations here in DHA of course this is an indirect negotiation uh mediated by uh Qatar the uh Israeli Prime Minister's office thank Qatar Egypt and the United States of America for their role in uh the truth that was reached uh last week of course as we know the Qatar mediated truce uh led to uh the uh uh Palestinian group Hamas releasing around 181 Israeli captives and around uh 23 uh th th and Filipino uh captives who were in Gaza and in return Israel um released some 240 Palestinians um including children and women many of them who were detained uh without even being sentenced by uh the courts so the situation right now given the fact that Israel already resumed the war is that there's no talks for now and uh everyone will be waiting to see whether a new attempt will be done in order to U restore a truce and of course uh the first category of uh captives that was released were women and and children from the Palestinian side and from the Israeli side now there are other categories including the uh women Soldiers the reservists the men who ended the uh uh the period in reserve and of course the military personnel who are in captivity with Hamas and Ali I know details are thin on the ground right now as to exactly why these talks these particular talks have have have hit a a roadblock at this point but I suppose it does uh give you a sense doesn't it of just how fragile uh and delicate this whole process has been from the beginning well from the beginning there was an offer that Hamas placed on the table which is all for all all the Israeli captives for all the Palestinian prisoners and Hamas said that it wanted to clean as it said the Israeli presence of Palestinian diones this was refused and then we went through the uh uh uh the first Truth uh that uh extended uh over around uh six days from the 24th of November till the 30th of November and then after uh uh this deadlock that Israel spoke about and uh Israel resumed its uh its campaign its war on on Gaza and as we can see the pictures from from Gaza it's it's continuing its bombardment of the residential buildings and and this is the situation now of course there's going to be a lot of uh efforts by Qatar of course as a mediator and also by the United States of America and Egypt in order to try bring the uh Israelis uh back to the table and of course Hamas uh from the other side because this is an indirect negotiation so the mediators will try their best but at the end there should be of course a new uh status qu and maybe new conditions on the table all right for the moment Ali Hashim life first there in daha thanks very much
