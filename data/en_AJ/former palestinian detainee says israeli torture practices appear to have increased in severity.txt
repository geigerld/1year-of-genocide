Israeli Human Rights group bet Salem has released a damning report on the mistreatment of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons since October the 7th now the report found that systematic abuse in Israeli prisons as calling them deao torture camps some of the violations include severe physical and sexual violence humiliation sleep deprivation and deliberate starvation the number of Palestinians in Israeli jails has now doubled to 9,623 since the war started last October at least 60 have died in custody Manu Schuman is a former detainee in Israeli prison joins us now from Toronto uh good to have you with us Mr Schuman on the program what's your first reaction when you hear of people being detained by Israel and then released back to Gaza or the occupied West Bank in a condition that their own families have never seen them in like that before um first of all um that they were released and they are still alive because like you said in your report earlier with regards to thees that have been captured from Gaza a lot of them have come back in body bags to their families and they've come back decomposed and um I've been detained in 2009 uh at that time um things were a little bit um uh less I think when it comes to the severity of the circumstances of the prisoners uh at that time I was taken into Administration ative custody I was in interrogated in bet and detained um in an in a prison in asalan and also suffered solitary confinement you have to understand that these people have no rights we had no rights I wasn't able to see a lawyer until many months ahead I wasn't able to see my family I was told that um I have a secret case and a file um that has full that is full of information about all misdeeds that I have done and that they cannot disclose to me any of it and that they will continually interrogate us until we let them know everything that they need to know about what is happening we suffered from sleep sleep deprivation we would for example sleep in a room with lights above us and we would they would continually come to our room and ensure that we stay awake no sleep the quality of the food is extremely bad very low in quantity sometimes the food is not enough for everyone there is no access to light we continuously get searched unfortunately we also sometimes ask to be stripped onto our to become naked in front of the in front of the prisoners can I just jump in there Mr sh can you just can I just jump in there can I just jump in there and just ask you how many people to a cell uh and the sanitary conditions as well so in when during normal times we would be between 6 to 9 depending on the number of bunk beds but whenever there is um some kind of emergency that happens in the West Bank or razza they would actually um punish the the the people in the cells and they would actually put 14 to 16 of us in one cell room so people would have to sleep on the floor and um people would also have to share the less food amongst each other in addition to sharing one bathroom sometimes the bathroom would just be a mere um Hall in the middle of of of of the cell where people would U would be able to do what they need to do um uh you have to understand that there's no medical treatment I remember being sent to a doctor once after being in severe pain and every time the doctor would say there's nothing wrong with you and then they would take you back in addition to that there is very severe psychological um mistreatment and psychological um damage that happens to us uh uh in addition to continuous cuffing you know the cuffing would stay in your hands during especially during the interrogation they would cuff your feet your legs at one point during the interrogation they would also Scare You by putting other prisoners like you in closets steel closets locking them up and then starting to shake the closets and throw them around so there's a lot of fear tactics that they also put in place so when you were tortured Mr schum when you were interrogated tortured however you would like to describe it um how many or how long would that last are we talking hours are we talking days and then were you then returned to the same prison cell or were you put somewhere so it it would it would it would take hours hours of of of of torture and interrogation and sometimes we would be taken back into a solitary cell sometimes we'd be taken back into the group cell um some thing that I can also add is I had it easy as well because I had a an international foreign passport the other detainees there they had just Palestinian passports and they had a much more tough time than what I went through um again I I strongly ask for you know as a result of this uh be salm report for other International agencies to come to the prisons inside Israel and check on the Palestinian PR as soon as possible because I'm sure what they're going through under this rightwing government is unbearable obviously very difficult for you to recount for us but we do appreciate it and gives our International viewers another perspective of what's going on uh in the region Manu Shuman thanks for joining us from Toronto thank you make sure to
