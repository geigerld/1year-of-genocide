at least four Palestinians have been killed and several have been injured in Israeli air strikes on tents near the alaa hospital in daab Bala the initial report suggest that the attack has been aimed at tents that have been housing people who have been Sheltering from the violence and journalists we can join Al jazer hind kri now live from the AL AXA Hospital compound hind I know you and the team have reported on many occasions from Al AXA hospital just bring us up to date with first of all with what's been happening since this latest attack [Music] it was a horrifying incident where at 12:00 p.m. today the Israeli forces targeted a tent in ALA Hospital in it's a tent surrounded by hundreds of other tents at least two Palestinians have been killed 15 have been injured including at least five journalists this hospital is not only a hospital it's a shelter and a refuge for thousands of Palestinians who made and set up their tents and there have been living here uh journalists have been uh working from uh the hospital for months now this is not only a hospital it's a house and a home uh for hundreds uh of Palestinians especially uh under uh this displacement conditions um talking to a lot of people uh displaced here they're saying that they're terrified that this incident is repeating itself where uh cha hospital has been attacked in the previous months and norer hospitals and Palestinians are saying that they do not feel safe anywhere and they don't know where they're going to go after the hospital has been um directly targeted by the Israeli forces hind we've had a statement from the Reuters news agency which is quoting Israel's military saying that it was targeting it carried out the air strikes targeting um an area operated by what it's calling the armed is isamic Jihad group in the courtyard of the hospital um can you tell me was there any way of distinguishing the tents in which particularly the journalists were working because as we can see obviously you and your colleagues have press across your uh the the protective clothing that you have there was there any way of making the tents for the journalists working uh more distinctive to show that it was press that was working there well I told you we have been living and coming to this hospital since November we never witnessed any type of any uh military action in the hospital uh my my colleagues work in the in in the tent sticking to this tent um we have been also talking with other displaced people surrounding the tent they personally know uh the person that was killed inside the tent they said that he uh sells vegetables on uh uh a a near near the hospital and in the market we never saw any uh military action we never saw anything related to Islamic Jihad in uh the hospital we come the we come here every single day because we have been all uh being displaced and the hospital is the only place that provides uh journalists with internet and electricity because there is a solar panel here um the hospital is also full with displaced people and uh the like I I believe that this uh a claim has been a justification to justify the target of uh of Palestinians and we have been seeing this ongoing for 6 months right now Palestinians being targeted in un shelters in hospitals in schools and always it's the same claim military action Islamic Jihad and Hamas uh there's no uh proof that there has been any Islamic Jihad in the hospital and in the tent targeted H thank you very much indeed as you're talking to us of course we can hear the Drone from the quadcopters that are flying above you which obviously obviously as we know the Israeli military use to monitor areas like that to be able to identify who is on the ground HRI thank you very much indeed
