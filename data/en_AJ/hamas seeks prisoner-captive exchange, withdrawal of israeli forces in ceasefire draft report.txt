all right we begin with developing news on the Diplomatic efforts to end the war on Gaza reuter says it's obtains a draft document that says Hamas has proposed a three-stage ceasefire plan in response to Qatari and Egyptian mediators it involves the exchange of Israeli captives captured by Hamas on October the 7th for Palestinian prisoners secure securing the Reconstruction of Gaza ensuring the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces and and the exchanging of bodies we have with us Hashim albar he's joining us here uh in Doha I suppose Hashim the devil is in the detail so what are you learning about this three-stage proposal very interesting developments yesterday when the Qatari prime minister Muhammad Alani met with blinken both said that they believe the elements are there for a deal the qataris said that they were confident and that Hamas uh response was positive and then they said we're not going to go into details because it's a very sensitive thing it has to go now to the Israelis and the other ones to have to look into the details except that the document was leaked earlier today and I know from our sources that the bulk of the this is is authentic Hamas wants this to be a phased agreement that starts with the announcement of a truce of about six weeks 45 days in exchange for the release of Israeli captives mostly women and the elderly but when you look at the details of the agreement they say we would like to see Israeli troops pull out from the urban areas populated areas and relocate onto the suburbs humanitarian Aid to be allowed and within the first phase we would like to maintain indirect talks with the Israelis and which is going to be through the key mediators Qatar and and Egypt why they want this to happen because this is where they're going to have to agree on the criteria of every single phase of the agreement I'll give you an example so Hamas is saying we are going to release the women and the elderly in exchange for an unspecified number of pales Israeli Palestinians detained by Israel it's going to be up to the qataris and to Egyptians to the Nar with the differences between Hamas and Israel now we come to phase to which is extremely crucial and important they want to get guarantees that the Israelis are going to make an announcement of a permanent ceasefire it's going to extend for 45 days but during that period they say they are going to release all the uh the other uh captives mostly uh soldiers okay so that's important then because the soldiers uh are somewhat of hamas's trump card are they not that's the that's the key component of their deal because this is where they believe when it comes to the aspect they are going to ask for a huge number of Palestinians detained in Israel to be released and we're going to go back to the criteria itself and whether the qataris and Egyptians will have more leverage to try to make sure that this H this succeeds and this is where the Americans will have to have a say now you go to phase three so we're talking about now 90 days almost 90 days phase one and phase two I'll tell you about the political calculus of Hamas when it comes to the phases of this agreement they're going to exchange the remains of those who were killed the Israeli captives killed Hamas has been saying over the past few months that many of those captives who were killed in Israeli bombardment in exchange for Hamas fighters who they say were killed and they would like to get back their remains at this phase Hamas wants to ensure coming back now to their political calculus that after almost 100 35 days it becomes a new political reality which is basically in 145 days we didn't have any Relentless bombardment and therefore it becomes a political reality and the ceasefire itself becomes a status quo they do understand I think one of the reasons why this document was leaked today is that Netanyahu and his War cabinet is looking into those details they will have to come up with an answer to the Americans to Blink in and then who's going to to come back to the to Qatar and then after that we're likely to hear the the official announcement of the agreement but for the Israelis it's also an extremely delicate thing to do because it's also about the personal political survival of Netanyahu yeah and the the way you have to sell it to your own people has to take into account that this is widely going to be seen as a dignified exit strategy same thing for Hamas and particularly for its top command inaz and Muhammad because when you look at what has been happening over the last four months you cannot come back to the people of Gaza and say you know what we have a deal which is which falls short of the expectations of the people we've seen the reaction of the people of Gaza over the last few weeks when they thought that suddenly an announcement was going to be imminent and they took to the streets celebrating the and they were so frustrated when they were told no you have to wait because it hasn't been finalized massive political pressure on Hamas and Israel as we speak to accept this agreement ment and you see the Hamas is trying to reinvent itself as a very practical pragmatic uh element in this story by saying you know what we're becoming more receptive than ever to the demands of the International Community but more so for our own key Partners or key mediators the Egyptians and the Saudis we don't want to be SE be seen as the ones who are torpedoing this deal look hasham I mean we do have Rory chalon standing by for us and occupied East Jerusalem so in a moment I'll bring him in find out what we canally from the Israelis and and blink of is in Aviv today but let me ask you this Hashim obviously this is a big if right if if the Israelis accept this or there are any changes to a ceasefire deal is there anything in that leaked document that talks about who will uh guarantee the terms of any deal going forward uh I I believe uh is going to be I'm trying to go through the different elements of this agreement based on the same guarantees that were implemented during the first agreement that happened in late November which is basically you have Egyptians operating in in in across the border with their own people the uh general intelligence uh directorate led by abas camel and they are in touch with different factions in in Gaza and you have the qataris who have Have Been instrumental Let me just explain to our viewers how this works so each time the the it's like like particularly when it comes to this agreement it was handed over to the political of Bureau of Hamas based in Doha but then the another ones who will have to have the final say they send it back to yya Sinar and Muhammad right yya is the top political leader inaz Muhammad is the top military commander and you have to have their say you have to have them on board otherwise you have to have a deal they will have to talk to their own people top commanders the founders of Hamas those who have huge political religious say in the in the strip they will come back to the political Bureau the political Bureau hands over the the the final answer to the qataris the qataris will give it back to the Americans or to the Israelis exactly what happened within this one why is it critical why is it delicate I think it's also an extremely delicate thing for the Americans because when you saw yesterday Anthony blinkin he didn't mention a ceasefire we do understand why but at the same time he said that he thinks a deal is is is now possible but the reason why he's going to Israel is to put more pressure on the Israelis to accommodate some of those demands um for this deal to move forward because ultimately it's about the way it's going to be perceived by the Israelis and by the Palestinians it's very it's very crucial for the political survival of Hamas and and and more so for Benjamin Netanyahu and I think it's going to come down to whether you will be able to look into those very small details of the agreement Implement them and move forward but as far as we are concerned it is different than the first agreement it's based on phases it's very important for Hamas because they believe this time not anything sure that than a prolonged ceasefire is a big no okay Hashim thank you so much for the time being we'll now bring in Rory Chalin joining us from occupied East Jerusalem Rory so now we have this a draft document that Hamas has proposed the three-stage ceasefire plan as hasham was just explaining to us Rory um what can we expect to happen in Tel Aviv today also keeping in mind that you have the Secretary of State Anthony blinkin who's there today and he'll be meeting with Israeli officials yeah blink's got a a very full day of diplomacy uh on Wednesday first of all he's meeting with Netanyahu uh then he's me meeting with the Israeli uh chief of military staff then he's meeting with the Israeli defense minister y have Galant then he's meeting with the president isak Herzog and then he's going to rala and he's going to be meeting with the Palestinian president mmud abas Hashim was exceptionally interesting there on the details of uh this Hamas response we know that this response was passed uh from Hamas through the ceries uh to mosad and is being picked apart poured over analyzed by the Israeli leadership right now and will be for hours to come uh what we don't know yet is what their response uh is likely to be we get the impression from the ceries that they are optimistic that this is something that can achieve a breakthrough deal um there is less optimism I think coming from the Americans and there is much less optimism uh coming from the Israelis now the Americans blinkin is saying that he thinks that a deal is possible and is necessary but Biden uh when asked about it very recently in a press conference said that he thought that hamas's uh demands here were a little bit over the top in Israel itself much much more negative negative it is very difficult to square at the moment the details that we are getting from uh this leak document and hamas's overall demand which is essentially that Israel ends the war in return for exchanges of captives and a ceasefire Etc with Israel's war goals which are to keep its occupation in in Gaza and to eliminate Hamas as a military force course these two things at the moment do not seem reconcilable so we may well have more rounds of negotiations to go okay thank you Rory Chalin reporting from occupied East Jerusalem
