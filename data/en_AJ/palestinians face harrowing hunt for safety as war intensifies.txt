One day before that, it was a difficult night. We did not sleep all night, and a building slammed next to us. The second day, all the people came out and we went out. We were like them. We were like them. They took us on Khamsa Street. Selfie and my husband made tents and sat down. The plane started to get dirty. I don’t know what the Qadaf missiles were. I don’t know what happened. Then something came down on us. Fire didn’t happen.  I know what it is. The whole earth smells our fire. We run through the fire. I was with a girl and the second girl I couldn't be with her. I didn't see her because of the fire. She doesn't know the fire. Whenever there was a fire, my daughter and my husband were gone. The arish was with his brother sitting. The day they brought them, they were burned, protected, and they couldn't be seen. My predecessor and her daughter were all burned. We can't go now.  God is sufficient for me, and He is the best disposer of affairs, but it is all a lie. It is all a lie. This brings people together and there is a distance in it. It is all a lie. Who is the least of them? The least of them. God is sufficient for me. God is sufficient for me, and He is the best disposer of affairs among them, and not a single one is standing with me. This is the rule.
