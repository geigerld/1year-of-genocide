it's just gone 10:15 GMT I'm Laura Kyle and we've been watching proceedings at the un's top Court in the hag the international court of justice though we've been hearing Nicaragua's case against Germany that Germany's support for Israel violates the Gen genocide convention Nicaragua told the court it's extremely urgent that Germany halts arms to Israel let's bring in our correspondent SE vasson she joins us now live from the hag se you were listening in you were in the court from most of those proceedings we heard twice from the Nicaraguan Ambassador and from two other representatives in this case so far talk us through the proceedings today well these past two hours must have been very uncomfortable for Germany 80 years after the Holocaust the country is now in the dock uh for facilitating genocide the Nicaraguan legal team called it a Judicial drama because this is an except unprecedented case two countries are here at the highest court who are not directly involved in the war in Gaza but they both are signaries to the genocide convention and that's why Nicaragua argues that Germany has its own obligation to fulfill this convention and not facilitate genocide and it has also uh to do everything it can to stop a possible genocide the ambassador of Nicaragua here in the Netherlands Carlos Gomez had very strong words because Germany has been saying from the beginning that Israel has a right to self-defense he said clearly Germany doesn't see the difference between self-defense and genocide that were very harsh words and he also uh argued that this that Germany is always referring to that its own existence because of the Holocaust is so much connected uh to Israel is is kind of misleading uh according to the Ambassador because he said don't confuse Israel with Jews uh and he also says that there is not only this moral and and and feeling of guilt that Germany is expressing but there's also a business aspect to it because uh the arm sales by German weapon companies have gone through the roof in the last year and he said it's not only uh Germany business as usual because they know what is happening in Israel and in Gaza they know and they have now also admitting in the last couple of months that they're very concerned about the possible breaches of international law but they still sending weapons Germany is the second largest uh exporter of weapons to Israel after the United States so this is what the ambassad had to say if the actions of Israel continue unrestrained as they have since its birth as a state and they continue to receive the indiscriminate support of States like Germany then a new generation of Palestinian will rise up again in the near future and we will hear a future Secretary General commenting this did not happen in a pakum the case before the court is an opportunity to break this vicious cycle without support of States like Germany Israel would not feel like can act with total impunity Nicaragua is hopeful that states particularly with the history of Germany will he heed the decisions of this court so that we heard there from Nicaragua for around two hours today tell us what we're expecting tomorrow and indeed when we might expect a ruling well tomorrow it's Germany's uh chance to defend itself and Nicaragua's legal team has already been anticipating on a few aspects and one of them is the jurisdiction of the international court of justice to to rule on this case because of course Germany is not directly uh bombing uh uh people in in Gaza and it's also has no soldiers on the ground there so there is no direct link to this possible genocide but according uh to the legal team by Nicaragua uh there is definitely this obligation that Germany has uh to abide by this genocide convention so we expect to hear the German team tomorrow it's led by the highest legal advisor to the foreign Ministry and a team from the UK and Italy who will present their case here uh and then we will expect a provisional measure or decision on provisional measures coming from the the court here in a couple of weeks okay step basson from outside the ha many thanks for bringing us that update on everything that has been going on there this morning let's take a look closer look now at Nicaragua's plea at the international court of justice such measures are binding but might not be enforced by individual countries Germany is one of Israel's closest allies and its biggest weapon supplier after the us German arms make up 30% of Israel's Imports that's according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute the country has increased weapons deliveries nearly tfold in 2023 delivering $354 Million worth last year let's bring in now Raymond Murphy he's a human rights lawyer and professor of law at the University of gway and he joins us now from gway in Ireland great to have you with us we just heard from our correspondent in the ha that this is an exceptional and unprecedented case but how strong is Nicaragua's argument um yeah there there this is a very important case and it seeks to clarify certain legal issues um I I think it has made a strong case in respect of certain of the provisional measures uh that it is seeking but I'm not certain that other other measures it has claimed uh that the court should award uh will be successful and at the heart of this case there are two legal issues and I won't be I won't be over technical the first is what exactly does it mean uh the obligation uh to to prevent and to punish uh the crime of genocide and what exactly are the obligations that follow from the Geneva conventions and common article one which requires all states uh to respect and ensure respect for international human Ian law and they are the two primary legal foundations on which this case is made and it has great relevance not just for Gaza but also for all states that manufacture weapons and Supply States and other parties with weapons that are ultimately used uh to commit violations of international law human rights law uh violations of the the uh convention against uh genocide and a whole host of other International measures that seek to protect civilians and other vulnerable groups um I think it also uh Nicaragua did address one of the central weaknesses in their own case and uh and that's a technical concept known as the indispensable third party issue Israel is not a party to this particular case but it is Central to the arguments being made in other words there's an accusation that Israel is committing violations of international humanitarian law and committing genocide in in in Gaza and usually they would have to be a party to the case before this could proceed but as was rightly pointed out I think by the representatives for Nicaragua we can't wait to prove that genocide is occurring we're all on public notice and all states are on public notice and that there are serious law and the international court of justice has already established that there is a plausible uh case to be made to protect the civilians of of um of Gaza from genocide so there is a lot of Merit in the case there are a lot of political and legal implications for this case and the what does surprise me is unlike the case taken by South Africa how little public attention and uh International media attention has been given to this case because because I jump in there R much of what the court is covering today I mean it's Uncharted Territory isn't it so this is a case that really could strengthen international law it is and and for that we all DET a gratitude to Nicaragua um I mean uh I if we get clarification on exactly what it means uh what what are the state's obligations all states obligations to prevent the crime of genocide and what are the what are the legal um implications for for Germany and other states that are providing weapons to Israel now that they are aware that there's a plausible case for genocide and that there's overwhelming evidence of a range of serious violations of international humanitarian law um and uh viewers might wonder why did it not take the case against the United States seen as the United States as the primary supplier of weapons to Israel the reason is simple in that is uh United States has opted out of the relevant Clause within the statute of the international court of justice and and the uh also the genocide convention that would allow such a case to be taken against it whereas Germany has not done so okay Raymond Murphy many thanks indeed for bringing your expertise as we uh open that first day of the case against Germany B by Nicaragua to the international court of justice
