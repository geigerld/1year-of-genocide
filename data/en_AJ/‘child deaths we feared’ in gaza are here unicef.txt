aa's Health Ministry says at least 15 children have died from malnutrition and dehydration at just one Hospital in the past few days for weeks the UN has been warning that 10,000 children in Gaza are at risk of starvation in this video from northern Gaza a mother is mourning the death of her child she told a Palestinian journalist her daughter died of malnutrition and lack of oxygen doctors at the hospital said the child was lacking clinical vitamins and minerals my daughter has died she passed away due to malnutrition all vitamins and minerals drop sharply in my daughter's body with an accepting heart all I can do is pray to God one I this child was suffering an acute lack of oxygen and severe malnutrition we did our best to save our life unfortunately the child died we do not know how many like her will follow well let's now speak to Adele hter who's reach reg director for Middle East and North Africa for Unicef the un's Children's Fund she's joining us from Aman in Jordan thank you very much Adel for speaking to Al jazer so we have 15 children dead because of malnutrition in Kamal adwin Hospital in Northern Gaza alone what is the rate the number of children across the Gaza Strip who have died because of lack of proper nutrition thank you um of course these are the children that we know about when we reported about this this morning in our statement we had information uh about 10 children but then in the afternoon you are saying there are reportedly 15 children so the number is on the rise and this is the number reported only from One hospital so we really do not know about uh what's happening to other children to whom we do not have access or to whom the ministry of health does not have uh enough access or information yeah what we know and what we have yeah yeah go ahead please finish your thought and then I'll get to my next question go ahead yeah I mean what we know and what we have been warning about is that access to humanitarian Aid and the delivery of a humanitarian Aid can really reduce the proportion of malnutrition among children one and six children in Northern Gaza one and six children which means 15% % of children in Northern Gaza under the age of two have severe acute malnutrition this proportion is 5% so much less in the areas where the aid is arriving yeah I want to ask you about the disparities before nor between North and South in just a moment but I just wanted to find out about the reasons a little bit more and I think it's really important for our audience to know why this is happening why are these children dying at such an alarming rate I've read that such a decline in a population's nutritional status is is unprecedented globally in just three months why is this happening at such an alarming rate it's happening first because the babies do not have the appropriate food usually babies get breast milk from their mothers and the mothers are very malnourished we know that there are the adults in Northern Gaza are getting one meal per day and if a mother gets one meal per day there is no way that she can breastfeed the child and as a result the child will not get all the nutrients usually the breast milk is necessary for everything for the child can give all the nutrients but in these cases when the mother cannot eat more than one meal per day of course the child is going to be malnourished they do not have the babies also are not like the adults they cannot eat the normal food that any adult can uh eat we are hearing horrible stories about what the people the adults are eating and this type of food cannot be given to babies the water the availability of water the availability of hygiene the fact that there is no adequate water uh we our reports indicate that uh the access to water in the parts of Northern Raza is one liter per day whereas under an emergency condition the minimum is 3 lers so this of course will cause more disease because they cannot take care of the hygiene and how they are feeding the babies yeah and in a situation of electricity yeah I understand the situation extremely um dire particularly extreme I understand in Northern Gaza the northern Gaza Strip which is almost completely cut off from a talk to us about that disparity between northern and southern Gaza yeah I mean we already said that the the the uh the the malnutrition is really preventable and in in Northern Gaza 15% of the children under two years are suffering from severe acute malnutrition this proportion and the other parts of Raza is 5% which means that when you we are able to have humanitarian Aid delivered to the people then the number of deaths among children will be less so it is preventable right and we can reduce the number of children who are dying by making sure that we deliver all the aid to the people who need It Adele I just wanted to ask you one last question I mean this war has had a devastating toll on children a as the un's children's agency your mandate is to save children's lives prevent them from dying of hunger defend their rights you must feel today a sense of helplessness Despair and even failure I imagine for not being able to prevent these children in D in Gaza from dying well we never give up on children that's for sure and we are trying everything and in fact on the 1 of March before two days we were able to deliver a very small uh supply of vaccines and of some essential uh medical supplies to Northern Gaza but this is only one time since the 23rd of January and that's not enough so we need access but we will not give up and we need access through different routs we needs for the bombardment to stop we need a ceasefire to be able to deliver to the the children what they need but we will never give up our teams are still on the ground trying to reach as much as they can nor than Gaza and sometimes putting their own lives under danger to be able to reach those children but we need for all the land routs to be open and we need definitely a ceasefire that will enable us to reach those that are most in need but we will never give up thank you very much for speaking to us Adele h Regional director for Middle East and North Africa for Unicef thank you for your time thank you
