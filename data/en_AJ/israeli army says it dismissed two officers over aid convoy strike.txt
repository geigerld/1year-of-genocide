the Israeli military has just released its report on the killing of the seven employees of the world Central Kitchen Aid group in Gaza on Monday for more on this we'll bring in our correspondent Rory Chalin joining us from occupied East Jerusalem so what have we learned from this Rory well we have learned that this was a according to the Israelis a grave mistake and they have just put out their initial assessment uh into the incident uh which has already been shared with the world Central Kitchen it's also been shared with the embassies of the countries uh whose uh citizens were killed uh in that air strike uh and now it has just been released to the public it's basically been de embargoed and what this report says it's been carried out by uh the uh joint fact finding mechanism of The Joint Chiefs of sta led by Major General yov har who's the major general in the reserves what they've said is that this was the result of a misidentification of the target they say that they thought that there was an armed fighter on one of these a trucks and then when the uh uh Convoy got to the warehouse they thought there was another armed fighter that left on the Convoy from the warehouse they say they didn't identify the trucks as being associated with the world Central Kitchen despite the fact as we know already uh from the world Central Kitchen that they have been updating the Israeli military all the way uh on their on their mission and supposedly the Israeli military knew exactly where they were so this report says that the strike was a serious violation of the commands and of the military standard oper operating procedures and it shouldn't have occurred what they're going to do about it well heads are rolling basically um they uh the the military's Chief of Staff has decided that the Brigade fire supports commander who is a major he is going to be dismissed the brigade's chief of staff who was the colonel is also going to be dismissed and then there are going to be reprimands for the Brigade support commander and the 162nd Division commander and a reprimand uh for the commander of the entire uh Southern command they finish this uh initial report by saying the the IDF will learn lessons and incorporate them into its ongoing operations so it's an apology it's uh you know it's it's dismissals and it's saying that they will endeavor not to make the same mistakes again that's is where this report takes us right and Rory I mean to just put s things in context here there was a lot of international pressure on Israel after this in ident was there not and particularly a lot of people say because the killings involved foreign aid workers in Gaza well exactly I mean this seems to have been something of a watershed uh in this war we have certainly seen from Israel's friends and allies around the world uh the condemnation uh following this incident that perhaps they weren't willing to extend to the thousands and thousands and thousands of deaths of Palestinians that you could say might have been killed in similarly erroneous uh conditions or or situations but because these uh people were foreigners because you know they had they came from countries like the UK uh like Poland Canada the United States um governments that have been you know in the past very friendly towards Israel they're angry and they're annoyed and so they are putting pressure on Israel uh to respond so this response I think is Israel hoping that it is uh drawing a line under this incident what we're not seeing uh in this report is that there are going to be any legal prosecutions against these people now that might come in the future but that's certainly not contained in this this this report what we get is dismissals from positions and Military reprimands but that's not necessarily Justice uh for the people for the families and friends of those who died okay Rory thank you for that update from occupied East Jerusalem
