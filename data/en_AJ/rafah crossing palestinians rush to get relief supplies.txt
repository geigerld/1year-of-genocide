there's been a Scramble for Aid at the Rafa Crossing between Gaza and Egypt The Crossing is the only entry point for Aid into Gaza at the moment the UN says hunger levels across the strip have spiraled in recent days telecommunication lines in Gaza have been damaged and this is only complicating humanitarian operations let's bring in our correspondent hany Mahmud he is joining us live in Rafa in southern Gaza and hany you have been reporting from Rafa for week weeks now where you have been saying that 1 million people from the Gaza Strip are now in Rafa and they as we can see in those pictures are desperate for humanitarian Aid yes indeed very desperate humanitarian situations for not only the residents of rafah City here but also for the 1 million displaced Palestinian who uh quite frankly are becoming hungry thirsty and traumatized as the the war is is pounding them and more unpredictable uh uh bombs falling on their on their homes destroying their residential homes and and their infrastructure people and then this is very consistent with a report by the uh by a statement by the general Deputy Commissioner of Honor who described that there was an imminent starvation going on here whatever the amount that has been lit in is not enough it's not enough for those who have been displaced those who are hungry and thirsty and it just if we look at that what happened people pre this war lived in in their homes and they had everything that they needed to sustain them for for every single day but all the sudden now they are without anything without a home without the access to food without access to water without access to medical supplies and the scenes that we we're we we're looking at either from the the videos or picture just just a natural response when people starve when when people are starved to death when people are hungry this is what we what we will see happening people trying to survive it's a survival mode right now and Hanny the people who have fled to Rafa have escaped or tried to escape attacks from northern from Central Gaza and one of the most targeted places in Gaza has been the jabalia refugee camp in the North and the attacks there are continuing yes indeed and it's it's nonstop it has happened within the past a few weeks and since the beginning of this war is still continuing and and and what what what we were just describing in in the the the the chaos when humanitarian AIDS are coming in is the direct result of people becoming displaced there are more people becoming displaced the fact that that people step outside their homes and and let alone it is being destroyed put them at this very situation there 20 people have been killed more than aund 20 people have been critically injured as a result of a massive Target an explosion of an entire residential Block in jabal and this is not the first time jabalia been the Target have been targeted repeatedly more than any other place across the Gaza STP there more civilian are dying more children more women and the aftermath more people are becoming hungry and this is what the the the result of what we're seeing Hy thank you very much for that that is hany mahm with the latest live and ruer in southern Gaza
