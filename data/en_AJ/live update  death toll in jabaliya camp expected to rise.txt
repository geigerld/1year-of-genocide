welcome to the program there is no safe place in Gaza this hour Israel's bombardment has been constant and unsparing Thursday more than 150 Palestinians were killed by Israeli air strikes in total more than 1,400 Palestinians have been killed since Saturday including First Responders and journalists and that number is rising entire neighborhoods have been destroyed at least 338,000 Palestinians have fled their homes and have been forced to take shelter elsewhere and at least 1300 Israelis have been killed since Hamas launched its surprise military offensive on Southern Israel on Saturday among the dead are 245 Israeli soldiers and 47 police officers and hundreds of Israeli civilians these are the areas that have come under Israeli attack late on Thursday they include refugee camps Israeli air strikes have also hit the hammed bin jasim Hospital dozens of patients and displaced Palestinians were inside we have a team of correspondents covering all angles of this story they're in Gaza West Jerusalem and Washington DC but first yna Al begins our coverage from Gaza the flow of casualties to gaza's hospital seemingly never ends these children are caught up in the middle of Israel's war on Gaza they're unlikely to understand why this is happening and they're clearly terrified hospitals are running on emergency generators when the fuel runs out the lights will go out the incubators will stop working kidney dialysis machines will shut down and x-rays can't be taken faces are thick with dust from homes that have collapsed often on top of them without warning Israel says it is destroying locations used by Hamas but Gaza is so densely populated that it is almost impossible to separate private homes from where Fighters may or may not be hiding and anyway these people have no choice where decides to operate we were sleeping peacefully and then suddenly my house and my neighbor's house were hit by bombardments I went outside and I found my children all injured then I looked around and I saw dead bodies and body parts and other people injured this appears to be Israel's most powerful bombing campaign against Palestinians in the 75e history of the conflict whole neighborhoods have been flattened for the people trapped here there's nowhere to go there's nowhere to escape Israel shut its border crossings on Saturday and bombed the one to Egypt yum Al jazer Gaza Strip let's get the latest from Gaza now and bring in tck Abu AUM hello there tar thousands of strikes since Saturday we know that and there have been dozens in just the past hour paint a picture of what it's like inside Gaza right now well another night of Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip continues uh different areas of the Gaza Strip were bombarded by the Israeli Air Forces specifically right now in asaa neighborhood with where is there is an a residential building was leveled to the ground without prior warning also in kanun specifically in Hamed City uh it's a very uh densely uh populated area with a different kind of residential uh Towers a flat that was bombarded by the Israeli air strikes now the Gaza Strip at the current moment is is witnessing uh different kinds of attacks by the Israeli uh by the Israeli forces from Land from the sea and even from the uh aircrafts uh according to the uh Palestinian Ministry of Health inside the Gaza Strip the number of the Palestinian victims is rising also uh uh the number of children killed by the Israeli forces reached to 500 kids and around 276 women also were killed during the early beginning of the conflict okay thank you very much for the update TK Abu aom there earlier my colleague Tom McCrae spoke to Jennifer Austin who's the deputy director for the United Nations relief and works Agency for Palestinian refugees in Gaza she explains just how dire the situation is there it is exhausting but it's more exhausting for the staff of the UN who are working tirelessly to provide services to the refugees and and I think I heard earlier in your um earlier speaker talking about our our schools our shelters that we've got 270,000 uh idps are in our shelters and yeah we are really stretched um our emergency response plans cater for 150,000 clearly like after a few days and we're now into day six we've almost exhausted all our supplies it's extremely extremely difficult yeah we know many people and and organizations are calling for a safe passage to allow civilians uh to get out of Gaza but also allow Aid and supplies in and I know that you you're clearly one of them who are you talking to about trying to get a safe passage open well um that's not part of the of the UN um plan because that that's that's out sits outside of the unua but I'm not sure this is part of the who's plan I guess but what uh what we're doing is we're trying to mobilize fuel resources that we can um get our get available um you know we need to have fuel fuel into Gaza is the most critical because fuel is running the desalination plants so it's got we can get clean drinking water fuel is running um the generators for the hospitals you know without fuel um you know gazer is in really big big trouble how you personally and your your teams there how long will you be able to operate because obviously you're suffering like everyone else in Gaza at this point in time well our commissioner General has been working tirelessly at the highest levels you know up to their Secretary General I'm sure that everyone is doing all the advocacy needed working with Egypt trying to get safe Passage through Egypt Egypt and Rafa seems to be the only available option at the moment the US Secretary of State is in Israel to reassert American support his visit follows the first shipment of US military aid that arrived in Israel on Wednesday blinkin is also set to meet Palestinian president Mahmud abas in Jordan on Friday Sarah hyat reports from West Jerusalem see another us reassurance to Israel this time face to face we're here we're not calling anyway US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shake hands firmly a show of solidarity between two countries whose Alliance and friendship goes beyond politics building on his Jewish Heritage and referencing bipartisan supports for Israel blinken had this message you may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself but as long as America exists you will never ever have to we will always be there by your side you standing together in unity Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the US's help Mr secretary your visit is another tangible example of America's unequivocal support for Israel Hamas has shown itself to be an enemy of civilization US citizens and other foreign Nationals were among those killed or captured during the attack on Israel by Hamas fighters on Saturday intelligence and Military Support from the US arrived on Wednesday in the form of the world's largest aircraft carrier fighter jet and other military aid blink's visit and the formation of a so-called War cabinet under an emergency Unity government is supported nationally in Israel the United Nations and other nations though are urgently calling on the country to allow safe passage for people to leave Gaza but for now they have no way out as Israel continues its bombing AL jazer West Jerusalem let's bring in hod abdalhamid who is outside the knesset in West Jerusalem hello there Hoda there's a sense of unity within Israel politically with the knesset approving an emergency government just how significant was that and is there the same sense of unity among everyday Israelis well it was more of a formality in the sense that prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu had already uh made a war declaration in iMed in the immediate uh uh aftermath of the attack last Saturday but he had to go in front of the ceset and basically what it does is that he has activated some closes of the basic clo closes pertaining to war that basically gives him the authority to delegate to this newly formed War cabinet which is part of the broader newly formed emergency Unity uh government so that is that was what was happening at the knesset and then you had the Second Step that also needed to be done is that you had five new ministers who had to uh who had to do their o oath to the in front of the caness they are now part of the government they are five members of the opposition National uh Unity uh party headed by Benny Gans and he is one of the five Minister who uh who were there today so all of this is basically formalizing all of the politics and all of the political negotiations that happened over the past few days and I have been looking online and talking to some people and some of them said well they're very happy that finally they can see two bitter Rivals standing together and uh showing you know a united front in the wake of uh the enemy and in the wake of what the country is going to go through in the coming days or weeks actually some people said you know it took them six days it's a long time five days to form the government at this emergency Unity government and then today is the sixth day some of them told me no that that should have been done much much quicker considering the uh the the the gravity of the situation this country is in at the moment now um not all of the politicians are are are united even though everybody says that they will they will support this emergency Unity government but you have you still have the major opposition party with the double of seats in the knesset than what Benny Gans has who said that it would not join that government because it is still against uh the fact that in the ruling Coalition of uh the Prime Minister there are two far right uh ministers and the opp y leid the main opposition figure blames these two farri uh ministers for also creating this and provoking the Palestinians and somehow taking part in in you know in this tension that is at the moment in the country and that has been simmering in the weeks and months lead to that in the occupied West Bank so that is happening now now Israelis are very known to be standing together to put aside all the blame game uh during times of Crisis and this is what's happening now even though polls indicate that they squarely put the the the blame on the government and on the political leadership for for the lack of security along that border with Gaza but they will put put that conversation to the side until the end of the war and then Benjamin Netanyahu will have to answer some very tough questions uh his political survival is at stake his legacy is at stake because during his tenure as prime minister the man who presented himself always as the man the only option to provide security to Israel well then during his tenure Israel faced the worst day in its history as many people say okay thanks for breaking it all down for us H abdal Hamed in West Jerusalem let's head to return now to Secretary of State Anthony blink's visit to Israel where Patty khain is covering developments for us from Washington DC Patty this was blink's most direct plea so far for Israel to show restraint it was and I think what's significant is here is where he did it there were some questions I think as to whether the message that had been growing here in the United States evolving saying that while Hamas does not follow the rules of uh the laws of war Israel has to uh we heard that from the president but the question was would Secretary of State an Anthony blinkin say it well he was in Israel now notably he didn't say it next to the Prime Minister but he did say it to members of the press that the US expects that they will follow the laws of war the laws of war say you cannot starve an entire population of food fuel uh and and water it is a war crime so what is the US going to do about this obviously uh they have some leverage they are currently supplying Israel with lots of ammunition the first shipment arrived this week including uh missiles for the Iron Dome that air defense system that Israel relies on so very much uh they could use that as leverage now they're giving no indication that they plan to do that nor have they done that in the past at least not that we know of uh but they are also trying to push the Israelis for a humanitarian corter because obviously again rules uh the laws of war you can't indiscriminately Target civilians and while Israel can say that it's not trying to Target civilians it's pretty much impossible not to when you're talking about bombing a population that cannot leave so he is pushing for a humanitarian Corridor and in that vein we've seen him change his travel plans he was origin only supposed to go to Israel and Jordan now he has added stops to speak with the Palestinian president Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas then he's going to go to Saudi Arabia cutter the United Arab Emirates and his spokesman says the three focus is there with those conversations is for them to try and use their influence to make sure that this war doesn't broaden to talk about how to get the hostages out and how to actually enable a humanitarian Corridor that it seems so far at least from reports that Israel and both Egypt are in fact resisting and Patty is the defense department correspondent have you spoken to them and and what are they saying any intel you can give us I just spoke on background with a very senior uh Pentagon official and they told us that in fact the Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin he's going to be leaving Brussels where he was focused on the Ukraine war and he's going to be headed to Israel tomorrow for meetings with his counterparts and with Benjamin Netanyahu obviously well Lincoln is focused on the the diplomacy of it it's being the state department uh the Department of Defense is going to be looking a little bit more closely at Israel's uh potential plans and obviously we've seen preparation for a ground Invasion they're going to be talking about what sort of Munitions what sort of equipment Israel is going to need because if they do take that step uh from everyone I've ever spoken to in the military Community if there's one kind of fighting you do not want your forces doing it is Street to Street ground combat in a very densely populated area especially when there is a very long series of tunnels involved uh it is incredibly dangerous for any armed forces and you need a lot of equipment if you're going to even try to do that successfully so we expect that Austin's conversations are going to be much more on the M Munitions that we that they need he's also probably going to highlight what the US has done to try and uh basically warn off anyone who might seek to escalate the situation as we know the USS Gerald Ford the largest uh air aircraft carrier in the world arrived on stations with its assorted ships we've seen air uh assets uh improved and moved to the region uh so he's going to take the military piece of that now we do know that Americans are in Israel with expertise on hostage negotiations and hostage recovery there have been some speculation of whether the US would launch Special Forces from their assets in the Eastern Med but uh again this very senior Pentagon official told me that they do not expect to see any American forces involved in this conflict okay thanks so much for the update as always paty Khan in Washington DC for us two of hamas's leaders have just issued a video statement Basim Naim and gazi hammad condemned Israel's indiscriminate bombing of Gaza if we uh describe the situation in Gaza it is could be said in one word it is a genocide uh there is no safe area for the people in Gaza to seek Refugee or shelter uh every area and every building is under possible attack everyone is targeted and vulnerable to Israel killing including women children elderly and even disabled people with and people with special needs for the uh this uh days difficult days in Gaza the brutal Israel aggression against Gaza Strip continues with all p prity and intend to com commit as more crimes and massacres as they can uh they are targeting residential neighborhood they are destroying homes without giving any warning or chance for the inhabitants to leave uh not to mention the illegal and unethical closure of Gaza Crossing and cutting all vital services including water electricity fuel the supply of medicines and food as clearly stated by the Israeli leaders the the Israel leaders are giving clear instruction to their army to carry out a genocide uh to more than two million citizens in Gaza Strip we are facing an presented crimes in the modern history they uh have exceeded all books of uh at atrocious crimes and they have uh torn up all the human Arian and international law and uh conventions we clearly condemn the reports we have received that certain Western countries are dispatching Military Support to the Israeli occupation those countries are taking part in the Israeli aggression and killing of our people instead of seeking a resolution or contributing to ending the longest ever occupation in modern history e for the captives and prisoners held by the resistance we confirm here and make it clear we are fully committed to treat them in accordance with our religious values and the rules of international humanitarian law but in the same time we are really worried that at the that as the Israel aggression is everywhere in Gaza they might be the victims to the Israeli Army bombardment like our people where all know that Israel military allows Israeli Army to Target captives and their captors even if it leads to kill them which is named the Hannibal Doctrine ninth we also confirm that the file of prisoners and capes will not be open as long as the Israeli aggression on Gaza continues 10th on the Israeli allegations of killing civilians and beheading of babies which were unethically and unprofessionally adopted by many Western media Outlets this is completely shame that these media Outlets follow such lies and Israeli propaganda without making simple efforts to check the the reality of these allegations we firmly deny these allegations and as we reject this media bias we call on the media agencies to abide by the journalism code of ethics 11th in connection to this bias we totally reject the racist racist speech by US President Joe Biden who adopted Crystal Clear lies against our resistance and who blindly followed the Israeli allegations and propaganda that were refuted even by many US media finally I conclude as saying again that the Palestinian people have full right to fight back until ending the Israeli occupation where will we will continue to do so until reclaiming our national goals and rights we call upon the governments and peoples all over the world to help us against such brutal and fous incubation there's been a shooting near herod's gate in occupied East Jerusalem there are reports two Palestinians have been injured by Israeli Security Forces after shots were fired at a police station two officers were injured security forces have cordoned off the area to France now where police have used te gas to disperse Pro Palestinian demonstrators in the Capitol Paris despite bans on such Gatherings Natasha Butler was there well there hundreds of demonstrators here this Pro Palestinian uh protest in the center of Paris they actually being kept very tightly in this area between uh these two buildings in the street and that is because the police are not letting them leave this is a demonstration has actually been banned by the French authorities because they are worried about any violence they see say that any people turning up here will be arrested but for the time being what we're seeing is police very much on the sides of protesters say though that they're not going to go anywhere the authorities mix up everything we're here for justice a ban is an affront to our freedom of speech and to democracy well what's happening now is police are moving people back because what they're trying to do is encourage these protesters to go home because this protest has been permitted they're staying here for now many people have said to uh me when I've been talking to them is that it's so sad that people are dying on all sides that civilians should not be caught up in this and they also feel that the cause of the Palestinian people has been ignored for too long we have compassion for all the victims on the Israeli side and also on the Palestinian side but people must also understand that for nearly 75 years Palestinians have been colonized so we are here as elsewhere in the world to support them and call for two free [Applause] states we can see there's some young girls there bit frightened by what's going on the police have just pushed in protesters I'm going to move you there slightly they've just pushed them the right the way down because they're trying to clear this protest there are a lot of people though that look quite nervous quite tense in the situation certainly changeed from a peaceful protest one that seems a little bit more violent Z Paris that's it for me Emily anguin and this bulletin but I'll be back in 30 minutes time with more of our special ongoing coverage of the Gaza War these are live pictures out of Gaza at the moment we'll have all of the day's news including day going into day seven of
