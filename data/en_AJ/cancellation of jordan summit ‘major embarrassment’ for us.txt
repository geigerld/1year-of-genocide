let's bring in Maran bashara he's alaz senior political analyst he joins us now from London Maran we've watched a bombardment continue now for 10 days but does something of this magnitude change the calculus here well certainly today was uh worse than anything we've seen before um the idea that a school is bombarded a hospital is bombarded apartment building are bombarded hundreds many hundreds of civilians die within hours that's a a Perpetual Massacre this is a massacre on a on a scale we haven't seen probably since the second world war and uh it is not uh you know more of the same uh talk about collateral damage this is not collateral damage in in a war situation the last two days we've heard from the Israeli leaders notably the Israeli president himself isak Herzog saying that there there are no innocent Palestinians in Gaza saying that they are all responsible for the attack on Southern Israel and hence this massacre does in fact uh take the shape of a genocide because there is now a stated clear intent to hurt the pales in they are not collateral damage killed by mistake in a bombardment of the Gaza Strip these are now targeted even the people who are fleeing for their life to the South are being bombarded clearly no one is safe in Gaza nowhere is safe in Gaza nothing is safe in guysa Maran we've seen well attempts at the UN Security Council for resolu resolution nothing's happened there there have been calls multiple calls from Human Rights organizations for some kind of a ceasefire also a humanitarian Corridor neither of those things have happened where are we at now in terms of of mediation or or some path forward does what we're seeing tonight change the political calculus potentially for members of the International Community it must of course but the International Community has proving to be impotent and indifferent in large part and clearly the part of the International Community that uh has been flexing its muscle it has been basically empowering Israel watching uh the German Chancellor today uh just you know wants to make you cry uh as if never again it means never again to a certain people not to humanity as if the Palestinians are people of a lesser God than Jews such indifference such cynicism such hypocrisy on the part of western leaders uh this week today uh simply ignoring Palestinian Sovereign really uh you know what makes one question uh a number of things that one thought were constant but back to your question I think I think there is a way out in the next 24 hours and and please listen carefully because this is important those who are meeting with President Biden tomorrow Palestinians jordanians and Egyptians yes they are all on the American payroll yes they are dependent on American assistance but they are also Arabs and Palestinians and instead of more backs slapping with the US Secretary State they need now today in light of this massacre make their position clear we will not meet with President Biden tomorrow unless there is a ceasefire this should have been their position already before today's Massacre but now that today's massacres with hundreds perhaps more of Palestinian Deads thousands of casualties within one day this definitely requires a Palestinian Arab position okay at least a Palestinian position those Palestinian officials in Aman who are getting excited about meeting the American president should take a political position a moral ethical position on the side of their people by simply saying we will only meet if you the American president put pressure on Israel that is also also in the American payroll not just American payroll four plus billion dollars a year from the American taxpayers certainly the American president has leverage with this genocidal Israeli government and I think it would be not only a huge embarrassment this will probably be the biggest setbacks of all setbacks of the past two three years if Arab leaders especially the Palestinian leader tell the American president look we cannot afford to be complicit in your supported war crimes against the Palestinian people anymore I think it's doable I think they can get away with it and I think it will put enough pressure on President Biden as he makes his long flight to Amman Jordan to reconsider and to start putting applying some pressure on the Israeli government to stop their Massacre against the Palestinians Mar one as we watch these pictures here and we're watching pictures from alifa hospital where a lot of the injured have been taken after that blast at the Ali Arab hospital and and you and I have spoken about how the US position or the US tone on the humanitarian situation in Gaza has shifted somewhat over the last few days as we see these pictures including a huge amount of injured children and women and as we look at these numbers which we've gotten from the Palestinian health Ministry at least 500 dead what does this mean for Biden's trip you've spoken a little bit there about what Arab leaders should be demanding of Biden what is Biden's position in going into those conversations that he's going to be having with Netanyahu he's going to be facing huge amounts of pressure at home absolutely look uh we've seen a bit of a trajectory the past few days since secretary blink started his uh tour of the Middle East back and forth between AR capitals and clearly there's been some slight change in tone we are no longer talking about ethnically cleansing the Palestinians and throwing them into siai so-called humanitarian Corridor a really really orwan ugly term of terming ethnic cleansing but now the secretary state is talking about safe Zone well that's another orwan concept that's clearly shown it itself to be today that's just another way of Israel being able to Target bombing civilians even those who are fleeing for their lives even those who are injured in hospitals even those who are looking for shelter so there is a change of tone but there isn't a real change in policy and that's the problem the American Administration knowing that the world is watching and it must be taking some initiatives aside from its unconditional support to Israel's genocidal war and it has become now truly genocidal war in Gaza they need to create the impression that they also care about human life and that they want to help with the humanitarian disaster but in fact by giving Israel the green light K blanch unconditional support to carry on with its bombardment of Gaza they are not helping at all they're simply putting a bandaid over a cancerous policy that is leading to a continuous permanent Perpetual Massacre of a people who are basically more or less unarmed and just trying to survive Maran bashara there Al jazer senior political analyst sharing those thoughts with us from London thank you very much Maran
