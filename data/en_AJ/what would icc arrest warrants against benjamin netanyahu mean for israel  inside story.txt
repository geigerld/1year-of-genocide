all eyes are on the international criminal court it's investigating Israel's actions in Gaza and the West Bank and Israeli officials fear it's preparing to issue arrest warrant against a prime minister and other senior figures so what would legal action mean for the country and its leaders this is Inside Story hello there and welcome to the program I'm Nick Clark so Israel's prime minister says nobody will stop its military actions not even the international criminal court the ICC is investigating the country's operations in Gaza in the occupied West Bank and could issue warrants for the arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders he says such a move would be outrageous and set a dangerous precedent and the foreign minister insists the country will not be deterred and will continue to fight the Court's prosecutor says anybody who breaks the law will be held accountable but Israel is not part of the ICC and does not recognize its jurisdiction yet any warrant IT issues could put its officials at risk of being arrested in other countries so what does this mean for Netanyahu and his country we'll put that to our guest shortly but first this report from imag Kimber Israeli officials fear the international criminal court May issue arrest warrants for senior members of government and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu may be on the list charges could be over alleged war crimes committed during Israel's ongoing war on Gaza emergency meetings have reportedly been held by the prime minister's office under my leadership Israel will never accept any attempt by the ICC to undermine its inherent rights of self-defense while the ICC will not affect Israel's actions it would set a d dangerous precedent that threatens the soldiers and officials of all democracies fighting Savage terrorism and wanton aggression the ICC is the only permanent International court that can prosecute individuals for crimes against humanity including genocide Palestine was admitted in 2015 but Israel is not a member and does not recognize its jurisdiction however many Israelis are looking to the court in the ha for justice over the Israelis who were taken captive on October the 7th by Hamas perpetrators should be held criminally accountable for the atrocity they committed we trust that the I has the capacity to bring about Justice for the hostages and their families the visit of the prose prosecutor to Israel has reinforced our belief in the integrity and professionalism of the Court international criminal court prosecutor Kareem k says the attacks on October 7th come under the Court's Jurisdiction and are part of his investigation into crimes allegedly committed in Gaza reality laws of war must be respected they can't be rendered Hollow they can't be interpreted so as to Avid them of meaning or to um dilute or eviscerate any protective purpose that the Geneva conventions and the law provides the most vulnerable children uh women uh people that are sick uh or civilians they must be interpreted with full protection the prosecutor has expressed deep concern over Israeli incursions and its bombing of Rafa where around 1.5 million people are Sheltering possible charges could include acts regarded as collective punishment including the deliberate starvation of Palestinians in Gaza and the withholding of Aid Israel has faced numerous accusations of crimes against humanity by International lawyers and un Representatives the state is also facing a case of genocide in the international court of justice brought by South Africa for Netanyahu an arrest warrant may not be of immediate concern but it could impact his position internationally there's only one thing better Imaging Kimber Al jaer for Inside Story So then plenty to take on let's bring in our panel of guests from Tel Aviv Gideon Levy is a columnist with heret newspaper in anbury in the United Kingdom Jeffrey nice is a barister and a human rights lawyer and in gothenberg Steven zunes is a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco jents a very warm welcome to all of you uh the IC by its own definition investigates where warranted and tries in individuals charged with the gravest crimes of concern to the International Community you know the workings of the ICC very well Jeffrey nice uh we might well expect then that the ICC would be looking into potential crimes from both Israel and Hamas given everything that has gone on since October the 7th absolutely it should look at it and I'm glad it has um it's heartening to know from what Mr khah has said that all that although the crimes of October the 7th were committed on is the soil of the state of Israel he satisfied he's got jurisdiction there and it's well known that he has jurisdiction for any crimes committed on Gaza or indeed on the West Bank because of the acceptance of jurisdiction by the court following uh uh statement by the Palestinian Authority in 1995 so from the very beginning both sides of this conflict could have been and I'm glad to say are being investigated by as your piece says the only established International Court uh you mentioned there Jeffrey Kim Khan the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court uh one more thing Jeffrey the the fact that Israel is not a signatory to the IC what difference does that make how does that affect things well it doesn't in these circumstances because if Mr KH is satisfied not only that he has jurisdiction over crimes committed on Gaza territory and he satisfied that crimes committed on territory of Israel possibly because they were initiated undoubtedly in the territory of Gaza then it makes no difference that Israel is not a member of the international criminal court it can't avoid the exercise of jurisdiction by Mr KH and his team of prosecutors and we'll have to wait and see what the outcome of those investigations are all right so what's the picture in Tel Aviv let's speak to Gideon leevy he's uh there now and knows the sense the pulse of what's happening the fact that Benjamin Netanyahu has come out and spoken about this Gideon what does that say and what does it demonstrate is he worried is worried and I must be frank with you there are moments in which I'm hopeful net is very worried and not only netan this was the moment that the whole the Israeli Elite which is involved in the occupation in the war in Gaza was afraido because finally everyone cares about himself before anything else unfortunately so and it might make their lives quite complicated when they will not be able to travel and even the effect that you are wanted makes the whole the whole game a new game it's not anymore the condemnations of the EU or the resolutions of the UN General Assembly how it's about decl declaring Israel as a as a place where international law crimes are being committed and criminals are being wanted this is going to change the whole game when you say uh there are members of the administration not only Benjamin Netanyahu who are you talking about and tell us let's Explore More why they would be so afraid as you put it look it accompanies us for many years now there were even moments in which few cases in which a minister didn't get off the airplane in London and other General cancelled his visit somewhere in Europe because there were some kind of because it might happens in a surprise way you you are not necessarily expecting it when you land in a European country and all of a sudden you find yourself in jail I don't see it happening so so quickly but even this atmosphere of feeling guilty and wanted is very productive I want to say Nick one more sentence it's very clear to me at least that in the war of Gaza many crimes were committed it's it's very clear to me at least that nobody in is is going to investigate those crimes and for sure know to bring to Justice those who are responsible and accountable on those crimes this live the situation in an impossible way in which nobody will be taken accountable unless some kind of international institutions will get into the picture and therefore I said before quite in a in a embarrassed way that I am also hopeful because I think that those who are accountable for those crimes should be brought to Justice okay Steven zunes let's get the perspective from the United States when some would say across the world that the ICC indictments would give if they come would give another blow to Israel's already battered moral standing but that of course uh depends on perception and it's a completely different View point for example within the US Administration isn't it very much so and the United States has been pretty hostile towards the international criminal court from the very beginning uh not only is the United States one of the few Western countries that are not members of the court but uh US law forbids the United States from cooperating with the court in any way in fact it goes as far as saying that that they president is authorized to use whatever means necessary which implies military force if uh any uh if the United States or anybody any any American or any um member of an Allied country is held by or on behalf of the ICC thus it was nicknamed the hay Invasion act got a very negative response from the Dutch as you might imagine but uh what what what we're going to see from the United States if indeed there is an indictment against Netanyahu is that it'll immediately be attacked as biased as as hypocritical as a double standard which is ironic because you there have been a number of foreign heads of state that have been indicted and they've been almost all black Africans and the other Only Exception actually is Vladimir Putin uh if if Netanyahu was indicted he would be the first pro-western leader to ever get an indictment and yet you can you better believe that the United States will insist that the court is somehow biased just as they've said when the international court of justice or other uh International bodies have uh called out Israel for violations of international law Jeffrey Gideon mentioned uh the fact that he didn't think it would happen anytime soon how long could this process take I mean how soon could it happen is what I mean it's hard to know I imagine that the icc's prosecutor has been investigating this with some energy from as soon as it became possible that Israel's response to the terrible attack of the October the 7th was excessive and uh so that gives him about four or five months I suppose to have been doing the work that he clearly has been doing and there's no reason to believe that his arrest warrant if one is issued it's only rumor at the moment will be other than on satisfactory grounds the fighting's got to stop at some stage and at that stage providing there is no pressure applied to the IC to withdraw the arrest warrant then either a change of government in Israel May surrender people such as Netanyahu for trial the international criminal court which is what happened in the case of sladan mosovich who was a non-african head of state who was pred or maybe in later time he'll find himself in a foreign country where he thinks he's safe and he isn't he's handed over same applies to to all and any other senior members of his political cabinet or military chain of command who may or who may be the subject of arrest warrant so it could happen comparatively quickly or it could be in limbo for a very long time indeed remember just to clarify that Jeffrey sorry to jump in there but just to clarify that so so it could happen relatively quickly but within the confines of the war itself while the war is still going on I would thought that was impossible wasn't it because Mr Netanyahu as long as he's prime minister is not going to make himself available to be arrested by anyone anywhere uh Gideon Levy the perception within Israel uh will differ wildly given the the polarized view of of uh the prime minister there just give us some idea of of how it would be because after all this would put Benjamin Netanyahu in the same category as foreign leaders like Omar Al Basher the deposed president of Sudan and indeed the Russian President Vladimir Putin first of I would like to claim here that focusing only on nanyu who is all my lack of respect to netan putting all the focus on netan is really unfair because what we see now is an outcome of years of a very clear policy of apartheid and occupation netan didn't start it net didn't invent it including the incursions into Gaza and to put everything on netan is very comfortable and then to claim that after we will get rid to from netan Israel will turn into the paradise that we always dream that it will be is really a little bit oversimplified it's not about netan including ignore this war because this war is accepted by the majority of Israeli public opinion this war was approved by the entire government and most of the members of the parliament are supporting this war and supporting continuing this war it's not like one dictator here took his whole state into a war and now he is responsible there are many more others who should take share in respons responsibility and accountabil among them obviously ministers and also the heads of the army you can't think that they are not involved in in those crime now Israel will as usual put its it its protection wall and claim that the IC is anti-Semitic like the entire world is anti-Semitic Israel will claim that those are double standards Israel will claim that the whole world hates us and no no one almost no one in Israel will ask just a moment how did we get to it is it really only the world's fault is there no fault done by Israel are we really so innocent did we really conduct this war in Gaza according to the international law those questions will not be asked here let's take it on to the uh or at least back to Vladimir Putin and Russia uh if we could uh Steven zunes because you do wonder what difference this would make given what happened to him the icc's pre-trial chamber issued a warrant for the arrest of Vladimir Putin on March the 17th 2023 yet it's made absolutely no difference he's carried on his war in Ukraine with impunity so what difference is it likely to make in this case Israel is much more dependent on outside trade and military aid and the like than Russia is Russia obviously is is a huge country both in size and population and Israel despite its military might and technological sophistication is still quite small and indeed quite quite dependent and uh it would make it very difficult for uh Netanyahu and other Israelis who are indicted from traveling abroad the United States might be just about the only country where they could travel to to safely safe safely and um and also I think it could increase the um possibility that there can be some sanctions or some limitations other pressure from Western countries again the United States unfortunately would probably resist this kind of thing but it would Empower I think human rights activists and and their supporters including trade unions and popular movements for the International Community to put greater pressure on Israel and so while I don't think Netanyahu is any more likely to actually see Justice actually go to go to prison than than Putin I think the political impact could indeed be quite more significant but is Israel the Israeli government has shown itself to be a master of ignoring International sanctions even yeah very much so uh but the trouble is the sanctions have not been that strong uh the United States obviously has blocked the United Nations from taking any action and while some European countries have been reluctant to to provide certain kinds of military Technologies um the trade is is is continued and and uh you know that Israel is seen very much as as as a part of Europe in certain ways and uh with with an indictment like this I think it would be uh you know far more controversial at least and I think certainly there's some uh some sanctions could be could be there that the Israelis could actually feel for the first time now again whether this will actually alter policy as long as it have this Lifeline from the United States that is another question but uh certainly they they will feel it there will be some impact and Gideon Benjamin Netanyahu said came out and said that this would not affect Israel's actions moving forward but do you think it might have implications on the way that Israel behaves immediately in the war on God no not for the short run because nany's Main purpose is now to achieve this unachievable goal of Smashing Hamas and his other goal is to remain in power no matter what the IC is deciding and for this he has to continue and I'm afraid he will continue he knows also that even if he stops now the war the IC is in it I mean the crimes were committed and some someone will have to be taken accountable for those crimes I mean we we faced enough catastrophes in Gaza in the last seven months stopping them now is too little and too late but I don't think that this will stop Israel and Nan to get into Rafa unfortunately so you think that will still proceed now I'm afraid so unless the Americans will be very clear about it which they don't seem to be Jeffrey there is a suggestion that that this uh ICC investigation will be attached or has been attached to the current ICC investigations underway in into potential crimes which date back to 2014 to 13th of June 2014 tell us about that if you would and just how that would work just attaching the two together attaching them is possible I suppose if a continuing intention on the part of Israel that could be said to be criminal is established but there's a very another really important part about operation protective edge of 2014 and what happened subsequent to it in 2014 ishma Han certainly accepted that it would be a good thing if the IC went in and the following year the ICC got jurisdiction that's 2015 so we have to look at the eight years over which it might be argued that the IC had dragged its feet concerning the unhappy and tragic events of 2014 much smaller than they may have been in the present crisis consequences and you have to ask well supposing in fact the ICC had shown itself to be busy in those eight years nine years and shown itself to be willing to take on the Israeli leadership and not to be intimidated by the United States which may well over those years have been deterring it from taking action you might ask if the present thing could have happened at all the present conflict would have happened at all because leaders on both sides Hamas and Israel would have known that there was a legal system in in waiting and ready to deal with them even if it hadn't actually finally got round to issuing arrest warrants about protect about uh events since October so protective Edge and everything that happened since then in the legal setting May indeed be something that provides a continuity of intention on the part of Israel remember that protective Edge was described by some as part of an Israel state of Israel a policy of mowing the grass which was a way of perhaps keeping Gaza under control if there's a continuing intention shown between the two then it's entirely possible that the prosecutor will be looking at the crimes as connected much great though the present ones me than those H that happened in 2014 extremely serious indeed though they were 500 children cult I think all right thanks for that Jeffrey Stephen so we have these ICC investigations going on then of course there is South Africa's genocide case at the international court of justice how do these two separate investigations square up and then I guess they can run concurrently right very much so I mean one looks at um the specifics of the ongoing War whether that does constitute a violation of the international genocide treaty the and whether Israel indeed is is guilty of such violations there's a a simultaneous case actually about around the legality of the um 50 7ye Israeli occupation of the West Bank and and other territories seized in the June 1967 war the international court of justice which has been around for for many many decades uh is is is about countries about individual countries and their violations to international law they are brought forth you know by the other other member nations of the world Court the international criminal court which is founded only recently in 1999 uh looks at crimes of individuals so it's more on the on the level the the international court of justice looks at Israel on a state level and their violations whereas the ICC looks at on the individual level of individual leaders who are responsible for specific war crimes Gideon how do you think this latest approbation is likely to affect the world view you know we touched on the United States earlier where student protest as elsewhere in the world indeed are widespread there growing condemnation all over the globe of the way Israel is acting does that this just adds to that does it it makes the whole concept what Israel's doing uh in Gaza to many toxic no doubt that the last seven months were crucial in the way that they Chang the attitude of the world toward Israel and this time also the Western World and this time also the United States and this time even some of the Jewish communities in the world Israel is in big troubles we have to face it we have to admit it Israel deserves it in my view but that's another question but the it all it's all connected it's not a coincident this war in Gaza which was much worse than all the wars that Israel had launched before with so many more civilians being killed children women starvation destruction you name it and and you know all of you know exactly what I mean this war is a game changer and after this war Israel cannot be perceived anymore as it was before the thing is that the Israelis are not exposed to the images of Gaza because no one is showing it to them but the world sees Gaza and anyone who sees Gaza cannot remain indifferent cannot say oh but it's Syria they killed more anyone who sees Gaza has very very hard question to ask and big big suspicions about the one those who are accountable for this and therefore it's not a coincidence each of those powers are trying now to bring people who are responsible for the reality in Gaza to be taken accountable and that's exactly the role of the International Community gentlemen our time is done we appreciate your contributions thank you very much thanks to all our
