Israeli forces raiding al-shifa Hospital have severely beaten Al jazer journalist isma Al Gul he was covering the military's attack with colleagues when he was dragged away satellite trucks belonging to the Press Crews there were also destroyed by Israeli forces this news coming into us just in the last few minutes we can go straight to our correspondent Han Mahmud who is on the ground for us in Rafa and Southern Gaza what can you tell us hany about these latest developments uh regarding our Al jazer journalist at alifa hospital Hy honey if you can hear me honey if you can hear me uh we are yes yes I do yeah so please we so we're getting these reports we're getting these reports about Israeli forces raiding alifa hospital and severely beating up one of Algeria alzer's own journalist is alul what are you hearing yes melan that's that happened within the past couple hours where emerging reports of from a shifa hospital and uh Israeli military has already detained over 80 people including women and young men from shifa hospital and medical staff as well and injuries who are supposed to be inside the hospital getting treated uh including also a our colleagu alul from Al jazer and his crew member on the ground has been covering the ongoing genocidal War and the ongoing Israeli military attacks and atrocities on the ground what we were told by an eyewitness inside the hospital that is and his crew member uh were actually beaten and when verbally abused and dehumanized basically before they were uh and tortured before they were led into the unknown area it's important also to point out that the Israeli military bulldozer did in fact destroyed uh the equipment of is and his equ on the ground including the sng that help transmitting uh signals uh from the ground to the studio that's what's going on right now in in a shifa hospital including the other 80 plus people who were detained from the hospital it also a a part of the ongoing military attacks on a shifa hospital as people were are being told to leave and Evacuate the facility with the exception of the ICU team but as people tried to leave the facility that were shut out by the quad captors and surveillance drone and the machine guns at the vicinity uh of the hospital which led to the death of many people on the ground we don't know we don't have a confirmation number of how many people were killed but as an eyewitness described there are scattered at the courtyard uh of the of the hospital and that's part of the evacuation order that has been largely misleading confusing for people they were told to leave but the same time they were uh shot at in an earlier statement the spokesperson of the isra military described the the operation as limited and a precise and no evacuation required and now we're seeing these leaflets ordering people sharply to evacuate the facility and hany I believe this is the fourth time that Israeli forces have stormed alifa just remind us uh why exactly Al jazer journalist isal ALG was there what were the circumstances around the uh raid earlier this morning well just let's be clear about what's going on in Gaza and the Norther part not only there's a spread of famine and catastrophic situation but the vast majority of people there do not have their homes is standing where they can uh stay in so the vast majority of people refer to a shifa hospital and as it turn into a large uh evacuation center for the thousand and hundreds of displaced families and evacuees inside the the hospital so likely what is was doing is covering uh the uh what's going on on inside the hospital in terms of the catastrophic medical situations the inability of the hospital to operate as well as the uh the ongoing tsunami of injuries being transferred and reported to a sha Hospital from the ongoing attacks across Gaza City and the northern part uh we've seen within the past few days uh where atrocities committed either on the Rashid Road or on salahadin road on particularly on Aid Seekers where hundreds of injuries arrived to the hospital but the fact that the hospital is non operational is catastrophic and part of it is covering what's going on and the other part is Sheltering inside the hospital as there are no places to stay in across Gaza and the northern part hany can you tell us a little more about uh this journalist is alul he was an Al jazer Arabic uh journalist I believe and had been covering the war in Gaza for the last few months what more can you tell us about him well one one quite visible thing about is that he continue covering the atrocities and the the genocidal war and practices on the ground within the past months and and since the expansion of the the ground Invasion and often time bearing the uh the catastrophe of the spread of famine including a couple of reports that he did on on the situations where he described the difficult living conditions of people including himself and the crew member on the ground as going with on going on with days without any food or or a meal just to keep them uh sustainable and and continuing uh the work part of it the the documentation of the the the massacres whether it's the flower Massacre on the cter road or the destruction of entire Residential Building in the northern part of the strip uh and Gaza City and the the the attacks on us zun neighborhood within the the the past couple weeks he continued the work despite the the challenges and the the hardship created by the ongoing intense bombing campaign including the engineered famine that has pretty much affected everyone negatively so far we're looking at at least 27 people who died of this enforced dehydration and starvation uh uh in in Gaza and the northern part hany for our viewers that are just joining us I just want to remind them about this breaking news that we are reporting on Israeli forces who raided alifa Hospital in Gaza have severely beat Al jazer journalist isma Al Gul that is been confirmed to us uh in the last few minutes uh so going back to what you know uh so he was with a colleague I believe and he had a satellite truck with him him uh do we know what's happened to the truck to to his colleague or was it was it just ismile who was [Music] targeted no not only is our colleague is and his and the crew member in the but also the the equipment the the the truck that they have they're using to move around and to carry out the the the the equipment the transmission equipment from one place to another have been according to an eyewitness inside the hospital have been destroyed completely as the military bulldozer just ran it over uh and completely destroy all the equipment that they were using inside the the courtyard uh of the hospital which makes it very difficult right now for the the sustainability of the of the coverage had is been not detained but so far what we're getting that was a detained and his a crew member they were verbally abused they were dehumanized they were beaten severely before they were taken to undisclosed areas along with the 80 other people who were uh detained from the courtyard of the hospital right I understand uh as you were saying more than 80 people have been detained uh as a result of that raid uh at alifa hospital including medical staff as well as many of the people that were Sheltering there uh and uh as we we are reporting Al jazer Al jazer Arabic colleague isma Al Gul and his crew who were also Sheltering inside that hospital were detained he was also beaten uh before being taken to an undisclosed location uh hany do we know any more about why this raid took place have the Israelis said anything well as the the operation started uh there was a statement made by the Israeli military and with the with the list of allegations and it primary among the the the the the list is the the fact that based on intelligence information on the ground gathered by the internal security and the military intelligence the the presence talking about the presence of of Hamas members and and operative inside the hospital and the statement went on that this operation was going to be precise and limited and uh the the Army was advised the uh the Army was advised to not to harm civilians and no evacuations was required but so far since the beginning of the operation what we're seeing as the Israeli military moved into the hospital it surrounded the entire facility and storm it uh with its armored vehicles and tanks and bulldozer one building was sat on fire due to the uh intense bombing of of the tank shells as well as the use of a quad capter these are the kind of attack drones that they can maneuver everywhere including inside the the the facility itself uh the there's a great deal of of of of Terror going on inside the hospital as the vast majority of people we're talking about thousand of evacuees hundreds of entire families counted been Sheltering inside the hospitals including also the medical staff as well as the injuries who are inside the hospital and barely barely are making it through the day given the fact that there's no medical supplies or or sufficient medical staff to treat them or save their their lives so the the situation are getting pretty much very difficult right now uh uh but so far the is really military did not issue any statement to support the allegations that were made at earlier statement all what we know that this operation was meant for whatever it has cataloged so far but no substantial evidence whatsoever to support these allegations and hany uh one of the reasons that Al jazer has continued to cover tirelessly through this entire war is because of uh the the reporting of journalists like isma Al Gul uh who are Palestinian of course uh We've we've also had TK Abu AUM another one of our correspondents who's been targeted by the Israelis tell us a bit more give us some wider context here about how journalists continue to be targeted in Gaza well Molina as we've seen since the beginning of this genocidal war and it's pretty clear to everyone that there are no terms and no limits to what the Israeli military can do across the Gaza Strip from the bombing campaign into the mass killing and the Mass Slaughter of civilians the bombing of entire families inside their residential buildings and and right now what we' seen is a systematic attacks on on journalist and people who are reporting uh from the ground and and Reporting the ongoing atrocities the massacres the sheer level of Destruction caused by uh by the uh the Israeli military uh it's it's beyond imagination we have entire residential blocks and that are beyond recognition right now given the fact that it has been bombed in with in relentlessly and been destroyed severely uh and the vast majority of buildings right now and infrastructure public facilities either destroyed completely or severely damaged all of this Al jazer has been able to capture all the vast majority of these atrocities and destruction on the ground and and the fact that there are people still continuing to do this is something that is causing a great deal of of of frust ation to the Israeli military because it always refutes all the allegations and the made up claims of the existence of of people who are either wanted or these places have been housing tunnels or bunkers and we seen this example being refuted publicly as the in early December when the Israeli military storm shifa hospital and eventually it was only couple of videos that were released by the military but shows no substantial evidence to support any of the allegations that was that were made and Justified the storming of a shifa hospital same thing happened at Naser hospital and other health public facilities and private clinics as well as well as educational facilities all of this has been captured on the camera and been broadly refuted by the people who did the documentations and the reporting on these ongoing atrocity and that's something that the Israeli military want somehow to to put a muzzle on and and to stop it from continuing and honey uh just to recap uh while this uh has happened at alifa hospital I mean it's an ongoing situation there are still strikes going on elsewhere in Gaza yes air strike continue to pound across the Gaza Strip but nearly right now concentrated in Gaza City where we're looking at a very nearby neighborhood a remal neighborhood once a thriving bustling Market a neighborhood in the heart of Gaza has they've been destroyed and turned into a pile of ruins remaining residential buildings and uh and department stores have been destroyed with intense air bombardment within the past hours including major roads leading and connecting Gaza City with the northern part that includes Al jalat Road and Nas Road as well as Omar MTAR Street connecting eastern part of Gaza City with the West in part there are reports of entire residential buildings been targeted within the past couple hours with displaced families inside and giving how dangerous the situation right now with the presence of attack drones there is a clear inability of the civil defense crew members on the ground the uh the paramedics to get to these areas and help remove those who might have survived the attacks but so far it has been ours since the the house were leveled to the ground these houses leveled to the ground and it's likely that most people in their D Rebels won't make it okay hanim Mahmud uh we will leave it there I just want to recap this breaking news to you uh if you're just joining us Israeli forces that have raided alifa Hospital we've been reporting on this all morning have severely beat Al jazer journalist Ismail Al Gul he was working for Al jazer Arabic he and his colleagues were covering the attack of alifa when he was dragged away and the satellite truck which which belonged to the Press crew that he was with was also destroyed by Israeli forces so we don't know where he is now but as soon as we have any more information on this we will of course bring it to you and just to just to reference the pictures you're seeing on the screen that is indeed uh ISM alul uh we had him on our uh screens yesterday when he was reporting on the humanitarian Aid that had made its way into Northern Gaza yeah
