the United Nations says the humanitarian situation in gazra is beyond catastrophic the representative for the UN population fund has just wrapped up a week-long visit to Gaza and says the impact of the conflict on pregnant women and babies in particular is Stark what we see in Gaza is that it's it's a nightmare which is much more than a humanitarian crisis it is a crisis of humanity and the situation is beyond catastrophic the doctors are reporting that they no longer see normalized baby no they've not seen a normal sized baby they don't see them what they do see though tragically more stillborn births more stillborn babies and more neonatal deaths whilst driving up through Gaza into Gaza City I think what what I what I took away from that was the looks in the eyes of the people which the emotion is truly Indescribable everyone we passed everyone we spoke to was gone brail emaciated hungry that everybody was doing this for food and that is why every day especially in the north every day is a battle for survival the doctors are reporting that they no longer see normalized baby Noble they've not seen a normalized baby they don't see them what they do see though tragically a more stillborn births more stillborn babies and more neonatal deaths well let's take this on further we can speak to Dr Brenda Kelly who's a consultant obstetrician at Oxford University Hospitals also part of Gaza medical team of Oxford do doctors who teach in hospitals and medical schools in Gaza joins us now from Oxford H Dr Kelly thanks for joining us it is an unspeakable situation in Gaza as we've just been hearing young lives just well just fading away before they've barely lived what are you hearing about how desperate the situation is well it's everything that you've just heard from the previous speaker I mean pregnant and new mothers are absolutely struggling to keep themselves and their newborns alive amidst huge critical shortages of food water and and medical care and actually just able trying to Able or just get to hospitals for the the two that are in existence at the moment in Middle Zone Gaza and also in Rafa um the level of malnutrition is truly horrific um ought to re reckon about 90 % of pregnant women do not have anything close to adequate nutrition um and you know this is absolutely a critical time in in a in a person's life you know being to to actually grow a baby takes huge resource from the mother um and we know that many of the women even prior to this conflict coming into pregnancy had things like anemia but you know with the extreme malnutrition it is absolutely true there are many more babies being born that are very much smaller than would be expected um colleagues on the grind are reporting the you know huge increase in pre-term birth as well as growth restriction and also very sadly a rising number of miscarriages and still births right let me just ask you of all what first of all does the lack of adequate nutrition do to The Unborn Child So The Unborn Child requires you know hu everything from its mother in order to grow and develop so if you take for example um severe malnutrition which is what is happening in Gaza at the moment we anticipate that a baby is born much smaller than expected you know it it can its organs will be there but it the organs will not function as they should do that will increase the risk of stunted growth in childhood that child will have poorer immunity and therefore you know the illnesses that we're hearing about in Gaz at the moment due to lack of Clean Water um many children will succumb in those early months weeks of life but we also know that lack of adequate nutrition was to a baby in neutral and we know this from the great fam in Ethiopia for example in the mid 80s um and we've seen it time and again throughout other um areas of um of the world that been affected by conflict where nutrition has become an issue for pregnant women that those young babies grow into children where there is um uh impairment of their cognitive development because of the lack nutrition whilst they were growing in utro but also in later adulthood there's much higher rate of things like cardiovascular disease so the impact at the moment on these critical shortages of food water and Aid coming into Gaza to help you know the population but particularly the pregnant women has an impact not just for now but for the next generation of Palestinian children that will grow into adults right and so not only are these these uh children born weak they have to face the repercussions throughout life should they survive H and also I guess once babies are born then the mothers are unable to breastfeed in many cases right it's a huge problem and this is what we're hearing time and again from friends and colleagues in the grind um particularly those who are working at the moment in Rafa is that you know the the the lack of adequate nutrition I mean it's the human race has evolved such that woman um their physiology is geared towards survival of them so they can continue to look after the children they have but also to go on to have further children so if a woman herself becomes malnourished she will not spend necessary en energy in creating breast milk and so we have this situation where woman want to breastfeed is is the safest way to feed a child in Gaza a newborn child in Gaza but if they do not have the breast milk they then become reliant on formula but we also know that that there's a huge issue with getting formula milk into Gaza and distributing that milk um where it's provided in powdered form there simply isn't sufficient access to clean water so then we get into this very vicious circle of not only do we have malnourished newborns and this you know is becoming you know it's with every news report but we then have children who will die from diarrheal illnesses that you know simply should not be happening every which way you look it's just a desperate situation isn't it Dr Kelly totally desperate it is thank you so much for telling us about this important issue that's happening in Gaza Dr Brenda Kelly from the ox University Hospitals
