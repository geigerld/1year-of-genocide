the death toll had been over 8,000 when we were last able to get an accurate death toll it's been several weeks now so the figure is likely to be closer to 10,000 at this point and at the same time period so about three months into the Ukraine war the UN had stated at the time that the lives of children have been devastated at a scale that is uh has not been seen since World War II at the time on average two children were being killed per day uh the average number of children being killed per day in Gaza right now is well over a hundred and and like I said over 8,000 likely close to 10,000 children have been killed so far that excludes the thousands who've been disabled over 10,000 according to the UN likely uh with uh extremity uh amputations so upper and lower limb amputations so children mimed debilitated for Life over 20,000 children orphaned and then you know 85% of the gazen population is currently displaced many families having been displaced uh multiple times so 100% of children have no access to Reliable Heating in the winter there's uh no access to food like there's no there's food insecurity limited access to clean water and obviously high risk of disease 100% of children in Gaza have no access to school and we know that at least of the education facilities according to the office of coordination of humanitarian Affairs have been destroyed so far so all children not being educated at the moment Israel's military says its forces have finished dismantling hamas's military framework in Northern Gaza a spokesman announced that thousands of Hamas Fighters have been killed in the north of the strip since October 7th Israeli military says weapons and documents belonging to the group have been seized they say some Hamas members still remain in the area ham joins us now from occupied East Jerusalem what else has the Israeli military been saying about this ham it's interesting the Israeli military is saying they've completely dismantled hamas's military capabilities in Northern Gaza when we do know that over the last several weeks they've said repeatedly that they have quote full operational control control there but just earlier today Hamas releasing video of several different clashes in different neighborhoods in Northern Gaza specifically the T neighborhood so contradicting what the Israeli military is saying but Israeli military spokesperson Daniel hagat said that there are five components to the dismantling that has been done in Northern Gaza the first is the elimination of all the commanders of the battalions that were there the second is clearing the area of all the fighters third Gathering intelligence from the field and the fourth and fifth are destroying any Rockets or rocket launching sites and completely dismantling and destroying any tunnels or other underground infrastructure now the Israeli military also says that there is likely to still be some sporadic rocket Fire coming from northern Gaza even after they claim they have dismantled those military capabilities entirely but the army spokesperson Daniel hagari has said that the war is going to take time and is going to go well into the year 2024 but that the Israelis are now concentrating the effort of quote deepening their achievements into the central and southern parts of Gaza where they believe a lot of Hamas leaders and Fighters still remain so interesting that the Israelis are saying that they have full operational control and they have completely dismantled those capabilities when they have been some facts and statistics to prove that otherwise live for us in occupy East Jerusalem hamda thank you
