political leader of Hamas is hania has been killed in Iran that's according to statements from Hamas and Iran's revolutionary guard Iran State TV is also reporting he's been assassinated in the capital according to the Revolutionary guard hania and one of his bodyguards were killed in a strike on the building in tan where they were staying he was in the capital meeting President masud pesan the head of his inauguration so these are the latest pictures of that meeting in tran on Tuesday he then attended pesan swear in ceremony Iran says it's investigating the killing of Ismael Hanah well Al jazer juled AER takes a look back at isma hania's life and the events which shaped him into one of the most prominent Palestinian political figures this is what happened to the alati refugee camp in Northern Gaza during Israel's war in 2023 it's where ishir was born he was the son of Palestinian parents who were forc displaced from their home in what is now ashalon after the state of Israel was created in 1948 hania experienced firsthand the challenges faced by millions of Palestinians in their search for sted but his future and influence would turn out to be different than most Americans take responsibility for giving unlimited cover to this enemy to commit to these massacres war crimes and genocide in 1987 Han graduated from the Islamic University of Gaza this same year a Palestinian Mass Uprising began against Israel's occupation also known as the first in in its efforts to liberate Palestine the group Hamas was founded and among its younger members isma hania his Journey would soon become linked to the rise of the Palestinian group Israel imprisoned hanas several times for taking part in protests against the occupation after serving his longest three-year sentence he was deported to Southern Lebanon along with hundreds of Hamas members hania returned to Gaza in 1993 after the signing of the Oslo Accords and became a close Confidant of shik Ahmed Yasin the founder of Hamas together they survived an Israeli assassination attempt though Yasin was killed months later his rise to prominence came in 2006 when Hamas participated in the Palestinian legislative elections the group won a parliamentary majority making hania prime minister of the Palestinian Authority but his appointment angered the International Community who halted a to the PA placing the Govern Gover body under severe Financial strain Hamas is classified by many Western Nations as a terrorist organization months of conflict between factions led to president Mahmud Abbas dismissing hania and dissolving his government this would result in an independent Hamas Le government in the Gaza Strip headed by Han this seizure should not break our will and should not turn this conflict into an internal Palestinian conflict and that conflict should be against the parties that imposed The Siege against the Palestinian people in 2019 having voluntarily stepped down hania left Gaza and began living abroad for which he faced substantial scrutiny hania faced criticism for his absence from the strip during Israel's war on Gaza in 2023 he led hamas's diplomacy from a number of locations as civilians were massacred in the strip is hania's influence on the history and politics of Palestine will likely stay for years to come and for many he will remain a symbol of resistance in the face of occupation and adversity Hamas has released a statement on its official website it says brother leader and Mar Ismail hania the head of the movement has been killed in a treacherous Zionist raid on his residence in Teran after participating in the inauguration ceremony of the new Iranian president and Iran's revolutionary guard has also released a statement saying early this morning the residents of is Han and tan was struck resulting in his and one of his bodyguards martyrdom the cause is under investigation and will be announced soon so those two statements there coming from uh Hamas and the Iranians let's get more now with our correspondent Imran Khan he joins us live uh on the set here Imran you've been covering the war on Gaza since it started um you've been over in occup East Jerusalem for quite some time you're back with us here now um nothing yet from the Israelis but um the finger's being pointed at them absolutely but there will be nothing from the Israelis officially now there's precedent for this remember in uh April when the iog Commander in Damascus was hit by Israel there was a response from Iran an unprecedented response drones and missiles from Iranian territory fell in Israeli territory we'd never seen that before the difference is is uh that this was very well telegraphed by the Iranians they calculated this response and they took place knowing that it wouldn't escalate and that would draw a line under that particular uh episode however um the Israelis have said to the Americans that we have told you that we are going to do this so the Americans apparently according to Israeli local media were aware that this was going to be happened so we've got to talk about the calculation here hitting a Hamas leader in tahan it doesn't matter how they hit uh that particular building the location matters far more than anything else and now it's about seeing what Israel says next now we like I said won't get a official confirmation of this but we are getting the cultural Minister for example saying this is a good thing and there'll be dribs and drivs throughout the day low-level cabinet ministers politicians saying this is an amazing thing this is what we wanted for this plays into netanyahu's hands he is now able to say we are going after Hamas politically and militarily which is the goals of the war for him but he was doing that in Gaza he wasn't doing it in international territory this is going to be a very concern uh a real concern to Istanbul which has hosted Hamas leaders in the past Kat y Doha which has hosted Hamas leaders in past including is hania who was here I think uh he only left in uh July 2023 I think so this is a very this is a real concern for everyone but we've got to understand we've got to try and figure out why Israel thought that this right now was a good idea was a good idea so so so so that brings me nicely um uh Imran to what's the broader message from Israel here I mean we saw that attack yesterday uh in Beirut claiming they' killed the senior Hezbollah Commander Hezbollah haven't said anything yet they've neither confirmed nor denied it now we have the politically of Hamas is hania being killed on Iranian soil that's a huge leap as you're talking about now this kind of broader Regional implication what is the broader message from the Israelis here well the Israelis are think is going to be very simple and you'll hear it throughout the day we can get these people where they live it doesn't matter if they're in occupied territory or if they're they're wherever they are internationally and that's the message the the the Israelis unofficially will push let's see what the official response is let's see what prime minister Benjamin nahu says uh later on in the day uh when he makes a statement he might not talk about an hania completely officially but he will talk about the fact that this was this is a good thing and I think the talking points that the Israeli politicians are getting from um the prime minister's office are going to be pushing the fact that this is a good thing for Israel but without officially saying we've done this now it's about the escalation and where where this goes next and the Iranian response like I said in April there was a strike very well telegraphed from Iranian territory into Israeli territory I was there for that I saw those Rockets come in from uh Iranian territory the Israelis didn't respond directly to that but the Iranians have now got to figure out how to calculate a response and that's the worry is how what sort of response now could we see from the Iranians given this much telegraphed response uh to when their senior Commander was killed in Syria but but but this is likely to be a huge concern now as to how Iran responds it is but there is another precedent for this remember kasum suani in January 2023 was assassinated in Baghdad by the US uh under the Trump Administration uh the Iranians didn't respond to that uh particularly uh directly to the Americans the Israelis well may be saying we might be able to get away with this because of kasum salani but kasum salamani Muhammad resi in Syria and now hania Teran really does actually have to do something vocal and direct now it might be through Hamas it might be through Hezbollah heah I've got a different calculation right now like you say their senior Commander was killed yesterday so there is a lot of calculations going on when this kind of escalation happen miscalculation is the bigger danger than response if one of those groups miscalculates and yeah hits something that they shouldn't or they didn't want to or Israel miscalculates and does something that it really didn't want to do but has done then that's where you know that's where real problems will happen what do you think this means now then imman for hopes of any kind of ceasefire I mean this now seems to be getting further and further away given Israel's expansion of the conflict well I mean let's just go back to the ceasefire just a few months ago US President Joe Biden was very clear there's an Israeli approved ceasefire deal on the table that never came to fruition the Israelis were very surprised by this prime minister Benjamin n said what we gave you this this three-phase plan the Biden Administration announced saying that this was going to end the war in Gaza it was going to end the war in Gaza it wasn't it wasn't just you know a temporary ceasefire that's all gone away every time we get close to a deal whether it's in Cairo whether it's in katar whether it's in the US the prime minister of Israel says no actually we're changing the terms of this this is very frustrating for Hamas who have agreed uh to a ceas fight and then the Israelis say well actually no this is all hamas's fault they aren't doing it yeah and that's and that's interesting because we uh Hamas was saying just yesterday that the Israelis again have changed the terms of the of the proposed ceasefire yeah exactly and this keeps going on and on the only way we are going to avoid any kind of miscalculation any kind of escalation in uh the latest round of this war which is you know in a different phase today than it was yesterday let's be absolutely honest about that we're in different phase now is a comprehensive ceasefire in Gaza that's the only way that Hezbollah going to step down it's the only way Hamas is going to step down uh and it's the only way that the Americans are going to be able to push for reconstruction in Gaza and anything that they might want to be able to do but right now the Americans are backing Israel and Israel isn't going for a ceas fight as you say things are going to get worse or they get better Imran Khan there
