now the Dutch government says it will appeal a Court ruling to stop exports of War plan spare parts to Israel the announcement came hours after Dutch judges upheld an appeal by human rights organizations they argued that helping to maintain the F35 stealth Jets contributed to Israel's violations of international law the ruling says the Netherlands needs to stop exporting any parts destined for Israel within 7 Days the parts are American owned but stored in Dutch warehouses ready for shipping the F-35 is widely regarded as the world's most advanced war plane Israel was the first International buyer of the US jets in 2016 is also the only country in the Middle East to fly them the Israeli Air Force has dozens of f-35s its latest purchase was in July 25 Jets financed by $3 billion in US military aid the Israeli squadrons are due to be reinforced in three batches beginning in 2027 let's go to step vson who joins us live in the ha and step how much of a difference do we assume this ruling there will make well this is definitely seen as a landmark ruling by the appeal court in the ha because it's the first time that the court is ordering a state to stop sending weapons to Israel uh during the 30 minute verdict the judge dismissed all the arguments by the Dutch State saying that they needed to continue to to send the spare parts talking about political motives the the very strong ties the Netherlands has with the us but also with Israel that could be japanized but also economic ties because of course it's an interesting export product but it was all dismissed because the judge said that there is a serious risk that these weapons are used and that there are very uh strong uh uh risks that the international humanitarian laws is seriously being violated by Israel in Gaza and I'm right here at the Oxfam office one of the uh rights organizations who have filed the case and I'm talking to the director mikil SAS about this verdict how significant do you see this Verdict by the court in the he looking at the war in Gaza right now yeah well I think it's very significant and I'm I'm happy that the court was so clear also in its uh in its ruling uh today uh I'm hopeful that it will change the behaviors of my own government the Dutch government and it must because they need to obey by this ruling I also hope that it's a turning point that governments in Europe or elsewhere who have supported Israel so far uh will look themselves in the mirror and realize that they are in fact um co-responsible or even complicit of the violations taking place uh in Gaza as we speak basically some say it could also be used as a precedent for other groups like yours like Oxfam in other countries because we know other countries like Germany are still supplying weapons to Israel as well and what what do you know about this yes well we have been in contact with many other groups including other Oxfam also in countries but also other uh non-governmental organizations who have been following our court case from the beginning we started somewhere in November uh and I received numerous messages today of people first congratulating us of course with this uh important win in court but also immediately asking for all the information so they can use it in their own countries to pressure their own governments to change those policies there the main objective of course is was to relieve the suffering of the people in Gaza how do you see this verdict now affecting the civilians in Gaza right now well that's difficult uh to see and to say at this moment I would say especially today with all the uh the horrible news we again hear from Rafa and from other places uh in Gaza uh I have colleagues there oxam colleagues who work in Gaza who are currently based as refugees in Rafa at least for today this news that I could bring for them was a little bit of Hope a little bit of light a little bit of yeah realizing that people in other places are thinking about them I don't think it will change the situation on the ground immediately but I hope that this uh verdict here in the Netherlands is a turning point in the behaviors of our governments here and that makes it possible to put much much more pressure on Israel to stop the uh the attacks there in Gaza thank you very much for joining us here in the in the program what we know is that these f-35s have a very high maintenance it is sad that one hour of flying needs three hours of Maintenance and that there is a shortage of these spare parts what is now expecting uh to happen is that Israel will need to find some other suppliers and it's more likely that this is coming from the US but the US of course is much further away and it will definitely be leading to a scramble to make sure that these F-35 can still uh fly uh to Gaza from Israel step vson in the heg many thanks
