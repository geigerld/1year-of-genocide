breaking news now because Hamas has named its Gaza leader Yaya sinoa as chief of the group following isma hania's assassination in tan on July the 31st isma hania of course being the leader of the political wing of Hamas uh Yaya Sina has been the group's leader in Gaza since 2017 let's speak to nor OD who's in ralo in the occupied West Bank um Noah is Han obviously his death was a huge blow for Hamas had been involved in political uh negotiations to bring about an end uh to the ceasefire is now that his replacement has been named Yaya sinma what does this mean for Hamas what does this mean for hopes of Peace tell us more well yir let's talk first about the man this is a 62y old man someone who was imprisoned for a um he was sentenced to four consecutive life sentences he was released from Israeli prison in 2011 and he has skyrocketed to a an influential position in Hamas leading it in Gaza the choice of Hamas to name him the leader of the movement now puts Gaza front and center of not just the events on the ground but certainly of the Dynamics in the Hamas movement and it really sends a signal as far as negotiations and ceasefires concerned concerned Gaza calls the shots if you were expecting the assassination to bring in someone who might be more amenable to a solution more amenable to a ceasefire that is not very favorable then Hamas now has made its choice and it has really brought Gaza back to the center um and and given it as much power as one can imagine and it's really uh a choice that very few expected uh a lot of contenders a lot of names were Flo around yya sinir was not one of them so and no yay sinir since at least the beginning of this recent conflict as a man that has somewhat lived in the shadows in in Gaza to have him now in a prominent role potentially as a public negotiator would be a huge step for Yaya Sina given that he has been pretty much targeted by Israel as being somebody that they potentially want to eliminate absolutely yya senir is on the top of the Israel hit list for Hamas leaders he is someone that is wanted and pursued by the Israelis but now the shots are in his hands the decisions will be uh uh he will have the final call and so it will be H interesting to see how Hamas will maneuver this any decisions any negotiations happening outside of Gaza will have to filter through all the hoops uh that have to be taken in terms of security in order to get to yya sinir so that he can have the final say so that might complicate and prolong any negotiation process but it's also a message to Israel that Hamas is United that there are no differences that there won't be any Schism between Hamas outside of Gaza and Hamas inside of Gaza there was a lot of debate on whether the assassination of isma hania a pragmatist a political leader would imp power or embolden the hardliners this is a decision that will take a lot to digest but it also really speaks volumes about the multi-layered and very sophisticated decision-making process in Hamas itself uh there is a very you know a a a clear process of decision- making in Hamas there are layers of that and people take uh their roles very seriously they vote on these decisions and the votes are respected and so senir was not named by you know he was not imposed this is a man who now is at the helm of Hamas by the vote of those with him in leadership ranks many that we know but many more that we don't know about what about the response do you think from Palestinians in the the occupied West Bank from fata for instance I mean they prepared to get behind a figure like Yaya sinoa given his proximity to hamas's military Wing in Gaza well fat finds itself in a in a very interesting position since the beginning of this war it has not been able to perform to rise to the occasion if you will that's according to many observers and many within the fat movement have been very critical of the fact that the fat movement itself has taken a back seat it has not been vocal it has talked about the importance of unity it has talked about the importance of ending the war but as a movement as a long-standing movement in the Palestine National Liberation it hasn't had any prominent role during this war and so now it can only welcome the election of a new leader for the Hamas movement how they will deal with that in the coming days and weeks will be very interesting particularly as you said because yya senir is being pursued their relations will be primarily with the Hamas leaders above ground outside of the occupied territory Pro because the leaders here in the West Bank are mostly also been imprisoned by Israel so they will deal with the Hamas leaders outside of uh of Palestine knowing full full well that the final say will be in Gaza and will be from yya senir all right no many thanks for that reminder of the breaking news this hour Hamas has named uh the group Gaza leader Yaya Sina as its new political Chief following the assassination of isma hania on July the 31st let's bring in maen Bashar J senior political analyst he joins us by Skype from Paris Maran please put this into context for us because I mean how controversial is this appointment of Yaya sinoa given that he is of course one of Israel's Most Wanted men well you know as you know on the record Israel has declared that every Hamas leader is a Target and they threatened warned that they will assassinate all of Hamas leaders whether they are inside or outside so I'm not I'm not sure that's controversial on that that side of it because Israel was not going to let anyone off the hook after October 7 uh but if it's not controversial then what I to my mind it's Defiance that's what it is uh if the answer to the question that they what is the day after well Hamas just answered the day after Gaza it's is Gaza the day after Gaza it's Hamas in Gaza and the day after Gaza it's sinir on the Helm of Hamas in Gaza I think that's the answer that basically Hamas is is providing to its own ranks but also to Israel and the Arab world if uh Hamas leaders have had difficulty finding a home for themselves or finding shelter or finding a safe place anywhere in the Middle East well now it's clear that that the the top leader is right there somewhere in the tunnels of Gaza resisting so again then resistance is is the answer now as to your uh um sort of more political question about uh sinir and where he stands you know before October 7 when Israel was blocking all uh all the venues to a diplomatic solution senir is on the record telling his support that Hamas accepts a two-state solution and the return of the refugees so let's wait and see what Israel does at the time but of course Israel does not accept a two-state solution will not let the refugees back in and will continue to tet Hamas as it has been in fact so I think in terms of the consequences I don't think it's going to make much of a difference for Hamas in terms of Israel it will make uh you know a big difference now for it to understand that Defiance and resistance and steadfastness is the way forward for the Islamic group I I understand it not making much of a difference for Hamas philosophically politically and what the group aspires towards but as you say Maran um he is a man who may well be in the tunnels of Gaza as opposed to isma hania who was able to travel here to Qatar to Iran to Russia to China he's very much been a public figure uh in in the open uh how would things work do we imagine when it comes to ongoing negotiations with uh with the intermediaries in all of this well in fact you know it was to a large degree it was that was the intermediary and Israel killed him right and the decision was more or less in the hands of those in the tunnels uh the past several months and I think it remains so in as far as envoys and and diplomacy movements around the world and gardening support I think there are enough of the Hamas um you know legislative and executive body out out there on on the outside uh to be able to do that but I think once again the message is that this is all about resistance to fastness at this point in time rather than more of the you know diplomatic acrobatics if you will if you will that would probably don't don't lead to much at this point in time I think the focus on Gaza and the focus in sunir is a major signal of defiance and of the fact that Hamas was not about to lose Gaza and that Hamas is going to remain a power within Gaza and hence its leader is there interesting of course that this comes after the assassination of is hania who was in Iran the guest of the Iranian uh State there at the crucial uh handing over of power to the country's new leader Iran has promised a response hasn't it to that assassination I wonder whether this as you say show of defiance and appointing Yaya sinoa was directly linked is directly calibrated to the way in which isma hania died yes yes uh to a large degree I think it just tells you that Hamas is choices in this region in the Middle East region are you know are not are not easy and they're not numerous and in the end of the day after seven months of genocide in Gaza the idea that uh you know the leadership needs to be there where the people are suffering I think it's an interesting decision that I think will be taken not lightly uh even by the ranks in Gaza so you know people are suffering Gaza and so is the leadership within Gaza at the help there with the people resisting the Israeli genocide now Iran of course is a bit of a separate question here in terms of its response I think it will respond the response will be maybe a one time or maybe bit more but it's going to be limited in in time and scope Israel is more worried about the response coming from Hezbollah in fact at this point in time that it is at the response from Iran is almost predictable unless of course Iran surprises us all and carries a whole other qualitative kind of response to the Han assassination but I think the entire region now is in a bit of a you know well not exactly nervous breakdown but certainly it's certainly there at the at the brink and everyone is waiting including the many in Israel about what's going to happen next what will be the response and then what will be the response of Israel to the respon resp of the Iranians and the and the and hisbah as well as that of Hamas so the once again the decision to appoint sinir uh could you know be seen as a smack of desperation but it could also be interpreted as one of steadfastness and heroism and being in touch with the people in Gaza if this is indeed as you say a message of defiance then it is one that the United States will have to work out a respons to of course Washington says it's engaged in intense diplomacy pretty much around the clock uh that's the quote from the White House at least to help calm tensions says the White House at the same time the Israeli military says that us sencom Commander General Killa is in Israel for quote joint preparations it seems like diplomacy on the one hand and Military preparations are hand in glove at the moment and I wonder to what extent the addition of Sina into all of that will mean you know that's why the you know the only concept that comes to mind the only metaphor that I have I've have had the past several months is pyromaniac firemen the United States uh in its support to Israel in its unconditional support of Israel arming it financing it and shielding it is definitely leading to further escalation in the region leading to more death and destruction in Palestine and Elsewhere on the other hand um its attempt at diplomacy and its pressure on various partners and allies in the region including Egypt and qar and others to you know to try to reach some kind of a ceasefire uh deal and to build on that towards something larger you know is the is the firemen uh you know aspect of the of the Pyromania firemen so it's a bit of a it's a bit of a you know um what's the word for that it's a bit of a puzzle you know in a way and in a sense leaving it to Netanyahu to decide what the American policy should be and basically netan has gone Rong uh the past several weeks and months not listening to Biden not listening to the Biden Administration not even uh accepting any of its advice rather humiliating it once and again taking up uh the assassination of these two main leaders after he returned from Washington and continuously adding red lines to the negotiations that are happening in Doha and Cairo as well as basically killing the the negotiating partner is Han and and all the rest of it is definitely putting the Americans in a bind and so Biden instead of calling Netanyahu and say you know wrap it up Mr Netanyahu or otherwise he's calling you know the the the the the other allies including the kar Amir the president of Egypt and probably others in the region in order to ramp up support for diplomacy I'm not sure it's going to be easy for those who were put in a bind by the assassination they could do much today if nael continues to add to their okay Maran just stand by for a moment because you you mentioned that call between Biden and uh Regional leaders the White House has just released a statement saying US President Joe Biden has had a call with katar zir shik tamin B mammad Alani it says they addressed their efforts to deescalate Regional tensions including through an immediate ceasefire and hostage release deal President Biden and shik tamim agreed on the urgency of bringing the process to closure as soon as possible both leaders and their teams agreed to remain in close coordination over the coming days Maran what should we read into this call for close coordination uh between the leader of Qatar obviously a key mediator in the hopes of bringing an end to the conflict in Gaza and Washington well I'm I'm hoping you know there are a few interpretation I'm hoping that President Biden is lending support to the to his Arab allies uh because Netanyahu has been undermining them you know Netanyahu has undermined the negotiations in Qatar metan has even incited through his very allies against the leaderships in Q and other places basically the task of of mediating has been thankless uh and I really it's you know the Kari patience is admirable the steadfastness is admirable in you know continuously trying to get this same deal done while being continuously undermined by Netanyahu so hopefully this would be more of an attempt by Biden to support you know his Arab allies in the St and maybe this will be followed by another call to nany to say Mr nany you need to W it up in the process and as the K prime minister said you know this is really undermines any uh attempt at at concluding a Seas fire deal when Israel continues to carry assassination the did continues to kill Palestinians day in day out continues to expand its Killing Spree to the West Bank and expand the war now to to Lebanon and and and elsewhere it's not going to be possible to reach a deal when Netanyahu continuously re humiliates everyone including the Americans the the Egyptians the kataris and and you know everyone else all right Maran many thanks for that Mar and bashara alaz Senior political analyst and reminder of course of the breaking news
