almost 20,000 Palestinians have been killed many of them children mosques churches schools and hospitals have all been bombed as Israel continues its genocidal war on Gaza seemingly unchecked with the United Nations security Council unable to pass a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire Israel has been accused by human rights organizations of committing crimes against humanity in numerous war crimes now many say that as this war Contin news it is the very essence of international law that is also at stake let's take a sidebar and talk to Alan duritz a former professor of law at Harvard University and a leading figure or expert in his field he believes that organizations such as Doctors Without Borders and even some of the United Nations entities like UNICEF have effectively been co-opted by Hamas to push what he describes as hamas's propaganda [Music] Mr D thank you very much for uh joining us on sidebar uh you are professor of law uh and somebody who has been working in the legal field for decades and uh I want to start by uh discussing what is uh taking place now and the numerous breaches to international law that Israel has been accused of uh by many different uh people over 60 days of what has been described as's a idal war on the people of Gaza um but you are somebody who is uh been very vocal in their support of uh Israel how do you uh balance between those two things in terms of uh somebody who's meant to protect the implementation of Law and at the same time defending uh a country that has been accused of breaking numerous International laws well it starts of course with Hamas breaking the most fundamental laws of humanity uh attacking women and babies and children and rapes rape is a war crime and Israel's efforts to try to prevent a recurrence remember Hamas leaders have said that we're going to do October 7th on October 8th and 9th and 10th we're going to repeat it over and over again and Hamas has this strategy they call it the CNN strategy they purposely provoke Israel by killing as many Israeli civilians as possible knowing that Israel will have to take take out their rockets and their tunnels and their commanders and then they hide their commanders and their rockets and their tunnels among civilians deliberately in order to cause deaths among their own civilians and then they parade these dead babies in front of CNN in front of the New York Times and they get the world to react by condemning Israel instead of by condemning Hamas for its double War crime one attacking Israeli civilians and second using Palestinian civilians as human Shields so so you you've you've touched on a number of points there allegations of rape allegations of uh using human Shields and so forth and I do want to unpack that but you didn't answer my question about Israel breaking international law do you believe that Israel has broken international law absolutely not Israel is acted proportionately international law requires that you evaluate the seriousness of a military Target and going after commanders and Rockets and tunnels are a very very important military Target and then you have to evaluate the number of anticipated civilian deaths and it has to be proportional to the value of the Target and then you have to do everything in your power to minimize civilian deaths Israel has no interest in killing any Palestinian civilians quite the opposite whenever they kill a Palestinian civilian by accident they are condemned in the court of public opinion so Israel has every reason to minimize civilian casualties and they try to but because Hamas hides behind human Shields inevitably there are some civilian casualties too many but the responsibility lies with the US let me before you get into that example I just want to ask you something from the 18,000 18,000 Palestinians who have been killed of which 8,000 are children how many have been Hamas Fighters well the Israelis estimate about 7,000 including by the way children children are Fighters uh child is defined by Hamas as anybody under 19 and many of their Fighters are 177 and 18 so they're counted as children but they're they're combatants but I want to get to my example let's assume that I decide to rob a bank and the police come in and start shooting at me and I grab you as a hostage and I hold you in front of me and I keep killing civilians and then the police take aim at me but accidentally kill you who is resp under qari law under Sharia law under American law under the law of every country obvious viously it's not the policeman who fired trying to kill the the the the hostage taker uh it's the hostage taker who's responsible and so I think Hamas is responsible for many of the deaths uh that are tragic and that have resulted from them using uh human shield so so let's let's take that analogy uh in this situation the Hamas are bank robbers they're thieves right uh and they've taken hostages um but based on that analogy Hamas is taking is essentially stealing something on that analogy what Hamas would say is actually Israel is the bank robber because it has stolen land and it has put uh civilians in kabut and put civilians on land that doesn't belong to them in illegal settlements and therefore those who were killed on October 7th their responsibility lies on the Israeli government based on your analogy but the analogy doesn't hold because what Hamas did was not robbing a bank was murdering 1200 who who are put there as human Shields by Israel on the border of Gaza on land that doesn't belong to them according to the international uh uh law on in settlements and places that don't uh that people do not recognize to be Israeli territory everybody recognizes the kibu Sim in the south of Israel to be Israeli territory there that's part of Israel that was part of the 1947 1948 United Nation resolution these are not settlements these are not uh areas captured in 1967 or these are areas that have been part of Israel from the beginning if the Palestinians that just said yes to the UN resolution of 1947 1948 which Israel accepted there would have been a large Palestinian State and there would be Mr you you say everybody recognizes it but Israel itself Israel itself hasn't defined its borders where are Israel's borders for people to recognize them well the the borders on the south in the netive are recognized the borders were recognized between Egypt and Israel in the Camp David Egypt and Israel yes but the borders between between what you say let me finish the borders between Israel and Gaza are recognized by every virtually every country in the world uh and nobody would have called the members of The kibud Sim remember these people who were killed were peac Nicks these were people who opposed Netanyahu these were people who supported a two-state solution and let's remember that the Hamas Charter opposes the two-state solution it that's the old Charter that's sorry the the new Charter that that came out talks about a 20-year truce if 1967 borders were accepted in a true state but but let's finish one point at a time we will come to it I I do want to ask you about something you and it's a very important point you said that everybody recognizes those borders we had Benjamin Netanyahu stand up at the United Nations with a map of a new Middle East that did not have any reference whatsoever not to a state of Palestine not even to Palestinian territories it had historic Palestine completely as Israel could you point me to the article in Israel's Constitution or anywhere within Israel that identifies Israel's borders please oh sure uh there there are many things within Israel's basic laws that identify the borders look whenever the Palestinians come to the UN they have maps that show no Israel many of the countries of the world have maps that don't include Israel I don't think nanyo was right when he did that I strongly support the two-state solution as do most Israelis support a two-state solution it's Hamas that strongly opposes it Palestine will be free from The River To The Sea meaning free of Jews it will be cleaned what does that mean it means that Jews are dirty and that they have to be cleaned out if the Palestinian opponents of Israel were to lay down their arms there would be peace if Israel lay down its arms there would be genocide of the kind we saw on October 7th I think we could have a two-state solution uh if Hamas was destroyed and no longer had any power then the Palestinian Authority in Israel could work together on a peaceful two-state solution I would support that I have met with the Amir of Qatar who's a wonderful man who I like very much I've met with his brother I've met with his mother we have supported the two-state solution I would work very hard on the two-state solution if ramas did not exist a barrier to the two-state solution remember there was relative ceasefire between Israel and Hamas until October 7th and then without provocation with fake provocations you know the stuff about what was going on in the Temple mount that was a fake because these were plans months in advance the Hamas decided to kill as many Israeli civilians as possible in order to invoke the CNN strategy of having Israel kill cians and then be condemned by the world opinion that's again I we will we'll unpack it all we will come to the Future and so forth but again can you please tell me what identifies within the Israeli state or within their constitution where it clearly defines what Israel's borders are and it's basic laws it's basic laws the the entire ass uh there there's a dispute on the West Bank to be sure but there's no dispute about the area where these horrible barbarous murders occurred that is Israel and if you think that's not Israel then you're not recognized my my view is irrelevant to this I'm I'm asking I think the qari government and I think the Amir of Qatar and I think you should ask him that question I think the Qatari government and the Amir of Qatar recognizes that the areas that Hamas invaded and killed people in is a legitimate part of Israel that is not disputed by Qatar it is not disputed by Jordan it is not disputed by Egypt I I don't believe it's disputed by Saudi Arabia it's disputed by you no no I'm not I'm I I don't dispute anything like I said I'm purely asking a question here the reason why I'm asking you about Israel's borders is because you have uh uh uh put forward a narrative that this was an unprovoked attack inside Israel and uh Israel is defending itself and that Hamas is using human Shields to the end of it what we have seen over the past uh few weeks is Israeli Flags being planted inside Gaza and rhetoric being pushed by senior Israeli officials and military personnel saying that we will take back Gaza and in the absence of Israel being one of the only States if not the only States within the United Nations that has not defined clearly what its borders are it could be argued that those on the other side of the conflict will are excused to understand or to engage military in areas that have not been defined as a state this is what I'm asking you so where has Israel defined its borders that's all I want to know let's first of all talk about military action this wasn't military action rape is not there's been no evidence of rape I'm sorry there is there has been zero evidence of rape aside from the words that have been put forward by the Israeli government which has also pushed forward things like behind the scenes footage of a Lebanese film that has spoken about 40 beheaded B that shown calendars as if they names of Hamas commanders you're you're standing here now and denying that they was rape you're not believing the women who have come forward saying there's been no independent verification of it as a journalist we require there hasn't been the United States has accepted the the United States accepted the 40 dead baby story that means nothing the what baby no look babies were beheaded babies were killed look if you can't accept the fact that there was rape and murder if you think think that what happened is um an ordinary military activity then there's no sense Contin with this conversation forget about what I think sir I'm asking that question the same I would ask question the evidence of rape is overwhelming the evidence of beheadings and murder but even if there wasn't any rape even if there wasn't any murder you have to admit that the vast majority of the 12,000 people who were killed were at a peace conference a song conference they were Ordinary People they support the two solution people came to their homes and murdered their children in front of them that is not a military acted so what I would like to ask you based on this and as Gastly as what you have said is what I want to ask you is you and those who support Israel say what took place on October 7th was uh unforgivable and required a very clear response yes and it's unforgivable because so many civilians were killed in their homes and in front of their family members that's not why it's unforgivable it's unforgivable because the intention the goal the intention was to kill civilians civilians die in war civilians die when they're used as human Shields you can't make any comparison between the civilians who were killed by Israel in its attempt to prevent a recurrence of the attack and the civilians who were deliberately murdered in front of their children babies deliberately murdered they were not collateral damage that was the go that was the purpose of the invasion to kill and murder babies and civilians no comparison let me ask you let me ask you you say no comparison our colleague who's a veteran journalist for Al jaer whilst on air uh his wife and his children and his grandchildren were killed they had taken refuge in the place that Israel had asked them to take refuge in okay uh there was no Hamas Fighters there at all we can verify this as one of of our colleagues were and Israel has one of the most sophisticated if not the most sophisticated militaries in the world how might to believe the intention of Israel when he was forced to bury his children and his uh grandchildren and they were babies very simple very simple how you believe it is because Israel has no interest what conceivable interest let's assume Israel is the worst country in the world why would they ever want to kill babies and children they know that it hurts them it gets away with it that's why Israel's got gotten away with it for decades they're condemmed by every group in the world they're condemned by Human Rights Watch because the assumption is the wrong assumption that maybe that was done deliberately but it was never done deliberately if Hamas would stop using human Shields then civilians would stop being killed now I know that some of the journalists who were killed were killed by because they stayed up in the nor no they were in the South they were in the South sir well they were they were different there are different groups but what other country in the world has ever given notice before they've attacked has sent leaflets have put out Notions at all Israel according to Colonel Kemp the former head of the British uh Afghanistan unit said that no country in history has done more to protect civilians than Israel but no country in history no group in history like Kamas has done more to prevent uh have done more to endanger their own civilians by putting them In Harm's Way they've bragged about it they talk about how everybody is a Shahid everybody is a martyr we use women in Shields we have quotes from Hamas leaders saying we use women that the disabled the elderly and children as human Shields and Israel kills them and then they're condemned by World opinion so Hamas it why are you denying I'm not denying anything I I just want to to get uh understanding and perspective from from all sides and and you quoted there you were saying Hamas claims uh that everybody is a martyr and so forth so I want to give you a few quotes and and hear your thoughts on it Amit Hal or who is a member of the ceset for the liquid ruling liquid party he says there should be only two goals with regards to what is happening now in Gaza there is no more uh Muslim land in the land of Israel Gaza should be left as a monument like Sodom what do you think of that so that's wrong I condemn it I condemn it unequivocally I condemn much of what is said by the extreme Israeli right but those weren't the people who were killed not to justify killing or nuts but what I'm saying is you're depicting that Israel is the most moral army or a very Moral Moral Army but the people who are giving its orders I I want to quote you the people who are in power now and they are the ones who are giving orders you have the deputy speaker of parliament okay Nim rri who says expel them all right you have the Heritage M Minister who said who who said that you should drop a nuclear bomb on Gaza now how is that something that is going to bring trust in journalists or the public that Israel doesn't intend to kill children I completely agree with you that those statements are Abominations and they're rejected by most Israelis and they're rejected by the leadership of Israel no one has ever ever and I challenge you to give me one case no one has ever ever ordered a soldier in the IDF to kill a child or to kill an innocent civilian it just never happens what happens is because Hamas uses children as human Shields despite all the great efforts that Israel makes not to kill children inevitably children die and Hamas uses that as a way of attacking Israel it's part of their strategy it's called the dead baby strategy they deliberately use babies as human Shields they don't care about their own civilians they have tunnels in which the fighters hide but they won't allow their own civilians to use their tunnels to hide remember Israel has spent hundreds of millions of dolls if they use uh surely if Hamas was to put civilians in their tunnels then that would be using them as human Shields no the fact that they are separating their operational uh locations from the civilian location actually disproves what you're saying no not separating them they're building the tunnels underneath MOS underneath schools just yesterday Israel found underneath a school underneath a classroom a tunnel that was used by Hamas terrorists Hamas could easily build Shields Tunnels for civilians so why do why why does if Israel knows that these tunnels are under these buildings okay and you're saying that they find these tunnels after they've bombed them why why do they bomb them then if the tunel if they don't have any impact on the tunnels if they're underground and you're saying that they protect the people why bomb the schools and kill all of those people if if the idea is that the tunnels are underneath anywhere and the bombs don't do anything to them and they find them intact but they seemingly find them intact afterwards we know that they didn't bomb the hospital we know that that was an errant rocket which hospital many there's many many hospitals hospital where 500 people were killed in the parking lot that was a false story that was circulated by Hamas and by the Palestinian about the Indonesian hospital or shifa hospital or Nas hospital all of those ones uh Doctors Without Borders has become part of Hamas and they speak for Hamas and they protect Hamas and they cover for Hamas and hospitals are used there are pictures of Fighters wearing the green headband carrying RPGs walking into the hospital as if they owned it we know that hospitals are used as ways to protect right after the Savage attacks of October 7th some of the terrorists went immediately to the hospitals to hide there knowing that Israel would be reluctant to bomb the hospitals Israel then warns people and and and and and bombs in areas where there are Rockets coming from you say that Israel fires from safe areas Israel fires on safe areas as soon as an area is declared safe Hamas goes there and fires Rockets from it in order to induce Israel to fire into the civilian areas that's the plan of Hamas that's what it does that's why it's so successful and effective that's why it'll happen over and over and over again unless Hamas is destroyed and the biggest beneficiaries of Hamas being destroyed would be the Palestinian people can can I just ask you something you said something about uh Doctors Without Borders but not one this rule by ter so you said something about Doctors Without Borders and that they have been recruited by Hamas you said that's right has has UNESCO been recruited by Hamas sorry or UNICEF rather has UNICEF been been recruited by Hamas abely all three of them have become voices for Hamas none of them have any credibility around the world in objective people and who hasn't who hasn't been recruited by if you don't mind me saying and now we see the climate movement that young woman from Sweden now mouthpiece for Hamas but just because the world condemns uh many in the world condemn Israel doesn't mean that Israel is is wrong Israel is not perfect but compared to Hamas uh Hamas is is the greatest evil that the Palestinian people ever face and if Hamas is destroyed the people of Palestine will be so pleased and happy because Hamas because Gaza could have been Singapore in the Mediterranean when Israel left it just I need to ask a few questions if you don't mind I will ask you about Israel uh uh supposedly leaving 2005 but I just want to ask again you've now told me that uh Doctors Without Borders that UNICEF and even the climate movement been recruited by Hamas or they are Hamas spokes people okay who hasn't been recruited by Hamas like who who who in your view has credibility does the former uh does does the founding ICC prosecutor l Marino aampo does was he recruited by Hamas as well or is he somebody who has credibility no no no Lis aampo is a good friend of mine we taught together at law school can I quote something from him he's I know what he said and I disagree with him but he has credibility I believe generally credibility but many of these other organizations do not uh the United States state department has credibility Great Britain has credibility uh some of the other European countries have uh credibility Germany has credibility but Doctors Without Borders do not but let's get to but I want to to say something if you don't mind just let's make it a bit of a two-way just if you don't mind so so as I mentioned there ampo ampo who was the founding prosecutor of the international criminal court he says The Siege on Gaza even before October 7th and before what we are witnessing now okay these are his words The Siege on Gaza is a form of genocide because it is inflicting conditions that he didn't say qu you word for word and we can play it quote said this after he said this after October 7 not before October he was let me clarify it he was talking about post October sath so you totally misled your viewers let me and and what we will do is we will actually play this we will play this we will play this to hear it the siege of Gaza itself that is extermination or persecution as a crime against humanity and it's a form of genocide article 6 C or 2 C in the genocide convention Define that you don't need to kill people to commit genocide the the the rule say inflicting conditions to destroy the group that itself is a genocide so creating The Siege itself is a genocide and that is very clear the Israel W The Siege is very clear and the intention to destroy the people many officers from the Israel government are expressing genocidal intentions that why it's easy to say and the reasonable basis to believe Israel is committing a genocide in Gaza just on the siege then each bombing each of the killings should be properly investigated but come on we have already clear The Siege itself is a genocide he said that the siege on Gaza The Siege on Gaza is a form of genocide he said when prior to he said it after October 7th but made it very clear in his interview with Mark Lemont Hill on aler English that this siege that has been in place prior even to October 7th amounts to genocide righte prior to October 7th there was a ceased fire that was broken by Hamas Hamas was get Gaza was getting all kind of material all kind of food there was no Siege you're just lying to the people when you say that he said this and you said this he said this he didn't before October 7th get him on television interview him tell him I told you to put him on television and ask him directly whether he thinks there was genocide being committed against the Palestinian people before October 7th his answer will be no so so let me ask you two questions here number one you claimed that there was no Siege before October 7th when over uh the past since 2006 really uh there has been a Siege on Gaza where Gaza if if you let me let me just finish and then you can disagree all you like right where Israel has controlled all of the borders bar the one with Egypt where Israel controls the tax money going in where Israel controls the sources of electricity and of water where Israel uh controls the water ways and how far in Palestinian fishermen can go where Israel controls the sky and whether people can fly in it or not where Israel controls the land and this it's a good thing Let Me Tell let me just finish the question if you don't mind this constitutes this constitutes you want to call it a lighter version you want to call it a blockade you want to call it a Siege it in ensures that Israel has a strangle hold on 2 million people it is what has led to un officials calling Gaza an open air prison the largest in the world it is what Hamas says that its reasoning behind the October 7th lies in the decades long oppression of the people right and here is where I want to ask you because you started your clock on October 7th many Palestinians start their clock not just in 2005 not in 1967 in fact in 1948 or 1947 you say that Hamas has brought death and destruction but Di Yasin and the massacre of De Yasin where pregnant women were lined up and killed happened in 1947-48 you've had the uh tantura and other uh massacres that have taken place have happen Place much more before that a question let me answer let's start first with October um 7th um and and and and what you say uh happened there uh remember that uh Israel ended its occupation of the Gaza Strip in 2005 thean didn't end occupation let me me an answer now the Palestinian Authority took over at that time there was no Siege it was only when Hamas in a brutal coup murdered the pal inian Authority leaders took over and sent 6,000 Rockets into stot and areas in the south of Israel it was only after Hamas a terrorist organization started attacking Israel that Israel did with every other country in the world would do it said wait a minute you're at war with us and if you're at war with us we have to control the borders and make sure you don't get Rockets Make sure you don't get uh dirty bombs make sure you don't get the kinds of material that you used on October 7th so Hamas uh if they hadn't taken over in 200 and six and 7 Singapore on the sea could have been what Gaza was it's a beautiful area it's on the ocean they could have had a wonderful community and instead Hamas turned it into an open air prison Hamas killed all the opponents Hamas killed gay people Hamas killed feminists Hamas why isn't there a Singapore in the West Bank where Hamas doesn't rule R is a sing I've been to R several times rala is a nicer city than Jerusalem you don't see a single policeman you don't see a single Israeli you don't see a single soldier have you not seen the news over the past 24 hours there have been Palestinians killed in Ral in the past 24 hours by the Israelis you're not letting me talk the food inala is better than in Jerusalem the the homes are beautiful people have fantastic cars they have Rolex watches rala is a Palestinian State on the West Bank and if the rest of the West Bank and Gaza were like rala we could have a two-state solution Israel would easily make peace with ramala but the problem is there's janin the problem is there's tarum the problem is there's Gaza City the problem is there conun and from those places Israel is under attack and it has the absolute right and obligation to protect its own citizens and that's what it's been doing if everybody were like rala they would be peace in the Middle East but as the prime minister of Israel many years ago said if Israel laid down its arms there'd be genocide if Hamas laid down its arms there'd be peace let Hamas surrender let it give up Let there beace on the St on the on what you described as ramala and as you mention you asked me if I've been there I've been there ramala there's a the kalandia checkpoints are you familiar with the the checkpoint yeah no I've been through it it takes about 10 through no no for you it takes 10 seconds for a Palestinian it can take three hours is a beautiful please please Mr desit you can't brush this aside if you don't mind for you it will take 10 seconds to get anywhere around Israel for a Palestinian they can stay two hours at A checkpoint if not longer there have been Palestinian women who've been forced to give birth there is a separation barrier I've been there okay and there's footage again we can show there is a sep separation wall which has been described by human rights organizations as an apartheid wall that prevents people from going from one place to another in the West Bank okay not human organizations you're talking about Human Rights Watch which is paid by and by George Soros and which has no credibility anywhere in the Western World human right watch Doctors Without Borders UNICEF and Greta tumber or none of them have all of them have no credibility they're all pramas and about what about bet does betum have any credibility or are they also Hamas some credibility I've worked with betum I agree with some of their views but betum would not justify the I'm not talking about the attack now I'm talking about your allegation or your claim that there is a Singapore and ramala B B Salam B Salam clearly states that Israel is implementing a parthe in the West Bank this is something but it's not they're wrong they're wrong about that so they're only right when when when they're not condemning Israel Israel Israel offered to end its occupation in the West Bank they offered it in 19 1967 2001 2007 and the Palestinians have said no they offered 98% of the West bank and a Palestinian capital I know because ahod Omar is my friend and he was the one who made that offer there could havean state if the Palestinians had just said yes but the Palestinian leadership does not know how to say take yes for an answer mrz Mr I think it's important to be to be accurate with certain things yes they offered some of those things they didn't offer the capital in Jerusalem they did not offer the right of return for Palestinian refugees which is in shrined in international law and in the United Nations resolution no country world has ever accepted a right it is ined in international law if you in Pakistan has been a right of return in in in where the the places of Germany that the Russians have taken over it would be the only instance in history where there has been a right of return and Israel offered a symbolic right of return to people who were related to the people who live in Israel but the Palestinians rejected it categorically you can't get everything but the Palestinians bear enormous responsibility for there not being a two-state solution yes Rabin wanted a two-state solution he was murdered for murdered by who and M wanted in two states and they were murdered for it no I'm talking about iban sa and others in the Palestinian side Sadat who was murdered for it every country has its own problems but there would be a two-state solution if the Palestinians said said yes to ahot Mer's offer or to Bill Clinton's offer or to ah barack's offer there would be a Palestinian State there'd be no occupation of the West Bank I'm hoping will happen if Hamas is destroyed Hamas is destroy there can be a two-state solution let me ask you this question do you favor a two-state solution I don't favor anything I didn't just asking questions does qar does thear don't I don't speak for the Kat government and I have no idea IDE what what their views are I have no problem guessing them and asking them but I'm I'm here to ask you don't mind I'm here just to ask questions I honestly have no option no opinion what I'm asking here is this and you you've said something and it's really important that we we we take this here you now have put the hus uh largely if not solely on the Palestinians for there not being a two-state solution okay y signed the oo Accords for the preceding year or for the following years after that uh there was no move towards a Palestinian state in fact the Israeli Lobby in many countries prevented government from recognizing a Palestinian State yat ended up dying Under Siege in the M either by some theories being poisoned if not at least what we saw was surrounded by Israeli tanks which to totally destroyed the center of power of that Palestinian Authority so for you to claim that somehow Israel has been this Dove of peace and it has been the Palestinians that have been rejecting it is simply not true not least because it is not asking a question now you're making a statement so let me answer the question after the 200201 peace process went forward and Arafat said no he started anapat and killed many many Israelis as a result of that he got the Nobel Peace Prize it should have been taken away he started the inapa after after after Bill Clinton I spoke to Bill Clinton about this let me tell you about what happened Arafat called Bill Clinton when he was leaving the office and Arafat said to Bill Clinton congratulations Mr President you've done a great job and Clinton said I could have done a great job if not for you you were the one who ruined it you were the one who prevented there being a two-state solution and he was and and and Clinton was Furious furious at arat and Arafat after he rejected the two-state solution started in inata buses were being blown up and that's the actual reality Israel would like to live in peace Israel was happy to live in peace on a sliver of land that was given by the heel Commission in 1937 1938 Israel accepted that the Palestinians said no and there have been Wars ever since remember the first program didn't occur at diin it occurred in at at at in heon in heon in 1929 when the uh uh grand grand muy of Jerusalem called on the Muslims to kill the Jews because the Jews were praying at the Western Wall so you know yeah you want to go back in time we can go back in time but this could have been solved in 1948 it could have been solved in 1967 it could have been solved in 1973 it was solved between Egypt and Israel and Jordan in after 1973 but the Palestinian leadership has refused refuse to accept any offer that the Israelis made you have to have compromise so so so where is the compromise on the side of the Israelis now I would the Qatari government help as it's help in the hostage situation help in creating a two-state solution where is the compromise where is the compromise on the Israeli side where is the compromise on the Israeli side right now I can help I can tell you this I can help BR that about if if if I hear from the people of of of the Palestinian side that there's an interest in the two-state solution look I met with the Amir of Qatar I met with his brother along with Donald Trump uh when they visited each other uh in in in the white house um I I met with him at the Bal Meister hotel and we had a very good talk and and and the the Amir of qar and his brother seemed to be willing to help create a peaceful solution I'd like to I'd like to invite them again I don't speak for the Israeli government of course but I certainly can Advocate within the Israeli government a two-state solution if there was any interest on the other side I had dinner I had dinner with a I just want to ask something that's very important here you've said you don't speak for the government but you can Advocate to them you've Also earlier in this program said to me obviously that this right-wing government you don't agree with them and so forth and I've given you quotations of them essentially saying the most outrageous things that they have said why do you think it is okay for people to accept uh mediation with a right-wing government that has essentially been genocidal in its both actions and words but it's not okay to try and find a mediator to discuss with the Palestinian side and in fact they just need to be wiped off the map Hamas and others why is it not I want to have a mediator and and if if Hamas wants to the political wing of Hamas wants to participate uh that's fine I want to see mediation I want to see negotiation instead of uh the killing of people and the the the solution that Hamas has to cross the border and murder 1200 Israeli citizens and rape and kill is not a movement toward peace it's a movement you see where the problem is here sorry there is there is a clear double standards in Outrage where you are outraged by the murder of 12200 people but you are not outraged by your own admission if you tell 7,000 of the 18,000 were militants well 11,000 weren't that's 11 times more or 10 times more let's say than the ones that were killed why is this selective outrage something that people should accept I'm very confused they should they should accept it because you should be much more outraged at the deliberate willful premeditated murder and rape of innocent people then you should by efforts itself No One Believes those I'm sorry I tell you now in the Arabs streets you've seen the protest in London you've seen the protest in New York even the Jewish community in the United States sir doesn't believe that there is an intentional effort by the Israeli governments to protect civilians we've seen it for Jews for justice for Palestine Jews for peace well Jews for Palestine is a fake organization it doesn't consist of Jews they use the name Jews let me give you an example from history so the Germans murdered six million Jews in concentration camps they killed them and and then the United States bom bom Hiroshima Nagasaki and bombed Berlin is there any comparison no the the murder of people deliberately taking babies and putting them in gas Chambers or taking babies and cutting their heads off in Israel is very different from what you have happen in war in war there are civilian casualties 100,000 people died in aosaki 100,000 people died in Hiroshima many more died in the invasion of Berlin and no there wasn't that kind of outrage I think you'll find you'll find a lot of people were outraged I can tell you I think there shouldn't be any selective outrage I think I think the death of in and the killing of yeah the killing of innocent people should be condemned everywhere I condemn everywhere the death of innocent people I condemn far more the deliberate targeting of innocent people the deliberate effort to rape murder behead burn innocent babies and children than I do killings that occurred in the fog of War as the result of human Shields yeah I do have much much greater condation of the former than the ladder just as I have much greater condemnation of the gas Chambers than I do of Nagasaki and I want end on a final I want to end on a final question if you don't mind on intention and protection a few years ago the Israeli Supreme Court unanimously rejected a call by human rights organizations Israeli ones including yesin to declare it unlawful for Israeli soldiers to shoot unarmed civilians how does this sit with your claim that there is an intention not to kill civilians it's Supreme Court I know the Supreme Court decision it didn't do that it didn't say that can tell you the Supreme Court has said over and over again that it is unlawful to kill unarmed civilians they also said it was unlawful to take hostages the Supreme Court of Israel has been diamond in in in the world in terms of Defending human rights it's made it much harder for the Israeli Army to operate the way other armies do do you know that in Israel no go no Army can take a decision in violation of The Advocate General's rules whereas in the United States and other countries it's just advisory but in Israel it's compulsory and the Supreme Court of Israel has never Justified the killing the deliberate willful killing of unarmed civilians it's just never happened I know I'm an expert on Israeli Supreme Court I taught a course at Harvard Law School with the president of the Israeli Supreme Court Aon Barack I follow their decisions every day and I challenge you to give your public we will put it up on the screen when we come to broadcast put that that you say says that is perfectly permissible to kill unarmed civilians that's just so what I said just just for to clarify again because I think you misquoted me here the Israeli Supreme Court unan unanimously rejected a call by human rights organizations including the Israeli human rights organization yeshin to declare it unlawful for soldiers to shoot unarmed civilians this is what the Israeli Supreme Court did I believe the ruling was in 2018 and you can and our viewers can check it sorry that's not an accurate statement it's a misunderstanding of the role of the Supreme Court in Israel it's just not a correct statement let me be very clear I condemn the vast majority of Israelis condemn the Israeli Supreme Court condemns any shooting of any unarmed person deliberately and willfully it's wrong and it should never happen and and the vast majority of Israelis agree with that whereas the vast majority of Palestinians supported the attack of October 7th which included the rape the murder the beheading and the burning of children so that's the reality that's the truth and we have to face up to that and I down with the Palestinians I'll happy to offer my efforts I've been do doing this been trying to get peace between Israel and the Palestinians for 70 years I'd like to continue that and I'd like a year from now for us to interview each other in which we can talk about a time when there's a two-state solution and peace between two wonderful people the Jewish people and the Arab course I'm sure I'm sure one thing that people are hopeful for is that the killing can end obviously as you mentioned there if you say that people condemn the killing of unarmed uh civilians um the idea is about and deliberates obviously we have our colleague sharen abak who was killed deliberately uh and very clearly on camera until now there has been no justice for her that's not true based on on our investigations and and the video evidence that that's there it was there but that's all we have time for for this episode of sidebar Mr Alan deitz thank you very much for your time I appreciate thank you
