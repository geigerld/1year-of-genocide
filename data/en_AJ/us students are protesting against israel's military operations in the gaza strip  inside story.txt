Sea will be free from coast to coast anger is rising in US universities against Israel's war on Gaza defy a Crackdown students are demanding their schools cut off links with Israel but have these protests become politicized and is freedom of speech under threat this is Inside Story hello there and welcome to the program I'm Laura Kyle students in American universities have for decades stood up for what they believed in from fighting for social justice and equal rights to pushing back against Global Wars they've made their voices heard and now they're speaking out against Israel's war on Gaza which has killed more than 34,000 people in the past 6 months the protest which began in New York's Columbia University intensified last week the police Crackdown that followed caused the anger to spread to other universities in the US and even to Europe and Australia the students say their right to protest is being crushed and these demonstrations may have an even bigger impact since it's an election year in the United States we'll get the thoughts of our guests in just a moment first Patty khh BRS our coverage from one pro test at George Washington University this encampment is unique because here at George Washington University it didn't exist until Thursday morning the students said that they were encouraged to do this because of what happened at Colombia and this is also unique in that this isn't just George Washington this is students from eight different schools universities all around the Washington area one of their main demands is divestment these are some of the wealthiest schools with the largest endowments in the country they want to see uh more transparency in exactly what they invest in and also they want to see them divest from any company that does business with Israel and again that's just one of many demands and you'll notice that they've been handing out masks to the students that's because many of them the prop Palestinian protesters say they've been docks they've had their pictures put on trucks and driven around campus and their information put online so a lot of masks because there is concern about repercussions that said they say not going to go anywhere until their demands are met Patty Caine Washington DC for inside story so let's take a closer look at why University campuses have become a focal point for growing opposition to the war on Gaza students at Columbia University in New York set up a Gaza solidarity encampment on April 17th they pitched their tents on campus a day after Colombia president Minish safik faced a congressional hearing on allegations of anti-Semitism at the University she then called called in police to disperse the protesters more than 100 students were arrested in the Crackdown but another Camp sprang up protests have since erupted on at least 30 campuses around the US escalating tensions and sparking debates about freedom of speech the students are demanding their universities cut Financial ties with companies and weapons manufacturers profiting from Israel's war well let's bring in our guests now and they're all joining us from the United States in New York we have Jude Taha Palestinian journalist and student at the Columbia University graduate school of Journalism in Austin Texas we'll be hearing from Jeremy Suri historian and Professor for Global Leadership history and public policy at the University of Texas at Austin and in Washington political strategist and former senior Congressional Aid Reena sha thank you very much all of you for being with us Jude let's start with you if you can give us an idea of the current situation there at Colombia University on this Friday morning as we record the show because this is where it all began and where deadlines to clear that camp keep being extended um thank you so much for having me absolutely uh Colombia is where the original encampment took place I was there for the pitching of the original tents on the south lawn before they decided to move to the opposite lawn after arrest um the situation inside the campus is quite different from the situation outside the campus um what we're seeing right now is students are settling into the encampment there are groups of people forming there's a lot of community being grown inside um a lot of teachings a lot of um activities that show solidarity with re with Palestine um protests and chants can be heard obviously um outside the camp is and outside the campus is quite a different story um protests for Palestine have been prevalent since day one of the encampment yesterday we saw a huge pro-israeli protest that was organized um by two extremists from what I've seen on social media um pro-israeli protesters were surrounding campus NYPD was present um and chants were heard for in support of Israel with bring the hostages home meanwhile inside um C some Pro Palestinian students were facing the gate and they were getting called uh names we heard a few slurs while I was reporting out there tensions are high outside the campus but inside the encampment solidarity is on an extreme High there is a level of Peace inside the encampment students are familiar with each other they are comfortable you know it's not easy being outside the weather in New York has been Shifty um but students have been dedicated in their demands they are asking that everyone Center um especially when they are talking about the reasoning of the encampment and especially under suppression um they're pretty United in stating that although freedom of dude do they are they concerned that they that the camp is going to get cleared there are um concerns certainly negotiations are happening as far as we know last night we received an email that negotiations are happening and that an NYPD sweep is not in sight for yesterday every day is a new day negotiations are being updated quite frequently um the camp is having a general assembly nearly every night to announce to students who are in the encampment about updates as far as we know we have not heard anything as for today okay Jeremy let's get uh the idea the situation at the University of Texas where you are how is the University responding to protests there so uh the University brought in police to the campus uh particularly State Police as well as City police and University Police uh on Wednesday and this made the situation worse I would say that on our campus there are a lot of students who are very concerned about what's happening in the Middle East um a majority are probably um more concerned about the treatment of civilians in Gaza and elsewhere but there's a very large contingent that's also concerned about Israel's security and the Israeli hostages who are still being held by Hamas M so the campus has a lot of concern that's being voiced but it has been peaceful there are no encampments there was a demonstration on Wednesday and the police were brought into campus and as I've written about the arrival of the police made things worse it provoked students uh it provoked um violence uh low-scale violence between the police and the students most of the violence came from the police yesterday was much more calm there were larger demonstrations but they were peaceful and there was very little police presence on campus so so far we've had expressions of concern from students a relatively divided campus but a campus that is not at war with itself and we've had a very little violence okay uh Reena we'll get more onto the Crackdown in just a moment first of all I just want to get your ideas your feelings about this student protest that really has spread across so many University campuses are you surprised to see the speed and and the intensity with which it's taken hold this is democracy and and I actually think it's a very beautiful thing because as a longtime political uh Insider operative I can tell you this year being a presidential election year so much on the line here in these United States uh one thing that is seemingly widespread has been voter apathy so far because we have the same two choices we had in 2020 the American voter in general loves something new every few years and we don't have that this time around so what we're seeing again is uh is a lot of worry amongst those of Us in the political class that really want to see political participation we're wondering what turnout's going to be like how the electorate feels and so when I see a movement like this of students taking uh peaceful nonviolent actions expressing their concern about the US government's backing of Israel of where are taxpayer dollars going I think it's extremely healthy and that's not a partisan statement to make it's just saying that this is what's enshrined our constitution the ability to assemble peacefully the ability to use your voice um democracy in the streets is an incredible incredible thing and so I am supportive of these students doing so non-violently and peacefully again because this expression again speaks to what is going to be so important on the ballot in November okay then what do you make of the I just jump in there because what do you make of the response then to these protests that have by and large as you say been peaceful well I can speak to the Congressional response from Republican in the house chamber uh when they went to Columbia University's campus I was taken AB back number one I just want our audience to know that that is such an unusual move we've not seen that in the modern era as somebody who has served two former Republican members of the house uh if I were still there advising I would have absolutely advised against it and said it was a bad move on top of it the words of the speaker and the other members of the house that they were delivering on a private campus calling for the resignation of the president speaking to students in a way that painted all of them with a broad brush uh speaking to speaking down to them I mean the students no matter where you look from coast to coast they are the future of this country these people are elected to serve us they are our representatives and for them to take that tone that all of these students assembled were part of hate-filled speech I get it there are Bad actors in every movement and we should condemn them but not all students assembled in these tent encampments are out there wanting to assault their fellow Jewish students they are all out there concerned again about America's role and backing BB Netanyahu while on the one hand we are supplying weapons and funds to to do what he wants to do in Gaza without listening to Biden and on the other hand we're sending billions in humanitarian Aid to Gaza this is a hypocrisy these students are concerned about and for Congressional leaders to continue giving unfettered support to Israel simply on the basis of all of their religion I think is a horrible move and that's not rec izing the separation of church and state I get it I just want to jump in there because Jude was obviously at Columbia University where uh the Republican uh house Speaker Mike Johnson visited on Wednesday this is what Reena was just talking about what were the students feelings towards uh Republican Johnson's visit there um to be quite honest there wasn't much of a reaction from the encampment at far as I was there um a lot of the students students are very very focused on their demands they're very focused on upholding Community guidelines and they're very focused about they believe that what they're doing is right you know they believe that their voices should be heard they come from a legacy of student protesters um and they are less concerned with freedom of speech of what the person said they're just kind of concerned more so about what's happening in R their complicity in it I think they expected this response um however it did not really phase much um the conversations in the en in the encampment were very much so still focused on r on divestment on building Community um and how to further their solidarity with Palestine um that's been the focus as far as I've been there okay Jeremy another example of politicians getting involved there are quite a few that we'll get to but this one is particularly Texas uh Governor Greg Albert calling these demonstrations anti-Semitic are they no um there are certain anti-semitic elements and voices that have been heard there has been some vandalism of the uh Hillel Center at UT uh with um anti-semitic graffiti and things of that sort so there have been instances of anti-Semitism but certainly on Wednesday when the police were called in uh that demonstration happened to be behind my office and my office is right near where that occurred and I I was outside for about 4 5 minutes to an hour during the demonstration and when the police went into the demonstration and I did not hear a single anti-semitic chant I did not see a single anti-semitic sign uh these were students uh arguing for free Palestine and then there were Jewish students there arguing for freeing the hostages um and in that case uh the video that you're showing now uh that was a reaction to a demonstration that was free speech and that was not anti-Semitism and dude what about you there on Colombia what evidence have you seen if any of anti semitism there have been a couple of instances that have spread quite widely on media for example of a sign being held up uh pointing towards pro-israel students saying this these are hamas's next targets I mean instances like that really don't help the cause do they um what I've seen in the encampment there is a very large um Jewish presence um Jewish voices for peace have been essential for the Gaza solidarity encampment in Colombia um what I've also seen is there was a press conference held by Jewish students who were suspended or arrested outside the president's house where they verbalized that they do not feel comfortable with their Jewish voices being used um in Zionist spaces or used to as an excuse for what's happening in re um I do know that certain instances have gone viral I would like to emphasize that the instances have so far been outside of the encampment and there are a lot of there was a lot of presence of especially in the early days um of pro Palestine um protesters that were entering in and out of Campus you know campus is on lockdown and access is restricted but that does not mean that necessarily everyone that is coming in and out as a student I will also say that certain chants that have been going viral have all taken place outside the campus um inside the campus the solidarity is extremely high between um anti-zionist Jewish students and prop Palestinian students and the encampment is set up to be accessible to all and it's very Equitable in the even the services that are being provided there there is a food table that has food nearly for everyone there's kosher food there's halal food so I do want to say that although these instances have happened inside the encampment um especially Jewish voices inside the encampment are insisting that the focus should not be on their um feelings it should go back to um and outside the encampment yesterday's protest um was quite surprising because a few of the demonstrators um were saying remarks that don't necessarily align with the broader idea of what Pro Israeli protesters are saying I think in movements such as this one there is a lot of people present that not don't necessarily all share the same values however in the gods of solidarity encampment the instances of anti- ISM I have not been able to see or pinpoint and I had been I have been there nearly every day okay um for most of my day reporting Reena when you when you hear Jude's account of the situation and Jeremy's account of the situation down there in Texas it doesn't seem like there's much of a problem with these protests and yet we've got politicians making more of it than perhaps is necessary why are the presidents of these universities being hauled in front of congressional committee hearings to EXP laain their stance on anti-Semitism well unfortunately we exist in an era where pure political theater seems to win cheap political points for for people who sit at the highest purches of our land in leadership and there's no other explanation but that you know look on the Republican side even this past fall if you paid attention to the Republican primary debates in which um former governor of South Carolina and former un Ambassador uh Nikki Haley was successful in many ways she talked about Israel being America's only Ally in the region and I've talked to a number of Democrats over the years as well especially this past week and they say that they don't think Biden is taking a different approach than any American president would and I think that's what's at the core of them here these students and even regular everyday Americans like me feel very very strongly that the approach we've taken to dealing with Benyamin Netanyahu is wrong uh the Biden blink and Duo has had a drip drop approach to the geopolitical tension we're seeing in Ukraine uh we're seeing again in Gaza I don't feel that there's much leadership at the wheel and again this is across the board so what we're seeing right that frustration coming to the four and what I think is most important though is to remember what former president Trump said he would do he said he would broker piece in the Middle East through his son-in-law he did not we are so far away from aate solution it is laughable but is the final point just in the past few weeks we heard leaked audio as well as I think on the record statements I could be wrong about that from president former president Trump excuse me who again is a candidate right now for the White House saying that Benyamin Netanyahu should call this off this is not good he needs to bring this to an end right okay Jeremy I can see you're wanting to jump in there well I think this is actually about something larger than the Middle East for the last two to three years um many politicians have been attacking universities and the same politicians who today are saying that universities like Columbia and the University of Texas should crack down on anti-semitic speech as they see it are the same politicians who two or three years ago said we didn't have enough free speech that there weren't enough voices for conservatives on our campus what I think we're witnessing is that politicians particularly in the Republican party but not exclusively but largely in the Republican Party are fearful of a Young Generation that is more diverse that has different viewpoints and a young Young Generation that is quite frankly opposed to most of what the Republican party is about if we're talking about abortion rights if we're talking about religious freedom if we're talking about various things US policy toward different parts of the world many of these protesters are also against what the Democratic party is for but they are seen as more threatening to the Republican party and so for the last 3 to four years the Republican party has been using universities as a Whipping Boy as a place for which they can Flex their muscles and show that they are conservative and show that they're tough and blame students for problems that are not made by students and so I think that's why this is on that point how do you think the college administrators are standing up to that well I think the college administrators are doing a very poor job of standing up to that and the reason they're doing a poor job is first of all they're hoping for Goodwill from politicians many of these politicians who are attacking universities are the products of these universities Alise stonic uh who graduated from Harvard University was the person who attacked the president of Harvard University so first of all administrators have to recognize that politicians are now more hostile than they were and most administrators are trying not to be vocal and if they're not vocal if they're staying out of the debate what's happening is they're letting the politicians dominate the debate we need to hear University administrators stand up more vocally for free speech stand up for the rights and interests of students not taking political sides but defending what an academic environment is about do do you agree with that I mean how did you rate uh president Manu shafi's testimony at her Congressional hearing appearance uh did did she give students did students hear what they wanted to hear that she was defending them that she was defending the right to free speech um I don't believe that that is what they heard especially at Columbia University where there is an anti-Semitism task force that was created in response to the protesters and anti-Semitism was not defined um we don't know what anti-Semitism is in regards to the task force it's kind of like I I'll know it when I see it um I think at Columbia University what's super interesting as well is we're seeing faculty stand up for academic freedom and freedom of speech um faculty had a huge display on low Library steps where essentially what they were saying is although we might not all agree politically a majority of us agree that students deserve the space to vocalize and protest what they believe is right to have an environment where they can voice out their opinions they can say what they believe in and not be under threat of suspension not be under threat of eviction not be under threat of losing their academic degrees um and I do think that largely on Colombia's campus many faculty members are quite upset at the reaction especially bringing the NYPD in to arrest protesters who were largely peaceful I think that display really shook Colombia as a society as a community to its core because it's a scene that they are not used to seeing especially when the protest has been as targeted as they were by Administration as Pro Palestinian students have been dealing with disciplinary action since the first um protest happened on campus and I do think that there is no more space for these students to vocalize and verbalize what they want to say this is why the encampment is such a special space for them essentially what is happening is when students walk into the they feel like they're living in a reality that is shared where they can share what they're seeing they can be upset about it and still feel supported and around Community the teachings have been essal for them so we I can see you're wanting to jump in there go ahead yeah you know I think that what the students have highlighted with these movements which I believe we'll see more of over the weekend and into next week is the the so much gray that's here and and look I've been a political operative for a very long time and Tra had the great privilege of traveling the United States speaking to rural and urban Americans and this is what rural Americans also want they don't want billions of our taxpayer dollars going overseas to kill other people uh to to have other leaders decide indiscriminately to do what they want to do you know a lot of our politics today is sensationalized but one thing that's not is these dispatches out of the Middle East out of um Ukraine that show us the devastation that certain leaders are bringing to certain parts of the world and that is a shock not only to to the Consciousness because we are getting it steadily um we're getting in a way we've never had before we are more technologically connected to The Ballot Box than ever before and in the same way the that's coming is incessant and that is what has shown American people and students this is what Republicans should want they should want critical thinking they should want students to express themselves peacefully and really dissect these issues there's a lot of gray here look I'm not Jewish I'm not Muslim but I can empathize with the pl of both you can be an American I've heard this from rural and urban Americans you can be somebody that says I want the hostages of October 7th returned and I want the killing whatever BB is doing in Gaza to stop there for there to be a Perman fire there is a lot of great here that unfortunately doesn't get talked about enough and this movement is highlighting sure Jeremy there's a couple of weeks left of term do you see these protests continuing into the summer even returning in the Autumn when the election happens in November well I think we will see more protests for the next week or two of the term but I do think there'll be some over the summer but it will become more sparse uh and that might be a good thing there might be a cooling off period uh and what happens in the fall will be very much influenced by the events of the summer uh do events in the Middle East uh continue to expand as the violence continue to expand there how does US policy change uh how is the US government's role seen by students so there are a lot of variables what I do want to say though is although I agree with uh the points being made about how this there there's a lot of there should be a lot of agreement from rural voters with uh many of the things that were just said I will say that attacking demonstrators at universities always works with rural voters because rural voters see University students as privileged and even though they might not like spending money in the Middle East they see what what students are doing or the way it's depicted they see it as unpatriotic and this is why in the 1960s in the 1970s and today certain conservative politicians will often attack universities and attack the privileged students at universities unfortunately this is politically effective so Republicans will continue to do this I would expect to see more of it okay Jude the last word to you how would you like uh the university to respond going forward to these protests I think the response should be a genuine conversation and consideration with the demands the protest are making I think a lot of students in the encampment demanding divestment demanding Financial transparency de demanding amnesty as a result of the Crackdown needs to be heard and I think a lot of the focus should be on the fact that they want actionable steps they no longer want to be complicit they want their voices to be heard and I think I want to make a point to say that although students do go to these prestigious universities a lot of them are risking quite a lot to make the statement hurt and to them it feels worth it um one statement that has been told to me last night was we're sitting in a university in camps but we are optionally choosing to be here because there are no more universities standing in they are saying that although the Crackdown has been brutal the focus should be on the fact that they are safe there and that students in Le and other people in Le are not safe and I think there needs to be a real Reckoning with the reasoning these protests are happening and the reasoning people the men investment Jude we do have to leave it there many thanks to all
