time for the medical team to work we all say that the services of the medical teams in the hospitals are of no way because the hospitals are now out of service due to the Israeli aggression and we couldn't trade the Ang people in Gaza Strip the the health Ministry in Gaz is not able to fix the problem and to te the Eng and to te the wounded operations are being done on the floor on the ground
