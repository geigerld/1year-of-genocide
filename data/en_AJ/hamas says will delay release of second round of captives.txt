well let's recap again all of the latest developments we've been hearing out of Israel and the occupied territories the expected exchange of a second group of Israeli captives and Palestinian Prisoners has apparently been delayed the military wing of Hamas says the exchange won't happen until Israel adheres to the ceasefire agreement reached between the two sides and allows allows Aid trucks to enter Northern Gaza Maan bishara is Al's senior political analyst and joins me again here in the studio Maran these are incredibly sensitive moments aren't they we've all been on the lookout for the potential stumbling blocks the tension points in this complex choreography now potentially something is a foot a delay in the Handover of captives we thought it was underway Hamas now saying no no we're holding on to them because Israel hasn't adhered to the terms of the deal in sending Aid to Northern Gaza what is happening at the moment behind the scenes to try and resolve this how is how are they even contacting each other how are they even talking about this well my understanding is that the qataris now are directly involved uh in what is going on and probably not just here it's also over there but also uh there's clear violations apparently of the uh of the agreement and I think one of the things I've seen which I think probably would uh invoke or provoke uh Hamas into taking such a decision and that is that the aid is not reaching Northern Gaza I mean the fact that this whole entire Enterprise I'm talking about the deal was made in order to release few prisoners in the West Bank and Jerusalem that's a bit of a thin one right considering that the entire West Bank is held hostage to Israel and that it just held uh arrested imprisoned some 3,000 Palestinians right so the issue issue for Hamas in Gaza is about the humanitarian Aid and they agreed on to 300 trucks a day but clearly something is happening with that that's not well especially the idea of that Aid reaching those who need it most most in the north now why are there a lot of people still or some people still still in the north I've seen one image today that for me give me the clear answer young man mandates all over but walking around with tubes out of him with someone carrying the whatever it is that they do for whatever reason and walking from the north to the South because there are no ambulances to take him I can imagine that there are countless number of sick people old people and other kinds of people who just cannot make it to the South those people are in bad need of anything from drinking water to food well M mads Gilbert we just heard him there talked about the north the needs in the north he said there is not a single remaining functioning medical facility half a million people there many of them in extreme need patients still stuck in those non-functioning hospitals and no Aid reaching absolutely and one wonders about uh about the um about the functionality of those hospitals moving forward because my understanding is that contrary to the images that we've seen the Israelis presumably bringing new equipment that apparently the hospital didn't need at the time 2 7th of October now we hear Palestinian reports about uh about the Israeli military ransacking the hospitals I mean clearly the message here uh Jonah is that the Israelis don't want to leave anything functional they want to destroy the entire Civic structure in Northern Gaza perhaps later Southern Gaza in order to make it uninhabitable unlivable they just want to make sure that people simply will not be able to bear living anymore in the north so when we talk about Collective punishment as a war crime when we talk about Collective punishment as genocide when we talk about the unraveling genocide that's what we mean starving people rendering people unable even to drink water and we just saw the reports about diarrhea now we're talking about tens of thousands of any such cases that's just incredulous the idea that Israel could with such impunity under the cover of the deal to be able to continue to carry arrests in the West Bank to continue to starve people in Gaza right that's certainly a violation of some sort it's first and foremost for me as an analyst it's a violation of basic human decency basic human decency let alone violation of international law War crime Collective punishment and so on so forth and it's certainly a violation of the deal if the deal is to to let Aid into Gaza Maran it was striking listening to an interview conducted earlier by Nita Ibrahim uh at the uh outside offer prison where a gentleman described the ceasefire deal as a victory for the Palestinian resistance we've heard similar sentiments from the Israeli side who want to portray this ceasefire deal as their Victory they have subdued Gaza they have brought Hamas to heal and forced them to release some captives both both sides claiming Victory you talked about the point of this ceasefire deal what are the interests of both sides in preserving this ceasefire you know it's interesting that you say both sides and we need we need to dissect that what do we mean by both sides right because clearly the interests of the captives is not anymore the interest of the Netanyahu government in fact it wasn't from the very beginning we know for a fact that Hamas did consider those uh captives at least the hostage civilian amongst them that they were guests and they wanted to get rid of them as soon as possible and so Israel did not go did not need to go through 40 plus days of warfare of war crimes in order to get those released because Hamas wanted to get them released for minimum uh uh requirements and and and return what Hamas will insist on huge return will be the release of the soldiers that's a whole other game but the release of foreigners and and and Tha and and and and and Tha workers and and old people and young people Hamas wanted to do that from the beginning so Israel's claim that it's only under the pressure of war that Hamas wanted to release that that's humbug two I think Hamas can declare political political uh achievement in this deal because it prove to the world one that it's still capable after 50 days of war crimes to to have a have a command over its militants be able to ensure the safety and the well-being of the hostages the captives and I was just reading this is probably important for our viewers around the world who don't read Hebrew I was just reading a Hebrew website Walla in Israel the main website in Hebrew and Israel reporting about the relatives of the uh released hostages captives from Israel and those are relaying what their family members who were held by Hamas are saying and their testimony is that those uh captives were very well treated throughout their uh almost 50 days of captivity with the exception with the very few hours until they were brought into Gaza later on it seems like they were actually treated like guests and the entire Israeli hasbara the entire Israeli Public Relation deception from the the decapitation of babies through the you know the evil that's going to befall over the captives that's all is proving once again to be just that propaganda and it is totally untrue so in a sense Hamas was able to reveal certain things and was able to withhold withand steadfast you know Vis A V the the Israeli aggression but the people of Gaza paid a huge price for this Hamas might want to declare temporary Victory but no the people of Gaza are not Victorious today the people of Gaza were not party to this necessarily the people of Gaza are innocent unlike what the Israeli President says very hard to see what Hamas does with any political Capital it may gain in any of this we can talk about that later perhaps thanks Mar
