in Gaza a stroll to the beach is more than just a break it is a necessity high temperatures weigh daily on every facet of life for Palestinians living under siege homes destroyed no access to running water a swim in the cool blue Mediterranean Sea off the Gaza Coast often the only way to cool off when I want to go to the beach with my brother we must be barefoot so that our flip-flops aren't stolen we swim and show in the sea stay as much as we like and then go back to the tent so many people have been driven out of their homes a kind of shanty town of makeshift shelters now lines the Gaza Coast in this part of Kan yunus people here say sometimes it can be hotter inside the tent I have chess problems and life intense doesn't suit people with chest problems we walk to the beach spend some time enjoying the cooler Breeze this gives us some relief from our horrible life in The Tint living conditions here are harsh at best very basic they ration drinking water choosing to either clean or cook rarely both and the hotter it gets the faster the spread of infectious disease life in a tent during the war is very tough and extremely rough we came to the beach because we don't have any other option I am old and sick I feel suffocated in a tent sitting here like this for around 9 hours a day is not healthy either the whole situation is difficult for everyone particularly old people and children the tents are full of insects no one can sleep at night because of insects and flies you can't tolerate more than 5 minutes in a tent the water in the bottles becomes very hot and the food spoils quickly I don't know what to do a reprieve from the ruin around them welcome but brief and even here the war is on their mind Muhammad says the tents may be hot but some people live in dirty streets some don't know where to go but they say they are grateful to be alive Zayn basravi Al jazer make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
