welcome to the program it's 1900 GMT that's 10 p.m. in Gaza and Israel where the war is now into its fourth day the Israeli military is bombarding Gaza Hamas is launching more Rockets and the death toll on both sides is rising air and artillery strikes on Gaza have pounded the strip from north to south targeting the port within the last few hours at least 830 Palestinian have been killed and more than 900 Israelis have died since Hamas launched its surprise military operation on Saturday Hamas has vowed to respond to all Israeli strikes on Gaza with equal force it fired a barrage of hundreds of rockets towards Southern Israel it targeted the port city of ashalon after earlier warning people to leave Israel has also imposed a total Siege on Gaza cutting off all supplies of food water and fuel the European Union has opposed the move US President Joe Biden has confirmed that 14 Americans were killed in hamas's military operation he also reiterated Washington's support for Israel we must be Crystal Clear we stand with Israel we stand with Israel and we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens defend itself and respond to this attack there's no justification for terrorism there's no excuse Hamas does not stand for the Palestinians people's right to dignity and self-determination the state of purposes the annihilation of the state of Israel and the murder of Jewish people they use Palestinian civilians as human Shields mamas offers nothing but Terror and bloodshed with no regard to who pays the price there are growing concerns about the humanitarian situation in Gaza here's our reporter Russell Suter with the latest building after building block after block all are now leveled many people inside including children and the elderly did not have time to escape by midday on Tuesday Israel had bombed nearly 2,000 locations in the L populated Gaza Strip and promised to intensify its assault leaving the 2.3 million Palestinians living there with nowhere to go the Israeli Army made a phone call to a person who wasn't here he was in alal we came running and they told one of our neighbors that the building has to be evacuated where should they go they said they can go to the Sea people started running and suddenly we heard an explosion my brother's two children were standing in the doorway they were killed on Monday the Israeli defense minister announced a Complete Siege of the Gaza stre cutting off supplies of electricity fuel food and water the unrelenting bombardment of homes communication Towers hospitals roads and Moses has become a daily occurrence our area alal is a quiet area but when I came here I didn't recognize it it's completely destroyed all its features have changed this is unfair this is Terrorism there's no Humanity families here live in peace and do not have any links to anything what happened was Revenge a crime people are searching for survivors under the rubble nowhere is safe and there is nowhere to go they say we are told to evacuate the eastern part of Kanan yunus and go to a safe place but there is no safe place in the Gaza Strip This Hospital in Rafa is under staffed and under equipped and the number of people arriving here needing treatment keeps growing some of these children's parents have died many don't know yet how much they have lost now there's a real Massacre being committed against innocent civilians in the Sabra area there are dozens of victims and ambulances and civilian vehicles are still evacuating the victims from this that was directly targeted journalists reporting on the front lines of this war have also become targets they like many of gaza's faces are now gone forever the Israeli air strikes have already killed hundreds of people and injured thousands but people in Gaza fear the worst is still to come RAR Al jazer okay let's head to TK Abu AUM who's in Gaza for us T we've seen multiple strikes across the city and boats have also been hit in the port what's the latest on the ground well the Israeli occupation Army continues targeting and bounding the Gaza Strip with heavy bombardment during the past hour the main concentration of the Israeli targets was in the Norther northern areas of the Gaza Strip uh which was uh severely uh bombarded and destructed during uh the past hour as well yet the number of uh the casualties in these uh strucked areas is not yet confirmed and still unknown but according to the latest updates released by the Palestinian Ministry of Health inside the Gaza trip in a Paris conference it has stated that the the death uh toll has increased to around 900 Palestinian killed on the hands of the Israeli occupation and uh including are 260 kid among the victims um uh Israel is still shuttering and ordered to the cut off of electricity water and Food Supplies to the Gaza Strip at the current moment so the situation in the Gaza Strip is exacerbating Amed the ongoing closure of borders yes that brings me to my next question TK we know hospitals are overwhelmed and there are 180,000 people displaced what's the humanity Arian situation we're heading towards well the humanitarian situation is detering due to the ongoing strikes of uh the Israeli occupation now uh we can say that uh more than 200,000 Palestinian according to the United Nations have uh been displaced from the houses uh they hi it to uh find a a sh a safe shelter for themselves now the main shelter was afforded for them uh were the Ona schools generally so now the capacity of on school has been uh full uh during the last couple of days or since the early eruption of this conflict now uh the other part of the Palestinian people now they still living in their houses but Main in fact they have such a great shortage of electricity so they cannot even sometime afford the basic needs uh Amed the ongoing closure of uh uh borders now uh the uh Gaza Strip even is suffering from the uh destruction of some phone networks telecommunication networks so the uh sometimes the phone connection might be uh caught due to the Israeli uh destruction of telecommunication uh satellite telecommunication uh Towers inside this strip as well okay thanks so much for the update TK Abu AUM in Gaza thank you I'm joined by Muhammad Jam jum now who is live for us in ashod in southern Israel near the border with Gaza um Muhammad explain where you are and just how fluid is the situation at the moment yes yes have we got Muhammad I'll just I'll just double check if we've got Muhammad there Muhammad it's an incredibly fluid situation explain to us where you are and what's happening Emily we're in ashdod uh the city of ashdod and just in the past hour uh well actually hour and a half security situations become extremely tenuous we've had to come indoors the last live shot I was doing with you all in the past hour we were talking about the fact that there had been uh a massive influx of security uh outside uh of of this uh of this hotel that intersection you had soldiers you had police you had reservists all show up and what we were told as they were concerned that there might be an infiltration from the coastline of Hamas Fighters we were then ordered to come inside of this local hotel that's where we are right now we're Sheltering in place um in the last 15 20 minutes we've heard multiple rounds of shots going on around the hotel it's become very very tense the security people telling us we need to stay in place we are not allowed to go outside at the moment I don't know if you can see from our view here but there are uh if we just Pan the camera a little bit there are soldiers that are patrolling the perimeter here here uh really going to show just how tense and fluid and volatile the situation uh remains um we are waiting to get more updates about precisely what kind of fighting is going on here in ashot of course tensions have been high here in this city for a couple of days because you had two days ago a rocket that had been launched from Gaza land in the center of town uh as of today earlier in the day we heard sirens now earlier this evening we were in another area we were in zakim Junction which is just North of the the Gaza Strip ashdod where we are right now is about 30 km north of the border with Gaza and yet still at this hour there is concern amongst the security Personnel that we have been speaking with that perhaps there has been an infiltration from the coastline of Hamas Fighters coming to the city of ashad we are waiting for more information we will be getting those details to you as we have them Emily Muhammad How Could An infiltration if that is the case and confirmed to be the case how can an INF ation like this occur given Israel has said as recently as today that it has more or less restored control it is a very good question Emily and we are trying to get to the bottom of that as well as those police and soldiers showed up in the last hour um and started patrolling the perimeter at one point they asked us when they first showed up on the scene they asked us if perhaps us or any other journalist in the area were flying a drone there was some concern that perhaps there was a drone flying above we don't know if that actually ended up turning out to be the case or not we're still waiting on more details because it is such a fluid situation and there have not been any operational updates from the security that is assembled here but everybody is on a very much heightened state of alert and it really goes to show that something that seemed Unthinkable just days ago in light of what happened on Saturday there is so much concern right now that there could potentially be infiltration by Hamas fighters in a city like this 30 or so kilometers north of the Gaza Strip that's something that nobody here would have thought imaginable just a few days ago uh if that turns out to have been the case and we don't know yet if that is the case if that turns out to be the case of course people are going to be asking at a time when there is a war going on at a time when there is a heightened state of security how could something like that happen in ashad we're going to have to get to the bottom of those details at some point later but for right now all I can say is that once again the residents of this town very concerned the security extremely concerned and it's very interesting to see just how the atmosphere changes in an instant here because just a couple of hours ago we were at the intersection outside of this hotel when we were out there at one point there were settlers that showed up and they were trying to show their support for the reservist for the troops uh the Army members uh that are here they were dancing on tops of cars they were playing loud music from their speakers it was almost a very surreal almost festive atmosphere in a way that they were showing their support for the soldiers for the Israeli soldiers within 10 minutes of that everything completely changed media was asked to be pushed back we stayed outside initially we were told that was okay then we were all ordered to come indoors because that shooting started so as I said very fluid situation we're still trying to figure out exactly what is going on but certainly the situation here in ashod completely different than it was just a couple of hours ago Emily okay Muhammad Jam jum thanks so much for bringing us up to speed US President Joe Biden has been speaking within the last hour on the unfolding situation between Israel and Gaza let's go to our Washington DC correspondent Heidi Joe Castro Heidi Biden certainly didn't Min words did he he did not urge restraint in Gaza on a phone call to the Israeli Prime Minister what more did he say that's right and we are just learning now as well Emily that US Secretary of State an blinkin will be departing to engage with Israeli counterparts in person this a news just being announced by the US state department with blink's arrival due on Thursday this action follows just minutes after as you said US President Joe Biden gave a very strongly worded uh uh Speech to the people of the US to the public saying that the US stands squarely with Israel we're going to continue to stand United supporting the people of Israel who are suffering unspeakable losses and opposing the hatred and violence of terrorism my team has been in near constant communication with our Israeli partners and partners all across the region and the world from the moment this Crisis began we're surging additional military assistants including ammunition and interceptors to replenish Iron Dome we're going to make sure that Israel does not run out of these critical assets to defend its cities and its citizens and President Biden also saying that among what the US says were the a thousand plus Israelis who were killed in this attack he said 14 at least were also US citizens he also said that US citizens number among those who were taken to Gaza and are being held hostage he said that that taking of hostages was quote in violation of every code of human morality and said that now us experts would be available to engage uh to help Israel's uh government try to get those hostages recovered and of course he mentioned the call that he had this was the third call in four days with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in which Biden said uh that he told Netanyahu that if it had been the US that were attacked that the US would respond swiftly and in a way that is overwhelming now it's been reported that uh Biden did not urge restraint to Netanyahu which is something that normally the US would do to try to deescalate situations like this but he did say something in his public comments Biden uh saying that the US though if it had been uh attacked would uphold the law of war in its response against Hamas uh not saying that Israel should do the same but perhaps it can be read that this was a warning to do so and Biden also drew the comparison saying that Hamas which he calls terrorists purposely targeted civilians and that that is something that the US nor Israel should be doing also he did not address this Complete Siege uh of the Gaza Strip that was just announced Biden did not take any uh questions from reporters but he did say that the US believes Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people okay thanks for bringing us up to speed honei Joe Castro in Washington DC there have also been explosions on Israel's northern border with Lebanon where the Israeli military has launched artillery strikes in response to Rocket attacks by Hezbollah hamasa kasan brigades also says it has launched a rocket attack from Lebanon Ali hasham has the details from Southern Lebanon there is a significant development with uh hamas's alasam brigades issuing a statement claiming responsibility for the missiles or the rockets that were launched in South Lebanon today this is very significant because if we put this beside yesterday's uh Islamic jihad's infiltration to the uh uh in the the borders towards Israel and engaging in a battle with the Israeli Army we're seeing now a new Dynamic here on the Lebanese front as I said before this is an operation area and this operation area is now engaging Palestinian fa on Lebanese soil and this is the first time since 1982 that Lebanese sorry Palestinian factions are engaging directly in a fight with the Israelis on the Lebanese borders this is the the development that seems to be uh kind of different than all what's been happening the past days yes hisbah has attacked in the past few days Israeli posts in sh Farms it retaliated yesterday for Israel's uh uh air strike on its uh positions today and just a few uh hours ago hisbah issued a statement uh claiming responsibility for an attack on an Israeli military vehicle in a with guided missiles so it's getting more and more complicated situation is escalating day afterday however it's still it's still contained we can't say that it's out of control but the more the more there is blood the more things are going to go out of control let's bring in Elijah Magna who joins us from Paris he's a military and political analyst thanks so much for being on the program Elijah certainly quite a fluid situation at the moment the first thing I want to ask you is we've heard from our correspondent Muhammad Jam jum who's in southern Israel that there is the potential for an infiltration to have occurred by Hamas but is Israel only today said it had more or less restored control of the region so how could something like that have been carried out thank you for having me in the in the region of uh Gaza is something and in Lebanon is a completely different ball game in Lebanon the the border is long between 1990 95 kilometers there are possibilities of infiltration but nothing would happen without the knowledge and the will of Hezbollah in the past we used to see that the Israelis would close an eye and accuse Palestinians because if accusing the hisbah they would have to retaliate and they would have to hit hisbah and then hisbah will have to hit back so they all both sides play it down because they don't want to escalate today we have a different scenario the Israelis are showing determination that even if hisbah pretend they are the Palestinians even if the Palestinian claim their responsibility they retaliating against Hezbollah and against the location of heah that both sides know where each side is maintaining a military location and how many people and how many militants how many military are in each one so today the sorry Elijah I just want you to break that down for us because we're assuming um we've got an international audience so so break it down in terms of Hezbollah and Hamas Lebanon and Israel so hisbah and Hamas are part of the axis of the resistance so they indeed work together they have a United operational room and they are coordinating uh their military action uh Hamas is in Gaza but it's also present with a representative in Lebanon and there is a long history of cooperation between both sides now Lebanon is has its own way of approaching what's happening in Gaza because the situation in Gaza doesn't concern most of the lanese however it concerns particularly Hezbollah and the Palestinian and all the society that protects Hezbollah so the AIS of the resistance really yes sorry no no no please finish that thought so the access of the resistance that is not only Hamas and hisbah but also there are factions in Syria in Iraq in Yemen they all coordinating their act and this is why today we heard that the yemenese are saying that if the Americans interfere we going also to interfere so all that will pour into one operational room that coordinating the acts of every single faction and they are monitoring ing closely what's happening with us so if I'm to simplify what you've just said we're in danger here of this war widening out broader into the region it depends really how far the Israelis would go so far the Israelis have shown that they are planning a ground attack in case of ground attack the access of the resistance will react differently and we talking about led by Hezbollah in this case so far we have seen howah was really working to show the Israelis that it is planning to keep it busy on the Northern Israeli Frontier that it is south of Lebanon and to make sure that there are enough Israeli forces engage on that borders so not the bulk of the forces all the Israeli forces would go against Gaza that it's important forah to keep the isra really engaged our reporter zah hod was reporting from Southern Lebanon a couple of days ago and she was pointing out that she had witnessed what she described as some restraint from Hezbollah to not get involved in this conflict and particularly given what's happening in Lebanon and the crisis that are unfolding with the Lebanese people she she was saying well they're actually quite hesitant to really get fully involved in this conflict your response to that not quite because hisbah started by hitting the hill of the radar in theba and sheba and then today it has launched a laser guided missile against the tank that mava tank that in theory have burned the Israeli tanks so because the Israelis are not revealing all their losses and they taking time uh I am sure that there will be more soldiers that will be announced killed in the next days this is how the Israelis did two days ago when yesterday there were a clash and they said only one officer was killed and today we learned that the are three officers were killed this is why we've seen the Israeli retaliation against three location of hisbah really targeting to kill three in exchange of three Israelis and it tells us that the commander of the northern front is determined with a specific rule of Engagement to respond immediately and retaliate however we've seen the attacks today is limited on the demarcation line within three and four kilometers of the borders Israel as you're saying is going to have to divide its forces between its border with Gaza and South Lebanon does it have the resources to do that and will that impact anything that's happening in Gaza it has because it has called reservist that are 300,000 plus the 90 professional soldiers and officers that are part of the Israeli Army so for that the Israelis will have to dedicate around 120,000 to Gaza 120,000 to Lebanon and another part as reservist to make sure that the commanding uh could and control will keep it in case of a third front would open from the Goen height or they have to respond to the houthis or to the Iraqi if ever they are involved in the battlefield so they don't really know how the reaction will be and that's why they are very cautious to put all the forces against Gaza hence the work of heah to make sure that is sending on daily messages to Israel that we are ready to engage plus the 7,000 of the hisbah special forces that are very visible on the on the borders for Israel to see them and to understand the determination of heah to take part at a certain point which is not sure we still have to wait and see the development of the Israelis attack on Gaza what impact will it have if it ends up being a ground invas as everyone has been speculating what impact will that ground Invasion into Gaza have on this broader War it will depend on Hamas and Islamic Jihad really the Palestinian resistance inside Gaza will be ready to receive the Israelis that in 2014 Venture into few hundred meters only so if the Palestinian resistant will be able to deal with the advance of the Israelis how far the Israelis would go how their for military formation is and then it is up to the military operation that is working together in axis of the resistance to decide if there is a need to open a second Frontier or second front and then perhaps use the Drone to start with and go beyond the borders of Lebanon and go really start hitting the Inland in Israel okay thank you so much for your analysis Elijah magnea joining us from Paris a military and political analyst we're going to head to a break now but stay with us we'll bring you more coverage of the Gaza Israel war and all the latest breaking news on day four do stay with [Music] us
