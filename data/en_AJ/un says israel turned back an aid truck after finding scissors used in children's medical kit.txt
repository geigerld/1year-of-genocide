with us yonti cpto who's the president and chief executive at save the children in the US joining us from Weston in Connecticut thanks for your time you yourself were at the ra Crossing in January and you saw several items that were rejected what surprised you the most well thank you Daren um what surprised me the most quite a few things I saw a wooden toy box with games for children being rejected because the the box was made of wood and it had to repack in and boxes I saw hygiene kits with soap and blankets and sanitary pads for women rejected because there was a nail clipper in it so the that that list goes on and I think the key thing here is also it is very unpredictable which trucks can make it into Gaza and which ones are rejected so I saw hundreds of trucks there at the cross in arish waiting for their turn some of them were there for the second or third time and then some sometimes they did get in because there was authoriz given for those drugs sometimes they were returned sometimes they got in on the second or third time so it is that level of unpredictability and the sheer inadequacy of the number of supplies that are coming in that is making the delivery of good humanitarian assistance at scale so complicated in Gaza today so from what you saw what did they actually allow in and in what sorts of quantities they allowed in basic food items blankets clean water in in in bottles um flour so some of that made it in it was just wellfully inadequate even at the time and this was late January we saw when I was there there were about 130 trucks on average per day going in versus the 500 trucks that were going in before uh October 7th now we're what five six weeks later we're now looking at a further diminishment of the number of trucks being allowed in so that is a real problem and aside from that even if trucks make it into Gaza then distribution inside Gaza is still hugely problematic partly because of the deconfliction and the violence that you just talked about earlier that is still going on it's making it unsafe for us to do our work and unsafe for the communities we are trying to help and it is there is so much rubble and destruction around that it is physically even hard to actually get to The Last Mile in order to deliver our our supplies when they make it in right so how do organizations like yours than uh deal with what seems to be from what you're describing a completely chaotic uh situation it is chaotic it is wly inadequate and the situation is getting worse by the minute we are now hearing reports from children starving to death literally starving to death completely unnecessarily aside from the injuries and and the The Killing that's been going on because of uh the lack of a ceasefire um what we're doing we're trying to do our utmost we have about 30 colleagues inside mostly Palestinians with a with a number of international colleagues there we are trying to do everything we can we can to get life saving Aid to people to get medicins to hospitals to get um um malnutrition treatment to children when we can but it is severely impacted we would love to do we would we can do much much more but again we need a ceasefire we need many more trucks coming in Overland we have no time to wait for a sea um uh solution however creative uh it is um and and we need that deconfliction so that that assurance that our convoys our locations our offices our warehouses are kept safe in order to do our work but I mean this is Israel's response they say that Israel assists encourages and facilitates the entry of humanitarian aid for the residents of the Gaza Strip and for medical and other critical infrastructures in the strip but clearly uh that's not what you saw what's your response to what they have to say it's a drip feed I mean if if facilitation is to get 50 60 trucks a day in whereas what we need is 500 um I'm not quite sure what the definition really means um so we have seen a number of times that trucks that want to go to the north where still 15% of the population is they've had almost nothing since uh over the past number of weeks and months people are eating tree leaves they're mixing animal Foods uh with whatever flour they can find in order to make bread I mean it is really dire up in the north if if it's even if it's also bad in Rafa so we do not see in practice on the ground that facilitation working okay we thank you so much for joining us from Connecticut thank you well
