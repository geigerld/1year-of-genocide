since the October 7th attack Israel's leaders have invoked the historical persecution of the Jewish people to justify Israel's ongoing Siege of Gaza Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called hamas's Massacre quote the worst act of anti-Semitic violence since the Holocaust and said that just as the world United to defeat the Nazis it must also Stand United behind Israel to defeat Hamas but as the death toll in Gaza continues to rise and some experts warn of a potential genocide critics have started questioning this framing are Jewish history and anti-Semitism being weaponized as some within the Jewish Community claimed that discussion is coming up in an upfront special joining us to discuss this is omad bartov an Israeli American professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Brown University Stephanie Fox executive director of Jewish voice for peace and Omar badar political analyst and commentator and former deputy director of the Arab American Institute thank you all so much for joining me uh Omar I'm going to start with you uh following hamas's attack uh both Israeli and Western officials have repeatedly invoked Israel's right to defend itself US President Biden's anti-Semitism Envoy Deborah lipat went further saying quote no one has the right to tell Israel how to defend itself but Israel's response has had devastating humanitarian consequences states have the right to defend themselves within the limits of international law uh but they also have to consider proportionality uh where is the line between Israel's right to defense and the toll that it's taking on the Palestinian people Mark I'll take it a step back and say even before we get to the question of proportionality is to remember that Israel is an occupying force in Gaza Gaza has been placed under siege by Israel for more than 17 years in which life in Gaza is miserable people there was no economy to speak of half the population is unemployed um most most of the water that is in Gaza is undrinkable and they don't have the right to have an airport or a Seaport or trade with the outside world that is the reality for Gaza and successive Israeli military operations in Gaza have killed literally thousands of innocent people including hundreds of children more than 300 children in 20089 more than 550 children in 2014 and so when we ask the question of the right to self-defense the most obvious question that should come up is do Palestinians have the right to self-defense and as an occupied people who are living under a brutal military occupation there's no question that they do but obviously nobody thinks that hamas's attack which included tremendous harm to Israeli civilians that anybody could consider that to be an act of self-defense similarly let me ask a question about that because there are people particularly is Israeli Advocates who would say fine the West Bank is occupied but Israel moved all the troops settlers left in 2006 uh this is hamas's issue if there's if there's violence in Gaza if there's a problem in Gaza it's not Israel's occupation it's it's it's it's Hamas what do you say to those people look ending an occupation of a place does not just mean taking settlers out because Israel is literally in control of everything that goes in in and out of the Gaza Strip because they're not allowed to function or have access to the outside world without Israeli permission nothing goes into Gaza without Israel's permission nothing leaves Gaza without Israel's permission and again there is you know if if it's if you're talking about Israel controlling its own border or Egypt controlling its own border that's one thing but when you say Gaza is not allowed to have an airport and Gaza is not allowed to have a Seaport that the last time a humanitarian ship tried to come into Gaza to deliver some Aid Israeli soldiers boarded that ship and killed nine people on board including an American citizen you can't pretend that Gaza is a free place that is up for the people who live in it uh to determine its future because it is under occupation and that's the reason why the UN and many other human rights organizations also considered Gaza to continue to be under Israeli occupation Stephanie let me bring you in here many have pointed out that October 7th was the most lethal attack on Jewish people since the Holocaust one which as the writer uh Adam shatz put it triggered the rawest part of Jews psyche the fear of annihilation can you help us understand the psychological impact of hamas's attack listen every single one of the 1200 Israelis murdered by Hamas that over 200 kidnapped are precious and sacred you know on a human level and as a Jew with loved ones directly harmed I of course understand the desire to feel like the clock has to stop to feel engulfed with the pain and horror of what are obvious atrocities and war crimes but I think that um when you speak about that sort of sense of triggering a a core and sort of Primal Jewish fear of annihilation um that's not um a new Dynamic for us to be talking about in the context of the Israeli government or its oppression of Palestinians right we have to understand the ways in which um the Israeli government from its outset has been set on abusing the history of Jewish suffering and using it to justify more and more oppression and dispossession of Palestinians and we've been taught as Jews that Palestinians are somehow the rightful inheritors of the blame for genocidal European Christian anti-Semitism and the Holocaust while never deemed worthy of their own and that the basic fundamental longing Palestinians have for freedom in their own homes for survival in their own indigenous lands is falsely represented as rooted in hatred for Jews instead of love for family love for Community love for the land to which they belong you know and so I think that in this moment we see a Twining and intertwining of Jewish trauma and Palestinian trauma that we have to start um understanding both the way that that history has been twined and intertwined the way it's been pitted against each other and our responsibility to look at both the nakba and European responsibility for the Holocaust at once Omare you're an expert on uh genocide and you have talked about your concerns regarding the response of Israeli leadership to October 7th uh you said that they're showing quote genocidal intent which can easily tip into genocidal action you pointed to the fact that on October 28th prime minister Netanyahu said quote you must remember what amalec did to you this of course is a reference to a Torah passage uh where after a surprise attack God commands the Jewish people to kill every man woman and infant that's a story where failing to eradicate the enemy nearly leads to a Jewish genocide side that is to say the least provocative rhetoric what do you make of it what concerns you about it um Let me let me start just by saying that the Hamas attack on October 7th uh was a horrendous attack that could easily U be defined as a crime against humanity and as a war crime um and the question you asked earlier about self-defense I think every state uh has a right and often a duty for self-defense so the the question is obviously the framing of it as Omar said but um there there is actually an issue of uh a major attack in which U over 900 civilians were killed as well as 300 soldiers often in atrocious way so that is one part that that we have to keep in mind and the sense of insecurity that is it has instilled in the entire community community in Israel and the rhetoric that has come from Israeli political leaders you've you've mentioned netan the there many others as well as some military leaders has Echoes of genocide it it it actually sounds like an intent to carry out genocide now the question is whether they're actually doing it and we can go into greater detail my my sense is that the is huge disproportionality between the military goals that Israel wants to achieve which is to destroy at least the military infrastructure of Hamas and the number of civilians that it has killed including uh it seems thousands of children so on a far larger scale than ever before uh so there's indication of war crimes there's indication of crimes against humanity whether there is a um genocide I think we have not reached that point but one thing has to be pointed out is that Israel has uh forcibly evacuated about a million Palestinian citizens from the northern Gaza Strip to the southern G strip it claims to do that to protect them from military action but the result is that you have now huge congestion of people without appropriate infrastructure and just as winter is setting in uh that can be seen as ethnic cleansing which often in the past in several cases Wy cleansing has actually led to genocide so this is what we have to watch out for uh and warn against and that's what I've been trying to do for me as a Jew and I think for many of us the dehumanization of the language and the actions and the idea that nearly 5,000 Palestinian children have been murdered mured in a month many more hundreds maybe thousands stuck under the rubble dying slowly while those who are dropping the bombs are talking about how these are human animals that is like at talk about triggering a core Jewish understanding of what is what is the purpose of deeply dehumanizing language um so many of us in the Jewish Community who take the exact opposite lesson from histories of Oppression are pouring into the movement demanding a ceasefire demanding an end to the root causes of all of this violence um because we feel absolutely compelled to say you know never again is right now since October 7th Israel said we're trying to get rid of Hamas fully but an internal government document uncovered by a Hebrew Outlet shows that as early as October 13th the Israeli government was already considering expelling gaza's population into the Sinai desert saying that doing so would yield quote long-term strategic outcomes for Israel one Israeli Think Tank said that following October 7th there was quote a unique and rare opportunity to evacuate the entire Gaza Strip what do the past six weeks tell us about Israel's actual motivations here look there's no question that the fantasy in Israeli politicians Minds is to drive all Palestinians out of Gaza they've always looked at Gaza as a problem that they don't know how to deal with and if they sustain the current level of Destruction and damage that is taking place all over the Gaza Strip to the point where it can literally no longer sustain life you may end up in a situation in which to literally save the lives of people who are currently in Gaza that you end up forcing them to basically leave in order to set up a quote unquote temporary living situation elsewhere and then prevent them from returning Stephanie you talked about context before getting at some of the root causes uh that got us to October 7th that created these conditions uh other people have done that and they haven't gotten a great response I mean the Israeli government government was Furious after un Secretary General Antonio gutterz said that uh the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum the Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation with some Israeli officials actually accusing gutterz of Defending Hamas activists expressing solidarity with Palestinians have similarly been accused of Defending Hamas despite the fact that only a small minority have actually uh voiced support for the group and many including your group have been accused of having a pramas sentiment uh for asking to consider again the system of violence to borrow your words uh that led us to October 7th what's happening here how are these messages somehow being conflated with support for Hamas you know it's critical that we understand that for Palestinians October 6th October 5th October 4th and every day for the last 75 years have been a day of great emergency and violence that in the time even just in this past year between January 1st and October 7th Israel had killed 250 Palestinians including nearly 50 children pograms were so frequent in the West Bank that we as an organization were having a hard time responding quickly enough the Israeli military had bombed Janine refugee camp like we you know I've done this work for 15 years and I have never in my life been in a state of such emergency over the past year of just constant horrifying Violence by the Israeli state by the Israeli military by settlers working lock in lock step with those forces to attack or oppress and violently um harm and kill Palestinians and so it's outrageous to to suggest that the mere mention of those causes and the mere attempt to uh end violence is in fact somehow um anti-semitic or somehow disregarding of our deep care for jewi Jewish life Omare Israel's un Ambassador uh gilad erdan has repeatedly worn a yellow star of David like those that Jews were forced to wear during the Holocaust he's warned them to meetings at the UN Security Council uh but many say that comparing modern day Israel with the plight of Jews and Nazi Germany is actually a false analogy how do you make sense of those kind of competing narratives well you know shortly before the Hamas attack uh there was a pgam and that pgam was in hu in in a Palestinian town in the West Bank and it more or less was according to how you define a pgam that is that there is a mob that attacks a minority population in a in in a certain territory and this is what happened in the late 19th century and early 20th century to Jewish communities in Ukraine and Russia uh then when the Hamas attack happened then much of the Israeli media called that a program uh and that was meant really to evoke those memories and to say well you see now we are experiencing what we have always experienced it's anti-semitic it's an anti-semitic attack and there's nothing you can do against anti-Semitism but to fight it that you can't talk with anti-semites now of course it was not a pgam because a pgam is an attack on a minority and in this case the the whole point of Zionism the whole point of creating a jewi state was in response to pgam so the Jews would have as as anism saw it a Jewish majority state where the Army would be Jewish the police would be Jewish the government would be Jewish and therefore there would not be any pgs so calling the the the attack of Hamas which was an atrocious terrorist attack uh AOG is basically flipping things around uh it's like calling 911 a pgam it was a terrorist attack not a pgam the same thing happens with genocide I mean I've heard people claiming that the the Hamas attack was a genocide and now um many people marching uh in many cities saying that there's a genocide in Gaza there have been genocidal statements showing intent and when you define genocide you have to uh show an intent to destroy a group as such so intent is actually been shown through these statements whether that is actually happening on the ground that is whether there is intentional targeting of Civilian population rather than indiscriminate bombing that brings about the killing of large numbers of people of civilians of innocent civilians um that has to be debated I'm not sure that is the case as I said I think clearly there are war crimes happening potentially crimes against humanity whether it rises to the definition of genocide I'm not sure but I don't think in that sense it math is a great deal Omar look at least we agree that genocidal intent has been expressed now let's look at the actions and what they actually show you have a situation in which Amnesty International put out a report saying that entire families are being wiped out entire Bloodlines multiple generations of the same family have been obliterated off the face of the Earth and when you look at the history of how many children are killed in different conflicts you look at what happened in Ukraine about five just under 500 children were killed in Ukraine in the entire first year of Russia's war in Ukraine and what everybody acknowledges included war crimes and massive indiscriminate bombing of of Ukrainian areas and when you look at what's happening in Gaza 136 children are being killed every single day you are looking at a ratio of more than 100 to1 compared to almost any conflict that has happened in recent memory those numbers are absolutely horrifying and the extent to which half the house housing units in all of Gaza have been either completely destroyed or damaged you are looking at a scale of Destruction that if it is not stopped will make Gaza unfit for human living so the question for me is whether you call this a genocide or not will depend on whether you stop it in time or not however it is absolutely genocidal violence that is currently taking place that if it's allowed to continue you are going to completely destroy Palestinians ability to live in Gaza step uh anti-semitic attacks have risen in recent years and since October 7th we've seen uh a number of disturbing assaults on Jewish people uh there was a stabbing of a Jewish woman in in leyon there was a dagistan mob storming an airport in search of Jews uh at the same time many have characterized CS for a ceasefire as anti-semitic and have accused Jewish organizations like uh jvp Jewish voice for peace of being anti-semitic um in recent years organizations around the world have adopted the I's definition that's the international Holocaust remembrance alliance's definition of uh anti-Semitism which deems speech against the state of Israel as anti-semitic a hola scholar Amos Goldberg calls the IH definition catastrophic and says that the Israeli right has used it to completely change the discourse I want to get your take on this also omire uh what does that mean well it's how we have this truly orwellian World in which a March has happened this week that's supposing to be up against anti-Semitism but is actually a proar rally that is headlined by the one of the most powerful anti-semites in the US Pastor John heggy who has said that God brought Hitler to punish Jews and to drive them into Israel and has been working for decades to bring about what he hopes will be a world-ending apocalyptic religious war in the land you know it's how we have Marjorie Taylor green of Jewish space laser Fame of all things um starting the ball rolling on what would become the shameful censure of our only Palestinian American member of Congress Rashida Talib for fighting for the lives and rights of Palestinians and Israelis in equal measure you know so we have organizations like the Anti-Defamation League shutting down anti-apartheid student organizing in the name of Jewish safety is insane you know we see them actually collecting they're understood as somehow to be the the data collectors about anti-Semitism in the world but using that IH definition and using their own um slanderous definitions they actually um are collecting the the incidence of the largest Jewish protests in decades that are here fighting for a ceasefire for peace um they're they're documenting those as incidents of anti-Semitism so we have this upside down funhouse mirror situation of intentional confusion about what antiem semitism really is and that is incredibly dangerous in a moment when white nationalism and and and um anti-semitic ideologies are are driving violence against Jews and against Muslims and people of color it's essential that we be clear on what anti-Semitism is and on what it's not and that our movements are fighting for a future of freedom and safety for all people want to jump in I'm going to give you a chance to jump in just want to piggy back on one thing that Stephanie was saying that I think is really really telling whenever Israel starts committing war crimes there is also arising anti-semitic attacks and it is baffling that leading organizations rather than distance themselves from these war crimes insist that these war crimes are speaking in the name of the Jewish people that is just lunacy it tells you that they are less interested in combating anti-Semitism and they are more interested in running interference for promoting Israeli policy anti-Semitism is a very serious and Rising problem in this country and to play with it these silly political games and to water down that charge by flinging it at people who are trying to defend human rights and stand up to war crimes I think is is incredibly dangerous om so you know two Israeli professors Amos Goldberg whom you mentioned and Alon Kino uh and then myself joining them um actually uh responded to the IRA definition that has been um used by the Israeli government um created a separate definition the the the Jerusalem Declaration on on anti-Semitism that removes those sections that try to say that any uh criticism of the state of Israel is anti-Semitic but the IRA definition has been successful in being adopted by many governments um including quite a number of European governments and it is a weaponization by the Israeli government of anti-Semitism in order to uh defend itself from any criticism of its own policies you know I'm a historian so what I find most ironic about it is that the state of Israel was created as a response to anti-Semitism it was supposed to be the state in which Jews would be protected from anti-Semitism and anti-semitic attacks on Jews uh would would no longer have any rationale to them and the result right now is that just as Israel right now is the most dangerous place for Jews in the world it's also the the the main cause now for anti-semitic attacks nobody should condone those anti-semitic attacks but I think as Omar was saying uh when a state behaves in a particular way and it declares itself to be the state of the Jews then this has a particular effect on Jewish communities around the world you could say that what most triggers right now uh anti-Semitism around the world is the conduct of the state of through itself Stephanie we've seen Jewish organizations at the Forefront of the ceasefire movement are we seeing a growing diversity of opinion uh within the Jewish Community when it comes to Israel I mean absolutely the the you know protest movement that of the last month speaks for itself we have thousands and thousands of Jews of all ages certainly young people of course but of all ages pouring into the streets where you know the movement um for Palestinian rights and freedom Jews have always been a part of we're and also we've always been a part of so many movements for for justice and freedom and we bring all of that history with us into this moment in which it feels like um everything we've learned everything we've um fought for all of our Lives must be brought to bear to end these historic atrocities that we're seeing all right that's all we have time for I want to thank you all for joining me om Stephanie Omar thank you so much for joining me it's great having a conversation with you everybody that is our show up front we'll be back next
