a record number of people worldwide were displaced last year according to the internal displacement Monitoring Center its research shows nearly 76 million people were forced from their homes most were displaced by conflict and violence others by natural disasters nearly half were in Africa the UN says the conflict in Sudan has caused the world's worst displacement crisis this report says that by the end of last year more than N9 people 9 million people had been forced to flee Israel's war on Gaza forcibly displaced 1.7 million people in the 3 months between October and December and 4.7 million people in turqua and Syria are living in temporary shelters and containers after devastating earthquakes there Barbara Anga reports a watchdog says War drove Global displacement to a record 76 million people last year the report from the says the number of displaced people doubled in The Last 5 Years these Palestinians arriving at al- maasi area on gaza's western coast have been on the Move since Israel's war on Gaza began in October we've been displaced four times and now we live with my uncle's family in Al maasi but there is no space for us here violence in Gaza Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo drove 2/3 of the displacements in 2023 in the final quarter of the Year Israel's war on Gaza forcibly displaced 1.7 million Palestinians and in the Democratic Republic of Congo fighting between government troops and Rebels uprooted 6.7 million people since the conflict in San started in April 9.1 million people have been driven from their homes the second highest number recorded in a single country since records began in 2008 4-year-old y was orphaned as her family tried to escape from sedan to Chad during fighting between rival forces her mother who was 8 months pregnant was killed and she was left all alone some people found her on the road and brought her back here on the road we suffered a lot the rapid support forces killed and wounded so many people but the report says the crisis is just the tip of the iceberg tens of millions of people remain displaced from previous and ongoing Wars and disasters extreme weather and natural disasters also contributed to the global Spike of internally displaced people floods storms earthquakes and wildfires displaced more than 26 million people Barbara Anga Al jazer let's focus on the case of Sudan Sara Pantano is the chief executive of the think tank overseas development Institute you also led the UN development program's Sudan peace building unit and you're joining us from London thank you for your time today start by describing what life is like for internally displaced people in Sudan so as the report um your colleague just mentioned this is the worst the largest internal displacement crisis of these 9 million 7 million people are displaced within Sudan just to give you a sense the population of Kum a year ago was 6 million people now only 1 million remain um people are on the move all the time they have to flee and flee again you know we know there 750,000 people have crossed Chad that includes 200,000 almost 100,000 that were chadan refugees so people that left Chad to seek refuge in darur and now I have fled again because the violence is is in darur is so horrible um and what we know is that the the the level of the violence is what terrifies me people more than anything you know Human Rights Watch documented last year um there's been pretty much ethnic cleansing against the Mas tribe in darur so it's the violence is the fear of you know being being killed of course but it's also the hunger crisis because we are seeing um the the the threat of famine in Sudan um on levels that we haven't seen for many many years and we have seen famine before in the country so we know what to expect I I I'd like for our viewers to get an understanding of the long-term impact of something like this when we say that there have been 6 million displacements uh over the course of just one year as was the case in Sudan you know that that affects it's it's 6 million people for that year but it actually affects them for many many many years to come if not for their entire life absolutely it's actually 9 million people you know 6.7 are only those who are within the country the rest fled across the borders um and yes we know that you know crisis when the displacement crisis where people don't go back to their homes for six months they are likely to remain in displacement for three years we know that if they stay um away for more than a year they will be back for five and if they stay away for three they will be back for 10 and probably will never go back so all these figures are well established we have done a lot of research on these things in to over the years um so we know what to expect and what people need to imagine is what it means to be you know uprooted for such a long time you know for kids not to be able to go back to school not to be in education obviously for you know productive um activities to completely stall you know to completely hold and not be able to to to be resumed but obviously what we're most concerned about right now is not the long term is the immediate term and as I was saying before we are seeing so many parts of the countries at you know levels of food insecurity are extremely high now food insecurity is calculated on a range from one to five and last December we already had a lot of areas of Sudan that were in phase four which is emergency and then moving into catastrophe security canc was just briefed last month about you know the imminent danger of a catastropic fing in Sudan yeah the the faces the phases of food insecurity are something we've been we've become quite familiar with on aljazera uh whether it's in Sudan whether it's in Gaza phase four or five you know for for for our viewers for context for our viewers here it's based on how much food you have how nutritious the food uh is that you are eating if people are eating you know grass as we've seen in some cases that's not nutritious enough it doesn't sustain you it doesn't sustain life uh and it's also how many people actually die of this uh of these food shortages you mentioned children what there's a KnockOn effect for the next generation of course now absolutely I mean you know talking about children UNICEF predicts that 700,000 children will die in Sudan this year alone even if we manage to act now to prevent the famine these children will die because we've already crossed the thresholds you know in terms of morbidity and it will be impossible to save them but of course as you say for a lot of them the impact will be long term you know the inability to be educated the trauma of the violence that is not um addressed you know the fact we will for many years continue to live in makeshift you know displacement or Refugee um camps I mean that will obviously have lasting impacts for generations and it's a bit what we have seen to be honest with some of the children they are in well the young soldiers if you want they are involved in perpetrating the violence today these were the childrens's of previous crises in Sudan that didn't have a future yeah they become vulnerable on so many levels SAR Sara Pantano chief executive of overseas development Institute thank you very much make sure to subscribe to our channel to
