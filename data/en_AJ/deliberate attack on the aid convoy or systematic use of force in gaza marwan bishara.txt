J senior political analyst Marwan bishar Marwan I'm I'm just really curious to hear what you thought of that um that John Kirby press conference because Kirby's now clearly I think we can say fairly is playing defense with all these questions that were being uh asked of him on what the US thinks of what Israel has done and and how can they keep supporting this you know and he's he's he's dodging bullets out there absolutely I think uh listening to uh Kirby and uh blinkin today from Paris uh defending the Israeli war crimes in Gaza gives you a good sense of how far American officials need to go out of their way in order to justify or defend Israeli actions that are indefensible in Gaza so much so that you can see that the journalists who are asking the questions are so frustrated because in the end of the day right 6 months later 33 th000 have been killed mostly women and children and Mr Kirby is still um you know outraged by questions about violations of laws of war and saying well we still have to wait and see wait wait and see what exactly right he he was asked specifically has Israel violated any laws of law have they committed any war crimes in the last five six months um he was pretty defensive about that absolutely and I think here in this question right and um I'll be curious what our viewers around the world are thinking or the way they're thinking about this because I can see that much of the debate already of the past few hours was about whether it's deliberate or not deliberate so what do you think Ser you think it's worse if it was deliberate or not deliberate because I think it's worse if it's not deliberate because if it's deliberate it could be a general it could be a colonal an engineer who's mining these drones or a pilot who's mining an airplane or what have you that decided to take an action deliberately against the the aid Convoy it could be high ranking official in the military but the way things have been happening in Gaza if they're not deliberate they are certainly systematic and that's much worse than one individual or several individual deliberate actions you're you're saying essentially if this was not deliberate striking this Aid Convoy it kind of means that the killing has gone on autopilot absolutely because I'll give you a few examples take for example the most Stark example of all examples when the Israeli soldiers shot at Israeli captives holding White Flags was that deliberate well certainly that was not deliberate and I'm sure the Israeli soldiers would not want to shoot at Israeli citizens held captives in Gaza holding White Flags but they are clearly trigger happy or let me be a bit more objective Tri trigger ready to shoot look at the look at what happened to asifa not just the last few days or a couple of weeks look at what happened to a hospital look at happened to all the hospitals was that deliberate or not deliberate look at the death the killing of 20 plus thousand children and women was that deliberate or not so delate yeah exactly building on your point if uh since here we have the Israeli Prime Minister saying essentially this was not intentional it was a mistake mistakes happen what does that then mean about the 32,000 Palestinians who were killed and whether or not that was intentional and and there's a bit there's a bit of a snod and HPA in his tone his dismissal oh oh you know it's what's tragic we will look into it and of course secretary of state blinkin says we demand that Israel does a Swift and impartial impartial how would Israel want to do an impartial of its own crimes in Gaza how do you expect an Israeli Army that is mered in the death and destruction of um tens of thousands displacements of a million or two to be impartial about something like that but there there's a pattern here and we spoke about it the past six months the killing of onor how many people of onor have been killed already some 100 plus right of onor so there's a lot of I think we're closer to 200 but I don't have the exact number so there's a lot of Aid workers have been killed in Gaza right so we we agree about that how many journalists have been killed in Gaza how many of our colleagues have been killed how many members of their families have been killed okay so it's not deliberate right we can add to that health workers Aid workers obviously uh children hospitals Engineers academic nurses but also all the civilian infrastructures what about the five or six or seven I don't know the number of universities that they were all destroyed down to the you know to Rubble so yes I understand the debate and this is all the questions about was this deliberate or not delate okay we will investigate My worry is that it's not deliberate not my worry almost my you know my my analysis is that even if it's not deliberate that's just as bad if not worse because the fact is that that the the Central Kitchen have coordinated their coordinates with the Israeli military the Israeli military know where they are so if they didn't do it deliberately that means they are so trigger ready to shoot at anything that moves in Gaza that's why when we were talking about them shooting at the Israeli civilians with white flags we said what about all the Palestinians that we were white flags and they killed them right so there there's a there's a systematic uh uh um you know uh violence that is that is being carried by the Israelis there's a systematic use of force trigger happy trigger ready to use there's anger there's frustration and there is Revenge on the part of the Israeli army they are still angry 6 months later about what happened October 7th they are not acting like a professional Army they're acting like a vengeful tribe is very hateful of the people in Gaza and they are echoing what the president said almost six months ago when he said there are no Innocents in Gaza that definitely includes the aid workers because look the attack on onwa right the the the the UN organization that has been for decades helping Palestinians and the largest Aid organization in the strip and if I may remind our viewers around the probably no one has mentioned that the past just you need to study the history of this conflict and and of Ona onova started its operations after 1948 serving Palestinians and Israelis until 1952 Israelis were helped by onor until 195 Israel was was on its feet to be able to help its own citizens so the fact that Israel has attacked something like onor for all these years and demonized Ona just because six of its members six out of 13,000 have been accused of joining in the with the October 7 attack seven of 13,000 as a good number of observers said they're surprised that there are six not 600 or 6,000 right because Liv living in Gaza being involved and all that I think a lot of people were curious to just to barge through the borders and see what Happ is happening on the other side but be that as it may Israel has been trigger happy using Force using violence using bombs and the United States has been trigger happy trigger ready to provide it with the weapons and that's why Kirby blinkin Biden and others have been defending Israel because they are complicit just the last few days the United States has uh once again uh uh declared that it will be selling more weapons it will be transferring more arms to Israel including 2,000 pound bombs again 2,000 PB bombs for what exactly for what use in Gaza so I I I I am I am disheartened by what happened to the aid workers uh in Gaza but I'm just as disheartened and even more for the 40,000 perhaps now that have been killed in Gaza mostly women and children and for all the um medical workers Palestinian medical workers today we were we heard some reports from shifa hospital deliberate or not deliberate all all all hospitals in Gaza perhaps half of one in Rafa they're all all destroyed I think there is a systematic use of violence there is a Readiness to use violence and force and excessive force hyper use of force in Gaza alzir senior political analyst Maran bishara thank you very much for that we're going to take a very short break we'll be
