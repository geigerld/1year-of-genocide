I have no Illusions I know the American political life sufficiently to know that that will not happen uh but at least it's important to put pressure on the United States in order to make sure that United States uh put pressure on Israel uh as they are supporting Israel put pressure on Israel to stop the war and at the same time to recognize that the two-state solution must not be undermined okay joining us here is Tamar kmut who's an associate professor public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies welcome back to Al jazer just your initial thoughts on what garas had to say to Al jazer I mean it it doesn't get clearer than this so he's addressing it to the United States it is the only superpower which has been so far enabling Israel to continue this War uh through funding weapons arms and providing diplomatic protection to Israel in un corridors so he says it blunt and clear he's the US has to intervene and this comes from the top un Diplomat and this puts us again back to to the US I mean where is the US Administration when it comes to this of course I mean it's obvious to everyone that the US Administration has been enabling this war to continue and to go on for so long but do his words uh are his words strong enough in your opinion because earlier this week as you know we saw the deadliest attack on un staff in Gaza since the War Began since also uh October 7th of last year there are hundreds of of un facilities which have been damaged hundreds of un staff which have been killed in Gaza so why hasn't the UN sort of been able to put an end to what looks to be blatant disregard of un facilities and un sta excellent point Darin I mean the the UN especially nor has been uh a target of a Target and a victim of this war since the onset of of uh of of the of the of the War uh and and Israel has been Keen to Target Ona in particular in addition to other un agencies but because Ona has carries this historical weight un was established because of uh the establishment of Israel and the displacement of millions of Palestinians so it's a UN agency uh that was established to to cater for these Palestinian refugees and as long as it exists and keeps delivering Services it means uh Palestinian refugees have a right more or less in in until their their uh until the conflict is solved and until they're able to return to their Homeland uh so and and most recently the Israeli Prime Minister have also instructed the Army to get ready to replace onu and providing key Social Services to the residents of Gaza which hence of Israel is willing to reoccupy Gaza more or less and I think when when gues sees all of this realizes that the Israeli campaign is bigger than fighting Hamas it's after onoro as well they want to end Ono's presence in the strip and this for sure I mean coming from a very rational politician and I mean gues was a former Minister foreign minister of of Portugal he realizes that this is this will not solve the conflict by any mean it will just complicate the conflict just one final thought from you before we move on this lack of accountability that many observe since the beginning of the Gaza War specifically when it comes to of course the killing of un staff in Gaza um does it sort of set a dangerous precedent that politics is being put above people do you think of course but but again let's remind you the viewers that the UN is a very political organization and for it to reach to a consensus on any issue any Global Affair it it has to to be anonymous consens agreement among the key players especially the veto players the five important countries it's not a fair un it does not represent the real will and of of the globe as it stands today uh but we inerted the system past second world war and now that's the only available in International System we have I mean decision making making is taking into in in this complex political uh environment so it is a political agency but it carries a very humanitarian mandate that upholds human rights human value Etc but again if you don't have this political consensus at the upper level the administrative level of the UN becomes paralyzed and this is where um gues comes and he cries and he screams and he say days we need to get over with the politics agree on a political solution to enable the UN as as an entity as an agency to perform and to deliver its responsibilities and duties right but we're not there at this stage thank you so much Tam kmud thank you my pleasure make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
