well the Israeli government has banned Al jazer from reporting from there so hamut joins me now from the Jordanian Capital am man H talk us through what we've now been hearing from the Israelis well we've been hearing from Israel's defense ministry as well as the Army chief of staff let's begin with that meeting at the Kia in Tel Aviv that's Israel's version of the Pentagon it's the defense Ministry where we did have a situational assessment held by yoav Galant the country's defense minister along with several generals from Israel's Northern front command and the Army Chief of Staff hery halevi now in a readout from the defense Ministry Gallant had emphasized that Israel is looking to combat the Iranian drone threat in all possible ways and that Israel should be prepared for all possible scenarios Additionally the Army Chief of Staff has said that Israel is preparing itself on the ground to the maximum highest alert and that they are ready for a wide range of possibilities ready to make what he's calling the right decision now all of this comes as hery halevi the military chief of staff was touring Israel's North earlier today essentially downplaying the video that Hezbollah had showed nearly 10 minutes long showing sensitive military areas within Northern Israel and even showing Iron Dome missile defense batteries now halevi there was saying that Hezbollah is quote not aware of the military cap capabilities that Israel still has and that any capabilities hisbah has Israel's are greater but the reality of the situation is we actually don't know what kind of military and weapons capabilities Hezbollah has because we haven't really seen it so the Army is downplaying what is going to happen next really with Hezbollah but it is worth mentioning that the generals from Israel's Northern command who did approve these new battle and attack plans for what they're calling an offensive in Le on were at this meeting with yoav Galant in which they're saying they are prepared for war well all the latest from the Israeli side there from hamda salut a reminder as I was saying earlier the Israeli government has banned Al jazer from operating Israel that's why HDA was joining us there from neighboring Jordan well let's bring in Maan bashara Al jaer senior political analyst he's joining us today from Paris Maan what do you make of the threats we're hearing from both Hezbollah and Israel how close are we to to All Out War here you know we don't know I mean that's the short answer right but certainly we are getting closer and closer to it uh because of the escalation that's going on and every time there is an escalation we all jump in and say well here we are we're getting closer to perhaps an allout War because even if uh they're not intended to do it uh intentionally basically it would they could still happen by mistake right right by some major killing of major proportions of people in Lebanon or in Israel and that will simply lead to an escalation because neither side will be able to Simply uh you know withhold uh uh whatever the the limits are uh but again we've been there and we've been said that uh we've been saying that the past uh you know several months I remember with with each time you know that American Israeli Envoy came to Lebanon back in what was it November uh January and March and this is the fourth time around those time there was always a bit of an escalation and then we talked about the threat of the of a widening War now the thing the thing that you hear from hisbah is basically an attempt not to go to to to to an old white War that's why you hear such uh screaming such warning such threat because it's meant to be as a deterrence if you go out on allout war well expect an allout War well Mar one Israel is also right now grappling with growing tensions not only with with Hezbollah but with the US I see the White House has reportedly canceled a fairly high level meeting after Netanyahu released that video saying that Washington is withholding military aid where is that relationship now okay so this is uh of course another front I think we're dealing here with a number of fronts you and I have spoken earlier about the legal aspect of things the geopolitical aspect of things and with Lebanon Israel we're talking about strategy and War and here in the case of Israel us we're talking about the politics yeah it's not about the strategy it's not about geopolitics it's about the politics of Netanyahu and his government the politics of Netanyahu and his uh systematic pathological lying backstabbing cheating prime minister right so just as he did with Obama now he's doing with Biden despite the unprecedented support for Israel by the Biden Administration is clearly preparing for the day after Biden or preparing for the day after Biden to happen which is Trump because the video that he did could easily be used as propaganda by the Republican Party by the Trump campaign against bu them by saying we are you know the solid Ally of the United States and we're not getting the weapons we need even though they've gotten billions upon billions of dollars of weapons including the 2,000 pound bombs and so on so forth so Nan is basically preparing the way forward if if if the Biden Administration as we know it succumbs and seems like from blink's declaration it's succumbing yet again to the humiliation of the pathological fire in t Aviv or wor comes to worst you know they lash they lash against netan but nany becomes friends with Trump as the election nears Maran I couldn't help but notice and in this video the man who is essentially asking for these 2,000 bombs to quote finish the job he's supposedly also the man who the US says has signed up to a ceasefire deal but you see this is the thing right I mean uh the the most recent report this morning from The New York Times right underlines underlines the fact that uh secretary blinkin could not get Netanyahu to State unequivocally that he supports the proposal imagine after all the back and forth since what 11th of May and later on since the the UN resolution was adopted by the UN Security Council and still there is no clear statement from Israel public or apparently private because blinkin keept telling us and the rest of the world that in fact Netanyahu is on board but in the New York Times report this morning no it's not clear at all that netan is on board with the American Proposal with the UN Security Council resolution so once again we are dealing with a pathological liar he made a career out of his lying since he first became prime minister in 1996 every sing single Israeli politician today can testify to the fact that he was either stabbed in the back by him or light him even his finance minister right smri the the sort of the radical of the radical The Fanatic of the Fanatics in Israel the most uh close radical to Netanyahu today SMR have have have called Netanyahu the liar of all liars you can imagine that you know the idea that Netanyahu would stab Biden in the back after uh eight months of unconditional support after the bation going out of its way to do basically everything possible including excuse my expression prostituting itself in favor of Israel's war crimes in Gaza and still that's not even enough for the man sitting in t Aviv Mr nanyo who is more than capable to step over anyone everywhere for his career and his for fanatical program in Israel alzer's senior political analyst Maran bashara joining us again thank you very much Maran
