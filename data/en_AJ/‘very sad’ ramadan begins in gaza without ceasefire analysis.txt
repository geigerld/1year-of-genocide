let's bring in Sami Al Aran he directs the center for Islam and Global Affairs at Istanbul Zim University U thank you for joining us in the studio this hour look going this is day one of Ramadan going into this holy month for Muslims there was a a question that now seems naive of whether that might provide some momentum for a ceasefire in Gaza for an easing of tensions uh maybe even for more humanitarian Aid to be brought in clearly the answer is no absolutely I mean this is not the first Ramadan that Israel would violate I mean in 2021 same thing happened they were violating you know people's rights all over including their right to Worship in the laka Masque in 2021 there was a huge war was during Ramadan as well but Ramadan of course is a special month a special occasion and special season for many people and now they are facing particular people in Gaza a month where people are supposed to feel for The Afflicted for the hungry for the people who are not having shelters and yet all this happen happens in Gaza and we have a month without ceasefire continuous bombardment continuous killing continuous uh uh starvation Mass starvation taking place with nothing taking place so it's a very sad moment uh to have and to see what's happening in Gazza today especially in the midst of Ramadan what's the calculus for Israel when they see Ramadan approaching on the calendar how do they factor that in in their decision- making unfortunately Israel does not see the Palestinians are human beings they said that they are human animals they do not see the Human Side of Palestinians they have been violating their rights left and right but what they see here is pressure on the resistance so that they can give up the demands that they have been trying to get from them uh regarding the ceasefire or not ceasefire actually cation of hostilities because so far they have not accepted the concept of ceasefire with the resistance with Palestinians they want to continue until they fulfill their objectives which is basically to uh uh devastate to kill to to to to undermine and to an annihilate the the resistance and also to uh try to force some sort of Palestinian surrender whether by having a an evacuation that is is is uh voluntary or forced are you saying I want to make sure I got this right are you saying that Israel sees Ramadan as possibly putting more pressure on Hamas and therefore as as they see they see it as a time when they can G benefit from this I don't see any doubt about this because even President Biden has been trying to tell them please stop something six weeks at least let Ramadan be a peaceful uh month this time around and they continue to say no but the there's a calculus around Al axam mosque specifically isn't there because Netanyahu had a decision to make he had within his cabinet the security minister national security minister itamar bav who wanted to severely restrict access to Alamos and was pleading with Netanyahu to do that to implement that policy on the other hand shinb the domestic security service was telling Netanyahu this is not in Israel's interest to do this and could cause further further tensions Netanyahu in in the end sided with shinette and said there will be no more restrictions on alaka this year during this Ramadan than there were last year I think there is a misconception also about what Netanyahu is allowing or not allowing what benav is trying to do was to not allow any Palestinian even those who are have Israeli citizens of going there unless they are of certain age and what n says now these people will be able to go there we're not going to put restrictions but there will be security restrictions on the people of the West Bank in which the overwhelming majority of men would not be allowed which is the same thing that's been happening every year except for certain occasions which would be towards the end last 10 days of Ramadan or whenever there aren't settlers in in the compound but there is not unfettered access to Ala mosque for the Palestinians who live in the West Bank and remember West Bank is not a a war zone it's not Hamas you know invested Zone and yet all these restrictions are taking place in Ramadan by the Israelis yeah and 400 Palestinians have been killed killed there since October 7th that's exactly right and plus 7,300 people have been arrested have been absolutely without any charges um is alaa alaa has typically been a flasho in the Israeli Palestinian conflict do you expect this to be the case again this Ramadan it was for instance back in 2021 right the previous war between Israel and Hamas it was one of the causes that that triggered that war actually if you see the the October 7th operation was called the FL SOA has always been at the center of this conflict uh the organization of Islamic conference or now the organization of Islamic cooperation was created in 1969 because of Al AA there was a somebody who tried to burn Al AA mosque back in 1969 and that's how this organization was was born because of the immense uh sacredness and Holiness of this place for Muslims worldwide all right samel Aran thank you very much you're the director of the center for Islam and Global Affairs at Istanbul Z University thank you for joining us in the studio today thank you
