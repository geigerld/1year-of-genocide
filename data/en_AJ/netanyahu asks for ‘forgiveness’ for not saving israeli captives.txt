thousands of people remain on the streets of major Israeli cities for a third day on Monday demonstrators demanding the government sign a deal Benjamin netan has just spoken on isra television he's asking for forgiveness for not bringing the captives home I told the families and I will say it again tonight I apologize and ask for your forgiveness because we couldn't bring them back alive we were close close but we failed let me say this again tonight Israel will not remain silent on this massacre Hamas will pay the price a very high price alar is a political analyst and contributor to the Israeli Daily Newspaper haret he joins us now from Tel Aviv good to have you with us so Netanyahu they're asking for forgiveness do you think most Israelis particularly those on the streets protesting against him are ready to give him forgiveness well Sammy uh I don't forgive him I was there uh yesterday I was today protesting as not as a journalist but uh as an Israeli Patriot and uh they don't forgive him first of all because he still doesn't take the responsibility for what happened to Israel on October 7th number two he is not showing us any light at the end of the tunnels of Hamas just more soldiers and more civilians more captives getting back home in body bags so uh there is no forgiveness uh among those people there is fatigue yes uh the question is how long will those people who are taking to the streets every day and it it's quite warm I think it's not as warm as in goha but um it's it's a summer and uh uh people in the north including children didn't stop the school year and they don't forgive him and uh the people who spent 10 or now more than 10 months in reserves people who lost their jobs and lost their businesses they don't forgive him how much of a challenge then do you think these protests are becoming to Netanyahu you mentioned the fatigue but the pictures coming in the live pictures coming in from Tel Aviv show you know people are still gathering on the streets it doesn't look like the numbers are ready to dissipate at least right now yeah but but it seems we know from uh recent history you remember s when we were talking about the so-called uh judicial reform that uh we had uh every weekend half a million people in the streets now uh in in my neighborhood we got 20 or 30,000 now we can hardly get 1,000 people to get out of their home and the reason is is that uh the Israeli politicians uh mainly from the liud and the Orthodox party seem uh to uh do everything they they can including robbing the the budget and robbing the country's future the future of our children to stay in power and uh uh people are losing hope that there will be at least four or five people from theud or from Shas that uh will uh not be able to uh look at the mirror and they will defect um so and Netanyahu going back to him um wants to say there because otherwise if the war will end and actually he compared uh the uh Philadelphia a to the ex of evil so for him he said he will never leave Gaza he wants to stay there forever which means that he will perpet the war he knows that December 1st he will have to stand in court and uh be uh uh crucified and uh for him uh this Coalition is a lifesaver as you're talking a I just want to point out we're looking at live pictures of a protest in West Jerusalem outside the prime minister's residence I'm being told so you can see still it looks like quite a number of people coming out onto the streets there what do you make then it it is a bit of a a game of political strategy and chess given listening to what you were saying going on does the Israeli Court ruling ordering an end to the strike offer a major sort of sense of relief for Netanyahu a move that you know only 24 hours ago many people were caught by surprise thinking this could be very serious for the government has the picture changed radically now with the court ruling actually uh you know Israel is still a democracy yes and uh um when we look at the the polls the Israeli if not this Coalition the Israeli right and radical right have the the upper hand even if we go for elections um we uh will not go back to the negotiating table with the Palestinians so people are losing hope um more and more Israelis are uh lining up in uh foreign embassies to get uh European or American passports and leave and these people are the Elite um and uh uh netan and uh his gang believe that uh democracy is all about elections and as long as they have 64 mandates in the CET um they have the full legitimacy to rule and uh to send more and more youngsters to the battlefield without telling them what is the aim what is the exit strategy of this war what Israel wants to do with Gaza they are not going anywhere so uh yeah uh if we had a so-called normal moral government uh those images that you show from the streets will make a difference but it seems that uh for netan the alternative which is his uh uh personal political and personal life is more important than the lives of the Israeli captives and keep in mind that uh even if he will hold have a full control over the uh Philadelphia AIS that uh he turned to be sacred interest of Israel uh they will the people like the six Israeli captives that were killed in the tunnels they are still there and when uh the uh Hamas militants will hear the Israeli soldiers we will not hear from those captives that they are holding in the tunnels okay so if you were saying that the streets might not make that much a difference what about the splits within the government particularly between the security establishment and the Prime Minister it's it's not new of course there have been reports of tensions but the latest statements by UAV Galant the Minister of Defense talking about netanyahu's position and insistence on keeping Israeli troops in the Philadelphia Corridor I mean those comments sound they look like they're designed particularly to be targeted against the Prime Minister he's supposed to be so under how serious is that actually natany has managed uh uh to corer gallant and to exclude him from the liud and uh we all know that he's got no political future and netan got a majority in the cabinet and uh he proved that uh you know uh Gant and uh What uh he believes is the security gang the head of the mosad it's not only Galan it's the entire Security Administration the uh Chief of Staff the head of De mosad and shin who support gallant and they keep telling journalists of the record but in the cabinets meeting they speak out and they say you have to make a decision if you want to execute at least we have 30 and 40 other captives alive say it loud don't tell us that uh we will bring them uh back home just with more pressure on the Hamas no the Hamas will the Hamas knows that these people are their only bargaining trick and if I was sin I would keep them you know uh he knows that otherwise you know n will even be able to send back settlers to Gaza if uh bangri and spich will keep pushing him and putting him uh to the corner all right thank you so much for your thoughts and Analysis on that AK alar political analyst make
