an Israeli airstrike on Han units in the Gaza Strip has killed the head of the rocket unit in the Islamic Jihad group in a statement the group confirmed its Commander Ali Hassan Gali was assassinated in the strike Gali was a member of the military Council and head of the rocket unit in the alcud's brigades so far Israel has killed four Islamic Jihad commanders in the last 72 hours will the airstrike hit a residential apartment in the hard units neighborhood at dawn two other people were also killed in the same attack in recent days Israel has launched multiple airstrikes on Gaza targeting a number of Islamic Jihad members at least 24 people have been killed and dozens injured Islamic Jihad has fired more than 400 Rockets from Gaza towards Israel with some traveling as far as Tel Aviv let's speak now to Islam adwan who's in Gaza City for US isamsa Reports an Israeli airstrike has killed the head of the Islamic Jihad rocket launching unit what more can you tell us at the moment to sum up what happened from last night it has been a long night filled with tension and fear particularly started with the Egyptian Outlets talking about a a mediation between Israel and Gaza about a truce implemented in a positive atmosphere but those talks have have not come to any sense particularly after 36 hours of cautious silence Israel targeted again residential buildings altering the Islamic Jihad to state that if Israel continues the policy of targeting residential buildings then they will go on a wider scale of shooting rockets at the Israeli cities later after their were a heavy exchange of fire from Gaza launching rockets and Israeli targeting multiple cities in the Gaza particularly the city of hanunes a later in the in the last couple of hours assassinating one of the Islamic Jihad Ali Hassan rally who has been known as the head of the Rockets launching unit and also one of the commanders the high commanders of the military Council of the Islamic Jihad the right wing of the Islamic Jihad al-khut a bridge this is altering in so many different ways as a Jihad as the Islamic Jihad stated before that the Dilemma of this truth talks in particular and the issue of reaching a positive atmosphere with regards to peace talks is a The Dilemma of the policy of assassination with which Israel has been practicing over the last decades and seemingly that Israel is not ready to let go of this policy Isam let me ask you do you think the death of this rocket launching Commander from Islamic Jihad is likely to cause a further escalation in the violence of things like likely to get worse now do you think the first assumptions of this assassination is assumed that the Israeli government is a pressuring the Islamic Jihad to surrender for the terms or for the talks approached by the Egyptian mediators along with Qatar and the U.S Administration to pressure them to accept the tree the truth Talks by the mediators but of course with the Islamic Jihad being put in such a difficult position assassinating for commanders in in three days two days and here we are in in the morning that was supposed to be a positive news with regards to those truth talks with another assassination of a high commander of the Islamic Jihad we believe this is an altering situation the Islamic Jihad has not commented since the assassination but to mourn the killing of of their senior Commando there were no shooting of rockets it's been like cautious silence that could in a way or another alter more rounds of violence in the coming hours we still don't know what the future holds for us all right there live for us in Gaza City Isam thank you
