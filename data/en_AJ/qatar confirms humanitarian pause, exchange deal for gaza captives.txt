mention that statement from the Qatari government uh confirming the truce deal this it this is what it had to say the humanitarian pors will also allow the entry of a larger number of humanitarian Aid convoys including fuel for humanitarian needs Kata reaffirmed its commitment to ongoing efforts to deescalate tensions stop the Bloodshed and protect civilians it also said it appreciates the efforts of Egypt and the United States in reaching this agreement let's go to alzer's John hendin to get the view from the states he's live in Washington DC John so as we've been reporting the Israeli cabinet finally approving this deal presumably this now takes some pressure of the Biden Administration the US has a lot riding on the deal doesn't it that's right Biden's polls have been plunging in the US Americans are not happy with how he's been dealing with the situation although initially they were very favorable to a pro-israeli response that has changed over time as have us demographics there is a a larger arab-american population a larger Muslim American population and there have been major protests throughout the US so the Biden Administration has been saying that they improved the deal here we had uh a thank you from Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin neton Yahoo to the White House Administration saying that they actually made things better and the White House has a direct interest here among those 50 or so hostages I'm sorry captives to be released over the four days there are three Americans and one of them is a three-year-old who has a birthday on Friday so the Americans have been working very aggressively to try to get this deal through and for Biden it matters because he his poll numbers have been falling among Arab Americans among liberal Americans among a great number of Americans and that's important because he was only leading his uh presumed opposition leader that is Donald Trump the former president a republican by a couple of percentage points and that that number has gone upside down so Biden has been behind not that that's the only important thing going on here but it has affected the 2024 presidential campaign the White House says that is not what is driving them but they say that they have aggressively tried to pursue the release of hostages mind you this is only women and children that we are talking about and according to axios the website um we have the American Secretary of State Anthony blinkin who is going to go back to the region for a fourth time sometime between Thursday the Thanksgiving holiday and Tuesday which is a NATO meeting and he's going to try to increase the number of captives who are released here but the US has been very happy that this is happening and they're particularly happy with the pause and hostilities that Israel has agreed to right John and we're just hearing on the news wires uh President Biden saying the deal should bring home additional American hostages I understand you've been talking to a senior Us official and he's been telling you what what the US's involvement has been in these negotiations that's right the US says that they have been aggressively pushing for an increase both in the amount of time that the hostilities are paused and in the number of captives to be released and they say that they have been aggressive in increasing the number of captives who would be released with Kamas um also uh the US has apparently given a a list of places to avoid humanitarian sites uh for Israel among those were the alifa hospitals uh the hospital rather and uh Israel has apparently chosen to ignore that saying that they believe that there is Hamas activity some kind of Hamas compound beneath that complex but the US has been pretty aggressive in in pushing forward a number of sits that they say should not be attacked but we are told that they have not presented in such a way that this is a no target list this is just a series of Suggestions by the US and by all accounts Israel has decided that it will choose its own targets okay thank you for that alas uh John hendin there for us in Washington DC let's speak to Dove Waxman he's a professor of Israel studies and political science UCLA he joins us live from Los Angeles thank you for your time so more details now emerging off this deal what is your reaction to what we've heard so far well I'm very happy to hear this news I I think this is really the first piece of good news we've had in six weeks of heartbreaking tragedy so um it will save lives it will save Palestinian lives it will save uh quite likely the lives of Israeli hostages as well uh it will allow for more humanitarian Aid to reach uh uh Palestinian civilians in Gaza which is desperately needed um and it um will also allow for the release of Palestinian children from Israeli prisons which I also welcome what do you make of the US's involvement throughout this entire Saga and particularly through these negotiations I mean Netanyahu before he went into the cabinet thanked President Biden for making the deal sweeter for the is Israelis how significant do you think that is well it does seem that I mean it's hard to know because obviously people have been pointing out that there was potentially a deal on the table uh before now which Israel didn't accept so I think it serves netanyahu's interest to make clear that he kind of um got the best deal possible and also to thank President Biden uh politically that's helpful given the fact that I think the president is under growing pressure um for his support for Israel um and so Netanyahu is in some sense trying to repay some of the favor that President Biden has has shown him over these last many weeks now the Israelis have made clear that the fighting will resume what do you think a pause will mean in terms of the tempo of Israel's military operations well that's the million dollar question I mean there's going to be a pause in the fighting while or there likely will be if this deal goes through of course uh it hasn't happened yet it could still fall apart but if it does happen the way the deal is structured with the kind of gradual incremental release of hostages I think that's going to ensure uh that there will be this pause in the fighting the pause can be extended if Hamas releases additional prisoners so it could go on longer than a five-day pause um and I think there's going to be growing International pressure on Israel to uh to extend it into a permanent ceasefire uh prime minister Netanyahu has made it very clear that he objects to that and that he will uh press on uh with Israel's military campaign after this pause ends but there's certainly going to be more pressure on the Biden Administration and on the Israeli government to extend this and to bring all the hostages home well nety also faces domestic pressure doesn't he I mean a pause in the fighting how how's that going to change the political Dynamic for Netanyahu well on the one hand this deal alleviates some of the domestic pressure he's been facing from the families of the hostages and he's been under really growing pressure to to bring at least some of those hostages home so it eases some of that domestic pressure but the Israeli public still um overwhelmingly demand Hamas to be defeated and really eradicated in the Gaza Strip um and I think prime minister Nyah who really has no choice uh but to heed to that demand and think I think it's very likely there for that Israel will resume its war after this poor ends uh because that's what the public Israeli public is demanding uh you you said a little earlier that we still don't the deal has not happened as of yet we haven't had the exchanges take place uh what do you think could stop a deal from going through well I think it's clear now on the Israeli side that was one question whether the Israeli cabinet would would agree to us and now that they have on the Israeli side it's clear I think on the on hamas's side it's clear as well um but until it actually happens I mean we've seen other kinds of uh trues between Israel and Hamas fall apart um things can happen on the ground so I think uh you know it's wise to be cautious until we see those uh those hostages uh start to be released and we also need to make it clear that that the Israelis actually are going to cease all of their military activity in the Gaza Strip they're not going to withdraw uh their soldiers from the Gaza Strip but they are uh promising to cease military activity and that is also a challenge given the fact that in addition to Hamas there's also other uh groups like Palestinian Islamic Jihad that hold hostages as well as um some others um and so you know there's other groups that could Scuttle this agreement if if if uh if if they want to U but I think it's very likely to go forward at this point okay good to speak to you and get your perspective do Waxman professor of Israel studies and political science at
