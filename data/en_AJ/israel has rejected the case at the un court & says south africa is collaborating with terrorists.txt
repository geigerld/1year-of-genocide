now Jeffrey nice is a barister and human rights lawyer who prosecuted Slobodan mosovich at the Yugoslav tribunal he explains why South Africa's case stands out in the history of international law the convention was signed in 48 became effective in 53 it's now 70 years 75 years or whatever it is since it became effective and in that time no great power has had the courage to do what South Africa is doing now and what once before was done by an African country The Gambia in respect of Myanmar because what should be done is that whenever genocide is detected any other party to the convention should deal with the matter by prevention and prevention needs them to do something the first thing they can do is take the matter to the international court of justice as South Africa has done to seek in this case first to seek protective measures which means getting an order from the court that is Israel should stop what it's doing so it's not unprecedented it's unusual but it's only unusual because the great Powers have refused for their own reasons and probably for their own interests to perform the undertaking that falls on them under article one of the convention and to deal with genocide as soon as they see it oh artto is a professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Brown University he joins us now uh from Cambridge in the UK thanks very much for being with us so first of all what do you make of this decision by South Africa to to file this case against um uh Israel and the international court of justice well I think as the as the um previous pres was saying um this is very unusual but I think it's a very important uh move on the part of South Africa my s is that it has uh it it may have two effects one is that there will be an international body a respected body that will actually deliberate over this uh because many people have been using the term genocide not always accurately uh to say whether they think what they're seeing on the ground is genocide and the second is I think that it will have an effect on the policy itself that is the very fact that it's come to the to the court may have an effect on Israel and on other countries putting pressure on it so it seems to me by large a rather positive step when you say it would have it will have an effect on the Pol policy itself just expand on that what do you mean by that well look I mean if the if the um International court of justice uh rules that it is genocide it it and and and uh offers any measures then that would have to go to the security Council and in the security Council uh this would have to be debated that is this would become an international issue uh so that would put pressure on the United States to clarify its position and thereby would put pressure on Israel either to modify its policies or to what I'm hoping to actually begin talking about what is the next phase once the fighting ends hopefully as soon as possible what would be the next phase so in that sense it just could greatly increase pressure to change the course of things as they are happening right now well you just mentioned there that you hope the fighting will end um as soon as possible and there are many people who share that um uh who share that hope but we've just been hearing from the Israeli Prime Minister within the last hour he's given a televised speech in which he says that um uh the war will go on will likely go on for many months until until Israel in his eyes achieves um Victory so there doesn't seem seem to be much of a a sentiment inside Israel uh for now for either wanting to to bring this war to a hold or to to um bring it to another phase as it were well I mean if if you follow the debate going on in Israel now there's a little bit of uh double talk there and that has to do not only with pressure from the United States but also with the sense that the way operations are happening in Gaza from the point of view of the Israeli military right now uh is not very good the IDF is sustaining um uh daily losses and has not accomplished its two main goals which was to remove Hamas and to free the hostages uh and so it seems to me that as part of uh what netan is trying to suggest and the chief of staff said similarly a couple of days ago is to move on to what they call phase three which would actually be to reduce the number of troops on the ground and then to try and have more targeted operations directly aimed at the Hamas leaders as well as um freeing the hostages whether they can succeed in doing that or not is unclear but if they removed um the large numbers of troops that are on the ground there they may actually reduce the number of Israeli casualties uh please the Americans at least partially and maybe actually have a more effective operation on the ground than simply bombing um civilian centers without any um clear U military advantage to that oh we'll leave it there for now om bartov appreciate your time and I did mistakenly uh say that you were joining us from Cambridge in the UK uh you are of course joining us from Cambridge Massachusetts in the US so apologies for that thank you
