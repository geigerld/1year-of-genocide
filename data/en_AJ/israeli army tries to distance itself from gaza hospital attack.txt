the Israeli Prime Minister has denied Israel was involved in the bombardment of the hospital in Gaza City in a social media post on X formerly known as Twitter Benjamin Netanyahu says the entire world should know it was barbaric terrorists in Gaza that attacked the hospital in Gaza and not the IDF those who brutally murdered our children also murder their own children let's speak now to Sarah hyet she joins us from occupied East Jerusalem so Sarah Israel's staunchly denying responsibility for this Hospital attack what's the latest you've been hearing from them yes and just a few minutes ago they released a video that's the Israeli Army releasing a video to as proof they said that um this wasn't to do had nothing to do with them of course they've been blaming Islamic Jihad for that uh uh rocket that hit the hospital but before that as soon as it happened there was a flurry of messages on social media uh wrong dates that were used uh um disinformation tweets that were deleted including I'll read a few of those out to you you had um the prime minister of Israel uh Twitter account saying this is a struggle between the children of light and the children of Darkness between humanity and the law of the Jungle of course that was soon deleted um you also had a Facebook uh uh State uh post that was put up by the Army saying due to the lack of medical equipment and lack of medical staff it was decided to bomb the Baptist Hospital in Gaza and give them euthanasia death and then that was deleted um other posts there was a video they had posted which seemed to have a wrong date so a lot of disinformation and it's been really interesting also following a lot of the Israeli media and the narrative that they've been putting out in terms of what's happening in Gaza we're not really actually seeing much of the videos out there we're seeing a lot of statements of course and uh videos from that Hamas initial Hamas attack on on Israelis but you're seeing a lot more of that side of things uh than what's going on in Gaza of course since that uh attack on the hospital the Islamic Jihad has denied it you also had um the angelical church that owns that building as well as medison Frontier saying the same which is also known as Doctors Without Borders um and this is what we're going to be seeing a lot more that's a different narrative where they're trying to prove that this is nothing to do with them of course this isn't the first time we had one of our own colleagues uh Shireen who was uh killed there's a huge investigation into that they'd initially denied it that happened a couple of years ago the Israelis denied it then they sort of admitted that potentially it could have been uh one of theirs and that of course is still in the courts this isn't the first time we see that kind of disinformation of course today what we're probably going to be seeing is an aggressive campaign to prove that it wasn't them behind this attack okay Sarah many thanks for that Sarah H joining us from occupied East Jerusalem
