well we begin in Gaza where the largest medical facility in the southern city of KH yunes is under siege Israeli snipers have killed at least three people and injured 10 others inside NASA hospital after telling displaced Palestinians Sheltering there to leave when people tried to flee they came under Fire 500 people including patients and medical staff are still believed to be trapped inside while the region of Rafa at the southernmost h of Gaza has become the last refuge for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fleeing Israeli bombs have a look this was rougher during times of relative peace although Israel still bombed the city several times over recent years the UN said it was overcrowded even before this war with a population of 300,000 and this is what parts of Rafa look like now after four months of War around 1.5 million Palestinians are Sheltering here the UN has called it a press pressure cooker of Despair people are now being forced to flee again ahead of a possible Israeli ground offensive well let's go to our correspondent honey mmud he joins us now live from Rafa in southern Gaza hany we know the bombardment has been escalating over the last few days talk us through the situation there on the ground right now yes well the the situations in in Rafa City are getting very very critical at this point with uh much felt of the sense of desperation and depression across the city with people inside uh residential homes uh for Sheltering or inside the the tents that they have set up since they arrived to ra City or simply people who don't have a place and have been spending uh the vast majority of their time in the right on the roads or in the streets of of RA City just giving you a sense of how terrible the situations are getting not only there's an intense bombing campaign going on now and more of the displaced families and and individuals who came to ra were killed here some were seriously injured but the the usual scenes that we of of people queuing in line for some water or for a pack of bread or to get some of the Food Supplies is just uh turned to be the quite the normal daily routine for the thousand thousand literally thousand of people in every corner of rafah City despite the the ongoing talks about a a possible ceasefire deal that could be reached within the coming days with lots of un uncertainty going on the ongoing threats of expanding the military operations just increasing the level of panic and and fear among the the people right here in not only the the displaced families the 1.5 million people have been displaced from their homes in the northern part from Gaza Central area and more recently from Khan Unice where the vast majority of people who fled the horror of the ongoing genocidal War are now in a in the fire line the line in in in in line of fire as the growing threats of expanding the operation in in raah City on top of that when we talk about public facilities particularly healthc care facilities in rafah rafah doesn't have any of the large Health Care Facilities here and uh the vast majority of the small side clinics here are privately on and due to ongoing bombings they're not operational at all so they don't they don't have the capacity accommodate this large number of people let alone providing the necessary medical intervention and a treatment needed for a very traumatized a displaced population you mentioned medical facilities or the lack thereof in Rafa I want to ask you about NASA Hospital honey we know it's been under siege for weeks but it feels like things really intensified there yesterday what's the situation there now do we have an idea of how many people are are trapped inside still yes well nazer hospital within the the past few days it's it's important to mention that this is the 18th day uh that the hospital under aggressive military Siege with the snipers surrounding the hospital uh but the those who remain inside the hospital there 300 medical staff 450 a patients and those who were injured during the war and and the hundreds hundreds of evacuees inside the hospital entire families who uh did not have anywhere to go other than to shelter inside the health uh facilities and as if we speak just within the past hour the isra military started sharply ordering those evacuating inside the hospital including the medical staff and everybody else to start leaving the hospital what they did they destroyed the northern gate of of the hospital block it with a pile of Sands and and rubbles and only the Eastern Gate is now open but there are tanks and armored vehicle station in front of the gate there are face recognition cameras Hightech technology being deployed and installed at the gates at the Eastern Gate of the hospital in which people are ordered to get through it if the for the evacuation and from past experience setting up these face recognition cameras and Hightech equipment for the mass arrest that is going to happen people are told to take a route and go all the way to Gaza European Hospital in Rafa City but the question remain here is this going to be their last stub is this the last place they're going to evacuate to or are they going to be ask one more time from Rafa to go elsewhere honey M there with the latest for us from the ground in Rafa and Southern Gaza thank you hany well let's give you some geographical context the NASA medical complex is in Unice as you can see they're just north of Rafa it's the biggest Hospital in southern Gaza and one of just five hospitals in the strip that is still functioning even so it can only offer basic first aid right now 30 of gaza's hospitals have shut down due to Israeli bombardment and a shortage of the most basic medical supplies well let's bring in G gimt Tomas she is the Doctors Without Borders medical coordinator for Palestine she joins us now from occupied East Jerusalem GED I I understand that you currently have inside NASA hospital what are you hearing from them and how concerned are you for their safety right now yes we still have nurses and one surgeon working inside the hospital um they are facing a very difficult situation now for more than three weeks with a hospital and the CH they are totally scared and Afraid for for the coming hours Gil do you have any idea can they leave right now and if so where would they go what are they being told we know that there are more than 400 patients at least most of them in critical situation in critical conditions and U of course the the the issue is uh is the to be able to provide adequate care for them and now knowing the situation in the hospital with the shortages with the issue of of medical staff uh the the the situation is really critical for these patients and we are very worried about the the future as we've been reporting things feel like they've changed in the last day or so after the hospital still being under siege for weeks can you give us a sense of the Dynamics there that you're hearing from your staff excuse me I didn't get your your question clearly that that the hospital has been surrounded and under siege for weeks and I'm just wondering how things have changed in the last 24 hours or so the last 24 hours have been uh even more um scaring for everybody because uh of uh of the the the the fightings really Clos uh the wanting to to evacuate the the refugees and the the displaced people inside and uh the situation is getting worse and worse inside uh the the the the medical staff uh don't know what to do and that's uh that's really uh really a big issue for for our staff but for all the the medical staff inside we've obviously been hearing about Israeli sniper fire in and around that medical facility how much Faith do you as an organization have in Israeli guarantees of safety actually uh it's it's a difficult question they they are seeing that the he facilities are not targeted uh itself but the situation we are we have seen since the beginning of the war uh is is quite different quite different and we have seen that chifa hospital ala hospital um alal Hospital recently have been raided by by Israeli forces so um it's a bit difficult to to be really um to to be I mean we have we have a lot of concern about the situation there because the guarantee are quite weak Gil talk us through the situation right now in NASA when it comes to supplies we know a a little girl who is 10 years old died in the last couple of days because the generators had to stop what's happening now uh what we know is that the situation for all the patients are is is really critical uh there are patients in ICU so depending the their life are really depending on the fuel the equipment the medical equipment and that's the case for for many patients of course the the the facility itself is not able to take care of the patients the atis are not working the the patient can't receive uh the the medication so uh this can lead to a critical situation where many people can die your organization Doctors Without Borders is is working across the strip can you give us a sense of the state of other medical facilities in Gaza right now obviously we know very few of them are actually still functioning this is a this is a huge concern now the only remaining hospital is the European Gaza Hospital which is already full uh it is the only one able to uh to endle with critical patients uh the only remaining facilities are partially functioning so that means they are not able to treat properly the patient and and this is the case in all Gaza Strip where 2.5 million people are leaving so this population is is totally uh alone and not able to receive any uh any care that they they they they should receive and the need are huge the needs are really important because they are living in dire conditions for more than four months now and and the situation is just getting worse and worse The Doctors Without Borders medical coordinator for Palestine thank you so much for joining us on Al jaaz gilet and we wish you and and the rest of your staff all the best with your work
