meanwhile the United Nations has released a report condemning the worsening human rights situation in the occupied West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem it says Palestinians are trapped in a cycle of fear facing the Relentless force of the Israeli Army as well as violence from settlers according to the report between October the 7th and December 27 nearly 300 Palestinians were killed primarily due to Israeli military operations and raids on refugee camp camps 492 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces this year that's the highest since the UN started recording such deaths 18 years ago more than 4,780 Palestinians have been detained the UN says they're subjected to torture and violence in Israeli jails there's been a further increase in settler violence since October the 7th with 1,28 people forcibly displaced during 366 seven settler attacks eight Palestinians were killed during these attacks the UN is calling on Israel to abide by international law stop all violence against Palestinians and thoroughly investigate these incidents use of military tactics and weapons in law enforcement contexts and the use of unnecessary or disproportionate Force by the Israeli security forces are extremely troubling dehumanization of Palestinians that characterizes many of the Settler's actions is very disturbing and must cease immediately I call on Israel to take immediate clear and effective steps to put an end to settler violence against the Palestinian population to investigate all incidents of of Violence by settlers and Israeli Security Forces well Ajit tungi is the head of the United Nations human rights office in the occupied Palestinian territory he joins us now live from New York good to have you with us so first of all take us through some of your findings there and particularly about what you've documented in terms of unlawful killings by Israeli forces thank you thanks for having me um the the main purpose of this report was to draw the attention to what was happening in West Bank um particularly from the 7th of October until yesterday what we noticed is a market increase of violation of human rights of Palestinians by the Israeli Security Forces um um and then also attacks by Israeli settlers um you are accurate in describing that Force has been used in an excessive manner um and in many cases uh unnecessary and disproportionate Force which has um ended up with hundreds of Palestinians being killed to be accurate about 500 this year highest number um since we recorded uh since we started recording um in the opt your report also references torture of prisoners take us through how widespread that's become since October the 7th um there are about 4,7 um odd people who have been detained 2,000 plus since the 7th of October um access to them has not been easy however some of them have been released we have had an opportunity to speak to them and also gather information from a number of other sources what from what we have been hearing is the ill treatment and very horrible situation in detention centers and also in some cases um you know uh acts that would amount to torture um what about settlers what role is settle violence playing in the displacement of Palestinian communities according to your report for settler violence has been a major cause of problem uh for years now settlements have been expanding um there are over 7 thou 700,000 settlers in the West Bank including East Jerusalem um as settlers get closer and closer to the Palestinian community at this point in time they're all over in West Bank tensions increase Israel settlers attack Hing communities of Palestinians what we've seen this year particularly after the uh 7th of October is an embold of settlers for different reasons and they have started attacking not in one or two um One One cases but in groups we have seen earlier this year in haara we've seen similar such cordinated settler attacks on the Palestinian community and herders and many others um in this cohesive environment have decided to move away from uh places where they have been living for years and what caught my attention is is when reading your report and you talk about this Rising wave of settler violence but the report talks about new restrictions on movement being placed on Palestinians right that is correct um the rise in in settler violence is also related to lack of accountability I think that's extremely important to underscore um where there is impunity VI will continue to happen and that's what we've noticed and we've been saying this for years now that accountability is important the next point that you made about movement restrictions is also extremely worrying and this is particularly for the Palestinians like we have mentioned in the report these restrictions are discriminatory it prevents Palestinians from moving from town to town we have heard this from number of sources we've also seen our teams have gone out it massively impacts the community but also businesses and their day-to-day life schools U and other activities and this has been a major concern for us and we've also underscore this is not what we have seen in the past there's a lot more of restrictions whether through Earth moles checkpoints um large obstacles Etc are you concerned that statements by some Israeli officials may actually be be playing into this Rising wave of settler violence you mentioned a moment ago the problems in haa and of course Israeli officials like bezel smotrich have been quoted as calling for haa to be wiped off the map indeed you know the High Commissioner for human rights W Kad du has issued many statements in the past alerting to such statement made made by people in power in government in Israel these statements embolden settlers they give them a sense of security it gives them a certain kind of permission to do what they want to do it is impossible not to relate these things and say there is a market increase because there is some kind of an embolden and this is exactly what I was trying to allude earlier that such statements from people in power actually further encourage us settlers to to attack on Palestine Palestinians thank you very much for sharing your your report there and more details of it a sunay thank you
