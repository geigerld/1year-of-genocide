let me take you to the general assembly emergency special session at the United Nations on the protection of the Palestinian civilian population these are live pictures from the United Nations this is the ambassador to the UN the uh for Palestine let's listen in Mr President colleagues let us all remember we are meeting here while Palestinians in Gaza are under the bombs remember that you are speaking while families are being killed while hospitals are coming to a Hal while neighborhoods are being destroyed while people are fleeing from one place to another with nowhere safe to go I urge you to choose use your words carefully and to act accordingly for all those mobilized against an even greater man-made humanitarian catastrophe or of a regional spell over and these are worthy goals we say stop the bombs or both will happen stop the bombs and save lives as the president of the general assembly has indicated all lives lives of children of civilians of 2.3 million civilians in the Gaza Strip Mr President in Gaza a father tells his daughter about the birthday he was planning for her and asks her not to miss it a mother laments my children died before they had a chance to eat the thoughts that cross the mind of a mother in the face of such grief 3,000 children in Gaza were killed by Israel in the last almost three weeks I repeat 3,000 children innocent children Angels killed in Gaza during the last 3 weeks a man Embraces his mother and pleads like a child come back I beg you come back and I will take you wherever you want he hugs her and can let go but there is no time to mourn more death is on the way 1,700 women were killed by Israel in the last two weeks a young man wrote We will not leave Gaza we will only leave Gaza to join the heavens a few days later he did 7,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel in the last Almost 3 weeks 70% of all those killed are wom and children almost all killed our civilians is this the war some of you are defending let me repeat is this the war that some of you are defending can this war be defended these are crimes this is barbarism if you don't if you do not stop it for all those who were killed stop it for all those whose lives we can still save Janan a little girl under the rubbles shouts at the people coming to rescue her what took you so long there are 900 Palestinian childr under the rebels alive or dead wondering what is taking so long wondering if any help is is on the way anas a little boy who is known as anus crawled from under the rubs not to find light but more darkness devastations and death all around him his ordeal has only started not ended 1,600 Palestinians are under the rubbles and no one can reach them to save them or bury them a doctor speaks of a term coined during this war wounded child with no surviving family 80 Palestinian families have lost 10 or more of their members sometimes up to 45 members of the same family were killed 18,000 people are wounded many treated in hospital hallways if at all with no anesthesia paramedics who have been who have seen death time and time again break down and cry this time is just too un staff humanitarian personnel and doctors are standing their ground and paying the ultimate price for it this memory is honored by some as if a natural disaster had killed them not a UN member staff as hospitals turn into Mor doctors and patients alike wonder is help on the way is help in the way they are not listening to the explanations of some leaders on why the war has to go on they just hear the bombs they just feel the blast they just face all this death trying to survive or to honor the pledge they took to save lives with no means to do so people are ordered to evacuate they look at their children should we head south will we be bombed on the way or once there should we go to a hospital Courtyard a un School a church a mosque sleep in our car in the streets but bombs are everywhere what choices do you make as a parent when there are only impossible choices when death is everywhere devastations is is everywhere a man stands in front of his house turned into Rubble yet another time after a long pause he asks how do you bury a house Israel has destroyed over 40% of all homes making an entire population homeless and displaced 1.4 million people in the hope to forcibly transfer them outside the territory the Israeli foreign minister came to the security Council and said this meeting should conclude with a clear message bring them home for millions of Palestinians there is no home to go back to for thousands there is no family left embrace not by an act of God but by the acts of a government represented here in this chamber he spoke of families and their pain there's not a single family in Gaza that has not endured epic suffering he told you horrible it was to kill civilians just before justifying the killing of Palestinian civilians by the thousands he spoke of the fear felt by people when Rockets are launched Israeli bombs have not spared a single square meter of Gaza he believes the difference between civilization and barbarism is who is doing the killing or how they do it he believes the laws of humanity and of our International law-based order apply to others but not Israel that they protect Israeli lives and allow the killing of Palestinians and taking Palestinian lives he believes Israel can pretend it it is abiding by the very laws it is breaching live on your TV screens and before your eyes that if you say Hamas enough times the world will not be able to object to wiping off the face from the face of Earth entire families four generations at a time or to a Siege where you let in enough humanitarian Aid to pretend you have a sense of humanity but nowhere enough to address the immense needs that are grow growing exponentially as you keep bombing a besieged territory he says release the hostages and takes 2 million Palestinian hostages let me translate these numbers compared to the population of Gaza this is the equivalent of 28,000 Israelis killed including 12,000 children and 6,800 wom 72,000 wounded 5.6 million displaced is it more shocking now more unacceptable more outrageous why some feel so much pain for Israelis and so little pain for us the Palestinians what is the problem do we have the wrong Faith the the wrong skin color the wrong nationality the wrong origin let me address all those who have in these past few days explained why one should not call for a ceasefire how can representatives of States explain how horrible it is that 1,000 Israelis were killed and can not feel the same outrage when 1,000 Palestinians are now killed every day 1,000 Palestinians killed every day why not feel a sense of urgency to end their killing nothing can justify war crimes crime against humanity and genocide nothing can justify The Kill of a single Palestinian child nothing nothing at all why not feel a sense of urgency to end our killing nothing can as I said justify war crimes you are sitting us back 80 years by trying to justify what Israel is doing now how naive one has to be or how hypocritical to pretend they don't know Israel is Vol voluntarily killing Palestinian civilians who can believe that those killed by Israel are for 70% children and women and that entire families were killed while Israel is trying to minimize civilian death they kill all of us they kill thousands of us and they say they are trying to minimize killing civilians how would it look like if they were trying to maximize killing Palestinian civilians if killing 7,000 is to minimize killing 700,000 would be possible to maximize we don't need you to offer us semantic reassurances about IHL and protection of civilians we need you to honor these Norms honor these Norms not recall them only to justify their breach seconds later this selective outrage is outrageous and needs to stop and need to stop now these people you watch in your screens for a few minutes a day every night while they are being slaughtered they have survived Decades of military occupation a 16 years long blockade and five wars in the Gaza Strip they built and rebuilt and rebuilt their lives and their homes again and again Against All Odds despite tremendous suffering they are walking Miracles how could you leave them to be killed once again the answer to the killing of Palestinian civilians is not the killing of Israeli civilians and the answer to the killing of Israeli civilians Is Not the Killing of Palestinian civilians vengeance is a dead end the only path forward is Justice the only path forward is justice justice for the Palestinian people don't distort the law don't bend it don't break it don't betray it to accommodate Israel uphold it and uphold it high this is what we are here for as a United Nations to save future Generations from the scor of War uphold it for the sake of all Nations for The credibility of these United Nations Mr President was reporting on the massacres in Gaza for those of you who do not who is D he is the field correspondent of Al jazer in the Gaza Strip as he's been doing relentlessly for days now when he received the news of an Israeli air strike that killed his wife his son and his daughter he he did something many parents do in these circum cumstances he spoke to his son waiting for an answer that never came he told him didn't you tell me you wanted to be a journalist his son wanted to be a journalist even though journalists are Targets in Palestine remember Sharina now the dream of the son will HT father W said a few words that I want you to hear well he said they took their Vengeance out on our children he then said in a heartbreaking voice malish allow me to explain explain it to you literally it means that's okay but let me tell you what I believe he meant let me do it in Arabic shame on this reality where Gaza is being slaughtered again shame to on those who do not have respect to our Humanity our dignity our suffering shame on those who justify the acts of the criminal all those who stand by the predator or just or give condolence to the victim explaining that the Killer is not responsible shame on those who abandoned our people as we are reallying under these massacres shame if a word of Truth is not uttered shame if I leave the field to rather than defending our people
