the UN a chief Martin Griffith is right now briefing the UN Security Council via video link let's have a listen but it also now deprives Gaza of a facility that cared for more than 45,000 patients a year before the current hostilities so I am compelled to reiterate and this will not surprise anybody as everyone else has done on many occasions in this Council that under International humanitarian law there are simple requirements there are simple rules of War which are applied to all of us whatever the provocation and God knows there has been provocation parties to arm conflict must protect civilians and civilian objects take constant care to spare them from any attack we have discussed this in almost every other conflict in this chamber around the world this one is no different international law affords specific protection to medical personnel and Facilities to ensure the wounded and sick receive the medical care they need it was no coincidence that one of the first humanitarian leaders on the scene after those events of the 7th of October was our dear friend and leader Dr Tedros of wh it's imperative that the wounded and sick receive the medical care they need it is imperative that the parties respect their obligations under the inter under International humanitarian law and it is our Collective responsibility we are all involved in this we're not Observers we are all involved in using all our influence to ensure that this is the case this tragedy is characteristic of the crushing impact this conflict has had on civilians and as Tor has been pointing out and Lana earlier the catastrophic consequences it will have if it continues to escalate as we fear in just 11 days since that storming of Israel by Palestinian armed groups on 7th of October the death toll as has been mentioned has already exceeded that of the 2014 hostilities which lasted more than seven weeks the pace of death of suffering of destruction of breaches of international law cannot be exaggerated in Gaza more than 3,000 people have been killed more than 12 a half thousand injured hundreds are unaccounted for under the rubble and quite frankly we do not know how many have moved from the north to the South to get out of Harm's Way the death toll also we all know this well includes humanitarians I want to pay tribute to the 15 UNR staff and Red Cross and rent present Personnel that I've been meeting these days families of those who have fallen we estimate that may be up to a million people have fled their homes to other parts of Gaza but we don't really know uh many have done so in response indeed to Israel announcement that civilians should leave Northern Gaza for safety but there is simply nowhere to go for civilians to escape the destruction and privation both of which grow by the hour as missiles continue to fly and essential supplies including F fuel food medical items water run low due to the scarcity of water anra in some locations and I want to pay a special tribute to anra but the way in which has provided a buffer against suffering in these terrible times and in anra in some locations is being forced to ration down to providing one liter of water per person per day bear in mind that the minimum by International standards should be 15 lers and they're getting one and they're the lucky ones people have been increasingly forced to consume from unsafe sources we're hearing many many more reports of that through anra and other agencies placing the population at risk of course of the outbreak of waterborne diseases and whether civilians move or stay and that must be their decision whether to move or stay whether to move again or stay where they have moved to whether they move or stay they must be protected they must not be attacked in places of Civilian infrastructures they must be protected in places of deconfliction and they must have access to the essentials of humanitarian assistance to survive which are available and in which we have all spent many many detailed hours in detailed negotiations with the parties and I'm grateful to them to all of them for the commitment that they have shown to these negotiations it means that the UN and the humanitarian partners and I specifically refer to the great leadership shown and I met their leaders today of the Egyptian red cresant and the Palestinian red cresant must be able to relief deliver excuse me to deliver relief to civilians in need throughout Gaza without impediment in places of their choice in places where they consider safe themselves to be safe and where we can seek to ensure that safety we have humanitarian supplies we have medical teams anra has a staff of 14,000 in Gaza still bravely working under these conditions the other agencies do the red crants of course have many many many volunteers and they are all ready to assist the people most in need I'm very grateful to many member states for providing very quickly emergency funding for available for the immediate relief in Gaza including from the central emergency response fund that my office runs and the occupied territories humanitarian fund thank you thank you to all of you who stepped up so quickly what we don't have however we have a lot but what we don't have and it's the killer what we desperately need is immediate safe human Arian access across all of Gaza and that is the burden of our discussions with key parties we urgently need a mechanism agreed by all relevant parties to allow for the regular provision of emergency needs throughout Gaza to get the level of distribution of assistance up to what it was before these terrible weeks of 100 trucks a day providing assistance throughout Gaza to people in need we need to get back to that level of ambition for that we need additional funding agencies like onra world food program and of course for the red crants in their leadership role and without new funding unra already painfully woefully lacking in funds will not have the ability to continue to deliver crosses but as Mr President has t said and I'm glad he did and he made two I think very important points Gaza is not the only location of concern in this deeply troubling conflict since the start of the latest hostilities situation in the West Bank has also been deteriorating as TR said and he should know last week was the deadliest week for Palestinians in the West Bank since the United Nations started recording fatalities in 2005 while settler violence incidents also have gone up from an average of three incidents day to eight suffering knows no borders widespread closures throughout the West Bank are impacting the ability of communities to access essential services is and there is a real risk of the situation expiring out of control but the people of Israel Palestine the region need what we all need what this council's mandate is in existence to secure is the sanity and humanitarian to Prevail drawing on the provisions of international humanitarian law for Urgent efforts this was toward the second point to arrest any further descent in this brutal Calamity Lana said it very eloquently the worry that I suppose many of us have where will this lead us where will this lead us when the fighting has taken place of course we implore the parties to respect International humanitarian law and by the way I want to be very clear the humanitarian ceasefire would go a long way to easing the Epic human suffering finally Mr President I know I've gone on too long I want to conclude by expressing my deepest admiration gratitude and commedy for the extraordinary people who are delivering life saving and humanitarian Services well you've been listening there to the UN a chief Martin Griffith briefing the UN Security Council via video link emphasizing the urgency of addressing the humanitarian situation in Gaza let's bring in Tark bonei he's the president of al-shabaka an independent Palestinian Think Tank and also the author of the book Hamas contained he joins me now live from New York tar Israel says that its bombardment of Gaza is in retaliation for hamas's attacks that it's striking Hamas military targets what do you make of what they've hit so far well what we've seen is really a continuation of Israeli uh tactics that it's used in past military assaults on the Gaza Strip which includes targeting civilian areas and targeting ambulances as well as Health Care Centers I think it's very clear for everyone who's looking at this that this isn't about retaliation against Hamas what's in place now is a much broader program that's focused on ethnic cleansing we saw in the first few days of the assault that began about 5 days ago now there was discussion about a security Corridor or humanitarian Corridor that would allow Palestinians to get out of the Gaza STP into Egypt Palestinians understand what that Corridor means this isn't about humanitarianism this is about ethnic cleansing and the depopulation of the Gaza Strip and so rightly a lot of Palestinians are worried about Mass displacement which has already affected more than a million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and what we're witnessing is T hearing those concerns from the Egyptian and Jordanian governments as well I just want to pick up on a word you use there cleansing Israel has has said that it won't stop until Hamas is completely removed and Hamas is not only an armed group right it's also regarded by many as a social movement of sorts can you remove Hamas from the Gaza Strip well I think that's exactly the question that we need to be asking I think the idea that Hamas can be destroyed or removed is nonsensical not only is the movement as you say not only a military organization but also a movement that provides Social Services Healthcare education uh charitable work to Palestinians in Gaza and Beyond Gaza but it's also an ideology hamas's ideology is one that's committed to resistance to liberate Palestine so this idea that Israel is an aparted regime and employs Colonial violence against Palestinians and that it can continue to do that with impunity is one that hamas's political project and military military project opposes and if Hamas in in this imaginary world where Hamas is decimated and destroyed that ideology of Palestinian liberation of pushing back against Israeli aparted will continue in a different guise so this idea that they're trying to uh kill Hamas is really a way of saying we don't want to deal with Palestinians we want to decimate the Palestinian political project and forgo any need to deal with the Palestinian political demands which are rights under inali are inali rights under international law including the right of return well Israel has not been drawing a distinction between the Palestinian resident of Gaza and Hamas how much popular support does Hamas have now tar and and what is its relationship like with the Palestinian leadership at this stage well I think it's important to remember that Hamas was a party that was politic democratically elected in 2006 so there is obviously a lot of support for hamas's political project among Palestinians some of that support comes from a place of ideology so Palestinians identify with hamas's ideological platform but Hamas also gets a lot of support from Palestinians for its military project uh as a military power Hamas is able to deter Israeli aggression and be the Frontline of defense for Palestinians who are otherwise defens defenseless when they're facing Colonial violence and so Hamas in this way is seen to be an important deterrent uh for for Palestinians and one that can can protect Palestinian civilians now obviously this is the Palestinian Liberation project is much bigger than Hamas Hamas doesn't speak on behalf of of all Palestinians but it is certainly a credible power now the Palestinian Authority as one of your correspondents was saying before has its own baggage in the in the West Bank it's engaged in security coordination tactics and at the time of War when Palestinians are being bombarded ceaselessly in the Gaza Strip it's coming out to prevent protests in the West Bank in support of Palestinians so that is something that is seen as illegitimate and many Palestinians opposed and we've seen a lot of of anger and a lot of heighten tensions as a result of that TK bonei there the president of Al shaca an independent Palestinian think tank and the author of the book Hamas contained thank you so much for joining us and sharing your thoughts on Al jaer T thank you
