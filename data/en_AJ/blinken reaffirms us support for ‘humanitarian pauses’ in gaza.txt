US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has been meeting foreign ministers from several Arab countries in the Jordanian Capital Aman to discuss the war blinkin reaffirmed us support for humanitarian pauses in the fighting to ensure the Palestinians in Gaza get humanitarian aid but he also said that the US does not back calls for a ceasefire Alan Fischer has more from occupied East Jerusalem it was a warm welcome for Anthony blinkin and a man but the cold reality is Arab countries see the US position supporting Israel is unsustainable the number of dead and injured in Gaza is growing our by Bloody hour the damage to homes hospitals and Roads changing the face of a place no one can escape Jordan's foreign minister was blunt with his message the priority now is to ending this War uh to saving innocent lives to preventing further destruction to restoring hope and to stopping the very dangerous dehumanization all lives matter to all of us and uh Mr secretary dear Tony the US has a leading role to play in these efforts and on it and on all of us uh fall the very heavy responsibility of ending this catastrophe achieving the just peace that is the right of uh every Palestinian every Israeli mother child father and that will ensure that none of them or any other in the region will ever have to live the horrors that this vicious cycle of violence and war is bringing Anthony blinkin repeated his calls for humanitarian pauses in the fighting a call rejected for now by Israel and said there had to be a new reality in Gaza in the future none of us are under the illusion that this will be easy particularly our partners from Egypt and Jordan who have for decades worked to facil facilitate a real peace but it's precisely now when the stakes are highest and even when the Outlook seems darkest that we have to intensify our work to meet this moment Anthony blinkin said it was important Israel conducted the war within International rules and laws too late said Egypt's foreign minister the unfortunate killing events in cannot be justified we would not accept to go into an argument or accept the justification of these practices as considered against the or right to self-defense the collective uh punishment Israel targeting innocent civilians and Facilities medical cilities paramedics in addition to trying to for for migration for Palestinians to re the their lands the US Secretary of State is now on his way to Tura when news of his visit spark protests Anthony blinkin knew the sort of reception he would get when he went to a man he will leave knowing that the Arabs are angry the United States is not doing more to stop the killing in Gaza Alan Fischer Al jaaz in occupied East Jerusalem Maran Bashar is aljaz senior political analyst Maran I I want to put to you another line that uh stood out for me of what Anthony blinkin said uh and he the reason it stood out is because he had the exact same line yesterday when he was in Israel almost word for word and this was about how he feels when he sees Palestinian suffering he says I look into the eyes of the Palestinian children through my TV who are being pulled out of the rubble and my heartbreaks and when I look at their eyes I see my own children right he had almost word for word the same thing today and yesterday so clearly this is something that this is a little bit of a setpiece for him something that's a little bit rehearsed and a message that he wants to put out there um the us trying to move the needle a little bit from what they the messaging they were they had at the very beginning of this war where their heart broke for Israel and they said so publicly very emotionally both the US president and blinkin um and now they're saying oh by the way we we are also we also feel for Palestinian children so since this is an official message now of us diplomacy my question is just how do you think that message is landing yeah that's actually a very good question because regardless of its sincerity um I think uh in much of the region there will be skepticism um once and again American officials are speaking out of both sides of their mouths while on the one hand they are expressing sorrow and empathy for the killing of the Palestinians Palestinian children but at the same time they are giving green light they are giving arms they are giv giving technical knowhow to the Israeli Army to carry out the slaughter Slaughter not just killing because we're talking about thousands of children killed women men and so on so forth in Gaza the decimation of Gaza is happening as we speak so the idea that uh the American uh officials want to tell the Arab world that they have big heart is not convincing much of the Arab Street much of I think the International Community looks uh with awe and shock at the images coming out of Gaza this could no longer be hidden it happens in plain sight I don't want to be humorous uh about this but I'm reminded of this little um anecdote of a person taking a little dog on a plane and asked by the hostess to take it off and says I don't have a dog and the dog starts barking and the man says you you believe me or you believe the dog the dog is barking people are getting killed it doesn't matter what secretary blinkin says he can say and express all the feelings that he might have sincere or otherwise in the end of the day The Barking is happening the Cries From Gaza we can all hear it and the cries of women the cries of Orphans we heard from doctors today that there's a new category in collateral damage and that is surviving children not knowing or knowing that their parents do no longer exist so this is a new category of children countless children being pulled out of the ruins of of of demolished buildings bombed by Israel that they actually if they survive they will be orphans this is the reality in Gaza so the Secretary of State could in all Earnest Express that kind of a thing but the way it sounds sounds like humbug humbug humbug so in that case where do you think I know it's hard to guess of course but where do you think us diplomacies goes next because blinkin it's his fourth time uh in Israel blinkin is calling repeatedly for short pauses what you call humanitarian pauses in the fighting Israel has said no um he's calling for more Aid who knows whether there will be more Aid going into the strip but everybody says for the moment what's going in there is deeply insufficient uh he's calling for Israel to respect international law we've had countless guests analysts lawyers Etc who tell us day after day that we're probably looking at a number of war crimes being committed in Gaza it's hard to think that us diplomacy can be satisfied with the results or absence of results that they're getting you you are right um the problem is that from day one since October 7 uh America looked at the situation and decided that it's going to uh marry into Israel and its war crimes in Gaza basically President Biden said and I'm using the words go get Justice get Justice in other words what Israel has been doing for the past four weeks is not a war of self-defense it's a war of self Revenge it's a war of Revenge that's happening in Gaza it's almost uh medieval even pre Biblical times in the sense of what we heard from prime minister Netanyahu when he said this is like us with the amalik during Biblical times yeah he framed everything in in Israeli scripture and that that very particular scripture that very particular biblical t uh uh citation as it's been you know unraveled in plain sight he's talking about Israel killing men women children babies and animals that's what that scripture said but that's what all times right there was no international law at the time there was no first world war second world war there was no Holocaust at that time so the for the prime minister of Israel to be basically boasting about genocide killing men women and children and babies and their animals and for the American president and his administration to marry into that to embrace it to finance it to arm it to help it to help execute it it's not it's not easy to walk to walk back that kind of a policy and hence four week into the Israeli war crimes in Gaza and despite the Arab anger everywhere the American Administration continue to defend that position as we've seen am now look what's important secretary blinkin was confronted by two foreign ministers who are probably Jordan and Egypt Jordan and Egypt probably the closest the most friendlier foreign ministers in the world certainly in the region to the United States these two countries are dependent on the United States they are friendly to the United States they cooperate they're even complicit with the United States on a number of things right so America will never find two friendlier regimes and yet the two foreign ministers told secretary blinkin your line defense is I can't say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's humbug your line of defense is not acceptable This Is War this is not a self-defense it must stop you secretary blinton need to call for a ceasefire because we your friendly neighbors your friendly Ally cannot continue with the same as usual while Palestinian women and children are being slaughtered um I Duty bound and obligated to apologize to our viewers for one of the words that you used but other than that I'm not going to repeat it but uh but uh but other than that uh to totally understand the the analysis and and the point Marwan bishar aljaz senior political analyst thank you so much
