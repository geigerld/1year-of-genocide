Rafa in southern Gaza the last refuge for 1.5 million Palestinians Sheltering in fear of an Israeli ground Invasion the US and European allies are all opposed so will Israel push ahead regardless what will be the consequences this is Inside Story [Music] hello again I'm James Bay rarely is their Unity among Israel's opponents and allies but that's the case regarding opposition to prime minister Benjamin netanyahu's plans to invade the city of Rafa in Gaza after more than 6 months of brutal War 1.5 million people are living in dire conditions at the southern end of the strip most have been forced there by Israeli attacks which continue on what's meant to be a place of Refuge yet despite worldwide opposition from Israel's allies its opponents and the United Nations Netanyahu says the battle plans for a major ground defensive in Rafa have been drawn up with a date already set so will he go ahead what will be the political implications of Israel going against the advice of the US its main backer and supplier of weapons and for Palestinians could this be the worst scenario yet a looming catastrophe after a catalog of horror we'll discuss all of this with our panel of guests in a moment but first this report from Finton Monahan most of gaza's population is crammed into the southern city of Rafa they live under constant Israeli bombardment the latest waves of attacks have killed dozens of people but as the Israeli Army prepares for a major ground offensive many fear things are about to get a lot worse we are definitely terrified whoever say he isn't afraid is lying there is nowhere for us to go we are scared if an invasion takes place in Rafa where can we go we are more than 20 people I really dream about going back to my home I wish I can go back to my apartment even if it is Rubble now Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says an attack on Rafa is essential to achieve his War aim of destroying Hamas he says nothing will prevent it from going ahead we will complete the elimination of the Hamas battalions including in Rafa there is no force in the world that will stop us but 1.5 million displaced Palestinians are taking Refuge there they have nowhere else to go and the UN is warning that a ground assault would result in major civilian casualties a ground intervention in Gaza in Rafa with the characteristics that we all know would be a humanitarian catastrophe and so I believe this is time to make sure that what we have been said saying since the beginning a humanitarian ceasefire takes place even the US Israel's stest Ally has urged it not to go ahead with the offensive in the first instance it's imperative that people uh are able to get out of the way of uh uh of any conflict uh and doing that getting people out of Harm's Way is a Monumental task uh for which we've yet to see a plan and not only getting them out of Harm's Way making sure that they can be supported with Arian assistance the Israeli government finalized its plans in March but still hasn't ordered the attack in the meantime the bombing continues and all the people of Rafa can do is wait and hope to survive Vinton Monahan Al jazer for Inside Story well now let's discuss this with our guest today kude jeil is in De AB balad in central Gaza she's an economic Justice officer at Oxfam whose special izes in supporting women-led businesses and youth entrepreneurship in Durham in the UK Robert gist pinfold a lecturer in peace and security at Durham University his research focuses on Israeli foreign and security policy and Hisham Mahana is actually in the city of Rafa he's the spokesman in Gaza for the international Committee of the Red Cross glad to have you all uh with us so let me start with you Hisham you are there in Rafa um and your organization is the Guardians of the rules of war the the Geneva Convention so tell me what does international humanitarian law say about the possibility of a large scale military offensive in a place that's so packed with people hello James and thank you for having me the rules of War are very clear civilian lives and infrastructure must be protected no matter what happens and from what we have been witnessing in Rafa with the large waves of displacement that have been ongoing for months and many families have been on the move and been displaced for an average of five times per family now they fac the emminent um um reality of uh a military operation Rafa and the icrc the international Committee of the Red Cross have warned um the International Community and parts of the conflict that any possible scenario of a massive military operation in raah given the situation of the densely populated areas here it will be nothing but Carnage and just to be clear for us what is the noise that we're hearing above you I'm assuming that's a drone that is correct this is uh what people in in Rafa and different areas across the Gaza Strip hear most of the day cude tell us more about the the life of ordinary people in Rafa and elsewhere in Gaza um you represent Oxfam but I know you are a mother of a young child yourself how difficult is things right now uh thank you for hosting me today and for this program and thank you for always giving attention to Gaza because eyes should always be on Kaza situation is really devastating the humanitarian situation is still very difficult no enough Aid enter Gaza uh despite the international called from the organizations and humanitarian organization to kill up Aid that ENT Gaza tell the situation is very devastating uh everyone here is afraid of of any expected military operation in Rafa because this for sure will put the humanitarian situation in a more difficult situation Rafa is very crowded of civilians Rafa is really crowded of tents of makeshift camps where people are trying to find safe shelter there so any military offensive on RAF will really uh make things more difficult we don't expect to to have a real uh actually evacuation of civilians from from RAF but what we really expect that the humanitarian situation will get more difficult because we expect uh closure of Border uh and we only have one line open which is RA Crossing border and despite this the aid that enter Gaza is not enough is not enough to respond to the needs of those interally displaced uh PE people and persons here in G strip and for sure as a mom uh on my personal level it's really hard whenever we hear about any expected military operations in any area not only ra but also in medal area or any area in the Gaza STP it's always put us in a situation where we cannot really find any safety anywhere Robert is it a case of if there is a Rafer offensive or when there is a raffer offensive because prime minister Netanyahu still talking about total Victory he says a date's already been set although he hasn't told us what it is of course well this is the question on everyone's Minds Netanyahu himself has been talking about raafa offensive for a very very long time now and nothing is material realized had you asked me this a week and a half or two weeks ago I would have said to you that this is all basically a bluff that Netanyahu is trying to use this as talk as leverage in the talks uh in uh Kata to try and basically reach an agreement with Hamas that would see The Return of hostages and some kind of a temporary or lasting ceasefire now um the exchange between Israel and Iran that took place subsequently is a gamech changer and leaves this an open question why well because netanyahu's retaliation Israel's retali retaliation against that Iranian attack um was relatively light basically one anti-aircraft um defense system was destroyed from what we can tell so far that was basically um it didn't reach a threshold to isolate Israel from its International Partners who've been arguing against the D escalation the problem Netanyahu now has is an internal one having appeased his International partners he has annoyed the far-right uh members of his Coalition on whom he's Reliant for his survival you had national security minister ital bville tweeting on X very uh soon after the attack uh one word that would Loosely translates to weak or pathetic in Hebrew so Netanyahu is now Under Pressure to demonstrate his hawkish credentials and to appease his Coalition allies so I think the danger of a Rafa offensive is now more substantial than we've had for a very long time in the previous weeks Hisham your organization the icrc we mentioned how it governs the laws of war but it's also itarian organization what would it mean if an offensive was carried out in Rafa given that this is I believe normally about 270,000 people and now there are about 1.5 million the place is completely swelled tell us a bit about the humanitarian situation on the ground and if I can add a second part to my question Rafa is very limited Aid coming into Gaza but is one of the entry points for Aid that makes it even worse doesn't it yes absolutely now considering that there is approximately 1.3 million people living on 20% only of the total space of the Gaza Strip totally disconnected from the the basic Services uh uh and for example uh 900 people have only access to one latran and an average person in Rafa has access to only three liters of water per day two of them are not suitable for human consumption and this is a basic examples of how people suffer under inhumane conditions as a result of the ongoing conflict now there are several challenges that are facing humanitarian workers including the international Committee of the Red Cross which is the lack of uh or absence of uh security guarantees that are crucial and necessary for achieving um a meaningful humanitarian response on the ground despite all that we are trying to maximize our humanitarian response however uh this will not change the reality on the ground as long as there are H still is on the ground and and and they are not seized anytime soon the situation worsens by the clock by the by by by the hour and uh uh there is already a limited space for humanitarian workers to work now if things escalate fur than in Rafa Crossing this humanitarian space will shrink even more and more making any possible humanitarian response definitely meaningless on the ground we are trying as hard as possible but this is not not an environment that humanitarians can work achieve their objectives I I'm going to move on actually and and ask cude a follow-up question now um if there was a raffer offensive where would the people go actually uh nowhere and this is the the question that we hear every day from anywhere living in Gaza like if there is any offensive operation and Med operation in any area in the Gaza strap where to go and actually people have no place to go each one of those Gan people at least at least has been displaced for at least one or two times through this war and till this moment we don't have like s shelters to host those itps in the Gaza Strip if there is any uh um expected offensive military operation in Rafa people will find knowwhere to go and the situation will is there a possibility is there a possibility cude which I've heard some say that people might be forced out of the Gaza Strip is that a possibility we have been hearing about this since the beginning of the war but what I think is that people in Gaza will not actually uh find this solution is really good for them to leave Gaza people here have left their house in North Gaza and in Gaza until this moment they wait every day in order to listen about any news or to learn about any updates and the negotiation that are have been uh uh uh done in Cur and Egypt and and everywhere in order to hear about the possibility to return to their houses leaving Gaza fory is not easy for those people actually and if we talk about being on the edge of the Gaza Strip and this is the southern point of the the Gaza Strip Robert um it's on the edge of Egyptian territory what and of course Egypt remains um a country with a peace treaty with Israel what what do you think Egypt is making of the prospect of this offensive well Egypt is very much against this offens of taking place and this is exactly why the Biden Administration is now exerting so much pressure because they're getting pressure from their Partners in the Arab world countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia and others for to pressure Israel to reach a ceasefire as soon as possible for Egypt as you say there is a border um issue here as well that Egypt explicitly has ruled out the resettling of Palestinians refugees within the Sinai Peninsula um instead there's been all sorts of talk about um Israel for example trying to resettle them elsewhere but this is a key point of friction between the Biden Administration and the Israeli government Israel maintains from what we've heard from leaks that um resettling all of the 1.5 um give or take civilians within Rafa will take them around four weeks the US disagrees vehemently and thinks this will take around four months and actually doing something like what Israel proposes this Mass uh very rapid resettlement to avoid a humanitarian crisis will actually only make a humanitarian crisis more likely and significantly worse because you will be moving people with that infrastructure without planning uh you'll be moving them at a very very um uh very planned way and as some of my colleagues here have mentioned these are people who' have been uprooted on multiple occasions so all of those risks of famine and disease would actually be exacerbated by a rapid unplanned evacuation so pick up on that point if you can Hisham I mean legally under International humanitarian law is there a way Israel could do this or does it amount to force displacement which is in itself International uh illegal under International well this is entirely our responsibility on party to the conflict and Israel as an occupying power in Gaza must ensure the protection of civilians and they have absolute access to everything necessary for their own Survival including food water hygiene and health care and in terms of displacement people must be assured that they can be moved safely from one area to another that families one family cannot or does not get separated from their beloved ones and it has to be timely bound that they cannot be displaced forever uh um it's now more important than ever that the International Community must be held of our responsibilities to exert more pressure to put this Bloodshed to an end and uh um there's no way that people in Gaza can continue living like this it has been almost 200 days now and they have been through a lot cude um we've got lots of comments from members of the International Community who are telling Israel not to carry out a Rafa operation the un uh Secretary General said an operation in Rafa would compound the humanitarian catastrophe the US Secretary of State Tony blinkin said there would be terrible consequences for civilians how seriously do people there in Gaza take these comments from these International figures when the war now is coming up to its seventh month and yes you've got uh the US warning of this but at the same time the us giving $26 billion do in the last few days to Israel people people in Gaza actually uh fed up uh listening to uh other to to the external roles declarations and comments on social media about any expected military operation in Rafa because what do they really suffer is the reality the reality is that the devastating humanitarian situation infrastructure is damaged houses buildings is Dam are damaged no access to clean water to drink no access to domestic water toast no access to enough food the health system is really collapsed so people are living in tent now we are in summer so people are are are being bured actually inside those tents so people are only thinking about the reality about what they are suffering from they try to to hear some news uh between times and other and another but they actually fear they actually fear any expected military operation because as you have mentioned they don't have any place to go they have no world there is no safe shelters in Gaza even in maasi even in place no place in Gaza is safe because people have already experiences with uh being displaced from one place to another place Robert um we've heard tough words from the Biden Administration before towards the Netanyahu government and Netanyahu really hasn't listened on many occasions but it is worth noting there is another development in the last few hours it looks like the US Secretary of State Anon blinkin is going to sanction under what's known as the lehy laws um one particular unit of the Israeli military do you think that will get Israel's attention it's not related to the to the possibility of a of a of uh offensive and Rafa but do you think it could become linked yeah just to give uh some context for your viewers what we're talking about here is the netak Yehuda Battalion now this was a pioneering Battalion set up by the IDF leadership because it specifically seeks to integrate um strictly Orthodox or Ultra Orthodox Israeli into the army many of whom wouldn't normally serve in the military so it's a strictly religious Unit H now the problem here is that this unit has been subject to um significant uh and building allegations of Human Rights abuses long before the current military campaign including the death of a 17 a 78-year-old Palestinian American in 2022 who was basically um abducted by the group and left to die uh so the Israeli government will say look there's no truth to these allegations but we do know that that Battalion was moved out of the West Bank and onto the quieter Goan Heights border uh whether there's a connection there is very much an open question but it is now fighting in the Gaza Strip and is part of the military operations at the moment will this um affect Israel's military behavior in its campaign no we're talking about 1,000 people here this is not a significant uh sanction but Israel's leaders are indeed insens by this they argue it's the thin end of a wedge and who knows what this opens up and it is indeed a new precedent so on the one hand you have Biden is basically trying to use carrot and stick here on the one hand you have that $26 billion Aid package uh that was used to uh support Israel and show us support for Israel on the other hand you have new precedents like the sanctioning of members of the IDF so is this an act in itself that will be a game changer no but is it the start of increased US public pressure against Israel I'd argue yes Hisham let me take you back to where you are where we're talking about um that overcrowded city of Rafa um now one of the things we've seen in over six months is the collapse of the medical system uh across the Gaza Strip and we saw that hospitals were deliberately targeted by Israel al shifer in Gaza City NASA Hospital in carun the most well-known but so many hospitals uh targeted um how worried are you about the hospitals where you are in Rafa if they were to to to to face this the same thing because they seem to be among the only functioning medical facilities in the whole Gaza Strip now the interational committee of the Red Cross have warned since the start the early stage of this conflict about impacting the healthc care system in Gaza which has been um heavily impacted by 16 years long of um restrictions on the movement of people and good and um after hospitals have come to Rubble following the military operations conducted inside these hospitals and around them uh it leaves only the entire Healthcare System in Gaza now is collapsed and there's only one hospital that is capable of providing Advanced healthc Care Service and that is the Gaza European Hospital in the governor of kanun where a surgical team of the icrc doctors and nurses and surgeons work since last November and deliver or perform an average of 20 uh urgently needed surgeries on daily basis the icrc it's at its most uh um priority to keep providing support to whatever is left from the healthc care system in Gaza Strip but there is no Health entity can can absorb the influx of patients either in Rafa or in hunas and if the scenario of a military operation is conducted hospitals have been reeling and doctors have been working um nonstop for 6 months the entire Healthcare System in Gaza or whatever is left of it is on its knees doctors themselves and medical staff have either been killed uh detained or lost um um a dear friend or or something that is uh valuable in their lives yet they continue to work however they cannot continue working like this forever I mean cude let me show our viewers something that I think uh demonstrates this uh these are pictures of a young baby in Rafa um the baby was saved from the womb of her mother um who was dying from head injuries and an emergency cesarian section was performed form Med in Rafa the woman died as did her husband as did um their three-year-old other uh daughter um it just shows the appalling situation facing um women and children in Gaza does it not a shocking statistic I saw from UNICEF every 10 minutes one child is killed or injured in Gaza we have uh we have actually a million of such a tragedy stories in in the G of trap and always and like in like any conflict around the world women and children always pay the highest price and during this War uh very big number of women and children were killed actually uh with no uh actually with no limited uh danger and risky things the children all the time they are at risk they are at danger they are fear they are they shout whenever they hear any pump or shelling around them for my son for example all the time I'm trying to keep him calm trying to convince him that there is nothing risky around us but the reality is that our children couldn't actually grow up in an environment like this children needs to grow up in a protective environment safety environment and the story of that uh baby actually in in Rafa is one of million of stories that happen in G TR during this escalation and it it was really tragedy seeing that how life is born out of death and it's really difficult to see and to think about how would the future of this baby will be without his mother his father siblings and with this really tragedy story staying with you kude and not as an official from Oxfam but as a mother what would be your message to leaders around the world who have power here uh what would be your message to to the Israeli leaders at this moment as they contemplate a full-on offensive into Rafa my me my message is really uh having any military operation in Rafa will will actually put civilians in a very uh devastating situation uh civilians should be protected that's why I call on my on a personal level as a mom I call for an immediate permanent ceasefire because every minute pass in Casa we lose we lose people we lose our beloved ones we lose our family members we lose our friends colleagues and everyone we know in Kaza so an immediate permanent ceas fire for sure will end this because this actually should end this fear this law should be end in Gaza now okay thank you very much to our three guests today kud Jil Rob gist pinfold and hishan Mahana you'll find comprehensive coverage of the war on Gaza from our team's base there including in
