thank you Israel has pulled negotiators from its intelligence agency Mossad out of Q it's blaming a deadlock in negotiations let's get more from Ali hasham he's joining us live from Doha so what are you hearing about exactly why those negotiations have come to a Hal Al well uh the negotiations stopped after the end of the first uh truce that ended on the 30th of uh November now the uh Israeli delegation the Mad delegation was asked to leave Doha as per the uh statement issued by uh Israel's prime minister office um they were joined here by delegations from the United States of America also a security team and Egypt and they were all hosted by Qatar now uh the first phase uh saw the Israelis releasing uh Palestinian women and children detained in Israeli prisons many of of them without even being sentenced and Hamas releasing a number of Israelis who were uh uh taken as captives uh on the 7th of October now U now the Israelis are requesting that Hamas releases the um female military personnel which Hamas is saying this is not going to be with the same price that was put on the uh in the previous uh swap so this was the main issue especially that there are now categories and different price tags if it's right to say for the uh uh for the swaps in this uh regard the uh the negotiations has stopped but this doesn't mean that it has sto forever because the mediation continues and Qatar is still exerting efforts in order to secure another truth in Gaza and Ali there are certainly many countries who want the ceasefire negotiation iations to restart the French President Emanuel macron has arrived in Doha would that hope well the French pres president is hoping to secure the release of five uh dual Nationals who are French Israelis uh who he believe believes are uh cap taken as captives in in Gaza uh we don't know actually if they are with Hamas or with any other Palestinian faction there seeking the mediation of Qatar in in this regard however before coming to to Qatar the French uh president spoke uh to uh journalists in uh in Dubai and um expressed a big concern towards the continuation of the Israeli War on Gaza and this is what he had to say I think this is the moment when Israeli authorities need to more precisely Define their end goals what does total destru ruction of Hamas mean and does anyone think it is possible if it is the aim the war will last 10 years there can be no long-term security for Israel in the region if that security comes at the price of Palestinian lives affecting public opinion in the region well this is a different stance from the uh French president the French president who is supposed also to meet with the Amir of Qatar here in Doha at the beginning of the war just two months around two months ago called for an International Coalition to uh fight Hamas so today with this uh uh stance with this position whereas he is asking the Israelis to Define their objective with respect to Hamas whether they want to continue with their their objective to destroy Hamas and as he said as we had uh this is going to take a decade or change the objectives now French uh uh diplomats who spoke to uh uh French media yesterday were saying that Israel is now a prisoner of his its own stance and it seems that this is now the thinking in Paris and this is why we are witnessing this shift in positions uh for macron all right Ali thank you for that Ali hasham with the latest live in
