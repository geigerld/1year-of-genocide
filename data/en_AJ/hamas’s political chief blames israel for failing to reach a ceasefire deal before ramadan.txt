well the head of hamas's political Bureau ishia has blamed Israel for failing to reach a ceasefire deal on Gaza before [Music] Ramadan until now the enemy has been evading giving clear assurances and commitments especially regarding the ceasefire meaning the sensation of aggressive Warfare on the Gaza Strip even hours before this speech I was in contact with my brothers the intermediaries and we did not receive any commitment from the enemy regarding a ceasefire this means they want their prisoners to return and then resume the war on our people and our Enclave okay will marks joins us live from occupied East Jerusalem now and will so much was pinned on getting a ceasefire done before Ramadan started clearly that hasn't happened Tom one of the reasons as just outlined there by the Hamas leader was the idea that the Israelis do indeed want their hostages back and they don't don't want to feel constricted in their military activities after any temporary ceasefire this has been a central sticking point for weeks now whether there would be an end to the war as Hamas would like or whether there would be a possibility of absolute Victory as the Israelis would like and and that has been incredibly difficult for both sides to reconcile it seems right now that the latest round of talks that are meant to be taking place in Cairo Egyptian officials have been briefing media about those starting yesterday the Israeli government press office the Israeli Prime Minister's office refusing to comment on whether Israeli delegations would be traveling to that Hamas saying they've not even received an invitation to attend let alone made plans to do so okay villm we're going to come back to you in a moment because we've got more from occupied East Jerusalem where Israeli forces have blocked the entrance to the AL Aram mosque compound some worshippers prayed outside others who were trying to enter the compound were beaten by Israeli soldiers at the The Gate entrance now the alaa compound is the third holiest site for Muslims and since October the 7th Israeli authorities have limited the number of people that are allowed in okay we're going to um get more on this from villum can you just tell us uh a little bit more about exactly what happened last night and how tense things are at the alaka MOs compound so last night there were instances where worshippers were blocked from getting closer to the mosque through certain routes inside the old city and there were instances where police officials police officers seemed to charge into the crowd to push them back Sometimes using batons this morning prayers have been calm there have been no reported incidents so far at the start of Ramadan but it's really really key to understand that here in the Israeli political establishment this is something people are very concerned about Benny Gant the member of the war cabinet releasing a statement yesterday calling for calm telling members of the Israeli Nation who are themselves Palestinian who might be seeking to worship inside the alaka mosque that they have a war right now but it is not against Islam he said meanwhile on Saturday though the minister for National Security here itar benav saying he felt the police forces that he has control of inside the old city were not sufficient to deal with what he cons considered a threat to security this is something that plays out both within the different communities here but also at the heart part of the Israeli government and it is something that officials are very concerned about okay we will be keeping a very close eye on that villain marks for us there and occupied East Jerusalem
