now after days of mounting International pressure and warnings of famine from humanitarian organizations Israel says it's allowed the largest number of a trucks into Gaza since the War Began 6 months ago Israeli authorities say 322 trucks entered the strip most of them carrying food before the war 500 trucks used to arrive daily Aid organizations accuse Israel of slowing the delivery of humanitarian relief supplies un has described the situation in Gaza as man-made starvation and warned of famine Tess Ingram is a communication specialist at UNICEF and she joins us live now from outside the Kuwait Hospital in Rafa Tess great to have you with us thanks for joining us so we've seen this Convoy of Aid trucks entering Gaza first of all can you help us understand where that Aid is going and the impact that it's [Music] having oh it's so important when I came into Gaza last week I know that there were 1,200 un and NGO trucks backed up waiting to enter so the fact that we've seen more trucks come in is really good news but we need this to happen consistently because of course Gaza is on the precipice of a famine this food has to get in and across the Gaza Strip with urgency most of the children dying of malnutrition who are in the north and our access to that area with food ha has been so limited so it's really important that this Aid comes in at scale and is continued for the days to come give us an idea of the logistics once the aid is inside Gaza how it is distributed from the south to the North and the obstacles that it faces it's a really challenging process um it's one of the most challenging places in the world to be a humanitarian Aid worker at the moment largely because of the safety concerns as we saw with colleagues at Word Central Kitchen on Monday even when we coordinated Mission with Israel that we're told is safe we are still put at risk and that's part of the challenge in getting the aid to the north we're just not getting the safety assurances we need and then of course there's other challenges damages to roads restrictions on where we can travel a serious lack of trucks now and fuel that we can use to transport the aid so the obstacles are many but we're still doing our best in these really difficult circumstances to bring food and water and medicine and nutrition treatments to the vulnerable children that need it how has UNICEF perhaps changed its operations since that Israeli strike on world Central Kitchen we along with other un agencies took a 48 hour pause on night operations but we're back to full operations now we've been here in Gaza for decades and we're not going anywhere we're going to stay here during the fighting stay here as the guns fall silent and then help the children of Gaza to rebuild once their finally is is peace but of course we can't do that if it's not safe so we need these safety assurances from Israel that when we go on a coordinated Mission we know we're not going to be killed Tess you're there at the Q8 Hospital in Rafa can you tell us what's the situation there because we know that all medical facilities are running low on supplies and added to that of course is the impact of alifa hospital being taken offline so what is the situation in the remaining I visited four hospitals in the last 5 days and I can tell you that every medical director has told me about the impact of the lack of resources and the lack of staff and how that's really detrimental for the patients in these hospitals they're running at four times capacity children are dying from infections children are dying from malnutrition there just not enough stuff and resources to go around so the needs are great that's why we have to rush this Aid in and it's why a sa fire well instead we've got Israel keeping on raising the Spectre of a ground offensive on Rafa where you are that's where 600,000 children are living mostly in makeshift shelters can you envisage a situation where they are all evacuated to safety no I can't there is no safe place in Gaza to evacuate these children too and when you walk around the streets of Rafa here here it is so clear that this is a city of children every second person is a child and I've met so many who have already been injured here in Rafa 9-year-old who was uh shot a 10-year-old sorry who was shot in the head in masasi um a 16-year-old whose house fell down around her and she broke her leg uh and a 10-year-old who has major wounds from explosions and this is all happening already in this area so the children are vulnerable and they need this fighting to end if it came into Rafa that would just be catastrophic Tess if I can just ask you one more question even as you are battling to be heard above the call to prayer behind you there uh the international Aid uh the in Northern Gaza one in three children under two years we we know that they are acutely malnourished we've been hearing for some time that that whole region uh is on the edge of famine if Aid is reaching there now is it arrival in time to prevent a widespread famine in that in that region look a famine could happen at any moment now in the north of the Gaza Strip we've been warning about these for months and still two little a has got into that area we're going to try and attempt to go there tomorrow with some nutrition treatments that are needed to try and help these children survive the lack of food that they've been faced with for months but we know that children are dying now already at these hospitals and they desperately need our help even in the middle area where I was on Wednesday I met a boy who had just come down from the north seven years old his name's Omar and he'd been living on grass grass and he was so sick and malnourished in so much pain and this has to be unacceptable to the world when the aid and the food is just a few kilometers away tragic stories indeed Tess Ingram we really appreciate you taking the time to bring us those stories and bring us the situation there in Rafa Tess Ingram with UNICEF joining us there from outside the Q8 Hospital in Rafa
