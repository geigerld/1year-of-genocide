and we're joined Now by Maron Jones associate professor of Middle East studies at hammad bin Khalifa University very good to see you firstly how significant would you say these comments by Chuck Schumer are I've heard one former Middle East peace Envoy us Middle East peace Envoy call them a political earthquake they are and I think we need to look in the context of American politics some people might say it's soft but look at it this way Chuck Schumer at the end of the day is the he's described as the highest ranking Jewish official elect official in the US and he has said something essentially a really scathing condemnation of Netanyahu during a time where the US you know support for Israel is slowly eroding this is really important unprecedented and what makes it really significant is that Schumer has been a longtime Ally of Israel right in the past few months he's even considering write a book on anti-Semitism because he's concerned about the way liberal youth in America are viewing Israel so to have him come and say this I would say is massively significant and does it show a rift in the Democratic party would you say between those who want to give Israel cart blanch and the more progressives well I don't think the rift is that uh clearcut I think traditionally with a rift you'd see people saying no no um we want to support Israel we oppose what you're saying but actually I think the rift is more so that there are people now in the Democratic party who really support more drastic action against Israel such as the withdrawing of us Aid to those who are slightly more moderate in their desire to critic criticize it I think the fact that Schumer is saying this is actually indicative not necessarily of a split but actually as a moving towards a general condemnation of Israel's genocide in Gaza so I think there is a split but it's not completely bifurcated it's more subtle yeah and isn't it interesting that he actually said that the US should be using more leverage using the leverage it has with Israel do you think that that was hinting at conditioning the billions of dollars they give to Israel absolutely I think it's a euphemism for conditioning and I think what we're seeing now progressively from Kamala Us's condemnation to now Schumer's condemnation uh and especially his mention as you said of Leverage I think this is basically suggesting that um Aid may be conditional and this is sort of basically the last warning Netanyahu is getting from the US or at least one of the last warnings he's getting to sort of say we need something and Biden as you mention as was mentioned in the report has again they announced these sanctions on settlements so they're clearly doing things in addition to this rhetoric to suggest that they're willing to take action whether whether we far away from them actually conditioning Aid I think we're quite far from that point but I think until there's actually a better uh delivery of Aid in Gaza we are going to continue to see the upping of this rhetoric and when we look at the later sanctions again the against these um outposts and settlers that the Biden Administration announced on Thursday settlements are illegal under international law so why Target just a few individuals well I I think yeah this is absolutely right I mean let's let's not forget that the settlements have always been illegal under international law so but if you target them all at the same time then really you lose that leverage right so I think what they're trying to do is say hey we're doing a few we're going to see if you come to the table or actually sort of comply with what we're demanding of you netan yaho first if not we'll take this a few steps further so I think again if we don't see any movement on Aid going into Gaza what we're going to see is maybe uh sanctions on more supplements so they're using it to give nanahu a longer essentially a bit of room to actually come to the table okay and just lastly going back to the point about conditioning Aid because this is something that's been spoken about a lot since the war on Gaza began especially military aid you know American weapons that are being used and the killing of Palestinians in Gaza you don't think that that will happen many people think don't think that that will happen but just the fact that bringing it you know to the US House of Representatives or to the Senate that will delay that will delay it wed yeah I mean it's it's it's absolutely kind of um putting this on the table but I think we still have to ackn at this point that the US is talking about and sending Aid to Gaza well at the same time sending military aid to Israel to kill gazans right but I do think this is significant and I think Netanyahu crucially will know that the possibility of having us Aid withdrawn is on the table now right because we are seeing a stry escalation so I think it is significant and I think it's something that we need to or Israel need to be very concerned about MCO and Jones thank you as always for your analysis we appreciate it
