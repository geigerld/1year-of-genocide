Jeffrey nice is a human rights Barrister who led the prosecution of former Serbian leader Slobodan mosovich at the un's international criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia he joins us live now from Canterbury in the United Kingdom good to have you with us so looking through the statements we heard from councils to South Africa there were references to additional measures there are references to Israel failing to abide by previous provisional orders what exactly if you could summarize for us is South Africa then asking the court to do now one of your earlier contributors uh made the point that occurred to me to begin with South Africa allowed for those who might have doubts about Israel's intention not to be too horrified by the order that was event obtain and that order did not order the cessation of fighting it ordered protection of the Gaza people in respect of their right not to suffer genocide but you will have noticed that this time the language is much much stronger not only in that it demands an end immediately and withdrawal of fighting forces but it asserts quite clearly that that there is genocidal intent on the part of Israel the desire to see off gazan citizens altogether and by having waited some time before it puts this argument at the top of its case it has shown respect to the court and to some degree extent respect even to Israel given what Israel undoubtedly suffered on the 7th of October but now it is making it quite clear that which many other commentators have felt has been the case namely that there's evidence that Israel really has genocidal intent to destroy the gazan people in Gaza alog together that's a big change now it's a big change so Jeffrey if I could jump in it is basically does this mean that if the icj rules in favor of South Africa's pleading at this point that it would be basically agreeing that there is genocidal intent and it would be ordering an end to the entire war in Gaza is that right it won't do the first thing because it can't make a determination of genocide really until all the evidence is heard at the end of the overall case but what it may do is identify a far stronger risk of genocide against which it needs to give its protection and it may say the only only way it can give its protection is by granting the protective measures that South Africa repeats and asks for and what's interesting of course is that as things develop over time desperately sad that it has to happen that way tragic that it has to happen that way where lives are lost in the intervening period but if it does that then it's actually to some extent in step with the changing political approach not least by the United States of America but also other countries who are saying that the attack on Rafa should not go ahead saying that arms should not be used for Attack on Rafa and so on and so forth that that's an important that's an important point I want to jump in again though and get in on something you mentioned if if the court cannot make that finding of genocidal intent obviously or one assumes that it's got to wait for the major case to be finalized the main case to be finalized what was the value of South Africa introducing that in its pleading today is it to build up the grounds slowly towards that finding of genocidal intent I think it's both that of course but it's also to establish evidence in the words of those who it says has spoken with genocidal in inent to justify the protective measures to say as a result of what you've heard seen and observed on the footage or pictures you can now be sure that the risk of the gazen people suffering genocide is really great and therefore you must do more and what you must do is this I thought there was also a very interesting cont element from one of the speaker one of the council I can't remember which one who spoke the desire of some countries to have things resolved politically in the security Council rather than by law that approach is one that I think the general public who are informed about these matters would find deeply concerning and distasteful it is politicians for decades in the security Council and around the world who bear responsibility for what has happened here what has happened here was foreseeable from the beginning of the 20th century when the first developments towards the creation of the state of Israel were taking place everybody knew how things might end and it needed real clever International political Goodwill and action to save what has happened from happening so the idea that this law which was introduced the genocide convention to save people from the sort of thing that it is said is now happening should be overridden by The Works of politicians when it is they who bear responsibility for what is happening is a pretty tall order isn't it and I think the public now who are becoming increasingly well aware of the law and how it interacts with countries that choose to go to war I think the public will now begin to see they would rather the law worked than that the politicians did not work I think there's uh plenty of sentiment around the world that would probably agree with uh the idea that there's doubt in politicians certainly ultimately Jeffrey do you think it's likely this court is going to Grant South Africa's request will it order an end to the war I prefer not to second guess what the Court decides that I'm not the judge they are but I think it's worth having in mind as we wait for their decision that if they don't Grant the request then it will be seen by Israel as a green light to do that which many countries around the world want them not to do so to the extent that the international court of justice is politically sensitive and of course it is all International courts are particularly sensitive and sometimes subject to Poli political influence to the extent that it's politically sensitive it may be rather easier for it to do that which South Africa wants now than it would have been five months ago all right thank you so much for your analysis of these proceedings oral statements being made today Jeffrey nice there make
