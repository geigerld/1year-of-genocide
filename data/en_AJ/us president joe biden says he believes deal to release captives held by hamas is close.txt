hamas's political leader says they are close to reaching a truce agreement with Israel in a statement ishmail hania says Hamas has delivered its response to the potential deal to Qatari negotiators Qatar has been mediating the release of captives held by its armed Wing in Gaza let's take a look at the number of captives Israel says were taken by Hamas Fighters Israel says at least 237 people were taken during the October 7th attack by Hamas they include Nationals from more than 40 countries and at least 20 Thai Farm Workers the Israeli government says 33 of them are children Hamas has released four of them an Israeli Army says one was released during an operation in Gaza Israel says the bodies of two female captives were recovered near the al-shifa hospital complex well earlier US President Joe Biden said he believes a deal to release captives held by Hamas is close our White House correspondent Kimberly hulit has more from Washington DC US President Joe Biden on Monday confirming that a deal to secure the release of captives is closed this after days of speculation that an agreement had been reached but National Security spokesperson John Kirby confirming that the details are still being worked out what we know is that this agreement could involve a pause in fighting for several days in order to secure the release of dozens of captives it would also allow for stepped up and much needed humanitarian Aid if you're going to secure the release of hostages and we certainly hope we're going to be able to do that soon you got to make sure they can get from where they are to safety and do that as safely as possible which means you're going to have to have at least a temporary localized stop in the fighting to allow them to move I mean we also can't take for granted that all these people are easily mobile and don't have some sort of health issues that require perhaps a slower route out or assistance getting out so um I don't again I don't want to negotiate in public but uh but we we believe we're getting closer John Kirby also confirming to Al jazer for the second time in roughly a week senior White House advisor Amos Hawkin is in Israel meeting with senior officials specifically the National Security adviser as well as the defense minister the goal of the meeting is to try and prevent a broader war between Israel and Lebanon the concern that there could be the risk of a second Northern front there will also be meetings with Lebanese officials as well the fear is is that Israel because of its military activity inside Lebanon may be trying to provoke Hezbollah into a wider conflict that could potentially even draw in the United States as a result the goal of these meetings again to try and send a strong message of deterrence Kimberly hit Al jazer the White House well for more on this let's speak to Sara hit she joins us live from occupied East Jerusalem so Sarah it does appeal appear that a deal is growing ever closer what are you hearing from the the Israeli side good morning Laura well it seems that everything is indicating in all the players that are involved are indicating that this is imminent and it's due to happen however uh despite Israeli media reporting that Israel has given the green light uh to go ahead with this potential deal uh you have uh Hamas seemingly saying that it potentially might happen in a few hours uh whereas uh the Israeli media is reporting that it could be potentially happening in a few days so maybe the timing is slightly different as far as we know uh however still no details revealed whatsoever what we do know is that the families of those held captive in a huge meeting with the war cabinet overnight uh discussed potentially uh some of that information that hasn't been privy to the public just yet it was behind closed doors at the foreign Ministry uh in Tel Aviv uh and they came out because they had been demanding answers from their government as to what the latest situation is in terms of the negotiations that have been happening via the US Qatar and Egypt they came out saying that they couldn't share that information with the media they didn't seem to be happy with the results emphasizing that prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been focusing mostly uh on uh the fact that uh uh uh carrying out this war against Hamas and eliminating Hamas was as equally as important as bringing back those captives however the families have been saying time and time again and protesting we've seen protests we've seen marches with them saying that bringing back the captives alive should be absolutely Paramount in terms of the details it's still not 100% clear just yet because nothing has been sheded but there have been talks of a possible 5day pause uh and potentially the release of well we've seen different reports about 50 they've said women and children Israeli captiv women and children uh uh and in in exchange for the release of Palestinian women and children held in detention by Israel uh but there are also talks that potentially it could be all of the uh women and children captives so those details are probably is what has taken so long in the last few days to iron out but it seems that a deal is potentially imminent very soon okay and we'll certainly keep an eye on uh announcements about a deal and of course the details as they get excuse me as they get announced there has been huge pressure hasn't there be on Benjamin Netanyahu and the war cabinet to secure the release of these hostages yeah that's right Laura um as I was just saying there that that meeting that happened overnight uh initially what we saw uh was uh uh these families that had demanded a meeting with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and in the entire War cabinet they didn't want to just meet one individual or two they wanted their entirity to be there and this came off the back of a March that had thousands of Israelis marching with families of captives all the way from T Tel Aviv earlier this week uh to uh Jerusalem which took them an incredible 5 days many of them said they weren't just physically uh fatigued but of course emotionally fatigued as well many of them them had family members killed on October 7 and then also those are held captive so um they be they've been pushing for answers to their questions they said they don't know if the government even is aware of the whereabouts of those captives that are being held and what what the condition is another demand they've been making uh recently is uh asking for U medical staff from uh uh the who from the World Health Organization along with several other uh entities like the Red Cross in Gaza to be able to find out if it's possible to check on them because a lot of those held captive are without medication especially those where it's essential to their survival the biggest fear for them has been from day one is that their relatives are killed in air strikes and for them they said that if it's up to them they would accept any form of uh deal as long as it means that it brings all of them and they want all of them back at the same time Sarah H join the latest from occupied East Jerusalem thanks very much Sara
