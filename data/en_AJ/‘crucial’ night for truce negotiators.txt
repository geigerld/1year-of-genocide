now earlier qatar's foreign Ministry released a statement saying it expresses deep regret at the resumption of Israeli aggression against Gaza following the end of the humanitarian pause it added that negotiations to restore the ceasefire are still ongoing but that the bombardment of Gaza is complicating mediation efforts let's bring in Hashim ahbar who's following these negotiations very closely for us here in Doha Hashim we've heard the Israelis blame Hamas for the resumption of the war Hamas blaming the Israelis for the collapse of of the txin extending the ceas fire what are your catar sources telling you about what led to the breakdown well basically the problem yesterday was about the list of the Israeli captives uh Hamas said that it has he provided a list yesterday of the the Israeli family that was killed the Bas family the bbas family along with the father for plus six to be released in exchange for 30 Palestinians and that this was rejected by Israel and that there was another option which was basically a list of elderly Israelis to be exchanged for a list of elderly Palestinians and then they were trying to look into different options such as the release of a female uh Israeli soldiers in exchange for Israeli Palestinian but that would be a totally different uh issue isn't it I mean because it would seem that Hamas would want to renegotiate the terms of agreement they were to get to the soldiers they wanted to make some concession when it comes to the female soldiers the male Israeli soldier is going to be different and but then they said throughout the negotiations yesterday night the Israelis said no we want this list to to be released and that when they went through the list they said these were female uh female soldiers they have to be part of a different criteria so it was about criteria it was about leverage but it was about a great deal of Uncertain uncertainty about how to move forward each party was trying to study the enemy's next move and this explains why the talks collapsed so the talks have collapse but I understand that there's still a line of communication between the two sides right and the cies are trying to negotiate another extension what what's the likelihood of reaching another extension another agreement between Israel and is there a chance that we can there is they say there is a chance just the fact that they are negotiating as we speak is a good indication no one is pulling out from the talks however they need to convince both Hamas and Israel on agreeing on a on a list and particularly when it comes to the list of the Israeli captives as we speak they are yet to finalize the list if there is no list then you won't have an agreement then the problem is you see the escalation today so this is a collapse of the ceasefire agreement if it continues to further deteriorate it will just diminish the chances whatsoever to extend the ceasefire and this has been qatar's strategic goal which is just continue in the in this track to ensure that the ceasefire HS if the ceasefire HS it will be conducive to a comprehensive agreement but there was always the risk that the ceasefire would collapse right I mean there was a risk sorry that the war would resume because Netanyahu the Israeli Prime Minister had said even if the cire is working right now we will go back to war we will resume the war and we're seeing the pictures of that happening right now with intense Israeli bombardment across the Gaza Strip the North and even the South which is supposed to be safer we seem to be in a new phase of this war what is it going to look like you think is it going to be as intense as the first round do you know when the negotiate when when they were into the thick of the negotiations about potential for a prolonged uh uh extension uh so came the statements from the Israelis on the need to destroy Hamas but then official statements for the first time by his top Israeli officials including the Prime Minister on Israel determined to kill the leadership of Hass of Hamas all over the world the timing of those statements when you are trying to salvage a political deal that could be conducive to seiz fire left many grappling with what are the Israeli what what are Israel's motives when it comes to the deal are they genuine do they want to go to go to a deal do they want to see a prolonged ceasefire and then you have the resumption of the fighting and this explains why when you see the statement from Q's Minister of Foreign Affairs it says while they are determined to continue mediation but they but they condemn what they described as Israel's Collective punishment of the Palestinians the forcible displacement of the people and the continuing of the destruction of the civilian uh property right and so what should be should we be watching out for in the next few hours and next few days Hashim when it comes to the negotiations of diplomacy tonight is going to be crucial I mean you have to come up with something positive you cannot afford to have a second day of fighting because there might be uh a typic point where suddenly you won't have any control of this whole situation this is something that Qatar is understand there's been a momentum they've been building and they were hoping to capitalize on that momentum to to convince the Americans in particular to put more pressure on Israel for this ceasefire to hold if it continues and if the escalation continues for another day it's going to be extremely difficult to return back to square one hasham thank you very much for that Hashim aara joining us here in the studio
