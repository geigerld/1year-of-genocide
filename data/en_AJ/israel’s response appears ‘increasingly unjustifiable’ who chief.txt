assembly and uh have a listen to Dr Ted Ros Gabriel Mr President excellencies dear colleagues thank you Mr President for convening this meeting on Tuesday of this week I met for the second time with families of Israeli hostages being held in Gaza I heard and felt their pain and heartache who continues to call for those hostages who are still alive to be released without condition we're deeply concerned for their health and wellbeing just as we're concerned for the health and well-being of the people of Gaza which is becoming more precarious every hour so far this week w has not received updates on the number of deaths or injuries in Gaza which makes it harder for us to evaluate the functioning of the health system what's clear is that the health needs of the people of Gaza are growing all the time and the health system is near collaps only 10 of gaza's 36 hospitals are still functioning with just one ,400 hospital beds many health workers have been displaced forced to flee with their families here is what that means more and more casualties and fewer and fewer beds health workers medicines and supplies premature babies dying as life support systems shut down more than 2,000 patients with cancer 1,000 with kidney disease 50,000 with cardiovascular disease and 60,000 with diabetes all at risk as their treatment is interrupted up to 200 women giving birth every day in the worst imaginable conditions an estimated 20,000 people and counting in need of specialized Mental Health Services among this place po ations in overcrowded shelters we're seeing increasing numbers of respiratory and skin infections cases of acute watery diarrhea as the SE system breaks down and people are forced to defecate in the open increasing malnutrition I could go on and on there are no words to describe the horror the people of Gaza need our support your support now the best way to support Gaza health workers and the people they serve is by giving them the tools they need medicines medical equipment clean water food power and protection field hospitals and Emergency Medical Teams can complement and support existing hospitals and health workers in Gaza but they cannot replace them supporting gas health workers is at the heart of who's operational response plan we need to rapidly resupply the hospitals reconstitute the health Workforce and ensure health services are protected but frankly the amount of Aid that has been allowed into Gaza so far is fitful it's pathetic and even the little Aid we can get into Gaza cannot be distributed without fuel it's as simple as that no fuel no Aid the small amount of fuel that entered this week has already run out we welcome reports that an agreement has been reached for increased supply of fuel to Gaza we look forward to seeing the details of those reports and to their fulfillment but it's not just fuel electricity is also needed to power desalination plants water and SEI treatment plants hospitals and other essential Services we welcome the security council's adoption on Wednesday of a resolution on urgent and extended humanitarian poses and corridors in Gaza it doesn't go far enough we need AIS but it's a start we call for the immediate implementation of the resolution and we call on all parties to abide by it most of all we need attacks on Health Care to stop the Geneva conventions were adopted and ratified to establish what's acceptable and what is not in Conflict violating the neutrality of of healthare is not acceptable attacks on Health Care must stop but so far wh has verified 152 attacks on healthc care in Gaza 170 in the West Bank and 33 in Israel attacks on hospitals clinics ambulances health workers and Patients alifa Hospital must be enabled to function as a hospital there are reportedly up to 300 health workers and 650 patients inside the hospital even if hamus has used the hospital for military purposes the hospital and indeed all health care facilities are never without protection under humanitarian law furthermore the proposal for a so-called safe Zone at Alma is a recipe for disaster attempting to cram so many people into such a small area with such little infrastructure or services will significantly increase risks to help for people who are already on the brink who will not participate in the establishment of any so-called safe Zone in Gaza without broad agreement and unless fundamental conditions are in place to ensure safety and other essential needs are met and the mechanism is in place to supervise its implementation as Martin Griffith had already said earlier let me be clear the attacks by Hamas and other armed groups on Israel the killing of 1,200 people and The Taking of more than 200 hostages were totally unjustifiable but with at least 11,500 gazin killed 70% of the women and children with 1.7 million people displaced with two3 of Gaza hospitals out of action with no electricity no fuel no clean water no food with every bomb that kills or Mims a child with every family buried beneath the rubel of its own home the scale of Israel's response appears increasingly unjustifiable wh like the rest of the United Nations system is impartial we're not on one side or the other we are on the side of humanity Mr President excellencies we are witnessing the destruction of life and property on a horrific scale but we are also witnessing the destruction of Civility the rules based system and trust between countries this crisis is an acid test for the United Nations and for you its member states this organization was established to Foster peace in our world if you as member states of the United Nations will not or cannot stop this Bloodshed then we must ask for the crisis in Gaza is a crisis for the UN and a crisis for Humanity talk is not enough resolutions are not enough statements are not enough you must act and you must act now we call on you to ensure unfettered access to deliver humanitarian Aid to the civilians of Gaza we call on Hamas to release the hostages we call on Israel to restore supplies of water electricity and fuel we call on both decides to abide by their obligations under International humanitarian law we call for attacks on healthc care to stop and for Patients health facilities Health infrastructure and health workers as well as Aid workers to be protected and we continue to call for an end to this conflict to prevent further deaths of civilians and further damage to gaza's hospitals and health facilities Mr President thank you once again for inviting me and back to you pretty powerful statement there from Dr Tedros gabrius director general of the World Health
