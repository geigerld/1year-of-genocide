it's 1500 GMT 6: p.m. in Gaza where today alone more than 150 people were killed by Israeli air strikes more than 1,400 Palestinians have now been killed including First Responders and journalists and that number is rising fast entire neighborhoods have been destroyed at least 338,000 Palestinians have fled their homes and have been forced to take shelter elsewhere and at least 30 00 Israelis have been killed since aasa's attack on Southern Israel on Saturday hundreds of civilians are among the dead well these are the areas that have come under Israeli attack in the past few hours that includes refugee camps Israeli air strikes have also hit the hammad B jasm Hospital dozens of patients and displaced Palestinians were inside now one air strike has left a vast crater in the center of the de albala neighborhood a major hospital is nearby and a number of homes in the area have been hit Israel says it has dropped 6,000 bombs on Gaza so far similar scenes of chaos and despair in arafa in the south of Gaza Israeli strikes have destroyed homes killing at least 11 people including women and children with the number of injuries Rising hospitals are facing severe medical shortages and there's no sign of Aid anytime soon Israel can continues to amass huge numbers of troops and weapons near the border and vows to continue to block all Fuel and water to Gaza until Hamas frees Israeli captives begins our coverage from inside Gaza the flow of casualties to gaza's hospital seemingly never ends these children are caught up in the middle of Israel's war on Gaza they're unlikely to understand why this is happening and they're clearly terrified hospitals are running on emergency generators when the fuel runs out the lights will go out the incubators will stop working kidney dialysis machines will shut down and x-rays can't be taken faces are thick with dust from homes that have collapsed often on top of them without warning Israel says it is destroying locations used by Hamas but Gaza is so densely populated that it is almost impossible to separate private homes from where Fighters may or may not be hiding and anyway these people have no choice where Hamas decides to operate we were sleeping peacefully and then suddenly my house and my neighbor's house were hit by bombardments I went outside and I found my children all injured then I looked around and I saw dead bodies and body parts and other people injured this appears to be Israel's most powerful bombing campaign against Palestinians in the 75y year history of the conflict whole neighborhoods have been flattened for the people trapped here there's nowhere to go there's nowhere to escape Israel shut its border crossings on Saturday and bombed the one to Egypt y Al jazer Gaza well let's get the latest on the situation inside Gaza Jamila Abu Zuna joins us on the phone from inside the besieged strip and Jamila the Israeli Army has just said it's dropped 6,000 bombs on Gaza which hit 3,600 targets can you just give us an idea of what it is like being under that kind of constant attack well Gaza is witnessing an arm up rides of bombings from all directions by air sea and land from the north to the South resulting in displacing thousands of people after forced to be leaving their houses to be demolished into the ground hospitals launched appeals to the international humanitarian organizations to provide medical assistance to the Palestinian people who are in urgent need of help meanwhile um the Hamas military Wing have announced launching more Rockets into Israel we will know more about it after the recorded speech of the spokesman of Hamas abua which will be on air shortly we also understand the rougher Crossing has been targeted is that now completely impossible at this point in time currently yes it's impossible for any help to be delivered into Gaza because uh we haven't received any confirmation from the Egyptian uh uh side so nothing until now and you mentioned hospitals and the medical supplies a short time ago I mean they seem very much in the firing line here what is the situation uh when it comes to people who are in need of medical attention are they able to get it at this point in time people need medical uh medical assistance any urgently uh because uh now we have we have been seeing footage of of uh people U deceased people uh their bodies are being placed outside a shifa hospital because there is no place to to put them in a shifa uh to two two days ago uh they put a tent inside the hospital to to put uh the bod inside because the morg was full inside the hospital now they're putting them outside the hospital this is catastrophic and the casualties and Ender people need immediate uh and Urgent uh help and it's obviously not just the medical uh supplies and the condition of people there that is a huge concern now the humanitarian situation is becoming more and more desperate isn't it how are people coping without uh food water fuel there's power shortages and that's only going to get worse isn't it yes definitely because people have lost all hopes uh for situation to get any better uh they are living with the least and um expecting things to get worse uh the worst scenario is about to happen uh probably uh the Israel military um will get into Gaza by land that's why they have been uh demolish the whole area in the north all this area so they can uh get inside um uh inside of of I land this is the worst scenario so far yeah as you say it does uh seem like things are going to get worse thank you so much for that that is Chila abuna for us inside Gaza
