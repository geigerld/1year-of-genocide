well the Dutch prime minister Mark rer has called for humanitarian pauses to allow the flow of Aid into Gaza he made that call during a visit to Israel and Palestine well for more we're now joined by H Abdul Hamed who's in rala in the occupied West Bank H I understand prime minister Ruta spoke to you after meeting with Netanyahu what did he say yes well he said that they discussed four main points uh being the the minimizing as much as possible the civilian casualties maximizing humanitarian Aid coming into Gaza also trying to avoid uh the the threat of this becoming a regional conflict and the issue of uh captives held by Hamas and the foreign Nationals who are in Gaza the Netherlands having at least 20 Nationals living there and one held captive by Hamas I also asked him about the position of the EU and he said that the EU backed uh Israel's right to defend itself while making sure that proportionality is relevant so when I asked him if 5,000 uh dead among which 2,000 uh children was already was enough in matter of prop proportionality this is what he had to say first of all I cannot judge because of course I'm right but I cannot judge whether at a moment um yes or no Israel is completely uh working within the lines of proportionality and international human law uh humanitarian law I cannot judge that because I do not know all the effects on the table this of course is up to Israel at this moment to navigate but I very much stress the point and the practicality of that is the humanitarian access the practicality of that is preventing Regional escalation the practicality of that taking out the hostages and then foreigners and the practicality is to do everything and that's the main issue of preventing innocent civilians to be um to be uh killed uh if not necessary what else did he share with you in that interview well I did ask him about humanitarian Aid especially about the issue of fuel which is darely needed uh in Gaza and very quickly I did ask him if he discussed it with prime minister netan he said he did I did ask him if he got any uh commitment that that would happen uh the only answer I got is that at the moment he got the impression that Israel was looking into the issue but we didn't get any further uh uh information about that meaning from what I understood that is not yet on the table even though Israel is coming under a lot of pressure H Abdul Hamid there for us with that report from rala and the occupied West Bank after speaking to Mark R thank you so much
