it took just 6 weeks for the US built humanitarian PE to fail on May 15th US Navy ship sailed from the Israeli Port of Azo to Gaza as these exclusive Al jazer images show these are warships and Logistics vessels responsible for connecting the floating structure to gaza's shore on A's way in the sh area the pier became operational on May 17th supported by two ships set about 9 km off the coast the images show two US ships and a smaller one intended to transport trucks onto the pier but problems arose almost immediately 8 Days Later high waves overwhelmed the pier over that period just 29 trucks delivered 99 shipments into Gaza dilemma that the American uh forces had in trying to build a peer uh with absolutely zero support from the Israelis in a place of war and trying to bypass the Israelis without coming to A A Clash with them and uh it added up to too little uh with bad weather too late publicly available Logistics details show US Navy personal constructing the pier us officials said the mission was also to protect it armed with machine GS and armored vehicles US forces also installed an air defense system and attached it to the Eastern side of the pier when the pier collapsed they had to dismantle the system as well the F missile defense system is capable of automatically tracking missiles and aircraft US military officials are now looking at what went wrong with the project in the meantime more than 2 million Palestinians continue to suffer with not nearly enough Aid getting into Gaza by land or t abum Al jazer Dar balah palestin well let's bring in gersan Basin he's the Middle East director at the NGO of the international communities organization he's also a former hostage negotiator he joins us now from West Jerusalem gersan there were always questions about how this peer would function criticism too that it it was a distraction and an excuse not to open land roots does this failure of the P now change The Diplomatic calculus here is there perhaps more pressure on the Israelis to reopen land borders I think there is international pressure on Israel to open up additional land borders um the Rafa Crossing is closed since Israel conquered the Palestinian side of the Rafa Crossing which has cut down a major passageway for Aid there is the K Shalom passageway from the Israeli side into Gaza that needs to be open and there needs to be roots from the north of Gaza into the northern part of Gaza into da into to Bon and Bia jabalia Gaza City this all needs to be done and it has to be as a result of international pressure because it's doubtful that Israel will do it on its own you say International pressure I've been wondering as we watch the humanitarian situation deteriorate even further we see more and more pictures of emaciated dying children more and more civilian deaths where is public sentiment in Israel I mean we've seen people actually attacking Aid trucks right public sentiment in Israel is mainly with the Israeli hostages and the families of the hostages and the families of soldiers who have been killed there's a really one-sided view of the war from the Israeli side um the Israelis don't really see the humanitarian suffering in Gaza I think it's perhaps time that we understand also that that the problem is not only getting the trucks in but there's also a problem of distribution because there's a breakdown of Law and Order in Gaza there is no functioning police and if there was a police it would be Hamas police maybe it's time for the United Nations security Council not only to pass resolutions for calling for a ceasefire but perhaps to use chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter and to send International forces to protect the Palestinian people in Gaza to force the Israelis to withdrawal and to put an end to this war that's a big call G so you're saying that that you're for international intervention for arms and boots on the ground from other countries well I don't know how we're going to end this war because the Israelis have refused to deal with any alternative to H in Gaza Hamas is digging in its boots into the ground and putting out statements a big statement by KH Mas just yesterday about Hamas staying in Gaza and that no one would replace them so we need to look to the Future where where Gaza will be able to be governed where reconstruction can happen the International Community isn't going to put a penny into Gaza as long as the mass is in control or as long as Israel is in Gaza so we need to think out of the box and come up with solutions that will enable War to end the Israeli hostages to come home and a rebuilding of Gaza process to begin in collaboration with Palestinians on the ground in Palestinians in the West Bank it it needs to be done collaboratively but we need to get this war to end quickly you speak about the War ending but you mentioned that public sentiment in Israel remains very much with with the captives there's obviously been huge and and growing anger about the Israeli government's lack of ability to get them home is that now also perhaps shifting to the way that the war is actually being carried out we we have been seen more and more divisions in government well we are seeing divisions in the government not necessarily about the war in Gaza or about the hostages it's mainly internal Israeli issues like the draft law the Supreme Court decision of two days ago which is obligating the government to draft all the ultra Orthodox into the army until there's a law that that gives them some kind of deferment from the Army which is unlikely to happen at this time so the government of Israel seems to be imploding which is a good thing we need to get to new elections but even that's a process that will take months not days well let me ask you then right now where are any kind of talks around captive exchanges a ceasefire you yourself dealt with Hamas as a hostage negotiator for 17 years what would it take right now to get momentum going again I really don't know we have an unbreachable Gap it seems at the present time where Hamas is not going to make any agreement with Israel that does not include an end to the war and Mr Nan has made it quite clear that he is only willing to do a partial agreement without an obligation to end the war I've spoken to people on the Israeli negotiating team who have told me that this is the reality on the ground that natano has not given a green light to the negotiators to arrive at an agreement that would end the war natany is sticking to what he says only a partial agreement that would bring some of the hostages home and give us a SE fired but not an obligation to end the war so we are stuck and the families of the hostages are extremely frustrated been sad we're we're N9 months into this war now and no end in sight Jan Baskin there the Middle East director at the NGO the international communities organization thank you for joining us again on Al jazer
