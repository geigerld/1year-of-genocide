well Mustafa baruti is Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative the former Palestinian information Minister joins us live from Madrid on Skype and some of the analysis we've heard so far suggests that the content of this agreement isn't too different from proposals that have been made before uh including uh one agreement that was rejected by the Israelis is the real question now not necessarily H how Hamas will respond but uh what Netanyahu is going to do with this uh deal well according to the American president this is an Israeli plan an Israeli offer but what we still need to hear is that Netanyahu really accepts his own offer if it is his offer so the most important Point here is that Israel must be held accountable for what is declared as an Israeli plan and I think that's what Hamas and other resistance movements should uh should insist on that there is a clear statement by by by Netanyahu that he is really approving or supporting this particular proposal that's one point the second point is that this uh declaration and this kind of details that we have heard ER clearly show that Israel and the United States of America are both admitting the failure of the Israeli War on Gaza in the sense that it has failed in achieving all its goals it has failed failed in imposing with ethnic cleansing on Palestinian people in Gaza it has failed to eradicate the Palestinian resistance it has failed to bring back Israeli prisoners without an exchange deal uh and that by itself will have a very big impact on Netanyahu and his future in the long run finally the most important thing is that to make sure that Netanyahu will not play games again the fact that Biden decided to declare by himself these points and clearly he wouldn't have done so if it wasn't he if he didn't receive Israeli approval of it is is his way of besieging in my opinion Netanyahu and preventing him from maneuvering again everything you've just said about the failure of the war to achieve its objectives I supp suppose could also be used as a pretext for Netanyahu to continue the war yeah if you could but you see it's interesting what Biden said that Israel is getting isolated completely at the world I mean worldwide and that he said that the continuation of the war will not bring Israel anything else it will not bring Israel Victory it will not bring Israel more than it what what what they have on the table now and so in my opinion Netanyahu Biden was pressuring Netanyahu to say to to to to accept the reality uh which is that it is impossible to achieve anything more uh all that Israel has achieved is killing 46,000 Palestinian civilians mainly I mean if we include the 10,000 people who are decomposing under the rebel unfortunately all he has achieved is the destruction of the total infrastructure of Gaza people's homes people's houses causing a lot of pain to Palestinians achieving any political goal very important to you know the politics is there but also to focus on Gaza and the people inside who've been through an unbearable eight months but this after Decades of a a blockade and a Siege in any case do you see any path for this uh agreement to make life easier for them because you say Gaza is now uninhabitable for sure if this uh plan is implemented uh if Netanyahu stops his war and removes his army from Gaza and if the American president fulfills his promise that there will be a sufficient supply of humanitarian Aid and most important the beginning of reconstruction of Gaza uh I think this will relieve of course some of the pain some of the pain will never go away those who lost their fathers their mothers their children their their wives their husbands of course course these are wounds that will never heal but at least the suffering could stop and the the more no more people would be killed this is what we want and at the end of the day it's a turning point in the sense of showing that Palestinian people will never give up Will Never Surrender unless they get their freedom and that applies not only to what's happening in the the Gaza ship but also what's happening in the west bank and to Palestinian people people in general thank you very much Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative and former information Minister mfar baruti speaking to us let's get more on the an make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
