close to one and a half million Palestinians are Sheltering in Rafa where an Israeli ground offensive is threatened here's what a few of them are expecting the numbers of dead and wounded people here will be huge if Israel storms Rafa personally I will never leave Rafa I will stay in Rafa I'm ready this time to die in Rafa we urge all the Arab countries particularly Egypt Qatar the United Arab Emirates in Saudi Arabia to take action and adopted a decision to help the Palestinian people and to save the Palestinians from the genocide being committed by Netanyahu we live together with the shelling destruction relocation fear and hunger despite everything we will stay strong and resilient there is news that Israel is pressuring Hamas to accept certain demands otherwise Israel will storm Rafa this will result in a massive catastrophe we have spent more than 100 days here there are more than a million displaced people of different genders ages sicknesses and diseases we will remain an eternal memory of human history for everyone who cares to remember we kept moving from one place to another about seven times we've lost everything there is nothing left they can threaten us with from now on we have no place to go but the grave I want the Arab countries to be United and if I know America is comprehensively supporting Israel but I want Americans to help us get back our land and our houses the Palestinian prime minister Muhammad has warned that any Israeli offensive there would Mark a new phase in the Gaza genocide the killing machine of Israel is still killing our sons in Gaza Strip This Stone a new escalation has been announced by the Israeli Prime Minister toward storming RAF the last resulting Square in Rafa 100 martys have gone in most of them are women and children in RAF there are 1.4 million people living in difficult circumstances freezing weather epidemics hunger and Israel continues the genocide started in Gaza and words of concern from the European Union's top Diplomat as well Joseph barell says Israel should be pressed not to go ahead with its offensive on Rafa even the US who is the strongest supporter of Israel consider it by the President Biden himself that this action is disproportionated that they toll of people being killed civilians being killed is unable and warning Israel not to continue this way but my question is apart from words what else do you think it has to be done and Britain's foreign secretary is also calling for Israel to in his words stop and think before raiding Rafa David Cameron says Gaza needs a sustainable ceasefire we are very concerned about what is happening in Rafa because let's be clear the people there many of them have moved for or far six times before getting there and uh it really we think is impossible to to see how you can can fight a war amongst these people there's nowhere for them to go uh they can't go south into Egypt they can't go north in back to their homes because many have been destroyed so we are very concerned about the situation and we want Israel to stop and think very seriously before it takes any further action but above all what we want is an immediate pause in the fighting and we want that pause to lead to a ceas fire a sustainable ceasefire without a return um to further fighting well let's take a much closer look at all of these responses with jannis vraz who's an economist and Greece's former Finance Minister he joins us from Athens a warm welcome to you so when it comes to Israel's war on Gaza and the subsequent humanitarian catastrophe you once said that we Europeans have created this what did you mean by that Europeans have been responsible for centuries of anti-Semitism of U one program after the next until we reach the Holocaust and uh since then um this Collective guilt has weaponized a policy of uh uh White Settlement and um um supremacism in Palestine time essentially what we have been doing is um using the collective guilt over the treatment of Jews and over the Holocaust in order to justify um the Zionist genocide of Palestinians because let's face it what was this Zionist project all about it was about exporting Jews from Europe to a land that didn't belong to the Europeans that the Europeans allocated to the Jews to go to that is a collective project a European project it began with a balford declaration but after 1945 it gave rise to the Naka uh Zionism had a a very clear rationale a land without a people for a people without a land in a sense it was a racist ideology just like the British who went to Australia proclaiming Australia to be tanus an empty land along with other people right uh Zionism together with European forces have proclaimed Palestine to be a place without humans the dehumanization of if European if Europe as you say is collectively responsible for creating the problem in the first place obviously then the solution must be in the hands of Western Powers also what is the collective responsibility now on them well exactly as you put it we created we Europeans created the problem and at the moment we are playing a vicious role in its perpetuation you heard I just heard on your program Mr borell hypocritically lamenting the fact that not enough pressure is being applied on Israel to stop the genocide in Rafa Mr borell you are representing the European Union which collectively is arming Israel Germany France Italy as we speak are sending the very armaments that are being used in Rafa to kill people we heard Mr Cameron the British foreign secretary lamenting again what is happening in Rafa he has been instrumental in uh steadying the hand of the IDF in its pursuit of genocide for weeks now by doing whatever he can in order to prevent the CIS fire from taking place so Europeans have created the problem Europeans are perpetuating the problem and Europeans are failing to do that which is necessary in order to to do what we claim we are interested in doing because the official the official version the official Theory the official policy is a two-state solution and yet Europeans are completely complicit in the support of an Israeli government under Mr Netanyahu whose life's work has been the destruction of any Prospect of a Palestinian state so so you Europe is as you say complicit in what we are seeing there I wonder to what extent the legal political the global institutions the European Union as you mentioned there these institutions that have underpinned the world order since the second world war what is happening to their Authority we know that the un's authority is being repeatedly ignored and even recent rulings that the is CJ calling on Israel to end acts of plausible genocide are being played down by the US UK and others I have to be honest with you I believe that Europe's moral Authority uh and geopolitical Authority at a global level uh is a spent Force we have jettison did some time ago if you think back to the time when you know Jac Shirak the right-wing president of France visited the occupied territories a long long time ago um even though he was a friend of Israel even though he was a Zionist he had the guts at during that visit to confront the uh the IDF the occupying forces and in in the occupied territories to proclaim the importance of ending the occupation what we call today apar heide today there's not French president there is no V brand a chancellor of Germany that had moral Authority back in the late 60s early 970s steadily Europe's moral soft power has been depleted with every occasion when Europeans are turning a blind eye to the very concept of Universal human rights that sprang out of the European Enlightenment with every uh nod to Washington that essentially whatever Washington decides regarding for instance Ukraine you go along with it right theal St mrus mrus I'm afraid we're we're up up against the clock in speaking to you but let me press you on the point of moral Authority because you personally have courted controversy by not rushing to condemn hamas's assault on Israel on October the 7th why did you make that decision let me start by saying I condemn every atrocity against civilians or every atrocity overall however what I refused to do was to condemn Hamas in the same way that I would never condemn the symptom of a phenomenon but I will go straight to the main cause of it in the same way that I would never for instance back in the 1970s condemn the the IRA for the colonialism exhibited by the British governments of many many decades and remember that in the end there would have been no peace and no justice in Northern Ireland if the IRA was not involved in the peace process in exactly the same way to use the events of the 7th of October to condemn Hamas would be to jeopardize any Prospect for peace and Universal human rights from the river to the sea in Palestine jannis faracis many thanks for joining us thank you
