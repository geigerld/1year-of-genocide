well it's just gone 1400 GMT that's Gaza despite International condemnation Israel is intensifying its attacks on residential areas in the last hour a strike has killed 15 people at the borage refugee camp the area had already been reduced to Rubble was attacked while Palestinians were trying to recover their loved ones elsewhere the jabalia refugee camp was attacked for a third day in a row the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza has announced the Indonesian hospital no longer has a fully functioning generator the secondary one is providing limited power but ventilation has stopped and the distribution of medical oxygen is also stopped meanwhile in the occupied West Bank dozens of Israeli settlers have set fire to shops and cars owned by Palestinians from all this let's speak to Charles Stratford who's in the D Shara in the occupied West Bank where one of the settler attacks is taking place so Charles are things have things quieten down now yes Sammy I mean we arrived here I suppose about 10 minutes ago and as we arrived there was groups of youths behind me there was a lot of tear gust being fired at them but by what we understand is the Israeli military that are just at the end of that road and and around the corner um we saw the kids hurling stones and and other projectiles towards the military we also saw certainly evidence of live fire being uh fired as well above their heads so the situation certainly has calmed down in the last 10 minutes or so but just to give you a little bit of context as to what's happened here it was this morning where we began to see circulating on social media a photograph of an upturned gray vehicle a gray car with um two people in it seemingly um who were initially reported as being soldiers who'd been killed but certainly they were wearing green clothing suggesting that they were the military we can't confirm that it wouldn't be inconceivable if indeed they were settlers it's being reported in the Israeli um Israeli media that one of those people one of those men has subsequently died and I suppose it was about an hour two hours after that where we started hearing lines drop about Israeli settlers coming down from just above on that Hill there is an Israeli settlement there is an Israeli military Camp close by to it next door in fact we heard reports of settlers coming into this town and attacking local properties um burning cars which we've seen pictures of um attacking um homes also and the situation was pretty much was beginning to get out of control we've seen pictures of smoke rising from this town as well we understand that those fires and that attack property or the fires from that attack property have subsequently been extinguished but there was also very interesting pictures of the Israeli military soldiers actually fighting with settlers trying to keep the settlers back because of course the charge normally amongst Palestinians and this is true um because we have seen it with our own eyes on multiple occasions any Palestinian will tell you that usually the Army basically stay back and they accuse the army of basically protecting the settlers in attacks like this of course in a situation where we have seeing nightly raids daily raids by the Israeli military right the way across the West Bank um after the beginning of the war following those Hammer attacks in Israel it's situations like this that are very worrying indeed uh according to um the local authorities at least 32 people were injured here in D Sherif over the last couple of hours um and the red Cresent saying that an ambulance tried to come into the town to take some of the injured out and was fired that by according to to to uh to local authorities uh live fire and tear gas but as you can see the situation seems to be more under control now but yeah situations like this are an indication of just how tense the situation is right the way across the occupied West Bank Charles when you read un reports they talk about increasing attacks by settlers and talk to us about whether there's a the concern about official support for for these settler attacks given statements from some members of the government like bezel smich who in March was quoted as saying or calling for a Palestinian Town haa needing to be wiped out and the perception that creates of at least some elements in the government giving their backing to settler attacks I think that's right and I think that those kind of voices have increased and have been given if you like for one of a better word sort of greater legitimacy in the eyes of many Israelis um who are sympathetic potentially to not to put too fine a point on it a degree of Revenge following those Hamas attacks on October the 7th we know that the government is dominated by right-wing parties it is a deeply right-wing government so these kind of opinions that are being expressed by these politicians analysts will tell you are only making the situation worse here are giving effectively the green light to some settlers to to attack Palestinians um in these Villages across the the occupied West Bank I mean over the last couple of weeks since we've been here and especially here in the north of the occupied West Bank it's Olive season it's Olive harvest season every single day now you're getting settlers coming down from their settlements their outposts and attacking uh people trying to to pick their crops now we see this every year but it's dead right that yes indeed these attacks are increasing in frequency and increasing in intensity um and yes it wouldn't be at all inconceivable for you to say well those kind of voices coming from government coming from politicians with those sort of ideas are in many ways only encouraging these attacks to get even worse so yeah um it is a very worrying situation as I say because these attacks happen on a daily basis and that's another thing just with respects to the military raids what we've seen in the last couple of days is increasingly Israeli military raids on West Bank West Bank towns and Villages actually occurring in daylight hours um we already know that there have been 1,900 plus arrests of Palestinians since October the 7th um 65 arrests at least overnight 132 Palestinians at least killed plus two in um in custody but we're seeing these Israeli military raids now happening during the daytime which would suggest you know a greater sense of confidence um a greater sense of of of purpose if you like and so as you can imagine there are hundreds of thousands many more than that Palestinians living in towns and Villages across the West Bank that are living in fear um and especially as I say at night but now as as this indicates this sort of thing is happening in broad daylight all right we'll leave it there thanks so much Charles statford for your reporting me
