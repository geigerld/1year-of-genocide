this week a special edition of the listening post we're looking at Europe digging into the discourse there the coverage of Israel's war on Gaza beginning in Germany Israel's most Dependable Ally in the EU where shows of support for Palestinians have been suppressed demonized France where much of the coverage is toxic and where the debate on Gaza has been weaponized against minorities plus the outlier that is Ireland where there has been probing criticism of Israel's actions from politicians when does Palestine get the right to defend itself and in the media if the United States has aided abetted and helped finance Israel's campaign of ethnic cleansing in Gaza the European Union has been complicit as well like their allies in Washington EU officials have provided their support for Israel's war refusing to condemn it the way they have hamas's attacks or call for a ceasefire and while there is significant empathy for Israel among Europeans there is also growing public opposition to this war along with demands that their governments do more to stop it across the EU there are different shades in the news coverage depending on which country you're in in this special episode we will examine the discourse around the conflict in three countries we'll look at France where some television news channels have distorted the debate to suit their own agendas and Ireland where support for the Palestinians is more widespread and far more tolerated but our starting point is Germany it's the eu's largest economy a country where historical guilt over the Holocaust has created one of the most pro-israel media climates around and where dissenting voices are routinely censored or intimidated into silence Germany's relationship with Israel is unlike that of any other country it's a relationship that goes beyond loyalty and support ensuring Israel's security and existence is part of what Germans call ston the country Germany's past the genocide of almost 6 million European Jews during the Holocaust informs every aspect of the country's public and political discourse around Israel for many Germans Israel is above reproach the outright support for Israel in Germany constitutes a sort of a comforting thought that okay the the the people that we as Germans oppressed and killed and treated so badly historically now have their kind of own State and everything is fine it's not so much that Israel is supported in Germany because we come to term with its past but it's shortcut for for not really coming to terms with our past when Germany categorized Israel's National Security as their reason of State they essentially wanted to solve their problem of being described as the original anti-semites of the world they want to put the past behind them so Germany instead of listening to their actual je citizens instead of fighting anti-Semitism in a way that protects all Jewish people what it has done instead is take a vehemently and staunch pro-israel stance where they essentially can can do no wrong in this atmosphere of unwavering political support for Israel German media Outlets have also shown pro-israel bias in their reporting this is reflected in the one-sidedness of talk show debates [Music] for built the biggest newspaper in Germany Hamas freed Israeli hostages while Israel freed Palestinian terrorists and mainstream Outlets from Ard the public broadcaster to Media conglomerate Axel Springer have issued strict guidance to their journalists on this story Ard sent an internal memo to its journalists where in it it states that um if any civilian deaths take place it has to be stated as these civilians are being used as human Shields and this was provocated by Hamas if that's the only image that Germans see then the public are not going to understand actual scale of this war and just how much violence has been inflicted on an innocent civilian population Axel Springer has like support for Israel written into its work contract so if you work as a journalist for one of their Outlets say bu saong which is the biggest new newpaper in the German media landscape or devel you are kind of committed already from the g go regardless of what your personal views might be to report in a pro-israeli way what that often translates to is literally outright support of Israel government policies built newspaper is the most widely read newspaper in Germany and it's journalistic standards if one can call them that are pretty unspeakable then you have the velt which is slightly more highbrow but ideologically it's cut from the same cloth and then you also have desiger which recently ran an article about greater tunberg you can only call it a hitpiece really just this this absurd personal attack on her because she has recently been quite vocal about her support for Palestine we try to speak to Ard and Exel Springer but neither Outlets granted us an interview or a statement and those in Germany who go against a grain on this story risk being blacklisted or sidelined journalists challenging the prevailing narrative in newsrooms have been fired exhibitions workshops and conferences in the cultural sphere have been cancelled or delayed peaceful protests have been either banned criminalized or violently repressed now Germany has one of Europe's largest Palestinian diasporas but it's also become one of the most censored places for anyone who expresses solidarity with Palestinians or anyone who speaks out against Israel's war crimes in Gaza there's an increasing climate of censorship in Germany in the last um 5 to six weeks a climate of kind of Botox McCarthyism it's really quite intense cers have been forbidden in schools like symbols of the Palestinian flag symbols of Palestinian identity have been forbidden anything that can basically be interpretable as anti-semitic and that's a very sort of like wide range of things for in the German Society has been kind of damned I don't believe Germany has come to terms with its past because what they're doing is stifling conversation stif in any progress or any sort of critical discourse and now because the spotlight has been shun on Germany and and German discourse more and more people are realizing that this is not fighting anti-Semitism this is attacking Palestinians essentially Palestinian existence is offensive to many in Germany that's the simplest way to put it really because Palestinians interfere with this utopian narrative that that the Holocaust was at least slightly balanced out by the foundation of Israel in terms of the moral and cultural identity that Germany promotes of itself it's hard for Palestinians to find a place which doesn't just involve demonization or eraser Germany is the EU state where debate on the war in Gaza is most heavily censored France may be the country where the discourse is at its most intense and volatile France is home to both Europe's largest community of Jews and its biggest Muslim population so its citizens are more invested in this conflict than most especially since it has been Fanning the Flames of both anti-Semitism and islamophobia there the macron government has been strident about which side it's on supporting bans placed on pro- Palestine demonstrations by local authorities and much of the media have effectively taken the same view news outlets owned by conservative billionaires have been pedling Israeli talking points and weaponizing this war to go after some familiar targets immigrants Islam and the political left the listening posts Mino shiravi now on some of the factors that feed into the intensity around France's debate on the Israel go a war October 10th 3 days after hamas's attack on Israel and France's most watched news channel bfmtv is reporting an incendiary claim that among hamas's victims were 40 infants the reporter making that claim a claim which was soon disproven was not one of bm's own he worked worked for I24 news an Israeli Pro Netanyahu channel that has the same owner as bfm the French Israeli billionaire Patrick drai it was I24 news that first reported the dead baby's claim babies their heads cut off that's what they said throughout this war bfm has relied on I24 news for much of its coverage and it shows bfm TV has acted as a message relay medium for the Israeli military a lot of space was given to a representative of the army and that gave him a platform to spread propaganda the fact that there is a through line from a propaganda Channel like I24 news to a French News Channel which is required to cover the news impartially is an ethical problem I don't even dare to imagine the reaction in France if we had a 24-hour Outlook that broadcast content from a Russian Channel there's impunity when it comes to Israel senior editorial staff at bfm have themselves taken issue with the Channel's coverage complaining to management about a lack of balance among their misgivings the repeated interviews with a certain Julian bahul described to viewers as a French Israeli living in Tel Aviv or a specialist in his Israeli Society bahul is in fact a former spokesperson for the Israeli military as well as a former journalist for I24 news bfm did not respond to our request for comment however some of those disgruntled journalists at the channel say its reporting has begun to improve coverage of the war by France's publicly funded news outlets and some of its newspapers has been more evenhanded but that still leaves plenty of others in an increasingly right-wing media landscape pushing some dubious divisive narratives I've often had the impression that the French media were telling us a story of civilization against barbarism several commentators have told us we absolutely cannot compare a child killed by Hamas on October 7th and a baby killed by Israeli bombings in what has greatly affected the media coverage is that there are very very few Palestinian voices on TV panels in most cases there are none we are invisible in the French media landscape and so there are no voices to provide a counternarrative to correct lies to correct an analysis that has dehumanized the Palestinian cause instead for two or three weeks we found ourselves in an endless debate about who considers Hamas as a terrorist group who does not who condemns it who does not without ever going into the real issues in any depth 2015 in France we have been very sensitive to the risk of islamist attacks and what we saw on October 7th reminded us of the attacks we've had in France so it was the nature of October 7th that led to it being interpreted in that way even so all opinions are represented in the French media as they are in most western media and as I would hope at Al jazer as well the discourse in France over the war in Gaza is unique because of two factors one historical the other demographic there was fr his role in the World War II Holocaust when the government installed by the Nazi occupation helped deport an estimated 75,000 Jews to the death camps and modern day France is home to Europe's largest populations of both Jews and Muslims that Demands a delicate approach on the part of the macron government which for the most part has been missing macron's interior Minister Geral Daman set the tone quickly imposing a nationwide ban specifically on Pro Palestine protests citing a risk of quote public recorded disturbances France's Top Court later watered down that policy which demonstrators had ignored anyway risking arrest in their thousands dharma's lopsided approach towards bigoted attacks has also riled people since early in the war he has toured French TV studios sharing government figures on the surge in anti-semitic incidents it took weeks of pressure from Muslim Community leaders before Dar manam published the stats for islamophobia which has also spiked multiple right-wing voices in the media have been using the rise in anti-Semitism to delegitimize Pro Palestine protesters and to demonize Muslims during the war the issue of islamophobia has somewhat disappeared from the coverage what's more there are islamophobic media outlets in France the most scandalous is C news owned by the billionaire vanon bore who is a Catholic fundamentalist he has become extremely powerful and his news Outlet spread islamophobia on C News hosts like Pascal prod or Sonia Muk always emphasized that Muslims can't integrate that they can't understand the values of the French Republic these media personalities read the Israel Palestine conflict as the expression of an incompatibility between democracy and the Arab Muslim world the coverage by these farri news outlets has argued that if we are pro Palestinian we are necessarily anti-semitic and drawing links with theories about terrorism and islamism but we must not forget that many people from immigrant backgrounds in Europe come from the history of decolonization we are facing one of the last Colonial conflicts in the world and so it's normal that people who come from these anti-colonial struggles rally around the Palestinian cause there is one country in Europe that hasn't lined up behind Israel the closest thing the EU has to an outlier Ireland its government has used words like disproportionate to describe Israel's bombing of Gaza terms like Collective punishment and opposition politicians there have taken it further way back in 1980 Ireland became the first EU government to call for Palestinian statehood there is an affinity with Palestinians that is rooted in a shared history of colonialism occupation and division under British rule Ireland's political consensus on Palestine is for the most part reflected in its media news outlets have provided the kind of Journalism that while hardly radical cannot be found almost anywhere else in Europe giving space to both Israelis and Palestinians the listening posts Tarak NAFA now on how the war on God is playing out across Irish politics and media it's genocide openly declared and carried out by the aparti state of Israel the Irish position is somewhat of an outlier H amongst European nations Ireland has been quite vocal about calling for an end to what's going on on the ground would you accept the accusation by the Irish government that that seems to have been really driven by Revenge there is a lot of criticism from Irish politicians of the Israeli offensive in Gaza and the overall position of the Israelis when it comes to the West Bank so the media tends to reflect that the debate around Palestine in Ireland is unlike almost anywhere else in Europe you can hear it in the language used by prime minister Leo vka but I have huge Sympathy for the Palestinian people um they've been horribly treated now for 75 years and it's evident in the positions held across the political Spectrum when when does Palestine get the right to defend itself in the voices you hear on the streets and it's echoed in the Irish media their approach to the story and the questions they're asking if you are killing people who are of a particular nationality or of a particular ethnicity that is the very legal definition of genocide absolutely not because we are not the coverage of Israel and the um mechanizations of the Israeli government have been quite impartial I've written opinion pieces that have called for a cease for us straight away and for the Carnage to stop that's controversial in other jurisdictions but I feel like this is a normal logical thing to call for I wouldn't necessarily say anything is radical about it the position is Irish people have compassion for what is happening in Gaza when they see dead children dead doctors dead nurses dead civilians there's no position in Ireland that is critical of Israel's right to defend itself or Israel's right to exist or anything like that there is the same amount of compassion for those who are the victims of hamas's savage attack it's just that I think the feeling in Ireland is that the innocent civilians in Gaza shouldn't pay the price for what Hamas has done Ireland's Affinity with Palestine is shaped by the country's Colonial past and a shared history of resistance to British rule Ireland was Britain's oldest Colony the tools of control Britain used there suppression violence and division informed British colonial rule elsewhere in the world including in Palestine and then there is Islands more recent history the Civil conflict in Northern Ireland known as the troubles and the difficult sacrifices Ireland has made in the pursuit of Peace which some suggest offers a template to Palestinians and Israelis Miracles are hard to believe in but it's worth remembering that we are currently living our own Miracle on this island and for all those in Israel and Palestine tonight it mightn't seem like it but there's always hope and we hope that your Miracle comes soon Ireland has fought British colonialism has experienced imperialism we have our our Legacy of experiencing ethnic cleansing forceable transfer genocide through hunger and starvation so Ireland has a natural affiliation when it comes to standing in solidarity with other colonized people of course there are uh those on the island of Ireland who would find Affinity with uh the Israeli state but in many ways it is the The Stance of the Irish people is in standing strong in favor of of Palestine and Palestinian Liberation beyond the shared history of Oppression what explains the Irish position is a grasp of reality I think our military uh neutrality has a lot to do with that when you see a piece of land and its people being bombarded by an extraordinarily well-resourced military the call for piece is a is a pretty obvious one our foreign policy has been very consistent for decades and not just on the issue of the two State solution for Palestine but our adherence to multilateralism Ireland has has had its own peace process and to do that we had to H get our diaspora on board we had to have international friends to help us along the way and I think the feeling in our is the Palestinians don't have any friends the Irish are seen as advocates for Palestinian rights in a continent that has mostly stood shoulder Tosh shoulder with Israel however Ireland's conservative government has faced criticism from the opposition for not going far enough that the recitation of all of our interventions and char itable acts for the Palestinian people do not relieve you as a government of your primary responsibility to hold Israel accountable to the world for its acts of the government has been vocal but its actions have been limited it has not recalled its ambassador to Israel or cut diplomatic ties like a number of countries across the global South Ireland May stand out in Europe but the discourse and its Poli ICS and its media shows that its stance is hardly radical the discourse and the language that is used at a European level is echoed by the Irish government and that in and of itself will find itself into the mainstream media so we are viewed in Europe as being somewhat of an outlier but that's still a relatively conservative position we may say one or two words differently to our European counterparts but that isn't a huge difference Ireland was very much behind you know the most the the language around condemning Hamas um releasing the hostages Israel's right to defend itself would wanted to ensure that amongst all of that was this the Palestinian civilians that they would have their rights observed under International humanitarian law it can use its Small Voice to ensure that the Palestinians are not forgotten the civilians in Palestine in Gaza are not forgotten you've been watching a special edition of the listening post on the news coverage the discourse surrounding Israel's unprecedented assault on the Gaza Strip a story which has exposed deep divisions within European societies and differences between EU States watch this space for where this story goes
