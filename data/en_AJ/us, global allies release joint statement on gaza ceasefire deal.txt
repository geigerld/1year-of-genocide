okay I want to bring you some breaking news 17 countries including the United States have released a joint statement in the last few minutes calling on Israel and Hamas to do whatever is necessary to agree on a Gaza ceasefire deal that would also secure the release of captives held in Gaza now uh just a reminder the Israeli Governor has banned Al jazer from reporting in Israel which is why our correspondent Imran Khan now joins us from the Jordanian capital man so uh this statement coming out Imran just in the last few minutes uh talk us through what what more you know and whether there's been any response uh from Israel to it well it is a joint statement like you say from 17 different countries they include Argentina Austria Brazil France Germany uh Poland the UK Spain Thailand and others they say as Leaders of countries deeply concerned for hostages held by Hamas in Gaza including many of our own citizens we fully support the movement towards a ceasefire and hostage release deal now on the table and as outlined by President Biden on May the 31st 2024 there is no time to lose we call on Hamas to close this agreement and Israel is ready to move forward with and begin the process of releasing our citizens we note that this agreement would lead to an immediate ceasefire and Rehabilitation of Gaza together with security SEC assurances for Israelis and Palestinians and opportunities for a more enduring long-term peace and two- State solution at this decisive moment we call on the leaders of Israel as well as Hamas to make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal and bring relief to the families of our hostages as well as those on both sides of this terrible conflict including civilian population it's time for the war to end and this deal is the necessary starting point this is very clearly designed to put pressure on both the negotiating parties on Israel and on Hamas but what we're hearing from Egyptian sources is that there is no breakthrough so far in the ceasefire talks we're hearing uh that the Karan Egyptian mediators have actually spoken to uh Hamas representatives and to the us but they say they're nowhere near a deal uh there's also a statement that we had uh from a senior Hamas official Sami aburi On th he says while the group welcomes Biden's idea the US draft resolution at the UN Security Council was dependent on an Israeli ceasefire proposal a mass has already seen and rejected the US document they go on to say um speaks of an open-ended negotiation with no deadline it speaks of a stage during which the occupation regains its hostages and resumes the war so the two sides have a lot of distance between them Hamas quite clearly want a permanent ceas Israel wants the option if Hamas breaks the deal to go back to war Israel's got a lot of domestic pressure as well this is not popular with the far-right Coalition the people that actually make up Benjamin netanyahu's government and are keeping in power they are completely against any kind of three-phase deal that the US President Joe Biden has proposed it's going to be very difficult also for the prime minister to stomach the words to States solution he's been against that for a very long time almost throughout his uh career and it's going to be an incredibly tough sell to his Coalition but this is likely just the beginning of a wave of international pressure designed to get the two parties at least a the table okay thank you for that Imran Khan there for us and Aman uh and and just a reminder again that Benjamin Net's cabinet has banned Al jaaz and Israel which is why we are reporting out of Jordan let's get more on this with roxan for man for man she's a lecturer on international relations off the Middle East at the University of Cambridge he joins us now from London thank you for joining us today so I wanted to get your reaction to the statement that has come through in the last sort of half an hour from the White House what do you make of it and what does it tell us about the pressure the United States is clearly under to get a deal done well I think it's an interesting statement because because it shows that the United States is trying to uh Galvanize its uh allies to um to come around and uh support its view um and to put pressure on the Israelis and I think what we're seeing is that it's a desperate uh act by Biden he's finding that neither side either Hamas or Israel are actually very supportive of the wording or the time frame of the uh proposal he put out last week so I think he's trying to now use the International Community and this is also partially to put pressure on his uh opponents and those that don't support him in the United States since it's the middle of an election year as well interesting you use the word desperate uh he made that speech about a week ago now and clearly things have not gone the way he expected do you think this is going to make any difference I really don't think it will I think the problems lie in the uh government of Netanyahu and uh the the support that he requires from the far right they have uh described his proposal the Biden proposal as Reckless that's been gavier one of the uh leaders of a party that uh Netanyahu relies on for his government and the Hamas uh complaint that this does not actually guarantee a uh permanent ceasefire means that they cannot uh supported it fully either so I think this is not something that International um together uh pressure is going to make any difference to this is relying on internal political faction and roxan what do you make of the fact that they uh that the US is putting the ball back again in hamas's court uh as if they are the ones who have to make this decision to accept the deal I'm just going to read out one of the lines in the statement we call on Hamas to close this agreement ment that Israel is ready to move forward with and begin the process of releasing releasing our citizens uh over the over the course of the last week I mean Israel's made it pretty clear they are not on board uh with this ceasefire proposal well I think that's a uh a symbol of of many of the difficulties that Biden has encountered in trying to put together a a uh a policy on this and um his uh uh Alliance is clearly with Israel so he is trying to to point out that it is Hamas that is uh take the statement is very interesting because he points out that hamus is the one that's holding hostages not only that are Israeli but are citizens of uh a number of the countries that have signed this statement that came out today so I think they are trying to highlight the fact that it's hamus that is the one that began this that is holding the hos hostages and that is why they are able to try to put pressure on Hamas more than in fact he is willing to point out that he can put pressure on uh Israel in this particular case really good to get your perspective roxan fan fayan lecturer on
