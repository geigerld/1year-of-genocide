let's speak now to our correspondent in Gaza safat alut and safat we'll get to Raff acrossing Aid in just a moment first of all let's talk about the situation in Gaza because the skies look relatively calm at the moment 800 a.m. there in Gaza City in the strip but there have been more Air Raids overnight yes the Israeli air strike in intensified in different areas all over the Gaza STP uh specifically in ra the in the south of the Gaza STP where they ask people to move inun five families the buildings of five families have been totally uh struck and brought down in jabalia refugee camp which is the the most gly populated in the Gaza Strip has uh also been struck in in in the East specifically in east of jabalia refugee camp now we uh we are following the news from the Central area in Al Zahra neighborhood they have just uh destroyed four residential buildings uh what they call them residential Towers uh hundreds of families have evacuated these four buildings and now staying in the street uh looking for shelters the minist of Health say that the overnight in the overnight isra raid 33 people at least in ra killed uh in these recent attacks we could we we could still hear the explosions in different areas where I'm staying in the in the central area of the Gaza STP also we could hear the explosions of the artillery from the Eastern side of D bah which is the border line saf let's look at this deal that the US has made with Egypt to open the Rafa Crossing to let in 20 trucks of humanitarian Aid it doesn't sound like very many do we know when it will get in and and how far this Aid will go look from what we see in Gaza Gaza run out of everything literally everything not only water and food and fuel everything including the the the personal needs uh for everyone clothes and other many other things it will it's long list of of things that we can talk about but uh at least they believe here if if there's an Israeli approval for the Egyptians to open or to let the uh the humanitarian EG in which means that there will be even more so Gaza is in need for anything to come or to bring from outside the Gaza Strip since as we said the Israelis have been shutting down all the Gaza Crossings including the one that Egypt controlled so once the the Egypt or Israel allows the Egyptians to bring in the food or to deliver the food and other humanitarian Aid it means that there will be more so the Ministry of Health is is the most urgent uh side that needs such uh such Aid since the hospital run ran out of everything almost okay saat alut bringing us the latest there from inside Gaza thanks very much safwat
