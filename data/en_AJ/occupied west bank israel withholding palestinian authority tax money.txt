these are the first days of summer break in the occupied West Bank it's a weekend and this Cafe is in the heart of ramalan this is usually a recipe for success but since the war on Gaza started the cafe owners say they're scared they'll be forced to shut down we haven't been able to pay the rent since the war started and have chicks bouncing back we have so much debt to our service providers usually at this time of the year they would hire extra work ERS now they've had to lay off half of their staff sua Haj Hindi kept her job as a waitress she's an interior designer who says she's lost two jobs since the war started even at this Cafe they laid off many male employees and needed me because my salary is less for men the pay is not enough to sustain a family Palestinian workers in Israel used to bring much needed cash to the occupied West Bank they were estimated at 22% of the workforce before the war now that Israel has banned their entry they barely make up 2.3% according to a recent survey by the international labor organization another obstacle facing the economy is Israel's decision to withhold tax revenue that belongs to the Palestinian Authority the PA has been struggling to pay its employees their salaries in full which hinders the economic cycle even more Israel has been systematically undermining the Palestinian economy for decades by controlling the Palestinian resources and lands it created a weak economy dependent on Israel and withheld the Palestinian authorities money to minimize its role in dealing with the crisis business owners say they are left alone facing the financial crunch the local authorities are not making emergency laws or decisions to help us survive this tough period one of the hardest hit sectors in Palestine is tourism the Church of the Nativity is one of the main tourist attractions here and a main source of income for Palestinians now many stores here have closed down and people say every day this war continues it adds another burden on the short and long terms one they might need decades to recover from nid ibraim Al jaaz the occupied West Bank Palestine make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
