here is Jam Abu Zuna who's in Gaza so jam just paint the picture for us we have this order for people to evacuate what's going on as I previously described uh people are in dozens here uh sleeping on the floor outside uh the building because there's no space for them with their families children and elderly people who need immediate um uh Healthcare uh assistance uh also now just minute ago we have um witnessed witnessed some some missiles being B being hit from Gaza to Israel from the south of Gaza from canun uh even though we heard that there's going to be a thief fire uh to to let the people have a chance uh to to come to the south of Gaza to flee from the north but um it looks like there's no se fire uh also there's um there's a a catastrophic situation because it looks like uh there's a discrimination between the UN UNP uh staff and uh the international NGO staff which has created chaos and it helped to escalate the situation there's a discrimination in providing food uh shelter and all the essential supplies so J am I right in saying that you're still in the north are you planning to head south or have you left already no I'm at the South I'm inun in training center for the UN right and and so and what did you see on your way down what was what was the journey and and what's what are people doing in their effort to get South okay uh we uh went by un cars uh as we were instructed there were citizen cars uh riding uh right behind us so the Convoy was from the UNP headquarters to the south of of Gaza in hanun we went by arid route which is by the Sea there were many destructions um uh in in the streets but we had to go from a specific route uh and they were also bombing along the way as we arrived here as I said before the situation was uh un Indescribable people are getting more and more in here the the numbers are increasing and um people were advised to go to the South uh to different areas in the South no matter where uh whether a un building or not but they're fleeing the north completely as bombings are getting heavier what about those who cannot leave especially those in hospitals we heard from the World Health Organization saying that it amounted what Israel was asking for amounted to a death sentence for them this is a disaster that there are many people who are unable to leave because of their situation I have personally I have no clue uh what's their situation because since uh this early morning I had no internet connection but we're off right now uh we can't contact anyone unless he's from uh he's calling from a a landline so I have no clue what's happening but I can only describe what I'm seeing right now so J tell us about the situation with supplies and so forth because clearly uh that's only getting worse day by day because no replenishments nothing no food or fuel is coming into Gaza yes uh I think uh the supplies are very little there are very few supplies we have carried our own food from the previous days uh to to um to to provide for us and to to today but I don't think it's going to be enough for the couple uh the couple few the couple days that that are coming uh especially that we have no idea what's going to happen in the next few hours the next today we have no clue where we're going where are they going to take us uh there's no clear plan Jam thanks very much for that update appreciate that interesting to hear about your efforts to get South J Abu Zuna our correspondent who's in Gaz car Unis in the South and let's bring in yusri alul now he's a Palestinian political writer and a Gaza resident it joins us on the phone from Gaza welcome to Al jazer could you just tell us first of all what part of Gaza you're in are you in the northern area where Israel has asked everybody to leave yes uh good evening at first I'm staying in sh camp where it locates in the northern place of Gaza uh situation here is so misery I talk after you you ask me but situation is so misery and I you cannot imagine how misery when I came just uh for this call right describe it for me what what kind of things are people having to put up with uh most of the people here in Gaza are suffering from the Bloodshed from the rockets that and uh bombings that comes from the Israeli airplanes now people are immigrating to uh uh nothing place and most of the Palestinian now are leaving and unfortunately uh the Israeli targeting also people who's leaving the Israeli says that we should leave our lands and to go to ra and uh and the middle of Gaza but they are targeting the civilians so you're saying that ordinary civilians who are trying to move South to places like K Unis are being targeted in attacks as well by the Israelis and as I told you most the the the whole Gaza Strip which is 365 kilomet Square is target targeted by the Israeli uh uh occupation forces and they are not leaving anybody here without uh horror without uh ter terrifying them the people here in Gaza under uh fire they are targeting anybody not only the people who's staying in in jabalia or in Bon or in Peach Camp they are targeting also the people in kanun and in RAF and just a few minutes and they are targeting people fromat where it locates in the middle of the Gaz STP can you describe for us your three what it's like when the bombardment starts and how it is for that sense of you know you just don't know if it's going to hit you or not yes I'm not going to tell you about me I'm going to tell you about my children my my my daughter which is always frightened she is always feeling me I'm I'm I can't say she feels that she's going to die because the bmps which is uh targeting the the buildings the civilian buildings or the houses it's it's something which is is incredible as they say incredible people doesn't imagine even in in the in the horrific situation uh to be uh targeted like this situ we are under uh genocide Israeli uh occupation forces are targeting every single or tiny thing they are targeting the animals targeting the sewi system the the the water they are we have nothing here yeah you cannot imagine how how misery situation I'm talking to you and I'm coming I'm feeling that when just a call me they target my my cell phone because I'm talking about the Palestinian situation in Gaza they didn't want people know what's happening here they're just having their propaganda saying that we are attacked by the the militants Palestinians but are not talking about what happened what is the the reasons that led the Palestinians to search for their freedom search for any kind of to live like any human in any part of the world given what's happening to you yri and all the the terrible things you're having to go through what do you think about what happened last weekend uh what the Hamas Fighters did do you do you portion any blame to them because of what's happening now just before to tell you about this question I'm just going to tell you I built a new house and I said that I'm going to leave and stay in it just in Saturday but unfortunately the aggression happened and and the Israeli occupation forces Air Forces destructed and destroyed my building my new building and I left home to came just to the camp to the people where were millions of Palestinians were I think uh for about uh 300 uh thousands of Palestinians are living in a crowded place in in pitam about your question if I had blame the Palestinian uh militant groups I can't blame those people because they they did what happened because uh unfortunately no airports no seap ports no any kind of humanity you cannot find no celery no cbin no no the Mis situation here in bistan in Gaza especially is is under siege for about 16 years we here cannot leave our land we cannot go to Egypt except uh we need to suffer just to to apply for the the the ministry of interior to allow us after one month or two months to leave Gaza to travel to Egypt and also Israeli checkpoints we can't have the access to go to through our lands to Jordan or any place so if I blame I blame the situation that L this those people to do what happened I humiliate anyone that kills animals even if animals but what happened Israeli killed thousands of Palestinians prison thousands of children and women and and old men Israeli unfortunately didn't understand that we are human seeking Freedom we are seeking un resolutions which is not allowed or or accepted by the Israeli government y we we'll leave it there we do really appreciate you speaking to us there from Gaza and hope for better times and most of all safety for you and your family and indeed your daughter who you spoke so powerfully about yri arul Palestinian political writer and a resident in Gaza in the midst of all this well protest ongoing in rala in the occupied West Bank against the war in Gaza they're making protests making their way to the illegal settlement of bet L Nita Ibrahim is there joins us live Nita tell us what's happening well the protest has made its way here to the illegal Israeli settlement of betel where Israeli forces are trying to suppress it using live fire as well as tear gas just a few seconds ago I'm not sure if you were able to hear but some fireworks were thrown towards the Israeli Army side as kind of a way for Palestinian protesters to uh uh camouflage and distract the Israeli soldiers that are in front of the protesters now all in all in the Palestinian territory in the occupied West Bank since this morning we're talking about four Palestinians who have been killed as a result of the protest that are taking place in different areas here in the West Bank according to the latest figures by the medical teams and the red Cresent they talk about 124 injuries some of those are hit with live ammunition so this is the scene here in the occupied West Bank just since Thursday morning we're talking about 11 Palestinians who have been killed by Israeli forces fire and by Israeli settlers fire remember we talked about settlers having arms and you're talking about a population that is largely only armed with rocks if so so we already have seen the Israeli settlers taking more weapons as politician are lobbying to get Israeli settlers more arms so there's a fear here that Palestinians are being left alone dealing with not only the Israeli soldiers and the Israeli forces that are armed to their teeth with snipers and all of the most equipped developments and equipped uh uh vehicles but also you're talking about settlers and when we talk about settlements they're so very close to Palestinian communities that even if someone is at their house they could be a target of those settlers because they've been expanding in the past few years and decades and inching closer and closer towards Palestinian communities basically they're getting more bold with the increase in numbers remember when we talk about the Israeli settlements there was a time when they were a minority here in the West Bank they used to be scared from the Palestinian presence here but now with the growth of those settlements the audacity of them is increasing we're talking about on average three attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians per day so when we talk about settlers we're not just talking about the lands they take but also the violence they cause and we've seen that violence push populations away we're talking about more than 500 people who have already fled their homes and their uh bwing communities in the occupied West Bank in the Jordan Valley as a result of the violence of those settlers right and as and when and I suppose we should say if the Israeli offensive proceeds into Gaza tensions we seeing all around the region they're only going to increase indeed and Palestinians here have already had an intense two years at least we've been seeing the Israeli forces uh raid Palestinian towns almost on a daily basis killing Palestinians we've already been reporting that to to this year has been the deadliest 2023 in two decades nearly here in the occupied West Bank as a result of the continuous raids by the Israeli forces now we've seen Palestinian groups in nais and in Janine gather themselves in groups and carry arms and commit attacks and conduct attacks against Israeli targets whether it's Israeli military checkpoints or Israeli settlements but in large you're talking about a population that is not armed that doesn't have access to weapons and let me remind you that they are under the rule of the Palestinian Authority this is an authority that has been saying it is not supportive of any armed struggle and we've just listened in to the Palestinian president's statement after his meeting with the US uh Secretary of State Anthony blinkin saying that he's you know the denouncing really uh violence against civilians from both sides we can say that he did not condemn Hamas directly but definitely the statement has something of sort of basically uh talking about the nonviolent resistance so here people feel that they've been left alone dealing with armed settlers armed uh soldiers while their Authority is incapable of protecting them while calling for peaceful protests as you can see even those peaceful protests that have been happening here near the illegal Israeli settlement of bet L are being faced with tear gas with live ammunition already we talk about four Palestinians who have lost their lives just this morning after those confrontations raising the total of Palestinians who have been killed since the beginning of this escalation to 40 all right Nita we'll leave it there thanks very much indeed for that Nita Ibrahim reporting on the ongoing situation there in beta
