for students occupying college campuses across the United States the price of protest can be high there are the arrests a hundred of them on Saturday at Northeastern University in Boston and more than 600 over the past week including two here at Princeton University talk about cancel culture I mean this is the cancel culture to actually shut down any discussion and really free ranging discussion of history I mean for many of these politicians um history began on October 7th history didn't begin on October 7th history actually led to October 7th and this is what students want to discuss then there is the academic price at Princeton where counter protesters look on many students wear masks to protect their identities but still play by the University's rules no amplifier no sleeping and no tents including the massive tent the university put up for an upcoming event next to the protest encampment students are taking some big risks at these protests if they violate University rules they can be expelled and here at Princeton tuition's over $5,000 a year and for many of them it's an education they've been looking forward to all their lives you know that speaks to how how passionate people are about it I mean we're willing to put that on the line and we also know that we have power in numbers that your Liberation is bound up with mine Palestinian activist Linda sarur says there's an irony in Elite universities instilling ethical values in students and then punishing them for exercising those values they are young people that you don't even have to agree with but they live in America in a democracy and they have every right to freedom of speech and they are being brutalized by law enforcement who could be using their time for something else and in fact the fact that we are suppressing young people across this country only further emboldens them and continues these types of encampments and work for justice Palestine that is what appears to be happening in New Jersey New York and at dozens of universities from coast to coast when College presidents call in police to arrest demonstrators and tear down protest encampments the students rebuild the old ones and build new ones on new campuses John hendin Al jazer Princeton New Jersey make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
