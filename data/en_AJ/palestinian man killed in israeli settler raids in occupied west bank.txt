the dust hadn't settled from Friday's arson attack by Israelis in the occupied West Bank before settlers again rampaged through Palestinian villages on Saturday the attack started after a teenage Israeli settler went missing the body of the 14-year-old was found on Saturday near his house in an illegal settlement Outpost bad Abu Alia's home was among those attacked only two rooms survived the fire we were inside our home we were having lunch when we were exposed to gunfire shells and Stones a few hours later Abu alyia sent us this video of the two surviving rooms also being burned he says he's lucky to be alive in the same neighborhood on Friday Israeli settlers shot dead 25-year-old Jihad abuyah two-thirds of the settlers were armed and the soldiers were protecting them the Army shot tear gas and then the settlers started shoot towards us we threw stones to fend them off but they were too many Jihad was visiting us and he just peaked from here and was shot on the spot without doing anything settlers spread out their attacks from the center to the north of the occupied West Bank soon after the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the killing of the Israeli teenager as a heinous murder and pledged to bring those responsible to Justice it's such Justice that Palestinians say they're denied just since the start of the war on Gaza the UN has recorded more than 700 settler attacks against Palestinians rights groups say 94% of reported attacks go unpunished many say the Palestinian Authority has undermined people's ability to defend themselves it's a complicated political situation the International Community is silent against what's happening in Gaza as if it's normal the Palestinian Authority is doing its usual role of supporting the steadfastness of Palestinians on their lands this steadfastness is at the core of settler attacks many say not only in certain Villages but these attacks are taking place also while Palestinians are on the road making it very dangerous for them to commute from one place to another four settlers cars have blocked the roads they pepper sprayed us attacked us with stones and rods and entered the car it's only by the grace of God that we are alive settler groups are calling for more attacks the result is a mainly unarmed Palestinian population facing many heavily armed Israeli settlers who've been growing in numbers increasing their violence ibraim Al jaaz the occupied West Bank make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
