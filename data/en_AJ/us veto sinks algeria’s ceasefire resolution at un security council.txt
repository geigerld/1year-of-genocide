welcome to the newsour the United States has once again vetoed a draft resolution on Gaza at the UN Security Council it's the third veto by the us since the start of the war the text put forward by Algeria called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and had 13 members voting in favor of it the US was the only country to vote against it we are rapidly approaching a critical juncture where the call to Hal the Machinery of violence will lose its significance today every Palestinian is a target for death extermination and genocide we should ask ask ourselves how many innocent lives must be sacrificed before before the council deems it necessary to call for a ceasefire now the US ambassador to the UN says that while they rejected the text presented by Algeria they'll be putting forward a rival resolution calling for a temporary ceasefire while numerous parties engage in sensitive negotiations this is not the time for this resolution which je jeopardizes these efforts colleagues I communicated our concerns publicly and privately over the last several weeks we've submitted numerous rounds of edits all were ignored and so for that reason the United States has offered an alternative resolution that would do what this text does not pressure Hamas to take the hostage deal that is on the table and help secure a pause that allows humanitarian assistance to reach Palestinian civilians in desperate need well moment we'll get reaction in Gaza with our correspondent T Abu but first let's cross over to our diplomatic editor James Bay at the United Nations and James often diplomats play their cards very close to their chess when it comes to voting in the security Council but I think we had an inkling of what was going to happen today oh we knew what was going to happen today and I'm afraid we're seeing exactly the same picture that we've seen a number of times before this is the third sorry the fourth time that the us has vetoed the idea of a Ceasar in the UN Security Council and remember this resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza would have passed if it wasn't for the United States uh using its veto power as a permanent member of the security Council every other member of the security Council voted for it apart from the UK the UK Ambassador Barbara Woodward is explaining her vote to the security Council right now they abstained though even though though they're also a permanent member that would not have blocked it it's only the US that again has blocked this from happening uh and says this is not the right time and says it's coming up with its own resolution and says that it needs to delay and negotiate that but of course in Gaza delay means death every single day Israel is killing more and more Palestinians and that is what will result from this uh resolution it's worth giving you the US reason the main reason which they say is those ongoing negotiations uh that have taken place uh involving Israel involving Hamas indirectly uh and with the intermediaries of Qatar and Egypt but we know those negotiations are not going particularly well and we know that two of the key players Egypt and Qatar do not have any problem with that uh resolution that Algeria was uh promoting and that was voted down by the US just now in fact they supported that resolution and James looking ahead obviously the US now wants to present its own version of a resolution the question will be will it be accepted by the security Council because one of the most sort of vifer replies to what happened today came from Russia's Ambassador at the security Council yeah the r the Russians very very strong on this they're making the point that they were the very first uh in the security Council resolution or draft resolution that didn't get adopted to come up with the idea of a ceasefire immediate ceasefire that was back in October when the death toll was about a th000 and now the death toll stands at about 30,000 so on this issue Russia believes that it has the moral High Ground uh what will happen with regard to the U this us um uh draft resolution it's not actually even been formally presented to the security Council by the United States uh we believe that will happen in the coming days and they don't seem to be in a great hurry uh they say um they've said to reporters they're not a great hurry to see a security Council uh resolution in place but they've put for what they say are the ideas they'd like to see eventually in a resolution it's quite a extensive document the US have presented um some of it talking about reconstruction of Gaza and things that are much further down the line there are elements there that I think will be supported by much of the security Council particularly a paragraph on Rafa in which the US says that an Israeli ground offensive should not uh proceed but there are other parts of it particularly on the language of a ceasefire um everyone on the security Council with the exception of the UK and the US wants to see an immediate Ceasar forced by the security Council now this new resolution talks about a temporary Ceasar as soon as is practicable so the idea of a Ceasar not one being ordered right now by the security Council and I think that may well be a deal break for other members of the council but as I say I think we're looking at a period now again of negotiation on that uh us text but I suspect other council members will also uh be trying to add things to that text or take things out of that text James B is our diplomatic editor there at the UN thank you let's cross over to rafan hour TK Abu aom uh joins us now and T I suppose hopes of a a ceasefire dashed once again for people who were living in Hope yes in fact soell Palestinians are seeing that the uh the the window of hope is getting much more narrow right now after the US rejection of the Algerian uh draft for a ceas fire proposal that might bring an end for the fighting here on the ground but Palestinians in fact has a great sentiment now of frustration as been as they have been seeing that all diplomatic efforts have been shut down by Israel's closes to lay as a kind kind of further permission to continue their atrocities and their genocidal acts here on the ground in sight Gaz as bombardment continue to unfolding all the all parts of the territory and alongside that people within this rejection will be also much more uh uh living under unhuman conditions specifically people in the northern part of Gaza and with the predictable suspension of a deliveries by the world food program to the Norther part of the territory it seems that going to be much more difficult days for Palestinians in the north to uh experience specifically that negotiations are still going on in Egypt for uh reaching GIS fire but till now there is no any kind of serious break through in terms of uh these efforts as Palestinians here are really hoping that they might uh reach to an end for the fighting on the ground but they are completely right now have been let down again by the American Administration to stop the bloodshed
