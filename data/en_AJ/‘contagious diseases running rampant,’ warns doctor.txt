well let's take a closer look at the alifa hospital so Palestinians call it the house of healing it's gaza's largest and most Advanced Health Care Facility Israel claims it's hamas's main command center but doctors and international health workers have all strongly disputed the allegations it has specialized surgical Internal Medicine Obstetrics and Gynecology facilities the hospital has a capacity of 700 patients but since the War Began more than 5,000 patients have been receiving care tens of thousands of displaced Palestinian civilians have been Sheltering there and even before Israel's assault on alifa doctors warned of a health disaster because of a lack of supplies let's speak to do Dr Alice Rothchild who's a physician and a member of Jewish voice for Peace's Health advisory Council she's the author of condition critical life and death in Israel and Palestine joining us from Seattle thanks for your time with us on Al jazer you're someone who knows Gaza well you were there as recently as is August I mean the Health Care system was already strained under 16 years of s Siege and a number of Wars just tell us what your initial thoughts are right now on the situation that's unfolding well as a a member of the health advisory Council of Jewish voice for peace we've been putting out uh an urgent update every 3 to four days uh documenting the realities on the ground from multiple sources so this is a horrific catastrophe a violation of international law an appallingly immoral uh acts being committed over and over again and so it's it's a rolling catastrophe that we see basically live streamed um this the collapse of shiffa hospital as well as three other hospitals in Gaza City was predictable uh if you take uh a Health Care System that's already on life support and then you add a horrific bombing campaign um it's going to destroy the system and patients are going to die patients are going to die not only of lack of electricity and oxygen they've run out of antibiotics people are going to starve I mean it is just an appalling appalling humanitarian catastrophe the the director of alifa hospital was speaking to Al jazer a short while ago and he was saying that at least three new born babies at the hospital have now died due to a lack of fuel and we know many other babies are also at risk what's at stake do you think for not only these newborn babies but also other patients in the hospital if fuel if water oxygen and medical supplies don't get in and and don't get in really soon well you can imagine a modern 21st century Hospital needs electricity to power all of its instruments to do testing uh it just is totally um unable to function without electricity operating rooms need to be able to wash their equipment uh keep the place clean uh patients need to be hydrated I mean just basic life supports require the things that they're not not able to have and many people don't realize that the Israelis have not allowed any fuel into the region since the attack began and the fuel is used not only to power ambulances but also to power the emergency electrical generators so uh it has a double catastrophe if there is no fuel and think about the hospital Personnel the staff is exhausted they're traumatized many of them are getting sick because there are contagious diseases that are now running rampant um there's no way that a modern hospital can function under these circumstances and what's going to happen is that people are going to suffer and they're going to die and some of them are going to die slowly with uh sepsis and infection and ganging and all sorts of horrific preventable diseases and some of them are going to die suddenly when their respirator stops working so there's nothing uh positive that one can say about the situation and of course we're hearing as well there are about 1.6 million displaced people now in in Gaza forced to move forced to live in crowded small places what are the risks of diseases here well first of all uh this is a heavily traumatized population just the task of moving from the north to the South while people are being shelled by Israeli military uh you know they weren't allowing Vehicles so elderly people children uh are walking miles to get to quote a safe Zone and then they get bombed in their safe zones when they're all crowded together in on shelters in mosques in churches in family homes where there are 30 40 people crowded in an apartment uh not only are they at risk for dehydration and hunger uh they are also at risk for infectious disease so we're seeing an increase in chickenpox scabies you know respiratory disease diarrheal diseases you've got to remember that there's no clean water so all of the diseases that go along with a sanitation system that's not working are going to Peak and people are even talking about an outbreak of chalera I mean the sanitation system is not longer working so there's uh sewage being poured into the Mediterranean Sea where people are resorting to bathing and cleaning their clothes and sometimes drinking this very contaminated water so this is uh going to be uh um a catastrophe from the Infectious Disease point of view from the trauma point of view and then you have thousands of women who are pregnant who are not having prenatal care who are going into labor in rubble in crowded apartments aren't able to get to hospitals aren't able to call an ambulance uh the internet keeps going down and this is controlled by the Israelis as well as they're damaging uh the internet equipment people can't use their phones because they have no electricity you know em people going to have heart attacks they can't get anywhere this is what's this is happening right now and over the past uh uh 36 37 days or so the who has recorded at least 137 attacks on Healthcare in Gaza I mean International humanitarian law is clear because it lends hospitals special protections during war and if they were to be attacked then there must be plenty of warning to allow for the evacuation of patients as well as medical workers you've been in the humanitarian field for a long time have you ever experienced or seen a situation like this and what needs to be done to stop this well this is the worst I've ever seen and I wanted just to address the issue of warnings if you say to a hospital you need to evacuate and they have no fuel they have no electricity the roads are bombed where are they going to evacuate to if they are the major Hospital facility for the Gaza Strip warnings are not enough uh for populations to evacuate it has to be possible for them to evacuate right and what we're hearing in fact from an shifa hospital is that when people tried to evacuate they were targeted and they were shot at exactly exactly so warnings uh that's like a false statement if if Israeli say well we gave them warning but if it's not a warning that can be utilized and there's no place for them to go uh there's no place to transfer patients to there's no ambulances that can run I mean then warnings are empty promises and you're still you're not allowed to bomb hospitals that's against international law you're not allowed to kill Health Care Personnel that's against international law the Geneva conventions uh this is just um not allowed at all so the first thing we need absolutely is a ceasefire immediately and then there needs to be a massive humanitarian effort to deal with this incredibly traumatized leaguered poverty stricken population that has lost all its infrastructure uh you know the rebuilding is going to be enormous and I doubt that Israel is going to foot the bill um and then ultimately we need to address the root causes people you you know I do not support uh militant groups taking hostages and killing civilians but people who are oppressed will will will resist their oppression and Palestinians have been oppressed for over 75 years and unless those root causes are addressed we will just see more and more resistance which is their right as an oppressed people okay we thank you so much Dr Alice Rothchild for speaking to us from Seattle
