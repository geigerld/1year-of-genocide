at least 16 Palestinians have been killed in overnight strikes in Gaza City there follows an attack on almasi in southern Gaza on Saturday that killed at least 90 Palestinians people there have described it as a horrific Massacre many are reported to be still missing under the rubble thousands of displaced people were seeking shelter in alasi since Israeli forces had designated the area of so-called safe Zone let's go live to T Abu who joins us from darala in central Gaza so T bring us up to speed with these latest early morning and overnight strikes specifically on Gaza City what more do what excuse me what more do we know yeah that's right NE when in fact we what we do know is that at least 16 Palestinians have been reported killed where more than 50 others were warned in overnight strikes that targeted key centers and aan areas in Gaza City IED ongoing efforts being made by civil defense crws in order to look for survivors but there is a grim reality there those operations are still ongoing there while people are dehydrated and hungry and while bombardment continue continues in the north of this STP intelligence operations are still ongoing in the central areas of Gaz especially with the surveillance of drones that are continued to hover on the vicinity of alaa Hospital alongside with the over the sky of the uh Dar balah town and the central areas of this trip for more than 3 hours till now and Eve uh and of course you know it's a day after the what's been described as a massacre in al- maasi the death toll as we know tck is uh at least 90 but there are still many more people missing yeah and this is the real problem right now resulted from the Israeli attack on alasi area that at least that were're talking about dozens of Palestinians have been buried underground due to the Israeli bombardment that had been widely targeted alasi area we've been hearing from eyewitnesses that the attack was incredibly destructive that people are still under the ground and now they there is a sort of uh digging a process in order to look for survivors but basically what we've been hearing also from the civil defense Crews is that they are facing a clear and notable difficulty in order to recover them due to the lack of essential equipment and basically they are afraid to be targeted again especially that Israel has been multiply targeted civil defense crews in the areas that had witnessed different sorts of Israeli bombardment and also people there are experiencing a a very disturbing psychological trauma resulted from the attack they're afraid panicked and dozens of them have have lost their flimsy tensor due to the attack and right now they are absolutely without any proper shelter as they have been told by the military that this place would be safe for them but no longer is available to be safe due to the wide scale attacks that had been launched in that area and potentially in the future might take place again T many thanks for the update tck Abu is in there in daral in central Gaza and well let's bring in ail byun she's a senior manager of advocacy and campaigns for medical aid for Palestinians she joins us from rala very warm welcome to you um firstly your reaction to the uh devastating attack on alasi as we were saying there at least 90 people dead many more presumed missing another example of high-powered weapons being used in densely populated areas what kind of reaction shall I give when we wake up every morning on a devastating news of Massacre we really don't know how to react anymore how to feel how to be humans we keep uh every morning I wake up really really worried about my colleagues I just want to reach them by phone to see that they're alive and then I'm worried again about the story that they will be sharing but the footage that you will be seeing from Gaza are really we are running out of wordss I don't have any verbal reaction to say a few days ago the UN Secretary General described the plight of Palestinians in Gaza is living as if they're in a a game of cruel uh pinball being forced from one location to another we've been saying for many months now that Noah is safe as an NGO with a team working and living there what can you tell us about the latest forced evacuation orders in Gaza so when the evacuation start started so it's a long nine months of evacuation games isn't it so first of all what our themes have been describing in the past weeks is as if it's as intense as the beginning of the war tens of thousands of people are running to Nowhere safe they are lacking basic amenities they don't know where to go there's no shelter there's no food people are just in the street also when we hear about an evacuation order we know hospitals are also being evacuated so our colleagues are also Des describing images of people hold holding their loved ones who are injured behind their back and just walking to a no safe place to know where to go to they know wherever they go like we witnessed yesterday they will be targeted so people are literally just running in panic hungry injured deeply traumatized and I don't think we have witnessed this in recent history where every week people are like mass number of civilians are just asked to run from a place to another and then targeting them again I was sing um another media Outlet like it's not like Ukraine where there's a bus come comes in takes in civilians to a safe place they just receive leaflets or messages to run where to run they don't know what would happen to them they don't know people can't even run they're hungry it's summertime and what about the well I suppose it's a deepening medical crisis that appears to be getting worse to worse on a daily basis has your organization been able to provide any health care uh in the areas most recently affected let me start with the healthcare situation and then what we have been trying to do so we all know that a famine is setting in across Gaza and the whole population is facing the POS of risk of genocide in addition Israel has been systematically dismounting the Healthcare System more than 460 attacks more than 105 more than 500 health workers have been killed every hospital has been targeted you know Palestinian doctors are either displaced detained loved ones or extremely overstretched with work and many of them have been subjected to torture during detention as hundreds have been detained and the number of Health work workers killed is more than all health workers killed in conflicts in 2021 and 2022 in addition to that the Israeli total Siege means that we cannot get in the right and adequate amount of uh medical supplies a lot of medical equipments have been denied access so we're talking about not only dismantled collapsed healthare system but doctors are really working over the hours with nothing literally with the very basic we have we're talking about in injuries of sharpen L which is the most severe type of injuries what we're trying to do as Medical Aid fans we're trying to get medical missions inside Gaza Medical Teams we're trying to get medical equipment very rarely they are accepted we're trying to get medications as well but whatever we're trying to get in is nearly dropping the ocean you're speaking to us from rala in the occupied West Bank a day of national strikes has been declared there it seems largely symbolic a show of real outrage at this latest attack by Israel I just wonder what the underlying message U people in the occupied West Bank and indeed in other countries in the region that are also protesting the latest strike by Israel are trying to send the Israeli government as Palestinians we have never f as helpless as we have been feeling since the start of the Gaza War you know in the West Bank we have more than 553 Palestinians killed since October including 131 children Israel has been raing every single town and city across the West Bank since years but now what we're feeling with the message we're trying to do is we don't know how to show solidarity to our own people in Gaza we don't know what to do a strike to go to I don't know a protest we are really feeling angry frustrated helpless in addition we are also under attack so the message is trying to send our people in Gaza that we don't know if we don't go to work maybe we show them how how in pain we are if we don't go to our shops if we don't open it's like sending a helpless message that we're there that we suffer as well all right Asel byun for medical aid for Palestinians thank you for joining us on Aluma thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
