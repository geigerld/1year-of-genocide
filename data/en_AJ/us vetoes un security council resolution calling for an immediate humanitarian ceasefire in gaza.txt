cross over to our diplomatic editor James Bay who's at un headquarters in New York the UN Ambassador there explaining uh her position and her government's position but even if they do present an alternative resolution James that might not be accepted by the security Council oh yes there's all sorts of problems ahead and all sorts of negotiations ahead on the US draft this is the US draft that they haven't even formally presented to the security Council and my understanding from the US is they're not in a great deal of a rush they would actually like to give everyone an opportunity to comment on this um and uh that uh they would take in representations from other delegations on it but of course that means more delay and delay is also the result of the veto today it means there is no immediate ceasefire in place it means more people will die in Gaza now the US position was uh that uh this is to give space to negot negotiations that have been taking place in the region um but of course the those negotiations involve the US and Israel but also Egypt and Qatar both Egypt and Qatar had no problem with the Algerian draft uh that the US vetoed uh the US said if that draft came into force and Hamas was given a ceasefire that's the way she put it uh then they um there wouldn't be the incentive for Hamas to release those being held prisoner uh in Gaza that's certainly the the line that the US are taking at this time but it is a very interesting picture um if you look at the security Council table today it's 13 countries in favor of an immediate Ceasar and I think that also reflects the vast majority of the membership of The Wider membership of the United Nations of the 193 countries and on the other side just the US vetoing and stopping this resolution becoming binding international law and the UK uh not quite with the us but sort of with the US they abstained on the resolution and of course James it was a disappointing session certainly for the Algerian sponsored resolution the Arab delegation did speak after that meeting a short time afterwards what did they have to say well they expressed their their their dissatisfaction with the US position and the fact that there is no Ceasar they said after so many deaths and so much time that there needed to be a ceasefire in place in in fact the Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour when he spoke in the security Council just before he spoke to us outside he said that the last security council meeting on this subject had been on the 31st of January so just at the end of last month 20 days ago and he said in that 20 days he said more than 4,000 more Palestinians had died he said that means the rate of killing is 20 is 200 Palestinians a day it means by his calculation during that 2our security council meeting that 25 Palestinians were killed just during that meeting and that shows what all of this delay means I I'll tell you that although they were saying publicly they were deeply unhappy with the US I did speak to one Arab Diplomat who said he could see some change in the US position the fact that they're actually using the word ceasefire albe it a temporary ceas far when practicable the fact that's in the new US draft is interesting and some of the language on Rafa this Diplomat said showed that perhaps the US position is changing this particular Diplomat said to me a part of it in his view is the US's own calculations in terms of their own domestic politics with a US election coming up at the end of this year James B our diplomatic editor there with an update from us from the UN thank you now the world food program says it's once again pausing deliveries of food Aid to Northern Gaza until safer conditions are created the agency says its Convoy of trucks were met with gunfire and looting with its drivers navigating complete chaos and violence due to a collapse of civil order the wfp previously suspended deliveries for 3 weeks after a truck came under Fire by the Israeli military a deliveries to the north have been scarce with residents there enduring acute malnourishment T Abu is uh standing by for us uh in Rafa uh disappointing news at the security Council and now disappointing news for from Aid agencies it's certainly worrying for those that are depending on any sort of help coming into the strip well we have been reporting about this again and again in fact so H the food crisis the acute food insecurity that Palestinians are suffering from the Norther part of gaza's strip and right now with the suspension of the world food program about its cities in Aid deliveries to the nor part the situation is moving from being terrible to be catastrophic as people there are suffering from one of the worst man-made starvation being ever made as a part of the Israeli ongoing genocidal military campaign on the Gaza Strip as we have been uh seeing that the uh the wfb had suspended its deliveries to AIDS to the Norther part of the Gaza Strip specifically that came after it had recently renewed it activities and a deliveries to the North after 3 weeks of suspension where people in the north are completely and desperately need such much needed humanitarian supplies the the record of famine there is unprecedented and at the same time children elderly people and women there are facing a clear malnutrition because of the uh full absence of food items there and with the ongoing Israeli restrictions on Aid delivery and with the ongoing bombardment that is the main cause why the wfb had suspend its deliveries for the aid supplies to the north of the Gaza Strip situation will completely change rabidly where people will die because of hanger and TK again day or night the strikes continue where should we be focusing our attention right now yes as we have been hearing more loud explosions in KH unas and we have been seeing a clear surge of military attacks also in the Central areas again of the territory where Dar bah had been attacked in the past hour a residential building belongs to K family had been destroyed where a number of Palestinians that have reported injured and the rescue operations as well in the area of the targeting continues Amed the very uh growing difficulty for people there to be evacuated and the injuries have been transported to alaka hospital for medical uh treatment but we have been hearing also and we have been hearing from residents in the north that they have have been more growing bombardments in jabalia refugee camp alongside with Rafa District in the far south of Gaza STP where civil car had been targeted two Palestinians at least being wed Amed ongoing artillery bombardment for the eastern part of Rafa in one of the most adjacent areas that separate hunas from Strip with the overall bombardment today the death had ding alongside with casualties among civilians to more than 140 Palestinians being injured within the past 24 hours ter Zoom force in Rafa thank you
