well the US says a Navy Logistics vessel has set sail for the Eastern Mediterranean to establish a temporary pier in Gaza to deliver aid but it's expected to take at least two months for the peer to become operational and it isn't yet clear how the aid will be distributed Aid groups say the move by US President Joe Biden sidesteps the core issue the need to allow in large numbers of trucks through existing Crossings well let's speak to me Statler about this she joins us from Melbourne in Australia is the CEO of ground truth solutions they help people affected by crisis shape how humanitarian Aid is implemented thank you so much make for being with us on Al jazer so what are your thoughts first about this temporary peer that the Americans want to set up is this an efficient effective way of bringing in Aid to Gaza I mean the short answer to that is no but I think the first question we have to ask ourselves is how have we gotten to this point you know humanitarian agencies have been warning for month mons that all signs were pointing to an absolutely critical humanitarian situation in Gaza if a lasting ceasefire didn't come if humanitarian law wasn't respected inside Gaza and if land borders weren't opened up for unrestricted Aid access so of course none of that is happened um we did some research with people living in Gaza over two months ago now that showed a population in absolutely desperate need of food and water I think at that time 90% of those we spoke to 97% even were rationing food to survive skipping meals um and drinking dirty water I think if you start with some you know some basic truths land access is possible now today the land borders are not closed by some natural force Like An Earthquake as we see in other places they're being blocked by humans um and they need to be opened up again and what is going to save lives now is a ceasefire combined with unimpeded access for humanitarian workers yeah you can sort of see from a humanitarian imperative standpoint you know why people would go to the extreme lengths that they're now going to to try to get Aid to Gaza but how long does it take to build a sea port I mean people are starving to death now and when people reach this level of hunger they have hours in which an intervention might help them they don't have weeks yeah um and so I think we're sort of skirting around the real problem which is the land access which is going to be much more Ive yeah land access in all eight organizations agree that this is the most efficient way and the most urgent uh way that aid needs to get into Gaza right now but at the same time you have you know different countries the US EU commission also hoping that an aid route from Cypress to Gaza will open on Sunday that ships will be able to depart from lanica in Cypress to Gaza do you do you feel like the international um Community is putting enough effort in delivering Aid to Gaza in an organized way it seems that every country is trying to do their own thing here I think from what I've seen you know I'm not in Gaza but the attempts that we've seen from particularly you know the United Nations to coordinate the aid that is going in um people are really doing what they can I think there has been obviously the geopolitical tensions have potentially caused some delays in some Aid decisions that could have happened a little bit faster um you know we've seen the The Cutting of funding to onra and then the reversal of those cuts um a lot of people just really scrambling to work out what they can do what is possible um I think at the moment when it comes to humanitarian assistance there seems to be people trying to come together to do the right thing I'm not sure from an advocacy standpoint that people are pushing hard enough for this lasting ceasefire that is needed um as well as pushing hard enough for this unimpeded humanitarian access because those two things together at this point given how critical the situation is are really the only things that are going to make a difference yeah you told us about the the assessment you were able to to have on Gaza about two months ago and the situation on the ground there how difficult is it today to organize an aid operation on a large scale in Gaza given the immense needs that are on the ground it's incredibly difficult I think there's a lot of real dedicated humanitarians who are trying their best um first of all there's a problem just of amounts so the only entry points to Gaza currently allowed are in the South there's not enough aid for people in the South as it is um but to get Aid to the north where people are really suffering convoys have to travel you know through these smashed up roads there's Rubble everywhere they're under constant threat of attack um even just looting I mean this is a desperate population now now and many convoys have been looted as well as being blocked or delayed um people who are trying to access Aid are being fired upon as we saw last week um so you know the conditions are really really challenging there are certainly from our research we found a lot of community groups who were doing their best to try to collect Assistance or food that was available make sure that it was redistributed amongst different communities so that those in the most need were able to get it um but being realistic you know that was a couple of months ago and the situation has just descended since then um it's absolutely hideous and so I think you know as I said before what really needs to happen is a lasting ceasefire not a temporary pause in hostilities um and the need to adhere to International humanitarian law because currently conditions for Aid workers are just too dangerous for them to be able to do what they need to do let alone for the people who are trying to access this life-saving assistance thank you for talking to us Meg thank you very much for your time Meg Satler joining us there from Melbourne Australia thank you so much
