now for 75 years the UN relief and works Agency for Palestinian refugees has been a Lifeline for millions of Palestinians living in Exile it became synonymous with their right to return but in recent months unwa has been facing an unprecedented funding crisis many of its International donor suspended funding after Israel alleged some of its workers were involved in the October 7th attack by Hamas those accusations have still not been verified nearly all of Gaza relies on the agency for basic necessities it's also active outside of the strip working in the occupied West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem as well as Syria Lebanon and Jordan unwa was created by the UN General Assembly in 1949 the year after the catastrophe Israel has argued the agency perpetuates the issue of Palestinian refugees by allowing them to transfer their Refugee status across Generations Israel has refused to accept their right of return samrose is the director of plan at the United Nations Agency for Palestinian refugees he's in Rafa and joins us now live good to have you with us Mr rose on the program obviously you're in Rafa but how do you plan for you might say the Palestinians in Gaza and even the West Bank to a certain extent with an occupier that won't give you full access to those you're trying to help yes thanks for having me on particularly on this NAA day which of course as others have said is a time for for somber reflection it's particularly difficult right now to operate in Gaza and in the West Bank given the the restrictions that that we face on our operations incredibly difficult times we've seen the incidents in East Jerusalem closures that have been a Facts of Life in the West Bank for 20 30 years and a fact of life in gazra as well but of course that is coupled by with with kind of horrific Relentless ongoing bombardments and your previous correspondent talked about the sound of sirens to commemorate the uh the nap but today all we have in Gaza are f-16s and the constant buzzing of drones overheads as people remember but they also continue to live in fear of of their lives and focus much more on the immediate on on on the Here and Now particularly in Rafa where hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people are packing up and are on the Move yeah let's talk about the here and now because I mean un official after un official has been warning of famine it's been confirmed in certain areas I of the Gaza Strip and doctors have told us here on Al jazer that some cases of adults and children have died of famine related causes I mean how is this subject being dealt with in terms of preparation as to when you can get extra Aid into Gaza because at the moment you can't and people are dying that's right I mean we have had some successes in in recent days in in bringing Aid into Northern Gaza which was where the situation was most acute but we have completely seen we' seen those gains reverse completely in in southern Gaza which was already facing a situation of catastrophic food insecurity in terms of numbers in terms of a pace of decline of the situation that has few parallels anywhere in in in modern modern history and and that situation became much more difficult with the uh the the onset of of the uh the occupation in toafa about a week and a half ago and there are really two main reasons for that one is the the shutting of the main Crossing points it becomes increasingly and difficult and and almost impossible to bring Aid in certainly impossible at the volumes we were seeing before the operation uh at the scale required and the frequency required but but the second element of this is that food Aid alone will not Stave off famine famine uh relief efforts require water they require s sanitation proper infrastructure Health Care Etc we have half a million people on the Move in in Rafer and it's simply impossible to provide those services to people in these conditions I jump in there Mr Rose just very briefly because we're running out of time it to a certain extent because when you talk about that Aid that Aid is being halted and stopped even attacked as it nears those Gaza crossings by Israeli protesters or Israeli settlers so I wonder from your perspective how do you protest to the Israeli authorities about this and is anyone listening we protest at the highest levels as the the United Nations we also call on the member states of the United Nations to use their influence and their advocacy and and their lobbying to put an end to this so yes we do everything that that we can but unfortunately right now we are yet to see those efforts yield fruit and we have very very little time here this is an increasingly urgent situation unless we do something about it in the coming days an already desperate situation will become far far worse we'll leave you there for now really appreciate you joining us we know that it's difficult to get that connection to raer with you right now so Sam Rose uh from the United Nations Agency for Palestinian refugees thank you for joining us make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz out
