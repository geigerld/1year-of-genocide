let's take a closer look at World Central Kitchen the non-governmental organization was founded in 2010 after a major earthquake in Haiti it provides meals to survivors of humanitarian crisis natural disasters and people fleeing conflict the charity partners with local organizations to set up a network of food trucks and emergency kitchens to reach people in need the group was involved in the first Maritime delivery of humanitarian Aid to Gaza from Cyprus in March a second shipment is due to arrive this week let's now speak to Yan egund who's the Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council he's joining us on Al jazer from Oslo Mr egund thank you very much for your time I guess I want to get your reaction first to this incident I imagine you and your teams in Gaza must be extremely worried after the killing of these Aid workers extremely worried and and heartbroken uh as we're mourning with our colleagues and World Central Kitchen a wonderful organization I saw the work myself when I was there in gasa we we exchanged tents for meals NC with World Food Central uh World kitchen uh they they are now part of a horrific statistics there are more dead Aid workers in gasa than in other any other conflict worldwide the last years the Israeli War Machine has has now killed more a workers more nurses more doctors uh targeted more ambulances and killed more civilians including children than in other any other conflict we need a ceasefire now and we need a de confliction system that a notification system that works yeah well talk to us a bit more about that notification system because uh the world Kitchen Central says they they communicated all their coordinates with the Israelis uh but they were still hit that the team was still hit talk to us about the conditions that your teams uh the Norwegian Refugee Council are working under right now in Gaza what sort of communication do you have with the Israelis well in war zones we always are in contact with the parties and we tell them transparently what we're doing where we are working how we are working and where we're going because this is called de confliction which is really the notification to the armed actors of of movements and of presence for humanitarian workers were unarmed we are there to provide uh assistance where neutral impartial and independent uh now World Central Kitchen had notified about this Convoy they have declared them themselves they were working in close coordination with the IDF the Israeli Defense Forces when they took the two barges of with food from Cyprus to Gaza you have to work with the IDF because they have they have control over the of the area and still they were targeted which means that this war M machine doesn't have a functioning de confliction system and I've been in contact with the UN and with fellow of uh large non-governmental organization saying that we we need to ask Israel and the US to reboot the system get something that functions in the absence of the ceasefire the system you say is not working Mr egland and as you've said yourself so many Aid workers have been killed in Gaza no one seems to be safe in Gaza do you think perhaps that these Aid workers and others could have been deliberately targeted well I I I still don't think Israel is trying to kill as many Aid workers as possible and it's and Especial not with an organization that have worked in close coordination with them on delivering food I I think it more complete lack of internal information and coordination which is very serious when you are attacking a place with overwhelming uh military superiority using thousands of of bumps having all of these drones like the ones that were hit hit our colleagues you need to have have have a have a working system where there is information flow and where there is restraint there is no restraint here or no distinction between military and civilian targets so what impacts do you see this um killing of these Aid workers having on on operations on the ground on the aid operations on Palestinians who depend desperately on on on this Aid and perhaps also on your operations the Norwegian Refugee council could could you reconsider your operations on the ground as a result of this uh uncertain security situation it it it has an immediate effect on the operations in the north where the fam is the worst the uh the this was the these Co these colleagues were returning from the north going to Rafa where we have our Hub where we have our Central operation from from see we work from RAF ourselves I think it will it it will really paralyze operations in the north where the needs are the greatest which means that Israel must come clean and the United States that is providing their arms to this with the new system that is working because it system as it is now is totally broken in terms of protecting uh Aid workers and without Aid workers there will not be relief for the civilian population thank you very much Mr egland for talking to us Yan egland is the Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council joining us from Oso thank you very much for your time we appreciate it
