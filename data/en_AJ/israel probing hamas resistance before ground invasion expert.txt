I spoke to retired Lebanese General elas Hannah he's also a strategic analyst and told me about Israel's looming ground Invasion what really influences the ground operation into Gaza are the demography topography and geography as well as the previous experiences between Hamas and the IDF which are five bloody encounter since 2005 so I think that what is they are trying to do is make maybe to probe the system to test the system to fix some forces from Hamas and maybe it is like a live maneuver Under Fire but it won't be the major access of or the the main thrust into Gaza because it could be like a deception to fix Hamas in the North and then go back into the middle with where where the weakest point of Hamas it's in the Middle where is like 6 kilometers between Gaza and the Sea interesting that you say this could be a test alas one of the um recently released captives she spoke of a spider's web of tunnels underneath Gaza City how much oversight do you think the Israelis have of Hamas capabilities and tactics at the moment we obviously know there have been failures uh the the Israelis the ADF are really training in say Alim where they have the center for a training for the urban Warfare but the training is something and the real fight is different there is like according to the BBC there is like 500 kilometers of time that's like the Metro of of Hamas and Hamas should have been able to plan for the worst case scenario After the flood of Al AKA that maybe when they pulled the Israeli IDF into Gaza they have to be preparing the ground it's like uh the X and Y and the Z and also under the ground so uh the main issue the main lessons for the Israelis uh with encounter with Gaza one main element that that the urban Warfare Warfare is necessary but at the same time it's costly are they prepared to pay the cost well given that's the case then if we're talking about some very bloody Urban Warfare potentially ahead strategically for Israel what is their next move here I think that according to what we've reading so far by lots of analysis that the Americans will allow the Israelis to really bombard The Scorch Earth tactic and then uh do like small limited operation targeting the Hamas leadership and the infrastructure and then uh uh go back and withdraw saying that this is the our theory of Victories we have achieved our goals and then we go out because the American are really influencing what's happening on the ground
