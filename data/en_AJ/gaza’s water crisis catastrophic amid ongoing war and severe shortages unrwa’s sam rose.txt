oos samrose is the director of planning with onoa the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees you're joining us live from alzaa in Gaza inside the strip uh Sam Israel has been accused of using starvation as a weapon of war is it fair to say it's also using thirst as a weapon of War I mean look what I can can say is that the water situation uh for Palestinians in in Gaza it was bad before the war it's catastrophic right now both in terms of availability of of water people's ability to access that water but also major concerns about the quality of the water that that's being provided and we're seeing that manifested in in higher rates of malnutrition and in outbreaks of of infectious disease in particular uh hepatitis but we've also seen recently dentry and and and massive increases in rates of diarrhea in recent weeks all this down to poor water quality and and and and and lack of of quantity yeah so you're pointing out multiple problems within one right quantity of water available access to that water and the quality of the water in terms of quantity the report we just heard laid out that on the on a good day there might be seven to eight liters available per person or one person rather might get access to seven or eight liters of water um how much water does a human being need on a daily basis minimal survival needs we we estimate in the in the humanitarian sex are around 15 lers a day per person minimal that's Sor that5 for drinking for washing for for basic hygiene and and and yes as you said it's a whole range of of inconnect interconnected problems here that we're dealing with which means the only solution to it is is is really a ceas we've got we've previously had massive issues with fuel coming in powering water wells and powering desalination plants those have recently been eased but we're we're left with a whole raft of of other issues the massive damage that has been inflicted on the water and sanitation infrastructure over the past 10 months the partial Supply from Israeli water lines and and and and our inability to bring in spare parts to bring in the chemicals to purify the water we're suffering from a lack of of chlorine right now and in terms of The Daily Grind for the people of Gaz as your correspondent said over a million people now crammed into the middle area this isn't an area that's built to provide services for that many people so the water points simply aren't here and when people continually move from one place to another the the water points the water providers have to follow them them round so it's incredibly difficult to for them to get access and for us and other water providers in Gaza to ensure that access when people are on the move and they're on the Move in the midst of a of a a very heavy uh conflict as well and very heavy bombardment so not only is it difficult it's also often very dangerous Sam Rose director of planning with unoa thank you very much for joining us today make sure to subscribe to our channel to the latest news from Al jazer
