Israeli forces have killed at least 11 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank on Friday the Palestinians have gathered in several places including near the illegal settlement of B Al to protest in support of Gaza since Saturday at least 47 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank either by Israeli forces or in settler attacks Nita Ibraham is in bate Allen she joins us live so Nita 11 Palestinians killed there today can you just bring us up to date with exactly what has happened well after the Friday prayers Palestinians have took to the streets of different Palestinian cities here in the occupied West Bank and moved to confrontation points with the Israeli forces and tried to show support for Gaza and protesting against the Israeli bombardment on their fellow Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip we're here in front of one protest that is happening in front of the illegalist Israeli settlement of b l and we're seeing the Israeli forces using live ammunition against the protesters you're talking about people who are only armed with rocks if so and they're being hit with even drones carrying tear gas and directing it towards the protesters and as you can see now it's getting darker which means it's going to get more risky for Palestinians it's going to be hard for them to identify where the shooting is coming from as we are seeing these forces moving in different directions around the military checkpoint and around the illegal Israeli settlement and let's not forget that in front of us also maybe we can Pan the camera to show you is the center of the Israeli occupation in the occupied West Bank the building where basically the Palestinian movement is decided the Palestinian permits so when we talk about the occupied West Bank we are talking about a system of occupation that has been in place for decades where Palestinians even have to take a military permit before they go to a hospital before they go from one place to another if they want to get married if they want to register their children in the uh public population registry so add to that the already difficult scenes that Palestinians are seeing and that are coming out from the besieged Gaza Strip and you can just get a feeling of how much Palestinians are frustrated how much they're triggered how much they feel that they've been left alone already we were talking about 2023 being the deadliest year in the occupied West Bank in two decades so Palestinians here would tell you that the Israeli forces were already trigger happy so you can imagine in a state of War as the Palestinians are being killed as the world is showing more and more support for for Israel that these numbers of casualties are going to increase yeah Nita can you just explain what will happen in the West Bank when this potential escalation this military escalation comes from Israel into Gaza what what uh direct impact will that have on the West Bank well it's hard to tell how and when if and if the Palestinian armed groups are going to be retaliating towards what's happening we've been seeing uh some armed groups here in the occupied West Bank gather and carry arms and use that in committing attacks against Israeli forces um so it's hard to tell whether they can do that now with the state of total closure between different cities in the occupied West Bank and we are talking about a population that is largely unarmed that it knows it's facing a heavy military with the most technological and advanced Weaponry um so you know where the power lies in this conflict but we've been speaking to those groups that have been uh uh grouping together and working together in Janine and Naas and people there would say yes we know we are the weaker party but that doesn't mean to give up and for them it is expected for their feelings to get even more agitated as they're seeing the Israeli forces pushing uh more than 1 million Palestinians uh away from their homes in Gaza so they're looking at the situation and seeing that the world saying that the world is witnessing another neba which is the catastrophe that took place in 1948 where we've seen hundreds of thousands of Palestinians being displaced from their homes as the state of Israel has been created so you can imagine that the Palestinians feel that they're totally being left alone K being killed in front of the world's cameras while no one is paying attention to their plight as victims of decades long Israeli military occupation okay thank you so much that is Nita Ibrahim for us in bate L well Imran Khan is outside a hospital in rala and he sent us this report all throughout the day we've seen ambulances arrive here from various demonstrations in the occupied West Bank this ambulance is actually arriving with a critically uh injured person you can see everybody uh all the Medics get around um now what the EMTs are telling us is that the types of injuries that they're seeing are from live fire and they say that there is an excessive use of force against Palestinians um normally the Israelis would use rubber coated steel bullets they would use tear gas but now it seems that they are using life fire against the protesters now right now uh the hospital says it's not overwhelmed but it is worried that if things escalate it could simply become overwhelmed Imran Khan Al jazer ramala
