Palestinians have now endured 100 days of War already the worst in gaza's history in the latest Israeli air strikes 30 people including several children were killed in a residential building in Gaza City another attack in Rafa killed 14 The War Began with hamas's attacks in southern Israel on October the 7th when around 1,200 people were killed more than 500 is soldiers have been killed most of them in the initial Hamas attacks at least 23,8 143 Palestinians have been killed and more than 10,400 of them have been Children gaza's Health Ministry says nearly 340 health workers are amongst the dead and at least 117 journalists well despite growing International outrage the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is saying that that no one will stop his country from continuing the war get are the latest now from hany mmud he joins us from Rafa in southern Gaza so Hanny 100 days of near constant shelling shortages of food medicine shelter it's beyond imaginable for most of us how are people coping yes well it's not a question about how people are coping it's a question about whether people have any other options or not and so far Palestinians in Gaza Strip particularly this small part of the of the Gaza Strip in southern in the southern part have no other choice but to uh uh to to to accept what's going on and which there is a a a problem with that people do not want to get to the point where they acques with their suffering and misery they want an end to this but the conditions on the ground are created to further the misery and the suffering and to push them into accepting it and there is no other choice uh to it so far we're not looking at death and destruction just the sheer level of Destruction to cities and towns and and public facilities to the point making the entire Gaza trip particularly the northern part in Gaza uninhabitable and it created the conditions of making it unbearable unable but we're looking at completely dire humanitarian situations with acute shortage of food water and medical supplies and and and and conditions created on the ground making the the humanitarian Aid of process broken as a progressive American Senator describe it as a broken aid process in the Gaza Strip when he was commenting uh in front of Congress H but there is also a growing concern and an overwhelming fear right now among 1.5 displaced Palestinians in the southern part here in Rafa City there are reports about Israeli plans of taking over the borderline between Egypt and Gaza better known the Philadelphia Corridor if that happens it will force the 1.5 1.5 million people uh into further displacement and the fact that this area is overcrowded a single missile could kill hundreds of people we're talking about a very overcrowded fully packed area very close to the borders from where I'm standing right here we're talking about at least half a half kilometer away from the border line the very border line the Israeli military is talking about and has set a plans to take over it the situations are not becoming easier in fact they're becoming more difficult and just get worse in each passing day and hany the strikes continue the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip tell us about the latest places that have been hit yes well so far we're looking at the an ongoing aerial bombardment along with artillery Shilling of the eastern border of Rafa un and the Central Area there also overnight attacks on the city of Baha and B hanun what seems to be the Israeli military continuing its uh a process of raising more agriculture land and destroying remaining residential buildings in the area again consistent with the plan of establishing a buffer zone and making the part in the Norther in the north of Gaza uninhabitable completely but in the central part of Gaza we're looking at city of darel balah within the vicinity of Al AA Hospital the only remaining health facility in the area and an area was described and designated safe for Palestinians to evacuate to as of these days becoming increasingly dangerous and risky and with the total communication and phone service black out it's very difficult to get uh exactly exact figures of the casualties in the central area and B city anhan unit but so far we're expecting a high number within the coming hours as there were massive aerial bombardment on particularly aloria Fiji Al magazi as well as Eastern of Dar bah City and within the vicinity of ala hospital here in RAF City very close to the vicinity of this Hospital yna neighborhood yna a refugee a camp a small refugee camp in southern Rafa City where six people were reported injured uh no death was reported as a result of a drone attacks on a residential homes in the southern part of of Raa City the bombings continues the pounding continues there are more people are are killed more people under the rebels and uh further humanitarian uh conditions made difficult on the ground uh for people right now okay hany Mahmud reporting there from Rafa in southern Gaza thanks very much hany
