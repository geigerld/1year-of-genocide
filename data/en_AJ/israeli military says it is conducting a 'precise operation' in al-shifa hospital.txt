we begin in Gaza where the Israeli Army has launched a new attack on the strip's largest medical complex there are reports of deaths and injuries inside alifa Hospital gaza's health Ministry says Israeli troops have launched missiles and opened fire on one of the buildings it says thousands of displaced Palestinians patients and medical staff are trapped inside several people have been arrested we're now besieged inside alifa Hospital we're being heavily shot at the occupation forces suddenly raided the hospital as you can hear now there are intense clashes going on we're hearing sounds coming from the gate there is shrapnel falling all over the hospital's Courtyard a statement from gaza's Health Ministry says it holds the Israeli occupation responsible for the lives of medical staff patients and displaced people inside the medical complex and that the Israeli oper ation is a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law the health Ministry accuses Israel of using fabricated narratives to deceive the world and justify the storming of alifa so in a few moments we'll be speaking to villain Marx in occupied East Jerusalem to find out what Israel has been saying about the attack first though let's go to hany Mahmud who's live for us in Rafa that's in southern Gaza honey what's the very latest that you're learning on what's going on inside Al shifa right yes sir well just within the past 45 minutes we looked at what looks like a leaflet dropped by the Israeli military sharply ordering people in a shifa hospital its vicinity and the entire residential block surrounding uh the shifa Health Complex ordering them sharply to evacuate a May immediately to Al maasi evacuation Zone that's the western part of Kan Yunis City now it's important to point out in an earlier uh uh statement hagari the spokesperson of the isra military said there are no evacuations needed for people so people do not have to evacuate and right now we seeing this a a sharp statement ordering people to evacuate just shows the contradiction the the vagueness as well as the the the misleading Narrative of evacuation Zone people are now in caught in between this right now whether to leave and uh to trust the statement or stay where the at we're talking about thousand of Palestinians who have been Sheltering inside the complex uh since the beginning of the war and it's important to point out this is not the first time a Shiva hospital is being stormed in a late in early December this really military uh made a list of allegations and Stor shifa Hospital destroyed the vast majority of its property and severely damaged major buildings and medical equipments inside uh the hospital arrested large number field close to 150 people were arrested inside the hospital one more time we're seeing the same patterns but this time it happens and there a group of uh a group it started at about 2:30 in the morning where a group of Special Forces uh entered a shifa hospital disguised in civilian uh garments and after that a military uh vehicles and tanks under heavy coverage of attack drones and and surveillance in drones and the military Choppers surrounded the the complex and start firing heavily at the uh at the the complex and the surrounding area with there were fired that caught in some of the buildings caught in fire at the vicinity of a shifa hospital there reports of at least 80 people have been arrested mostly women and young men right now have been arrested uh from a shifa hospital there reports of more death and injuries inside the hospital we don't have a confirmation number of how many people have been killed inside but the reports talk about many of them are in the courtyard or inside the buildings of the hospital right now hany give us a sense of who and maybe how many if you can who was in the hospital when this military operation began well so far what we know the the hospital has turned into an evacuation Center where we're looking at hundreds of of this place families from the northern part Gaza City and and the eastern part of the Gaza City the the the Shay neighborhoods they two neighborhood after they were stormed repeatedly and invaded by the Israeli forces on the ground the all ran to a shifa hospital and took it as a shelter now the statement made by the Israeli military it made a list of allegations and the primary among them is based on intelligence from the ground that they had inside information of the operatives or militants inside the hospital now this is a reminder of what happened in in in early December the same exact list of allegations and eventually what happened there were only a couple of videos that were released by the Israeli military about uh the shifa hospital none of the uh allegations was supported with any substantial evidence we see this happening again overnight and early hours of this morning there is no uh confirmation of who were the people who were arrested there talks about the 80 people but based on eyewitness inside the hospital mostly women and young men who were arrested from the the hospital Al is honey Mahmud thank you very much for that report honey I'll go now to villain Marx who is live in occupied East Jerusalem villm what is the Israeli military saying about this operation they are calling it a precise operation one that's predicated on the the presence of Hamas Fighters inside the hospital compound they've confirmed to me in the last few minutes they have made arrests and in terms of the reasoning behind this operation here's what the spokesperson for the Israeli military rear Admiral Daniel hagari said earlier our targeted Mission isn't just in operational necessity it's a global imperative our forces have undergone specify training to prepare them for the sensitive environment and complex scenarios they may encounter our war is against Hamas not against the people of Gaza we seek no harm to the civilians that Hamas is hiding behind now villm it it's quite notable that the the Israelis don't always choose to comment uh in a detailed way on ongoing operations how unusual is what we just heard for the Israelis to discuss this ongoing operation in such detail we've seen repeatedly over the last five months SEL when Israeli forces have operated in and around Hospital compounds has created a huge amount of blowback for them both inside Gaza but also internationally the fact they're releasing statements in the middle of the night as these operations are ongoing in the light of the fact that there are social media videos being posted by those inside the hospital complex an indication that they're aware of how can contentious these kinds of activities are don't forget the medical facilities hold a special status under international law it's part of their statement s interestingly they talked about the fact that Israeli troops had been instructed on the importance of quote operating cautiously as well as on the measures to be taken to avoid harm to the patients civilians medical staff and medical equipment another sign that they're aware that this will be a contentious raid and that the international response may once again place them under the spotlight yeah villain marks reporting from occupied East Jerusalem there thank you very much villan
