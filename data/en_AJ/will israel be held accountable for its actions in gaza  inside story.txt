a global outcry after the discovery of mass graves in two Gaza hospitals Israel is under pressure to provide answers but will it and how will it be held to account this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Muhammad jamj more bodies have been found in Mass graves in Gaza after Israeli forces withdrew from the nasur and alifa medical compounds they had besieged for weeks the Palestinian civil defense says there is clear evidence the Israeli Army committed crimes against humanity by carrying out summary executions the UN and EU are calling for Urgent investigations and the US says it once answers to international law demands a thorough and independent inquiry to uncover the truth behind these deaths and ensure accountability but will Israel ever be held to account for its actions in Gaza we'll put that to our guests in a moment first this report from Axel zovich a haunting site at the Naser medical facility in KH Unis where bodies remain unclaimed evidence of a mass grave has come to light after the Israeli Army left the compound these are not the only victims found in Gaza at the beginning of April similar discoveries were made at alifa hospital following an Israeli military operation satellite images confirmed the exist existence of two mass cves in these Hospital premises we feel the need to raise the alarm to raise the alarm because clearly there have been um multiple bodies discovered uh we don't know how many there are reports that some of them had their hands tied which of course indicates um serious violations of international human human rights law and international humanitarian law women wounded and older people buried deep and covered in waste are among the victims as the bodies begin to decompose there's a pressing call for an investigation experts say an independent inquiry needs a neutral party if you want an independent organization to do it go to a country if you find one that's willing to go into Gaza that is not engaged in the conflict by the supply of arms or otherwise and ask them if they'll put together a forensic team that will go in and do the job and I think that happened occasionally in the former Yugoslavia where you had a great deal of mass grave work that had to be done for investigations were conducted after Mass Graves were found in stonit and other towns in bosnan heroa the international Commission on missing persons initiated by former US President Bill Clinton helped in identifying victims and Prosecuting war crimes with similar investigations underway in Ukraine and Syria after the discovery of mass burial sites many wonder if the international Focus will shift to Gaza the question is if Israel will allow impartial investigators to enter the strip since it already stands accused of genocide at the international court of justice addressing these Mass Graves is crucial not only for the families seeking closure but for the broader goals of finding Justice and preventing such acts from happening ever again Axel zovich Al jazer for Inside Story all right let's go ahead and bring in our guests in Doha Mansour Shuman Gaza citizen journalists who took Refuge at ner hospital for months during the conflict in the he Andreas Kiser director for policy and cooperation at the international Commission on missing persons and in Geneva Kenneth Roth visiting professor at Princeton school for public and international Affairs and the former Executive Director of Human Rights Watch a warm welcome to you all and thanks so much for joining us today on Inside Story Mansour let me start with you today the Palestinian civil defense team says evidence from Mass graves in the grounds of nasar Hospital in Khan yunas clearly shows the Israeli Army carried out summary execution you're in touch with people on the ground there you spent so much time there yourself what are you hearing what I'm hearing is that this is yet another Mass grave found in another hospital in another part of Gaza Strip we found something similar in the north of Gaza in the middle region of Gaza in Gaza City itself and now we're finding it in nasar hospital around 400 bodies have now been found uh covered in different kinds of plastic covers different colors um many of the people have been identified and some of them I have known personally when whether they were nurses doctors patients in the hospital or even women and children who were residents of the ground in nasar hospital there at the same time many bodies there have been found but have not been identified yet because their limbs have been cut their heads are not there anymore many of them have lost their organs and then zipped up again um it is horrendous it is surreal that after over 200 days we are still talking about investigations and forensic studies where we all know who the perpetrator of this war crimes are and to be honest um I don't know for how long the world can stay silent regarding what is happening right now in addition to this Mass grave in nasar hospital let me remind the viewers that there are tens of thousands of those not only that have been killed and injured but those who we do not know where they are so we are fear them of or of seeing so many other Mass Graves similar to this one and what a shame that the International Community is still quiet and is still not doing anything to stop these genocide attempts against the Palestinian people in Gaza Kenneth Gaza is a war zone how is it possible to go about Gathering evidence when this kind of conflict is going on and so much evidence can and is being destroyed well I think what you speak to is first of all the importance of physical presence and the Israeli government has blocked physical presence both by Foreign journalists but also by human rights Defenders and perhaps you know most important because here we're speaking about accountability they have refused access to investigators the international criminal court the international body that has jurisdiction over war crimes in Gaza and could very well prosecute the perpetrators here so it's not impossible to do an investigation in the middle of of a war I mean this would require you know simply cooperation by the both sides I'm sure that you know Hamas would give safe passage the real question is what Israel but Israel doesn't want to give safe passage it doesn't want to allow these kind of independent investigations it just wants to kind of sweep the issue under the rug or or maybe it'll do what it usually do which is to say we're going to investigate ourselves which typically results in either we never hear anything again or a whitewash and I think it's you know that whitewashing which is why both the United Nations and the European Union have stressed the importance of an independent investigation that means not an Israeli self-investigation now the US government hasn't yet gone that far they have sought a thorough and transparent investigation but they didn't use the magic word an independent investigation but that's what we need we need somebody other than the Israelis to look at this and we need access sooner rather than later because you know bodies decompose and it's more difficult over time to figure out exactly what happened Andreas when it comes to mass grave sites and investigating and preserving forensic evidence how crucial is it that professional forensic experts with the right kind of equipment with the needed resources that they're able to act access those sites as quickly as possible so that the sites aren't contaminated yes thank you indeed um it's absolutely critical that um proper forensic um um investigations are carried out there um entails employing uh forensic archaeologists and anthropologists um it is likewise a critical these um investigations are conducted in an official framework so the the question iMed immediately imposes itself I mean who can um mandate um effectively um an independent investigation now we we know that steps have been taken by the United Nations so potentially that would provide a framework if um an invitation is extended to an international um organization that can assist in such um in such investigations now we've heard already that in identifications of victims are taking place place that is um presumably um done not necessarily employing scientific means which um incurs um certain um risks um so these um identifications will probably have have to be confirmed that should also be included um so to um point to the uh to previous experience of course um the international Commission on missing persons icmp has been um extensively assisting with um excavations Mass grave um examinations recovering victims and um identifying remains um in support of um domestic and also International authorities also in the context of criminal investigations in particular in the former Yugoslavia um what is critical to keep in mind is that all investigations should be done U with a view uh of collecting evidence to a standard that will hold up in a court of law MH um it is clear that um um alleged perpetrators have a different um Narrative of mass grav then um um the public or or or witnesses will present and to have a convincing account provide irrefutable evidence of what happened it is important to have Experts of a high caliber involved Mansour you spoke earlier about the frustration when it comes to hearing International actors and rights bodies call for investigations and yet still atrocities are happening I I want to ask you about the fact that after the discovery of of this latest Mass grave there are more calls there are calls from the EU and the UN for a for an independent investigation uh you have the the US calling for a transparent investigation but they're not going as far as calling for an independent investigation do you do you think there will be sufficient International pressure now that this could actually happen or will it be more of the same unfortunately I think the way uh the laws are set up in the world right now especially on the international stage is that the support and the one who is right is the one who is strong the one who has the power and right now the veto power right now is in the hands of the US and allies of the Zionist State unfortunately I do not have a lot of um a lot of confidence that the international agencies can do anything I remember when I was in nasar hospital together with tens of thousands of others of refugees in the hospital and in the schools around us we were told by these International agencies that we were in a safe place we were in a safe Zone that the IDF will not attack and that we have nothing to worry we have nothing to fear however on one morning the IDF came in with their trucks with with their with their um forklifts with their tanks with their soldiers and attacked the people inside the schools inside the Naser hospital and forced people like myself to flee and in addition to that it took with it hundreds of lives I I it's like we're talking about two different parallel worlds here you're talking about a world where Theory and human rights talk about what should and will happen but the reality is that what is happening right now cannot wait for these International agencies to talk to us about what should happen because time is running out time is running out and what has happened in Nas hospital now is going to happen soon in Raf in the hospitals there to the people there and the the blood of these people will be stained on these international organization reputations and these countries around the world claiming human rights and democracies for what is happening right now will be a stain on everyone right now who is calling for the right thing to be done but is not doing it we need action enough words we need action on the ground right now Kenneth I saw you're reacting there to what Mansour was saying um he's talking about the fact that he along with others were housing themselves in these medical complexes that are supposed to be protected under International humanitarian law and yet time and again we've seen these hospitals and medical complexes come under siege in in Gaza will these words translate into action will Israel be held to account for this what needs to happen for this to stop well first and and the point of the hospitals I mean hospitals are presumptively protected they can lose their protected status if the other side uses them for military purposes now Israel has you know a history here of saying that Hamas you know for example was supposed to have a major Command Center under Aliva hospital and that was going to justify Israel going in and you know basically occupying the biggest Hospital in Gaza at a point of acute need at a point where people are being bombed every day you know this is exactly when you need a hospital and Israel took it over you know evacuated the patients and that was the first time there have been two takeovers in ALA but you know when they at the end of that to show this supposed Command Center what did they show us you know a handful of rifles you know a little bit of military equipment one tunnel that a former Israeli Prime Minister said actually you know we the Israelis built back when we controlled Gaza City so you know they've been very unsuccessful in demonstrating the military justification for taking over these hospitals and in a sense what you see is they seem to be weaponizing Palestinians need for healthcare a moment of acute need by depriving them you know of the physical facilities I mean now I think the the w ho says 10 out of the 36 hospitals are minimally functioning you know Israel's been blockading you know really preventing much of the necessary medical equipment from coming in so you know this is um a direct assault on the Palestinian civilian population now you know the good question is well what can we do about this um and let's talk about you know both the international criminal court and the US government because I think these are parallel processes the international criminal court I mean it is difficult at this moment it doesn't permission to go into GSA so something you know like a mass grave which really does require a forensic investigation as we've just heard it's going to be hard for it to do that but there are major war crimes where the international criminal court already has the evidence you know one which is not even about Gaza is the settlements you know the settlements are a war crime they're a violation of article 49 of the forest Geneva Convention which prohibits an occupying power from sending its population into occupied territory Kareem Khan the chief prosecutor has that evidence the people ordering the the settlements are going up to the top he hasn't done anything the other thing that he do you know he's talked repeatedly about this he has the evidence that Israel is blocking food it's starvation strategy he doesn't need you know more evidence from inside Gaza he has that he's threatened to act on it but he hasn't Andreas let me ask you to follow up on a point that Kenneth was making there because I saw you reacting to some of what he was saying when it comes to these issues of international Justice um without an independent investigation taking place can the discovery of let's say this latest Mass grave can that be added to some of these forums where cases may be happening like let's say the international court of justice the case of South Africa brought against Israel accusing it of genocide in Gaza or if the IC were to take up the case and get involved later from from oer uh also going back to the former Yugoslavia and the trials that took place in the he including the the trials um of Mr madich and Dr karic um concerning crimes in and around um it is crucial uh to be able to um provide evidence of the circumstances of the establishment of these Mass Graves uh of who is in these Mass Graves of um um evidence of um um of crimes including trauma so it takes anthropological examinations of the remains um otherwise uh it is perfectly um Fe possible for alleged perpetrators um to claim that um M race are in fact um um and that exists too um legitimate in the sense that um persons found remains found in these Mas Braes um um died of various causes died in combat um were brought to um two two hospital locations um where they eventually um died um and mqu can be legitimately used um for purposes of um um a dignified treatment of human remains on a a temporary basis until proper um um rituals and commemorations can be carried out all of these arguments have been made uh in in uh trials before the international criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and needed to be refuted with um strong and clear evidence Mansour if I could ask you more of a personal question you talked about your experience there at at n hospital and Those whom you know who who have been there when it comes to making the choice to try and take refuge at a site where people are being told that it is protected and yet the fear is that it will not be protected that it will be attacked what is that choice like for Palestinians in Gaza who want to just protect themselves and their family members um I think the the Palestinians in Gazza right now believe they don't have a choice H they never did have a choice before the nas Hospital raid or after it they're just trying to seek Refuge wherever they can away from the IDF and its genocide attempt um please remember that drones hover had H is is hovering over them 24/7 you know in kind of a psychological warfare uh in addition to the expectation that at any moment they can be targeted their loved ones can be targeted they can lose further uh things that they have owned whether it be tangible or intangible I mean it we're talking about the physical impact on Gaza but later on uh we are going to be starting to measure the the mental impact the trauma impact and I think that uh the time for um investigation and uh looking into who is perpetrated this is I mean this is I think I think we're all done with this right now we're talking about taking action and a big salutation to the to the tens of thousands of students across the world especially in the United States universities who are taking on their campuses saying that you know it's time to free Palestine it's time to ensure that Gaza has a permanent ceasefire and that Aid reaches the people there you know they the politicians and those in power need to listen to this generation that is now looking at at things from from from an impartial view seeing the evidence firsthand being sent live on television on different social media platforms um the Palestinians on the ground will will stay steadfast they know that they are on the side right side of History they do not want a repeat of 1948 and 1967 and they cannot do that without the support of people like here at Al jazer trying to show the news people around the world demonstrating continuing to boycott continuing to Lobby their politicians it's important that everyone continues to do that because all of that results in a positive impact on the people on the ground in Palestine who continue to try to hear the news try to get the aid that is that is reaching them in in trickles I I was talking to a friend who is in kanun and he was telling me about about his brother that was in one of these Mass Graves and and and he said that Mansour despite us seeing all of this at least I know that I've seen my brother I've seen my brother I've seen him in in in his flesh and I know what happened to him hopefully he's in a better place in Paradise but think about the thousands who are still don't know the fate of their loved ones again people in Gaza are looking for Action so we are asking those International organizations we are asking the UN the icg to do right now what Palestinians need put an end to this war open make a permanent ceasefire ensure there's a no fly zone above Palestine announce a free Palestinian State and make sure that Aid reaches 2.3 million Palestinians that need it right now Kenneth I saw you reacting to some of what Monsur was saying there it looked like you wanted to jump in so please go ahead yeah I mean our um you know we're focusing most of this show on the Justice the accountability question which is it's important and obviously if Kem Khan were to charge you know Netanyahu for example that would be a big deterrent for these kinds of war crimes but you know I think manour is absolutely right that the real issue here is stopping the killing you know how do you stop the bombardment of civilians how do you stop the starvation of Civ and you know the one person in the world who really has the capacity to exert sufficient pressure on Netanyahu is Joe Biden um and you know we saw that even when he sort of vaguely threatened to condition us Aid if Netanyahu didn't allow in more food suddenly a little bit more food was allowed in but Biden has not really been willing to exert that linkage he hasn't been willing to say I'm going to stop arming and funding your war crimes until they stop period and you know he at this point is still discussing with Netanyahu how do you attack Rafa you know how do you move 1.4 million people to a you know a beachfront that is utterly unprepared to to receive them and where you know given history Israel would just bomb anyhow so you know what we really need is Biden to pressure Netanyahu and Biden's only going to do that if he sees a real political cost for his current AR arming and complicity in this war crimes and so that's why the protests in the United States really matter you know Biden has an election coming up he does have to care about public opinion and public opinion is very rapidly souring on Biden's complicity in these War crims Andreas we don't have a whole lot of time left but it looked like you were reacting to what Kenneth was saying there so I want to give you a chance to jump in if you wanted to icmp the international Commission on missing person has made it very clear that stands ready to um um assist MRA in the uh investigation um at the request of authorities um and that move will of course have to have the backing of the United Nations it will have to have um um the backing of the of the parties um we fully understand that um there are big question marks whether the parties will be willing to um permit a forensic investigation on the ground uh I would want to however underline as was said earlier that um it is not excluded carrying out such an independent um investigation in the short term if um um conditions and in particular the participation or the under the permission of the parties is present um I think that's um that's to be kept in mind and while I fully understand and it's absolutely understandable to to see a disappointment um with um International organizations in particular one has to keep in mind that International organizations do depend on the willingness of parties to cooperate Mansour despite where things stand right now despite how dire the situation is in Gaza are you hopeful that eventually there will be accountability do you think that there will be sufficient pressure on Israel that in the long term um there will be accountability 100% 100% I am hopeful together with all other Palestinians and those who love freedom around the world history repeats itself look what happened in South Africa s something similar is going to happen here in in Gazza and festine it's just a matter of time I think slowly International pressure if you look at the macropolitics it's changing if you look at the moods of of the people it's changing if you look at the media covering it's changing so I think it will happen it's just a matter of time but the question is how much more will the Palestinians in Gaza need to suffer before this time comes in and I hope not not not not I hope not not any more time all right we have run out of time so we're going to have to leave the conversation there thanks so much to all of our guests today Mansour Shuman Andreas Kiser and Kenneth Roth and thank you too for
