well since the War Began on October the 7th Israel's bombing campaign across the Gaza Strip has killed 7,028 Palestinians that's according to the health Ministry It also says that more than 100 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank have been killed in just over two weeks meanwhile the Israeli government says more than 1,400 Israelis were killed in hamus military operation the Palestinian ambassador to the UN has addressed an emergency sitting of the general assembly in New York it follows two failed security Council resolutions tabled by the US and Russia he called on countries not to allow Israel to violate international law the answer to the killing of Palestinian civilians is not the killing of Israeli civilians and the answer to the killing of Israeli civilians is not the killing of Palestinian civilians vengeance is a dead end the only path forward is justice the only path forward is justice justice for the Palestinian people don't distort the law don't bend it don't break it don't betray it to accommodate Israel Israel's ambassador to the UN says the current conflict can't be seen in the context of previous history the October 7th Massacre and what ensued has nothing to do with the Palestinians nothing it has nothing to do with the Arab Israeli conflict or the Palestinian question this is not a war with the Palestinians Israel is at war with the genocidal jihadist Hamas Terror organization only it is the law abiding democracy of Israel against modernday Nazis Iran's foreign ministers say Western Powers have double standards in their attitude to the war it has been three weeks that we have been witness to the war crimes and genoside of the occupying Israeli regime in Kaza and the West Bank of Palestine the United States and several European countries have sided with the occupying regime of Israel without observing the UN Charter and international law ad is joining us now he's professor of political science and Middle East studies at wford University thank you very much indeed uh for being with us you were sitting with us as those speeches were were going to air um they were very powerful they were very emotive the Israeli ambassador was holding up pictures of those who' been uh killed and injured in the events of October the 7th what's your assessment of what you've been hearing so far yeah I think the speech of Riyad was very well written and was was very well delivered also he uh delivered it with emotions with uh appealing to the uh delegates to vote for peace and to vote for the should just explain we're talking about the Palestinian the Palestinian that's the first speech I think it it touched the hearts of many people and that was reflected in the long Applause he received a few times in the middle and at the end they gave him long Applause now we come to the Israeli speech very strange speech honestly he as if history started on the 7th of October and ended on the 7th of October no one supposed to think outside this Frame work he put a frame for the people think only what happened these atrocities what happened to the children what happened this what but what happened before 7th of October to put it in context or what happened what what Israeli did after the sth of October it was completely missing and the most U unacceptable statement he made that it's not a war against the Palestinian it's a war against Hamas and those who are killed 7,000 probably none of them Hamas it's mostly at least 70 over 70% women and children not counting the UN staff not counting the elderly not counting the Ona student and Ona also staff so how could he address the uh the public 193 countries and say it's not a war against the Palestinian that is I found it that's too uh to too hard to swallow M and he appealed also again with the with the delegates not to vote for this resolution it looks like there is so much mobilization from both parties the Arab uh on one side and the Israeli to the uh delegates to vote or not to vote so there is so much and we're going to see that reflecting in the results of the vote we not we might not find a huge number of people voting for The the draft resolution but of course it will pass but maybe maybe with 128 130 125 so I expect along those uh lines one of the things that that I noticed was was that there was uh a repeated reference certainly among on the Palestinian side to double standards yeah those who were siding with Israeli they was the Israelis they said were focusing only on the deaths of the Israelis and why were they not considering the the deaths of the Palestinians at the same time of course the Israeli ambassador to the UN almost saying exactly the same thing things saying it is H hypocrisy to not take into account the 1400 Israelis who have been killed on October the 7th when only to focus on the the pr of plight of the Palestinians it's um a difficult argument to make to a degree on both sides to try to persuade the other to to go with that when we are dealing with such a polarized situation very true but uh I mean it looks very clear now with the number of deaths in Gaza the number of casualties rising up to 7,000 and no one can deny that there is a double standard on the part of some Western countries who kept lining behind Israel and did not call for immediate ceasefire so it shows I mean that is a kind of support for one side against the other the what the Palestinian been longing for is to be addressed as a humans as being the victims who were under occupation and not look from the only the lenses of Israel seeing that these atrocities committed on the 7th of October so that's why the Palestinians been and the Arabs in general always raise the issue of double standard if one Israeli is killed is one thing one story but if pal 10 Palestinian or 50 Palestinian killed then it's another story that's what the uh this analogy always come back to the floors of the general assembly about the double standard both in the security ccil Andia the Israelis want also the deleg to adapt their own narratives which sometime I I found that is not convincing because there is occupation here you cannot deny it you cannot look the other way you cannot deny that the Palestinians are being subject to most brutal occupation for 56 years and Gaza under siege for 16 years these are the facts so why people ignore that why the uh the draft resolution of the did not mention even that so that is where the uh the Arabs and Palestinians keep complaining about this dou stand really appreciate your analysis on this Abdul Sam thank you for no thank you very much indeed
