we begin in southern Gaza where the raah border crossing has been closed on the Palestinian side due to the presence of Israeli tanks according to the Border Authority Israeli tanks are now blocking the main archery bringing humanitarian Aid into the strip parts of which are already experiencing a fullblown famine that comes after a night of heavy Israeli bombardment in ra and Southern Gaza at least 14 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli strikes just in the past few hours the attacks follow a unanimous vote by the Israeli War cabinet to continue its operation in the city and come despite Hamas saying that it's ready to accept a ceasefire deal intense bombardment very very intense bombardment air strikes Rockets artillery shelling tank shelling drones all firing at us never in my life I am 69 years old have I ever seen bombardment like this and I have witnessed several Wars I have never seen a war like this one and I really wanted to leave to evacuate but I couldn't the reason was that I found this injured young man We rescued him but the whole area is completely and utterly destroyed well Israel has ordered at least 100,000 Palestinians to leave Eastern ra since the War Began Israel has forced Palestinians to leave the north from Gaza City to De bah in the center to Kan yunus in the South and then to RAF nearly 1 and a half million Palestinians are crowded into Rafa in the southernmost point of the strip and now the Israeli military has ordered all residents and displaced people to leave the Eastern neighborhoods of raah it says they must move to the al- maasi area near the coastline just hours before Israel renewed its attacks on Rafa Hamas said it had accepted a ceasefire deal and for a short while Palestinians in Gaza thought the war was over but the celebrations were brief as Israel said the deal doesn't meet its requirements the deputy head of Hamas in Gaza KH has said that the group received assurances from mediators about the potential deal mediators told us that the US president is clearly committed to ensuring the implementation of the agreement the ball is now on the court of the Israeli occupation we informed the mediators that we agree completely with the proposal the mediators now should put pressure on the Israeli side to agree as well as soon as possible but if the occupation wants to continue the war the onus is on the mediators and the International Community but we did what we were supposed to do and we're patient we will own our land and I think we did everything for our people and in this stage of the negotiations we achieved all the goals we talked about on the first day a full ceasefire the full withdrawal of the Israeli troops the return of the displaced with no conditions and the aid for our people and a deal for the exchange of prisoners we will continue until the end to free our captives from the occupation's jails we have with us Muhammad jamj who's joining us now from the Jordanian Capital Aman so Muhammad Israel has taken control of the ra Crossing according to them what more are you hearing about this so darine this is what we've heard heard thus far from the Israeli Army in the last couple of hours statements saying that the Israeli military has said that their forces have taken operational control of the Gaza side of the raah crossing that borders Egypt and that there are special forces scanning the area it adds that Israeli military says that forces operating in specific areas of Eastern rat that they are there in specific areas of Eastern raah uh also uh there's another statement that says that there have been many people that have been evacuated from the area of military operations that of course is not independently confirmed but that is what the Israeli military is stating at this hour they had said in the past that they were setting up evacuation corridors but again as I said that is nothing that has been independently verified and then also we've seen a statement from the Israeli military saying that the km Abu Salam Crossing has been closed for security reasons and that it will reopen once the security situation allows now that last point is of particular interest because in the readout of the call that happened between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden the White House readout of that call that happened on Monday evening uh the White House stated that Benjamin Netanyahu had committed to reopening that Crossing for the delivery of Aid into Gaza now we're hearing from the military that they have closed it for security reasons but that it will reopen as soon as the security situation calms down so it will be interesting to see if we hear more about that from the isra or from the Americans in the coming hours one more thing I'd like to mention deine is the fact that in the last hour we've also heard from the opposition leader in Israel Yer leid uh essentially reacting to what is going on in rafah today he gave an interview to Israeli Army Radio in which among many of the things he said one of the things he said was that if it had been him that he would have waited to do this operation for at least another 48 hours so that there would be more time for negotiators to try to work out a deal in Cairo and to get a ceasefire uh into effect so that those captives still being held in Gaza can be returned to their loved ones in Israel right and Muhammad I mean speaking of these negotiations we know that Israel has now sent negotiators over to Cairo but they've also said and besides a comment that you just uh made by Yer lared Israel officials have said that the deal is really a long way from being acceptable what can we expect to happen in Cairo well dar it's going to be interesting to see how this transpires because in the past when negotiators uh and mediators pardon me when negotiators have been sent delegations from the Israeli side to Cairo and other areas uh there have been often times when the Prime Minister has not given them really a wide mandate to fully negotiate um where he has insisted that they continue to consult with him in the war cabinet before they can take actions that that might uh ease the way into some kind of a final negotiation or final ceasefire so a lot is going to depend on how wide of a mandate these negotiators have what's interesting about all this is that up until yesterday even uh before the announcement that Hamas was accepting the deal that was proposed to them uh you had the Israeli is continuing to say that they were not going to send a delegation to Cairo until and unless they had a response from Hamas that they considered to be positive so what exactly does this mean clearly it shows that there is some momentum but how much momentum the Israelis have indicated uh in quotes that they've given to Israeli media Outlets that there are still large gaps uh that this is not something that's going to be easy um it really kind of speaks to the fact that the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under a lot of pressure uh politically right now he's under pressure from the far right-wing members of of his Coalition people like uh national security minister itar bin gav who continues to insist uh that the Prime Minister go into rafah with full force even yesterday on Twitter he maintained that stance and he's often threatened to walk away from the government if that does not happen then again as in the comments we were talking about just a moment ago the opposition of course is after Netanyahu people like AER Leed the opposition uh head in Israel to try and negotiate to make sure that there can be a ceasefire so that those captives can be released so it's a very interesting political Dynamic that's going on in Israel right now and it seems that the political landscape there for Netanyahu is really narrowing as far as what he can do it seems to be crucial hours but it's very unclear what these delegation these negotiators are going to do we'll just have to wait and see uh and and just one more thing to add when it comes to Israel of course Netanyahu is also under a lot of pressure from members of society there who want him to enter into a ceasefire you saw last night in Tel Aviv and hia and Jerusalem thousands of people who came out once again on the streets demonstrating saying that the time is now these are crucial hours and that the Israeli government needs to sign on the dotted line and get those captives to come back to their loved ones um we should also mention one last thing Dar I am now in Aman we are reporting from Jordan on all this because we are not allowed to report from Israel uh and uh and that is why we were coming up from Aman reporting on these Israeli lines right now okay Muhammad thank you so much for all that reporting from Aman we'll now cross over to Gaza and bring in hanni Mahmud he's joining us from murah specifically so hanni uh the border crossing is closed what have you been hearing and seeing on the ground yes well the the decision to Clos down ra Crossing because of the the presence of the Israeli military tanks and we've seen a video of how Israeli tanks and armored vehicle are causing great deal of vandalism inside the property of the ra Crossing just causing now a great deal of uncertainty of what's going to happen in terms of the flow of a humanitarian Aid into the Gaza Strip ra Crossing for the past months has been quite vital even though it was on a slow and a low level entry of a humanitarian but it kept flowing every once in a while providing NE necessities and and much needed uh aid for people right now with this complet closure uh on top of the ongoing intense bombing campaign that is started within the past 24 hours that started with the evacuation orders sharply ordering people to uh evacuate to designate safe Zone into the uh evolving uh events of intense bombing campaign that is started with artillery Shilling and as of early this morning uh we can safely say that Israel military has taken over the Eastern the entire eastern part of raah city under heavy coverage of intense bombing and and and fire and artillery Shilling all the way to ra cring the Gaza Strip right now is sealed off cut off completely from the remaining parts of the region uh not only it's it's causes it's to prevent people from leaving or coming into the G but it also is going to stop the flow of humanitarian Aid that's an issue that has been quite critical within the past seven months and it developed into becoming quite difficult ra Crossing is one of five more landed crossings that have been virtually blocked by the Israeli military including uh the one in the northern part that's irit Crossing in which the Israeli military stated that it's going to allow more humanitarian a but in fact it did not happen only trickle amount of it but this all together has been been causing a great deal of of a trauma on people in ra particularly the 1.5 million people have been displace it traumatized and yet they are evacuating for the third the fourth and the fifth time for so many of them trying to find shelters elsewhere as on my way to this side I've seen tens of cars hundreds in fact of cars carrying uh taking people to other parts of the Y and here right now this is a car bringing injuries from the eastern part of RA city as the bombing continues to to happen yeah so hany when people are told to evacuate to these so-called safe zones I mean as we've been reporting throughout months of this war people have been telling us there's no safe area in Gaza so where do they actually go to well people are taking the matter in their hands right now and they're trying to find wherever there's a possibility just a tin a bit of safety knowing in fact there is no saf place at all in Gaza but they're not taking the Israeli narrative in terms of safety safe zones and safe area across the Gaza Strip the past experience have been very difficult uh for displaced families who Ed up being killed or or or bombed Within These safe Zone within hours and sometimes within days of their arrival this has shattered innocense of safety it created a huge deal of mistrust of what the Israeli military is saying but what we're seeing on the ground so far is contradictory misleading and vague largely the very areas that designated as safe zone for people are not in fact safe with SE masasi evacuation Zone that's the western part of kanun and ra City where bombed repeatedly people in their tents were killed by the flying shrap naels and the depri falling and killing them inside on top of that the the Special Operations that were conducted by the Israeli military inside of masasi evacuation Zone within the past two months just it shattered any remaining sense of safety or any uh talks about there are actually safe Zone what people are right now talking about is this is a war zone created by the Israeli military and you can't have a safe Zone in a war zone okay hany thank you so much for that update from RA in Gaza well here's what we know about the contents of the proposed ceasefire deal so the proposal includes three phases each lasting 42 days the first phase of the deal includes providing passage for displaced Palestinians to return to their homes then the second phase of the deal includes the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the announcement of a permanent end to Israeli military operations in the third stage there's a provision on ending the blockade on the Gaza Strip we're now joined by Mark Owen Jones who's an associate professor of Middle East studies at hammad bin Khalifa University welcome back to Al jazer so um just take stock for me of where we are right now Hamas said that they accept The seasar Proposal the Israelis are now sending a delegation to Cairo yes well we are waiting for the Israeli response to this but let's bear in mind that about three or four days ago Israel and Netanyahu also left Cairo uh in what looked like a sabotage of the ceasefire talks right an interesting aspect of the recent when Hamas said that they' accepted the Qatar Egypt mediated proposal um it was then reported in Israeli media that this was a ruse designed to make Israel look like they had sabotaged the the deal but in fact we know about three or four days ago that Israel was done had done the very same and there was an opad in haret saying the very same thing that Netanyahu had deliberately been provocative during those what looked like positive ceasefire negotiations he had said during the negotiations that he was not going to budge on the invasion of RFA and then this undermined the whole negotiation because this was still very much on the table so it seemed that he was sabotaging the ceasefire deal four days ago and that's why the Israelis left Cairo um and so so we have this kind of situation where there's a blame G going on but it's very clear that Netanyahu as he has been the whole seven months not interested in a ceasefire and and the reasons have been stated many times he does not necessarily want the war to end right the war the the War ending for him means accountability not just domestically for his various criminal accusations but now potentially by the international criminal court okay so going into these talks right so going into these talks I mean what do you expect to happen what what you understand the the mandate to be for those uh for the Israeli delegation team there I think the Israeli delegation team will be stuck on a number of things one of those will probably be the fact that one of the demands now or one of the the the the kind of propositions in the ceasefire is to end the Israeli blockade of Gaza which has been going on for a long time that was always one of the sticking points but that was always one of the sticking points so I don't know how they're going to use this one but the other one is was Rafa what's curious about this is now Israel have actually gone into Rafa or at least bomb increased the bombing there there's the increased kind of mobilization of troops around Rafa they blocked the aid processings they've told people to leave is this a way of yo to train same facei saying that he did go into Rafa and that he's he might draw a line on it just so he's able to say I went into Rafa and then it stopped or not because I think this will be the issue I think the complete military withdrawal of Israel from Gaza is also going to be another sticking point but there might be some negotiation about that I think some of the demands that maybe Hamas have accepted in this deal are ones that they might be willing to drop the blockade of Gaza might be one of them I think that has to be or will rather be part of a political solution down the line I wonder what makes you say that because that is something that h has always said that is one of their key demands it's a key demand but I just don't think necessarily that there's going to be the political support for that demand and it's not something that the people brokering or at least trying to guarantee uh the the the kind of longevity the seire such as the United States would necessarily see as a priority so they might be saying to Hamas 2 like this one is not necessarily going to be one of the priorities in this I think at the end of the day that political solution will be sort of kicked further down the field at least that's that's my analysis it could be wrong does the ra operation pressure h in any way and is n Netanyahu trying to um perhaps change or influence the facts on the ground ahead of these as these negotiations take place well if we look at the timing it's very interesting so you know Hamas said they had accepted the ceasefire deal after it became clear that there was going to be a campaign in Rafa right so it seemed that Hamas were very much reacting to what Netanyahu had ordered in Rafa so it does seem that if that was a pressure move that was successful alternatively maybe Hamas always knew that you know he was going to go in ra then and this was part of their play and that Netanyahu left Cairo to go back to arrange this ra this move I think it will put pressure on them because it shows that there is a willingness to go into to raer and we saw that you know the people celebrating in Palestine for the CI shows that there is this strong desire amongst Palestinians uh to end this war but also at least have a ceasefire and we also know that the Israelis have been very much trying to uh demonize Hamas within Gaza to get Palestinians turned against them Hamas can only you know maintain a certain level of power in in in Gaza so long as they have some degree of supp and Palestinians and it clearly looks like there is such a strong desire now ceasefire in in in Gaza it's it's going to be untenable at some point for Hamas to keep uh you know basically not agreeing to a deal even if that deal is actually unjust and unfair and and is mostly driven by Israeli interests okay thank you Marco and Jones
