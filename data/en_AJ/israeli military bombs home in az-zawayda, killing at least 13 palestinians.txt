to Gaza now where the Israeli military has killed at least 13 Palestinians since Dawn across the strip Israeli forces struck a home in the AL zaa area in central Gaza killing at least eight people and injuring others three other Palestinians were killed in two separate attacks there let's go live to our correspondent thadak Abu aom he's joining us from De albala in central Gaza thadak more deadly air strikes on people's homes and Refugee and displacement camps yeah that's right Elizabeth that is the reality every morning and every minute in the strip where bombardment and air strikes do not witness any sort of lit up till now what we do know exactly Elizabeth regarding the overnight strikes is that the Israeli Army and the fight Jets have targeted a residential house in anat Refugee attack at refugee camp where at least eight Palestinians have been reported killed but surprisingly there is a very notable surge of Israeli attack on that very densely populated Camp which is right now hosting thousands of Palestinians families in that corner of this strip now we are talking about Amos also was targeted in that camp at least two Palestinians were killed another residential flat was hit without any casualties being reported but the Grim reality is that we are talking about a very dramatic surge of attacks on evacuation centers that are run by the United Nations and that's absolutely a very devastating and had a br negative impact on the safety of those civilians they were told by the military to go there in order to get their own safety but what we do know from sources that at least six schools were targeted during the past 10 days and this this number is unprecedented in a very particular part of the strep since the beginning of the conflict we're talking about dozens of families have been right now become Without Shelter and dozens of Palestinians in fact have were killed and we are talking about a blent of injuries arrived to the al- AA Hospital in order to get treatment resulted from the Israeli attacks on that corner of the strip but obviously Elizabeth it seems that Israel is mounting more pressure in areas where people recently started to take as an evacuation Center they'd like to get penit from that within the negotiations that they are still ongoing in K doab between Hamas and Israel in order to reach to a ceasefire deal but what we do know is that the Israeli Prime Minister and also military officials and the Israeli Army said that if this round of negotiations will come to an end without preaching for a ceasefire or deal with Hamas it means that there is going to be a more expansion of the fighting to reach these densely populated areas all right thic so that's the latest on the attacks across the trip we're also hearing just in the last half an hour or so that a number of Palestinians who were held prisoner by Israel prisoners by Israel have been released and I hear that they've actually been arriving at the hospital behind you alaka Hospital in there Al Bala what are you seeing yeah that's quite right as you can clearly see at the back ground the families of those Palestinian captives who have been released today came in order to check on their beloved ones who have been away from them for more than uh 5 months some of them we really have just spoken to they were in a very measurable condition to due to the high intensity of torture they were witnessing in the Israeli jails but they have been so uh very exhausted because they are suffering from a very clean malnutrition due to the very uh bad quality of food being provided for them in Israeli jails and we're talking about 16 Palestinian captives and prisoners being released today only and right now they are getting medical check inside Al AA Hospital in order to make sure that they are medically stable but obviously what we do know from them is that some of them did not know where they were in the Israeli detention camps they do not know the area that they were arrested in specifically that due to the uh wide scale aggressive procedures being taken by the authorities of prisons in the Israelis territories and basically those Palestinians are absolutely have been exhausted and at the same time they are trying to take more time to recover with different signs on the hands for being uh handc and there with the uh with different signs also of torture on their backs chests and evil legs due to the uh uh very unprecedented difficult beers that they witnessed in the Israeli JS but uh basically this is the reality for every single Palestinian who is getting out from the Israeli jails they are they have been saying that it was incredibly a miracle for them to get out from there alive as they are also saying that there are still hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and captives behind the Israeli par are witnessing the worst kind ever of it treatment by the Israeli Army thuk thank you very much for that that is thuk abaz with all the latest
