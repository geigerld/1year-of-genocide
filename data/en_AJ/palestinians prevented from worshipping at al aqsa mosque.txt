only 5,000 worshippers have been able to perform Friday praise at the alaa mosque due to restrictions sahat isn't occupied East Jerusalem near the AL aamos compound where Israeli forces fired tear gas on worshippers going to Friday prayers we're just going to get out of the way cuz the smelly water tank is coming over we don't want to get sprayed by that but Samir will show you as it's coming tear gas has been fired and that's the skunk water spray oh you've just seen a cameraman fall there this is the scene that we're seeing every single week now every Friday prayer surprisingly earlier we didn't see anything happening and we were surprised it seemed really quiet as soon as the worshippers left M this is what happened we suddenly saw the Israeli forces heading down here this is WHYY draws just up the road there is occupied East Jerusalem that tank there this is the one that comes out every single week to this area it stinks it smells really bad and they spray all of the streets here earlier last week we were seeking to one of the guys who told us that it really affects their business because no one wants to come down this route I just want to give you an idea of what happens tear gas has just been fired there I want to give you an idea of why this happens every week every week young worshippers try to head to Al AA mosque just there up the road they are prevented from reaching there they don't even manage to get close enough because the Israeli forces every single Friday push them back with tear gas and with this uh water now they only allow those that are older in age to get past and then what you often see is those above the age of 60 we're being moved now and this is the kind of attitude they've had towards the Press we're moving we're moving don't worry no need to push this is the attitude they have towards the media like ourselves yesterday we tried to cover a march by Ultra nationalists uh heading towards the old Damascus gate which was incredibly controversial and inflammatory and even then the police told us that we had to move further back we explained to them we didn't have a good view and they said that that was the destruction to push us back we've seen some of our colleagues last week when they went to visit Palestinian prisoners being released as part of that ceasefire they were also uh manhandled by the Israeli forces and this just gives you an idea of the atmosphere in occupied East Jerusalem as well as the occupied territories people are shutting their stores early for fear of things like this of scenes like this they are worried will be arrested any moment just for crossing the road as one person told us and throwing rubbish they were questioned over that and they were uh given a showdown and then were threatened to be arrested you have them turning up preventing anyone from posting on social media in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza
