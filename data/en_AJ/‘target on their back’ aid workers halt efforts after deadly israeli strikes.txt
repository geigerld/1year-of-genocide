well after a Monday's attack the world Central Kitchen suspended its operations in Gaza and displaced Palestinians say that they fear attacks like these will lead to further suffering let's take a look at other aid aid agencies who face similar challenges there is the American neare East Refugee Aid agency and it's decided to stop its operations in Gaza altogether the aid group had provided an average of 150,000 meals a day in partnership with the world Central Kitchen in February the UN Agency for pal Ian refugees unwa suspended its Aid operations to Northern Gaza and this came after what it called a collapse of civil order and prevention of safe passage for its trucks and other organizations like the International Medical Corps which has one of the largest field hospitals in ra is also thinking its humanitarian work in Gaza we'll now speak to Sandra Rashid who's a Palestine country director for the NGO the American neare East Refugee Aid she joins us from ramala that's in the occupied West Bank uh Sandra Rashid thanks for your time with us so at a time when we hear over and over that humanitarian Aid has to be scaled up in Gaza because the needs are so immense Aid organizations like yours have decided to stop the humanitarian work um what impact do you think this is going to have on Palestinians in Gaza yeah thank you thank you for having me I think the the long-term impacts are going to be dire we already know that the situation on the ground is extremely difficult even when anera was providing close to 150,000 meals a day wck was providing um as much and more and now we are suspending we have not completely stopped we're taking a pause right now to see and to evaluate the safety of our staff our staff have guided our work and they themselves feel like there's a Target on their backs and have requested that we take a pause so that we can ensure their safety So when you say you take a pause can you give us some sort of idea how long that suspension is going to last you know this all depends on um the Israeli side it the indiscriminate killing that's been taking on uh taking place in the last six months uh your colleague let you know that there was 173 unaa humanitarian Aid workers killed in the last six months but that number is over 200 for all humanitarian Aid workers where we also see a high rise of killings in for medical profession journalists um civilians children we are waiting to have some Assurance from Israel and from the International Community that doing this life-saving work will not constitute putting a Target on our staff's back so as of today have you asked the Israelis and the International Community for those assurances and if you have have you gotten a response and what has it been we've been in discussion with um both the Israelis and uh the International Community Community we we're talking on various levels and I think that um what was said earlier is that the world is in shock I think the more that we have time to process this the more surprising and shocking that it is these are three convoys that were hit by three different bombs um as you mentioned through the roof of their car which indicates a targeted killing um we are all Reeling I think this is going to take some some time from um the International Community um I would hope it wouldn't take too much time but time from the International Community in Israel to ensure that they would secure the safety of our staff you touched upon this in the beginning uh the impact that it would have on people in Gaza um I wonder if you can just expand on this a little bit and tell us what impact uh suspensions like these have on Aid distribution efforts in the Gaza Strip and particularly in the north of the country where uh we understand for a while now very very little Aid has been able to reach the North yes this is true um we as an era were providing 20,000 hot meals in the north every day uh we were working with wfp and other convoys to provide trucks and commodities to the north this is all stopped the situation as I mentioned is extremely dire we see that there is starvation there are over 45 thou 45 cases recorded of death by starvation so far and this is uh what we see due to strictly starvation we don't know how many deaths are related to malnutrition um the situation in terms of not having food supplied through our kitchens or through food par Parcels is extremely critical this was a very hard decision for us to take we know that um the situation Ona it keeps getting worse the situation gets worse by the day uh but as I mentioned we were forced to do this this is something that we were forced to do to ensure our safety um as an as a your Palestine country director and as an aid worker what do you think Israel is trying to achieve by targeting Aid workers in the Gaza Strip I think that what we see is a pattern of targeting humanitarian medical journalist staff I don't to have I I'm not in the heads of Israel intelligence or strategist to understand what what the purp is but we do see a clear pattern of this happening okay we'll leave it there Sandra Rashid we thank you so much for speaking to us from and the occupied West
