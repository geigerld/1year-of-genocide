okay I'm just going to jump in there because the UN Secretary General is talking and we just want to hear what he has to say sadly these sadly these numbers are expected to rise as the attacks are ongoing and many remain unaccounted for in addition over 100 possibly more Israelis civilians and military have been reported captured by armed groups including cluding women children and the elderly some are being held hostage inside Israel and many others have been taken inside the Gaza Strip meanwhile amas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad have launched thousands of indiscriminate rockets that have reached Central Israel including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem I recognize the legitimate grievances of the Palestinian people but nothing can justify these acts of Terror and the killing maming and Abduction of civilians I reiterate my call to immediately seize these attacks and release all hostages in the face of these unprecedented attacks Israeli air strikes have pounded Gaza I'm deeply alarmed by reports of over 500 Palestinians including women and children killed in Gaza and over 3,000 injured unfortunately these numbers are Rising by the minute as Israeli operations continue while I recognize Israel's legitimate security concerns I also remind Israel that military operations must be conducted in strict accordance with International humanitarian law civilians must be respected and protected at all times civilian infrastructure must never be a Target and we already have reports of Israeli missiles striking Health Facilities inside Gaza as well as multi stored residential towers and a mosque two un schools Sheltering displaced families in Gaza were also hit some 137,000 people are currently Sheltering in unra facilities with the number increasing as heavy shelling and air strikes continue I deeply distressed by today's announcement that Israel will initiate a Complete Siege of the Gaza Strip nothing allowed in no electricity food or fuel the humanitarian situation in Gaza was extremely dire before these hostilities now it will only deteriorate exponentially medical equipment food Fel and other humanitarian supplies are desperately needed along with excess for humanitarian Personnel relief and entry of essential supplies into Gaza must be facilitated and the UN will continue efforts to provide Aid to respond to this needs and I urge all sides and relevant parties to allow United Nations access to deliver urgent humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians trapped and helpless in the Gaza Street and I appeal to the International Community to mobilize immediate humanitarian support for these efforts the UN special coordinator and I are engaging with leaders in the region to express our concern our outrage and to advance effort to avoid any spillover to The Wider Middle East even in these worst of times and perhaps especially in the most trying moments it is vital to look to the long-term Horizon and avoid irreversible action that would embolden extremists and doom any prospects for lasting peace this most recent violence does not come in a vacuum the reality is that it grows out of a longstanding conflict with a 56 a long occupation and no political ending sight it's time to end this vicious circle of Bloodshed hatred and polarization Israel must see its legitimate needs for security materialized and Palestinians must see a clear perspective for the establishment of their own State realized only a negotiated piece that fulfills the legitimate National aspirations of Palestinians and Israelis together with their security alike the longal vision of a two-state solution in line with United Nations resolutions international law and previous agreements can bring long-term stability to the people of this land and wider middle east region thank you thank you sir thank you very much that was uh as spe given by the UN Secretary General Antonio GES he was addressing the situ situation there in Gaza and Israel saying he's deeply concerned by events recognizes the Grievances on both sides but calls for an end to attacks from both sides let's bring in shab bransi he's live for us at the United Nations she had what gueras was saying is pretty much in line isn't it with what one would expect to hear from the United Nations right but you I know you just missed that the right the beginning of that statement so just to just to summarize what he said he said he he just concluded an extraordinary meeting of senior un leaders to discuss the unprecedented developments in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory and then he repeated what he said was this quote utter condemnation of the abor attacks by Hamas and others against Israeli towns and Villages and I think then you kind of pretty much you pretty much caught up with with the statement as you say yes what what does the UN security Secretary General do he repeats the the importance of international humanitarian law he the the the need for proportionality and the Geneva conventions to be respected at a time though he's he's doing this though when clearly the Israelis and the Israeli defense Ministry have already said they are going to intensify the siege of Gaza the defense Min the defense minister in Israel called the Palestinians animals so clearly this is directly a violation already of international law and humanitarian law and proportionality but but we saw there the Secretary General then sort of balancing things out by saying well we're very concerned about the siege we want to continue un deliveries into into Gaza but meanwhile even the Palestinians aspirations you know while um while legitimate security legitimate um legitimate grievances they can't justify acts of Terror towards Israel as well so it's called classic un Secretary General even as we see the utter flouting of everything that the United Nations actually stands for and sheab what about the UN Security Council that's what we're hearing from the Secretary General what are we hearing from the council nothing now nothing today we did have that meeting those closed consultations on on Sunday and it was striking though whom we heard from we heard from the US ambassador who had a very different message to the UN Secretary General his message was pretty much just the green for the US for Israel to do anything it basically wants we heard from the Israeli ambassador to the UN who wasn't at those closed consultations who said that go all of Gaza was part of the Hamas War Machine and would now be a Target we heard from the Palestinian Mission which said effectively we've been warning you about this might happen the Palestinians are going to try and achieve their aspirations by one way or another we kept on saying give let's go the peaceful route it's still not too late for the peaceful route but you know we did warn you over over and over again here and we heard from the Chinese and Russians the Chinese saying it would be good to have a security Council statement they're against any violence against civilians the Russians saying look this is just a result of Decades of Us's stewardship of the Middle East peace process we need an immediate ceasefire and we need immediate negotiations so it's interesting and the UAE actually also spoke the Ambassador there who who said look we want an end to the violence and end to attacks on civilians so those who chose to speak in the main who aren't either the Israelis or the US were were were saying we need pause against in the violence but the US and Israel clearly had had a completely different message okay sheab branzi joining us live from the United Nations thanks very much sheab
