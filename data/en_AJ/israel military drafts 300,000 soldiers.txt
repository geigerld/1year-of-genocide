Israel has now imposed what it calls a total blockade of The Enclave cutting off food Fuel and power Israel is threatening further military action and is calling up 300,000 reservists they're being reinforced or those reinforcements rather are being sent to Southern Israel and the military says it has taken control of those border towns which were overrun by Hamas gunman but there are reports that some fighting is ongoing for the latest let's bring in villain Marx who joins us from West Jerusalem Complete Siege what are you hearing on the ground there so the defense minister yav Gan has been speaking over the last couple of hours following a security assessment with the Israeli military's command in the south of Israel he's been talking in quite Stark language about what the Israeli military and other agencies will be doing he said that he has ordered a full Siege on the Gaza Strip quote no power no food no gas no electricity everything is closed we are fighting he says Human animals and we act accordingly the death toll amongst Israelis has now risen above 800 and there is a very clear sense of anger amongst the people I speak to here in West Jerusalem in conversations many of them saying they are prepared for the Israeli military to carry out what they acknowledged would constitute war crimes in Gaza if it was able to achieve what they would like to see many of them telling me which is the destruction of the Armed faction Hamas inside the Gaza Strip politically this is a very complex moment for Mr Netanyahu the Prime Minister here because he's meeting with some of his political opponents through Representatives trying to figure out whether there is the possibility of creating an emergency Unity cabinet essentially uniting different political parties behind the Israeli military in particular ahead of what could be a very difficult few days ahead of them Israel has a huge pool of reservists to draw on as we've been reporting how is that playing out on the ground it's likely to be likely going to be quite a logistic feat yeah they've announced over the course of the last few hours 300,000 reservists have now been called up there is a huge pool of people across this country who've served in the isra military at some point typically during their younger years many of them choose to remain as active reservists meaning they can be called upon during situations like this that will happen through phone calls emails even text messages they'll be informed that they are being called up they will then have to report to a local office and essentially then be deployed to their unit wherever that may be many of those of course in that area around Gaza but let's not forget because of a military activity involving the Israeli military and Hezbollah in the North North of Israel Southern Lebanon also quite significant numbers of both weaponry and Personnel being deployed up to Israel's northern border as well some of the discussions have centered around how this attack on Saturday has somewhat unified the Israeli government and politicians there is that what you're hearing over the course of this year you know essentially this government that Mr Netanyahu lead is a very narrow majority inside the keset the Israeli Parliament he's had to Ally himself with some Far Right parties and that has created a huge amount of dissatisfaction amongst many ordinary Israelis who' not voted for Mr netanyahu's liud party and the challenge throughout the last few months has been for Mr Netanyahu to try and find common ground with his political opponents we've not seen very much of that until this past weekend several senior opposition leaders now saying they are prepared to work with Mr Netanyahu in some kind of emergency government Emily except for one of them in particular saying he would attach conditions to any kind of cooperation Mr yed saying that he would only take part in an emergency government with Netanyahu if Mr Netanyahu was to fire some of his most senior ministers from his far-right Alliance parties and that's not something that's going to be taken lightly by Mr Netanyahu given his razor thin majority in the conet vill I want to ask you another question but before I do I just want to remind our audience that some of the pictures that they're seeing on their screen are quite harrowing and viewer discretion uh should be advised or it should be observed at this point because they really are quite devastating images uh returning to you now villum where to from here we're hearing there could be plan plans of a ground invasion of Gaza obviously the intelligence from the Israeli military will be tight lipped they'll be keeping their cards close to their chest but have you heard any intel from that perspective given that there are hundreds of thousands of reservers being called up no specific Intel but you know it's very clear that when you have that kind of operation in mind you will need vast numbers of ground forces infantry in particular in order to try and intrude on such a massive area very heavy po heavily populated area we've seen just continued air strikes so far but the quantity of Tanks armored personnel carriers artillery that seem to be massing close to Gaza according to our colleague Charlie statford Who's down near sedot at the moment seems to indicate that a ground Invasion an incursion inside Gaza past that barrier fence that Hamas itself breached several places over the course of the weekend cannot be ruled out at this point okay thanks so much for bringing us up to speed vill marks in West Jerusalem
