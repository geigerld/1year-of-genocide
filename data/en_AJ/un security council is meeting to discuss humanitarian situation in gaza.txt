Agency for Palestine refugees in the near East to participate in this meeting it is so decided in accordance with rule 39 of the council's provisional rules of procedure I also invite his Excellency Mr stavos Lain heis head of the delegation of the European Union to the United Nations to participate in this decided the security Council will now begin its consideration of item two of the agenda and I now give the floor to Mr Philip larini Mr President member of the council this is a time of seismic change in the Middle East at the heart of this region the United Nation agency for Palestine refugees unoa is a stabilizing force in Gaza the agency is the backbone of the human turn operation coordinating and providing life saving assistance Beyond Gaza it has championed human development for pales refugees for decades across the region today an Insidious campaign to end un's operation is on the way with serious implication for International Peace and security it is in this cont context that the council is asked to consider the existential challenges confronting the agency Mr President 6 months of Relentless bombardment and a mercil Siege have transformed G Gaza beyond recognition homes schools and hospitals have been reduced to Rubble under which countless bodies lies children are bearing the brunt of this war more than 177,000 are separated from their families left to face the horror of Gaza alone children are killed injured and starved deprived of any physical or psychological safety across Gaza a man made famine is tightening tightening its grip in the north infant and young children have begun to die of malnutrition and dehydration across the border food and clean water weight but un is denied permission to deliver this Aid and save lives this outrage is occurring despite consecutive order by the international court of justice to increase the flow of Aid into Gaza which can be done if there is sufficient political will you have the power to make the difference member of the council un's mandate is supported by an overwhelmingly majority of member state yet the agency is under enormous strain it is facing a campaign to push it out of the occupied Palestinian territory in Gaza the government of Israel seeks to end unas activities the agency's request to deliver Aid to the north are repeatedly denied our staff are barred from coordination meetings between Israel and humanitarian actors Wars un premises and staff have have been targeted since the beginning of the war 178 un Personnel have been killed more than 160 un premises mostly used as shelters have been damaged or destroyed killing more than 400 people premises vacated by the agency have been used for military purposes by Israeli forces Hamas and other Palestinian armed group our headquarter has been occupied militarily and allegation have emerged concerning the existence of tunnels under our premises un personal detain by Israeli security forces have shared arrowing accounts of mistreatment and torture in detention Mr President we demand an independent investigation and accountability for the blat and disregard for the protected statue of humanitarian workers operation and Facilities under international law to do otherwise would set a dangerous precedent and compromise humanitarian world around the world member of the council the situation in the occupied West Bank is also highly concerning daily attacks by Israeli settlers military incursion and the destruction of homes and civilian infrastructure are part of a well oiled system of segregation and oppression un's operational space is shrinking with arbitrary measures imposed by Israel to restrict the presence and the movement of Staff it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep our schools and health centers open and accessible legislative and administrative action to evict un from its headquarter in eusem and prohibit its activities on Israeli territory are also on the way Mr President amid these challenges serious allegation against individual un personel in Gaza emerged in January horrified by this allegation I immediately terminated the appointment of those concerned the Secretary General ordered an investigation through the office of internal oversight services in parallel an independent review group is assessing how un uphold neutrality a core principle guiding our work despite this prompt and decis action a significant amount of donors funding remain suspended this has serious operational implication and undermine the financial sustainability of the agency be assured that we remain firmly committed to implementing the recommendation of the review and to strengthening existing safeguards against neutrality Bridges member of the council as I informed the general assembly in March calls for onas closure are not about adherence to humanitarian principles these calls are about ending the refugee statues of million of Palestinian they seek to change the longstanding political paramet for peace in the occupied Palestinian territory set by the resolution of the general and this Council accusation that un deliberately perpetuates Refugee status are false and dishonest the agency exists because a political solution does not it exist in new of a state that can deliver critical Public Services the International Community has long attempted to contain rather and resolve the Israel Palestine conflict liap Services paid to the two two-state solution each time an escalation occurs costing lives and hope un was created 75 years ago as a temporary agency a stop Gap measure pending a political answer to the question of Palestine if the International Community truly commit to a political solution un can retrieve its temporary Nature by supporting a Time born transition delivering education Primary Health Care and social support it can do so until a Palestine Administration takes over the services absorbing on Palestinian personnel as civil servant Mr President dismounting unoa will have lasting repercussions in the short term it will deepen the humanit crisis in Gaza and accelerate the onset of hin in the longer term it will jeopardize a transition from ceasefire to day after by depriving a traumatized population of essential Services it will make make nearly impossible the formidable task of bringing half a million deeply distressed girls and boys back to learning failing to deliver on education will condemn an entire generation to despair fueling anger resentment and endless cycles of violence a political solution cannot succeed in such a scenar scario member of the council let me conclude with three appeals first I call on council members to act in accordance with General Assembly resolution 302 and Safeguard un's critical role both now and within the framework of the transition un has long been a custodian of the rights of palestin refugees it can only relinquish its Central role of providing critical services and protecting human rights when a political solution is realized until then the political support of member states must be matched by funding second I urge you to commit to a genuine political process culminating in a solution that can bring peace to Palestinian and Israelis this process must up all Palestinian refugees right and aspiration to adjust and Lasting political solution to the plight third we must acknowledge that the political process alone will not guarantee a sustainable peace the wounds that run deep in this region cannot be healed without cultivating empathy and rejecting dehumanization that is rampant whether in political rhetoric or in the misuse of new technology in Warfare we must refuse to choose between empathizing with either Palestinian or Israelis or showing compassion for either gazen or Israeli hostages and their families instead we must recognize and reflect in our words and action that Palestinian and Israelis share a long and profound experience of grief and loss that they are equally deserving of a peaceful and secure future I urge you to hand realize this future through principled multilateral action and a genuine commitment to peace thank you I thank Mr lari
