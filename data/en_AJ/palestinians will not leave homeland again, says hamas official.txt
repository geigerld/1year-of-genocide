to Gaza where a Hamas official is urging Palestinians not to leave Gaza City we may have some disturbing pictures I want to give you that warning now let's listen in are quite trained these are the people who are killing the Palestinians do you think Europe and America will have any sympathy with the thei soldiers who are killing our kids who are killing our women what kind of democracy you are claiming I swear to Allah even if you killed us on these territories we will never leave our land you can destroy our houses but we will never leave Gaza we will be back to our country we will be back to the 1944 48 territories we urge the International Free World We urge the Egyptians please move to the borders please jordanians go and move to the borders ERS don't wait any decision from anyone we urge the refugees the Palestinian refugees in Jordan these are you people being killed here we need to move they need to move from the borders today is Friday today is the Friday of anger in any part of the world these are the crimes of Israel go via the borders of Jordan Lebanon and Egypt the Arabs must go to help Gaza and the gazans we will stay on this land kill us kill the 2 million gazin oh folks we need to be here we need to be strong we will always be here are you watching our we were bringing you live pictures from Gaza of a Hamas spokesman who was urging people urging pales iians particularly not to leave Gaza as this comes as Israel is warning that 1.1 million Palestinians in Gaza should move from Gaza City southwards ostensibly in advance of some sort of action that is that may well be planned for happening in and around Gaza City we have no details of what that might be I want to bring in majab zi he's been talking to us for the last couple of hours he's director of golf studies Center at Kau University good to have you back this is a very strong image that Hamas is putting forward we understand that the spokesman there was holding what may have been a body of a baby we don't know we have no way of knowing whether or not that's true but certainly a very emotive picture they're trying to encourage people in Gaza to remain where they are not to leave Gaza given the circumstances how effective do you think that's going to be I assume because there are no um I would say ways to go I mean the borders with Egypt are closed um they can't go to Israel so basically there are no other places to go to they are moving from City to City assuming that it will be sa and um ended while they they were attacked um I think I think this um statement is coming in in the context the context is in the last 40 hour there is a huge debate about uh pushing Palestinian to SAA and creating a new political status quo the political status quo basically saying Hamas has a base and the base is very limited and other uh people in Gaza which 2.3 are not supporting Hamas those people they can't go to to to SAA stay there for a while and then we Israel says we end uh Hamas and in space on on Gaza we clean it and then we say those people come back but you they come back under the umbrella of Palestinian Authority so by creating a new status quo they're assuming by that they weakened Hamas economically and politically and militarily and they create a new status quo which is bringing Palestinian Authority which has International commitment about peace and uh uh uh um uh basically with Israel and and managing their relation with Israel differently and that is the stat that's that's the current debate um will not be succeeded unless Egypt gives a green light on that thank you very much indeed for your analysis obviously over the coming hours as this develops but we're going to be coming back to but for now thank you very much indeed this comes on the day that Israel has said that uh 1 1 million Palestinians in Gaza should move from Gaza City to the south of Gaza that's possibly ahead of some sort of intended military action within Gaza that's directed they say against the fighters of Hamas the armed group that controls uh Gaza the Israeli military says it quote will quote operate significantly against Hamas positions in the coming days
