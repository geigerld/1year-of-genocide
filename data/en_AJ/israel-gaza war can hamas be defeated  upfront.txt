one of Israel's responses to the October 7th attacks was to promis to permanently destroy Hamas nearly two months after the attacks the group that has ruled Gaza for the last 16 years still seems to control large parts of the enclave and some are questioning whether Israel's goal is even achievable and if Hamas were to be toppled the question remains who would fill the power vacuum joining us to discuss this is Dian buhu she's a ramala based lawyer and former spokesperson with the Palestine Liberation Organization and KH alindi senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington DC I want to thank you both for joining me today Dan I'm going to start with you uh since October 7th Israel has consistently reiterated a vow to destroy Hamas it's estimated that Hamas has 30,000 Fighters at least uh and by the Israeli Army's own records in its own account the air strikes and the attacks have killed somewhere around 1 to 2,000 Hamas Fighters uh given the level of Destruction that we see so far given the current situation on the ground uh is a military victory for Israel even possible no but that's not what they wanted from the beginning Mark U their idea of destroy Hamas is code for destroy Gaza and anybody who's been watching this knows that this is what exactly what Israel means and that's why you see that the vast majority 62% of those who've been killed are Palestinian children under the age of 18 and women and so all along their attempt has never been to destroy Hamas because they know that that's not achievable Hamas is not just a milit it's not just a political party it's it's an ideology as well but instead it was code for destroy Gaza and that's exactly what it is that they're doing that's an important Point KH uh and that's something that uh the very famous renowned even Palestinian historian Rashid KH said he said and I quote Hamas will remain as a political force whether the Israelis occupy Gaza or leave destroying Hamas as a political institution destroying Hamas as an idea is impossible right why well the the idea of Hamas of course Hamas is the Islamic resistance movement so they have an islamist ideology but their primary focus is resistance resisting uh occupation uh repression um by by Israel and so you'd expect that when you have a system of structural violence like an occupation which can only be maintained through uh through violence uh you're going to get violent forms of resistance uh and that's that's an inevitability if it wasn't called Hamas it would be called something else um and it would behave more or less the same way because those are the conditions uh that Palestinians live under that's an important Point Deanna and and I get that at the philosophical level but there's also a political question very practical political question that we also have to ask which is uh is there another party right now that could step in to govern even if Hamas uh were to be defeated and I asked that question more to get a sense of what's going on on on the ground and what the what the kind of political climate is so I'm trying to get a sense of sort of what the possibilities are well that's a great question Mark the the the problem is is that there is no political party that's going to come in on the back of an Israeli tank in other words they're not going to come in and take over and rule or do anything in Gaza based on what the destruction that Israel has heaped on on the Gaza Strip um and so instead the question that we should be asking ourselves is what comes afterwards that Palestinians end up deciding not whether it is the United States deciding or Israel deciding but what is it that Palestinians want will it be Hamas maybe maybe they want out it's not entirely clear but whatever it is whichever group it is however groups might be more than one group it has to be pal palan L and not American driven or Israeli driven or even internationally driven it has to be Palestinians who finally get the ability to choose how it is that they want to live in the end and not based on Israeli dictates uh given what you've seen and what you're hearing uh has Hamas seen a loss of support on the ground uh given the destruction that we've seen at the hands of the Israeli government given the fact that some argue that you know some of it was foreseeable uh has Hamas lost support no quite the opposite Palestinians know who's dropping the bombs and we know that it is Israel who's dropping the bombs and it's not Hamas who is dropping the bombs and if anything people are saying that that they're supportive of the resistance that it's the resistance that's the only thing coming in the way between between Israel and the complete destruction of the Palestinian people our complete Annihilation why do they say that because on October 6th as you'll recall the day before um there was nobody ever talking about about liberating Palestine in fact the Diplomatic Community had dropped the issue so much so that that everything that Israel was doing was was barely met with something called grave concern on the part of the International Community if the choice was to die a very slow death where nobody is watching which is what the Israelis wanted to do or to push back and to have at least the world recognize the brutality of the Israeli regime it yeah I mean I think uh uh you know I actually have a slightly different uh take I I think Israel is trying to destroy Hamas I think they think that they can destroy Hamas um and it comes from a uh this this notion like all Colonial Powers um they don't fully appreciate the Grievances they don't recognize the Grievances of the people that they occupy or rule over and so they see Palestinian Politics as sort of an artificial construction um and and these groups uh can be excised uh in the same way that they were that they think that they were created so they can be surgically removed um from from they're being so nonsurgical in their in their destruction would you would you say that then the Palestinian people the children who are dying the hospitals that are being blown up are just sort of collateral damage that they're willing to accept or is it a Bo and situation where they want to destroy Hamas and they want to destroy the Gaza Strip I I I think it's both I think they want to destroy Hamas and the Gaza Strip I think they are operating um on the basis of rage and revenge uh still now more than eight weeks in um that has been the the the primary motivator so much so that they've given uh barely any thought at all to what comes next and uh we know what happens when you have a security vacuum and a governance vacuum uh you get you get violent groups uh fill that void you get uh extremists uh you get more radicalization so it's not only inhumane the way Israel is conducting itself it's actually quite stupid um if they care at all about their own security because it it absolutely will come back to haunt them help me think about what the future looks like for Palestinians in Gaza the Associated Press reporting that Israel's offensive has turned the area into a quote uninhabitable moonscape uh the UN estimates that 1.7 this is a stunning number to 1.7 million Palestinians in Gaza are newly homeless even if a permanent ceasefire were to be put in place today at this very moment uh to borrow the words of one gin Professor people have nothing to return to um and that's not even mentioning the psychological impact that a Siege uh has had and a Complete Siege is having right now on the on the people of Gaza uh what will it take to rebuild um it will take more time and money and effort than anything we've ever seen in the context of the occupied Palestinian territory Israel's actions are moving in a certain direction they are moving toward the permanent displacement of that 1.6 million Palestinians it's it's it's impossible for them to remain in the south of Gaza forever right it's just too crowded and and there are no Services um and so think very much uh the the ultimate goal is to push them out of Gaza and that's where the real danger is Dan what do you say what does it take to rebuild Gaza and also who's responsible for doing it who should be paying is Israel um who's going to end up probably paying will end up being likely the Europeans uh but who should be actually physically doing it is Palestinians want to rebuild our own places and spaces but what will Gaza look like afterwards that this is the the question that keeps many of us up at night because we haven't seen the end of this I remember a few weeks ago on your show I think it was seven weeks ago on your show you had Danny iyon on the show who who very clearly stated that Palestinians should be moved into the Egyptian Sinai pen peninsula in other words what they are looking for is ethnic cleansing they want to get rid of Palestinians but I I do want to address something about the destruction of Hamas I think that Israel knows very well that it can't destroy Hamas there not looking for security they're not looking for it at all if they were the formula is there but instead they looking constantly to perpetuate this so that it creates this mindset inside Israel that they're that they're not safe and it creates the mindset in the outer world that they're not safe as well and therefore more money flows more security more weapons and so on I think Israel knows full well what it's what it's doing and it knows full well that it cannot destroy Hamas that this is simply code for destroying Gaza destroying Palestinians and forcing Israelis to Forever live under under the gun that'll have to be our last word dan bu thank you so much for joining us khy thank you so much for joining us as well everybody that is our show UPF front we'll be back next
