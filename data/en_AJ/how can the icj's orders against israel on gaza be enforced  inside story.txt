Israel intensifies military operations in Gaza that's despite the UN stop Court ordering it to immediately hold its assault on Rafa it's not the first time Israel has refused to comply with an order from the world court so what's the point of these measures and how can they be enforced this is Inside Story [Music] hello and welcome to the program I'm fuli batibo the international court of justice has ordered Israel to stop its assault on Rafa the order is one of three issued by the un's top Court in the genocide case brought by South Africa against Israel over its war on Gaza Israel has long declared it plans to intensify its assault on the southern city saying it's necessary to dism Hamas and it appears it plans to follow through with that strategy the icj's rulings are final and legally binding but it doesn't have a way to enforce them so does this latest order carry any weight and will it affect events on the ground and how will prime minister Netanyahu manage increased pressure at home and abroad we'll explore these questions with our guests in just a moment but first this report by K Lopez hyan it's a signific ific an move for the un's top Court a landmark emergency ruling ordering Israel to stop its assault on Rafa Israel must immediately hold its military offensive and any other action in the Rafa Governor which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part but shortly after the international court of justice issued its ruling Israeli forces intensified their attacks wiping out entire neighborhoods the ruling is part of a wider legal case that began with South Africa accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza many Palestinians doubt any of the Court's orders will change things or stop the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from moving forward with the offensive I hope Israel will comply but it hasn't cared about Court's rulings or even its allies in the past Israel will continue the massacres Israel is a state above the law and no one can stop it as part of the ruling Israel was ordered to reopen the Rafa border crossing and allow Aid into Gaza famine is already affecting parts of the North and the World Health Organization says it can spread across the strip fast Israeli officials have condemned demed the icj's ruling the government says it's defending itself and fighting Hamas and some Israelis agree the fact that they're even having this conversation is quite ludicrous to be honest I think that we have women young women we have men we have elderly individuals that have been taken hostage and while Israel is a signatory to the Geneva conventions the icj has no means to enforce its orders many analysts now question whether the ruling like other legal motions will be dismissed by Israel and if so if there will be consequences states can choose to take countermeasures uh against other states uh non-violent counter measures would include things like economic sanctions for example um in order to induce enforcement all of that depends obviously on the the political will in the situation for now Palestinians in Gaza must wait to see if the icj's court orders will extend beyond words kope oan Al jazer for insight story well let's now bring in our guests for today's show joining us in occupied East Jerusalem is mammed D who is a lawyer and a founder of an East Jerusalem Law Firm that practices in the Israeli and Palestinian legal systems in Tel Aviv Alan Nel a former Israeli Diplomat who served as Israel's ambassador to South Africa and in London William shabas he's an international law expert and a professor at middle sex University gentlemen thank you for joining us on inside or a warm welcome to all of you uh Muhammad D if I can start with you a legally binding order from the international uh court of justice for Israel to stop its offensive on Rafa are you at all hopeful the Israelis will heed this call at some point in time so far it doesn't seem to be the case yeah it hasn't been the case but I think that the Israeli Army and that the Israeli government cannot continue to ignore international law in this case a specific International court order this is a a clear order this time and it talks about a specific area the the RAF area and I think that this time with the warrant orders the the arrest orders by the IC also waiting for bam Netanyahu and Galant I think that the Israeli government will think twice this time when they decide on their future actions in Rafa so it's not it it is Bing Israel hasn't been following international law in the past but I think with this current order they will uh they will they will treat it in a different way I don't think that the Israeli government can continue to violate international law can continue not to comply with orders issued by the international court of justice the high highest court in the world and get away with it I think this time they know that the time has come for Israel really to comply with these orders and to comply with the international law and if they don't do so then the risks of uh arrest warrants for the two gentlemen that we spoke about and maybe others the risk is is getting higher and higher okay Alan Neel your thoughts will Netanyahu completely ignore this order will the Israeli government continue to defy the highest court of international law in Israel the interpretation is different ER the Israeli government sees the order as to stop the violence once or if it is inflicting damage on civilians and the Israeli government say we are not inflicting any damage or casualties on civilians and will go on with a war in Rafa ER I think although Israel has a different interpretation it'll be very cautious especially when it comes to civilians but I don't think Israel intends to end the war H what can H maybe force Israel to do so is if these orders go to the UN Security Council for another vote and we'll need another American veto then a new procedure will start okay I'll ask you a little bit more about what we can expect at the UN Security Council in a moment let me bring in William shabas into the conversation uh William Alan leel says there is in Israel that there's a very different interpretation of this law but as Muhammad D said it's it's a very clear order this time from the international court of justice a very specific ruling unlike the two previous this once the court is ordering Israel to stop the the military operation in Rafa to allow humanitarian Aid in through Rafa and other Crossings how much weight does this ruling carry uh despite Israel ignoring previous rulings of the Court well I totally agree I think the ruling uh and the order from the court couldn't be much clearer than it is and the the idea that Israel can interpret this in some way that allows it to continue with its military offensive is is quite Preposterous and I think the whole world will will see that um of course it's clear now that Israel doesn't intend to comply with it whatever uh whatever contrived interpretation it develops about the order and as as everyone knows there is not an enforcement mechanism as such the enforc what's the purpose then of these measures William shabas if they're going to be ignored well you don't know that they're going to be ignored until you order them and I think that for most countries who've been on the receiving end of these orders historically they do comply with them and so South Africa has no alternative it has to go to the court to get the orders um and then hopefully political pressure will be put on Israel to get it to comply already we're seeing the consequences on Israel uh with many of its allies and Friends many of the countries that have been very supportive and friendly to Israel are losing their taste for this um partly because they also value and and respect the international court of justice they can't stomach Israel's attitude of of absolute disdain for an order by a court Israel accepted this Israel never had to ratify the genocide convention but once it did it opened the door to orders from the international court of justice and it it is it is obliged to respect them Alan how does Israel continue to justify rejecting these orders from uh the international court of justice is Israel Above the Law no I explained how Israel justifies it it takes the word if it may inflict and so on but H the headlines in the world are that the court ordered Israel to end the operation in Rafa and definitely this will trigger more criticism some of it probably in the UN and some of it bilaterally I don't think this International court of justice order is standing on its own you have simultaneously several things happening now in Israel's pH relations that are causing what we call here a tsunami or a diplomatic tsunami and Israel has to look at the wider picture definitely we are losing support in more and more parts of the world especially in Europe now that is seen as very important to us yeah certainly Alan leel this has been a bad week for Israel How concerned are Israelis about this growing International pressure and this growing International isolation it's not just this latest ruling by the international court of justice it's also the ICC seeking to issue arrest warrants against uh Israeli leaders and also Hamas leaders and some very important European countries as you mentioned who are now demanding uh that an independent Palestinian State be established how does this resonate with the Israeli public at large the Israeli public is not too concerned unfortunately an attitude was developed with most of the Israel public that no matter what we do the world will be against us as the world is by definition anti-semitic so there is a tendency to overlook what's happening in the International Community on the other end many Israelis are really really worried that if H we end the war Hamas will have a comeback and will attack us again so this is the the feeling in the public however netan will be the one making the decision he he can decide on its on his own he has in his cabinet some ministers say let's go the diplomatic way others are pushing for the military way and he has to the side yeah all right Muhammad Dal your thoughts about this Alan Neel says there a different interpretation of this latest ruling by Israel and the Israel views these decisions made uh at the international uh level as anti-semitic what do you make of this well I think as you know Israel has sent a judge adhoc judge Barack who is part of the international court of justice and I think now Israel is trying basically to base its case on his descending opinion in his opinion he tried to say that actually the international court of justice is not ordering a total freeze of the military offense in Rafa but actually it it does so with certain conditions that if they are met uh then Israel uh should stop the operation but if Israel doesn't inflict this physical damage to the Palestinian civil population then the operation can continue so that's the expl explanation that Barack in his opinion when it was issued that what he actually presented to the Israeli government to the Israeli attorney general basically giving advice to the Israeli Army yet reading the decision uh of the 13 judges in the court they say that actually there is no way to uh operate in Rafa without inflicting this damage on the civilian population they mentioned what Israel has tried to do with the several hundreds Palestinians that they evacuated from Rafa to al- maasi area and other areas and they the court says in its ruling that those areas are not adequate for habilitation people cannot really live there there are no houses no water no sewage nothing therefore the interpretation given by the Israelis I think will not be accepted by anybody in the world but that's the that's how Israel got away with it until now all the time Israel has its own interpretation to international law including International humanitarian law and that was only an Israeli interpretation that was different from what the World Scholars think about International humanitarian law briefly Muhammad Dal before I bring uh William back into the conversation the ruling also says Israel has to allow un investigators into Gaza uh to to investigate the genocide case right what's the likelihood of that happening of Israel allowing investigators into territory it hasn't allowed in the past several un inquiry commissions were supposed to come to the Palestinian territories in the past based on different uh resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly uh human rights Council or other committees and Israel in the past hasn't been cooperative and this time I don't think it's going to be any different Israel this is actually this this shows the case of Gaza Gaza has been besieged Gaza is still under isra full control from the sea from the air and uh from the the border the territorial borders no one can enter Gaza without an Israeli permit or an Israeli consent and Israel is the only one who decides who comes and who goes out of Gaza therefore I think that the Israelis will not allow the the the you know the investigators to come in so far they haven't been able to do that even Karim Karim Khan the the the Attorney General of the IC was not able to enter Gaza he only came to the ra Cross Point and but he was not able to get to get inside Gaza he visited the Israeli kuim inside Israel but he wasn't was n able to get inside Gaza although he got the information from other un agencies but entering into Gaza is a totally different story so unlikely to happen all the time is hindering that unlikely to happen then William uh will a Defiance of this order uh my understanding is that uh there's no immediate sanction for violating the provisional orders issued by the uh International court of justice but does the ruling have broader implications for the genocide case that Israel is facing well in principle it doesn't it's a preliminary ruling about an urgent situation and it's without prejudice as we lawyers say to the merits of the case but clearly the attitude and the violence it's we we consense the attitude of the judges already I I think Israel's approach in reading this order in this very technical Manner and suggesting that somehow it allows them to continue with business as usual is really not a reading in good faith you have to read the judgments you have to read what the other members of the Court have said in their individual opinions and one cons sense that this is a court that is getting more angrier and angrier and and more and more impatient with Israel so Israel is not heading into a good place in this case of course there's going to be a great debate when this finally goes on the merits but it's not it's not looking good for Israel in terms of its future at the international court of justice what about at the international criminal court will a Defiance of this order by Israel affect the pre-trial chamber of the ICC which is currently debating whether to issue arrest warrants against Israeli leaders not technically of course not because it has no the the two are not directly related in any way but uh again what we can see here listen there are 13 judges of the court from all over the world from countries that are friendly to Israel as well as countries that are perhaps less friendly to Israel and they're unanimous about this we can expect the same kind of sentiment the same kind of mood amongst the three judges at the pre-trial chamber of the international uh Criminal Court who are going to have to rule in the coming weeks on the prosecutor's application for the arrest warrants of course we can't foresee what they'll decide but this sets the tone and I I think we we can anticipate that those arrest warrants will be issued and there are all kinds of other sort of soft effects of this that go outside of the legal sphere altogether and we've made reference to them already the fact that there's an increasing number a growing momentum of states to recognize Palestine as a state and probably open the door still the United States is an obstacle but it's the last only the last obstacle to admitting Palestine as a full member state of the United Nations right and Muhammad I'll ask you about uh about this the us being this obstacle uh but let me just uh get Alan neel's thoughts about what uh uh William said there I mean what happens Alan if these arrest warrants are issued Israel's credibility has uh radically diminished within the course of this war on Gaza there's a shifting perception today in the world of Israel as a law abiding uh democracy what would it mean for Israel to lose that status and to be treated as a non-democracy oh as far as I remember remember uh 124 countries members of the international criminal court H will have to arrest netan and Gallant our Minister of Defense if orders are issued so this definitely is quite an embarrassment and quite a complication to our H for relations Israel will try to undermine it legally ER the visits to the United States are still possible even if orders will be issued because the United States is not a member of the IC I think at this stage from all the discussion the issue that is the most urgent one in Israeli eyes is if it will reach the security Council because as far as I understand every one of the 15 members of the security Council can now pull it to a discussion there and in the security Council it'll be very difficult for the United States to vote against a verdict or an order of the international court of justice so in a way we are complicating the international situation of the United States If It Moves again to the security Council so a lot is happening simultaneously definitely embarrassing to Israel embarrassing to Israel Muhammad D only the security Council has the power to enforce these rulings by the international court of justice but as we've heard from both uh William and Alan there it's likely that the the US will veto uh any moves at the security Council so what then should be done to uh enforce uh these rulings and and how difficult a position does this put the US in I mean they've backed Israel uh through in throughout this conflict how difficult will it be for them if this gets to the security Council I think it puts the United States in a very difficult position I mean for how long can the the the US use the veto to rescue Israel from its troubles and from the troubles that they are putting the United States in as well and we're not talking about the IC now we have heard what the Israelis are asking the the US Administration to do to the IC attorney general and to the judges and to the employes at the IC they want them to sanction the court we haven't heard such a thing ever I mean asking the superpower to sanction an international court for issuing or for issuing a motion only for the time being uh to ask for an arrest warrant for war criminals uh this is UN unheard of un think of but now we are moving to the ICC and the ICC is an organ of the United Nations and the United States is part of that of that order it's part of the IC it's part of the United Nations unlike the sorry it's part of the icj which the United States is not part of it it's not the United States in a very awkward position uhuh uh and and and and basically saying that this uh you know world or order that we established after the second world war which includes the UN Charter and it includes the international court of justice and so many other International covenants and conventions and agreements that are supposed to regulate relations between peoples between countries between states that those are actually are not applicable in the case of Israel the United States has been under a huge embarrassment for its treatment to Israel in this current conflict not now only but throughout the years and now it's in in really a very very bad position if it continues to use that veto because it's going to be clear for all the International Community that that this move is against international law and against International jti let me get William's thoughts about this William how much does this heighten the cost for the Biden Administration as it continues to be Israel's sole guarantor and Defender and what are the next steps as far as International law is concerned I mean they what are the obligations of third States in this case you know I wouldn't underestimate the ability of the United States to be hypocritical on these subjects the United States has been keenly supporting the international criminal court when it's investigating the Russians in Ukraine despite the fact that it claims that the court has no jurisdiction over people who aren't citizens of a member State now of course they're raising that objection and they're going to be uh trying to take measures apparently to block the work of the court it's not the first time they've done it they tried back in 2002 when it looked like the Rome statute was going to enter enter into Force which it did of course and then they tried under the Trump Administration but these were really quite pathetic efforts that had no teeth in them uh in in reality they had very little in the way of practical consequences and and I don't see that they thought up anything brilliant since then that could actually inflict pain it's a annoyance it's an annoyance disgraceful that they're doing it but but it's not going to stop the international criminal court proceeding with what what it is set up to do okay uh Alan leel is Israel and the Israeli government likely to reevaluate its position uh in the face of intensifying international pressure and intensifying isolation uh it's a difficult question because uh um I don't know if this wave will continue but if it will continue if both courts the IC and icj will go on with the pressures if the security Council will go on voting if more European countries will recognize Palestine if it will end up with the America in a certain time not Ving then Israel will have to listen I think we are at a critical Junction if we give up on our International standing and focus on our security or if we go after 100% security because of the pressure of the Israeli population the Israeli government will have to decide if to go now the military way or the Diplomatic way thank you gentlemen for a very interesting conversation thank you very much for joining us Muhammad D Alan leel William shabas thank
