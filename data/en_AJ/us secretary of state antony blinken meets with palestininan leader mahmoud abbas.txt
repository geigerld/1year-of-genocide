the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is meeting Palestinian leader mmud Abbas before flying out to Cairo on the last leg of his Middle East visit these are I believe the latest pictures from ramala and the occupied West Bank where the US Secretary of State is expected to discuss not just the situation in Gaza but also the future of the territory with abas who is the president of the Palestinian Authority now during his fifth visit to the region blinkin has repeated a familiar message to Israel which is a call for restraint but he has refused to call for a ceasefire more than 23,000 Palestinians many of them children have been killed in three months of War on Gaza SAR hyat reports from Tel Aviv he came to Israel with a message from some Arab leaders that normalization of relations is still possible but with conditions they're ready to support a lasting solution that ends the long running Cy cycle of violence and ensures Israel's security but they underscored that this can only come through a regional approach that includes a pathway to a Palestinian State nice to see you there's no sign that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is willing to allow a Palestinian state but Anthony blinkin again urged him to allow more Aid into the Gaza Strip and he seemed to convince Israel for now to consider allowing people it displaced from northern Gaza to return we agreed today on a plan for the UN to carry out an assessment Mission uh it will determine what needs to be done to allow displaced paltin Palestinians to return safely to homes in the north now this is not going to happen overnight there are serious security infrastructure and humanitarian challenges 70% of the Gaza strips infrastructure has been destroyed the majority of the population is hungry with famine said to be around the corner corner and diseases already spreading bodies continue to rot underneath the rubble and in the streets Anthony blinkin says that several Arab countries are ready to support gaza's reconstruction after the war but it's hard to tell when that will be as Israel says it will continue the war throughout the year and a so-called day after plan is still not clear but Gaza may not have been the Israeli side's main concern blink's flurry of meetings and Military updates focused on escalating tensions along Israel's northern border with the Iranian back group Hezbollah in southern Lebanon Lincoln's next stop is Egypt with a Revival of a ceasefire deal and another round of Hostage releases said to be top of his agenda but if this trip has highlighted anything it's how far away from a real settlement all the parties to this conflict still are Sarat Al jaaz Tel Aviv let's go now to our correspondent Muhammad jamj he joins us from ramala in the occupied West Bank and Muhammad what are we expecting from just the latest meeting between the Secretary of State blinkin and Mahmud Abbas we know the US position it wants the Palestinian Authority to play a more active role in gaza's future is that what the Palestinians want so Elizabeth let me tell you and our viewers first where we are we're here in El manada Square where there is a protest that's expected in the next hour that's when the meeting between US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin and Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas is expected to happen now it is not anticipated that the protest will be very large in fact it's expected it could only be dozens of people that would be in line with what we saw the last time that Anthony blinkin was in the ramala meeting with mahm abas um expectations quite frankly are low at this point in among those that we are speaking with yes Secretary of State blinkin reiterated yesterday in his talks with Israeli officials that he would like there to be a pathway for a Palestinian State he also said that he would like to deliver a message that they would like to see the US would like to see the Palestinian Authority reform itself and he also said that they would like to see Israelis make it less difficult for the Palestinian Authority to govern its own people all that being said though not a lot of expectation about what can actually be delivered from this meeting the last time that blink met with Abbas the meeting lasted less than an hour yes the US would like to see a pathway for a Palestinian state but they haven't presented any concrete details as to how that might happen and we've heard this rhetoric so often from the US in the past so the demonstrators that we are expecting out here today most of them are not just opposed to Blink and coming and speaking to to the Palestinian Authority about what might happen in GA what might happen in Gaza they're also largely unhappy with the Palestinian Authority and in fact there was a recent poll Elizabeth which was conducted in December which found that almost two-thirds of Palestinians are opposed even to the idea of the Palestinian Authority participating in meetings to discuss gaza's future after the war end so it's a complicated picture even if something could be delivered in this meeting today and not a lot of people expect that something can be um the fact of the matter is there's not a lot of trust here in the Palestinian Authority and there's not a lot of trust in the Palestinian Authority talking to the us about what might happen next in Gaza thank you very much for that Muhammad Jam Jun with the very latest uh live in rala
