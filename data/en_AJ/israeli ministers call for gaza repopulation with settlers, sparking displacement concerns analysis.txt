all right let me uh just bring you up to speed with some of the latest lines that was brought to us a short while ago by our correspondent hanni Mahmud in Gaza that the Naser Hospital in Gaza has now been stormed by Israeli forces this was after it was shelled and of course all of this happening as the world awaits for an anticipated Israeli ground offensive into Rafa one that's prompted warnings from several countries including now Australia New Zealand and Canada well to discuss this more Anthony Lowenstein joins us he's a journalist and author of The Palestine laboratory a book on Israel's arms and surveillance industry joins us now from Sydney good to have you with us Anthony so just to give some background to my first question we had on January the 28th 11 cabinet ministers attend an event advocating the repopulation of Gaza with Israeli settlers and the and and the departure of gazans are the concerns that Israel actually wants to displace and not just evacuate garen's valid when you look at that you look at the statement by the Israeli Finance Minister on December the 31st where he was quoted as saying garans should be encouraged to immigrate I mean the short answer is yes and that's just not really an opinion it's based on Netanyahu down countless is ministers and I might add a large sway to the Israeli Jewish public that there's really an intention here to make Gaza so unlivable which essentially is what it's become in vast parts of Gaza that really Palestinians have little choice now the question is of course where do they go and Israel has been trying for months to negotiate some kind of deal which essentially means bribing them with money and arms to various Nations including Egypt other neighbors and countries further a field and I read in the last 24 hours that's not confirmed that there's talk about some kind of Egyptian built buffer zone of sorts between wi the Sinai essentially between Gaza and Egypt now that suggests some kind of possible movement and ultimately Egypt can be bought because Egypt receives huge amounts of money every year from the US and Israel is a close Ally of Egypt and The Siege on Gaza for years has been imposed by Egypt and Israel so this is the really deep concern and I feel like too much of the world does not take that threat seriously Anthony I spoke to a doctor yesterday in Gaza who was talking to me about how they haven't received the usual supplies in a while is the disruption of food and Medicine linked to what you're talking about there's a long history of this you know at the beginning of the Israeli and Egyptian impos Siege in 2007 there was literally a document that was leaked a few years after that said that Israel was trying to put Palestinians in Gaza on a diet that's their words and they were very careful how many calories of in food would transported into Gaza people would not starve to death but they would not get particularly more calories than is's required to not die this is the level of dehumanization that exists within the Israeli government this of course was a government of many many years ago the current situation is that there are serious threats of huge amounts of people starving Mass disease not my opinion based on every single human rights organization both in Gaza and those who report nearby this is a real threat and the idea that there is not massive unrelenting pressure on Israel not just to end the war but to take food into Gaza to get trucks into Gaza I mean I have friends in Gaza in Rafa who have regularly spoken to me or been in touch in the last months really since October but particularly in the last few weeks who are not starving to death but they find it unbelievably hard to find food there is no food there's not enough food how is this not becoming one of the great scandals of our time it clearly should be right Anthony does the investigation by the Israeli newspaper haret published on February the 4th indic indicate as well that Israeli the Israeli military uses or has used psyclops as part of their policy to achieve their goals one of the things that been very clear um for the Israeli military strategy if you can call it that since October 7 is they realized pretty quickly that they're on the back foot that although there was some Global sympathy after October 7 in the attacks by hamus that quickly switched after Israel's unrelenting massacres in Gaza so what they started doing is running very very graphic telegram that um messaging app groups Distributing huge amounts of gory images of dead Garin to huge amounts of Israelis there are huge amounts of other telegram groups that I've seen just circulated by Israelis themselves with hundreds of thousands of followers which literally just shows dead and killed Palestinians and that's within Israel globally there is growing evidence that I've documented and others have as well of Israeli Le disinformation campaigns we hear a lot in the west about Russia and China spreading disinformation and election meddling which is true we hear far less about what Israel is doing both within its own country and far wider this is a threat because we don't really know exactly often the source of it Beyond and this was in hits recently as you rightly say Sammy that Israeli military realizes they have lost the information War not losing lost and the way they're trying to challenge that is to spread huge amounts of disinformation about Hamas about Palestinians about the fact that every Palestinian Gaza allegedly is a threat or is a terrorist I mean stuff that people are not buying so that really is a problem and I think it needs to be far greater examined than it has been all right thanks so much Anthony Lowenstein
