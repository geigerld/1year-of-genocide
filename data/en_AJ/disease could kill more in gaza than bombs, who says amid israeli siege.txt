now although the ceasefire in Gaza has been extended gaza's health system has collapsed the un's World Health Organization is warning that untreated diseases could become more deadly than Israeli bombardment we can now speak to Tark yerich who's the spokesperson at the World Health Organization joining us from Geneva thank you so much for your time can you tell us how the who came up with uh concluded that assessment that uh people could more people could die from diseases than bombings in Gaza well what we have right now is 1.8 million uh gazans have been forced to move out of their homes they are in overcrowded settings uh they are lacking uh clean water they are lacking food uh and also the temperatures are dropping so all this uh is making increased risk for different s sort of infectious diseases for respiratory diseases for uh waterbor diseases for skin diseases and we have already received information about emergence of uh some of these conditions and things will only get wor unless there is a Improvement in access to clean water and in uh in delivery of Health Care unfortunately as you have said the the the health system is near collaps right now with 2third of hospitals and two-third of Health Centers not being functional any longer and situation north of Gaza is of a particular concern things let unack let's let's unpack what you're saying first I just want you to elaborate on what you said a moment ago about you already receiving reports from Gaza on the emergence of these diseases well uh for example we have received a report rep on diarrhea cases acute diarrhea cases and this can be particularly uh uh uh dangerous in in small children who don't have a strong immunity and if there is no enough of food and we have heard from our colleagues from the world food program that there is a serious risk of malnutrition that would make a problem even bigger there is also reports of respiratory uh infections this is where people are in crowded area things are temperatures are getting uh uh lower and that increases death risk and also because people are in crowded settings there are there is a risk of lies and and other skin diseases because people are in unhygienic conditions just to give you the the scope of this there's only one shower for 4,500 people and there is the only one toilet unit for more than 200 people right now in these overcrowded settings so so all this is increasing risk of of diseases on top of the injuries due to the bombardment okay so the warning that the who is putting out that if the health system is not put back on its feet then this is likely to happen what needs to be done in your opinion right now as a matter of priority to put that Health System back on its feet well first of all we need uh unhindered access to Gaza to bring in medical supplies but medical supplies are not enough we need fuel most of these hospitals and health centers stopped working because of lack of fuel we need hospitals to be safe that people can continue working in those hospitals what we have seen last week in alifa and other hospitals in the nor is is a catastrophic because alifa was uh the the best Hospital uh in in Gaza and it nearly stopped all of its uh functions so we need access we need fuel and we need safety for health workers and for patients and for this obviously what we need is a sustained ceasefire what we are hearing right now is is is is not giving us much of Hope because there is a talk of uh of renewed fighting and that would bring more misery More Death more injuries all right we'll leave it there we thank you so much for joining us from Geneva
