well we can now speak to Hassan barari he's joining us here in our studio in Doha he's a professor for international Affairs at Qatar University Welcome to Al jazer um what do you make of the messaging that's coming out of the white house because um what Kimberly was just referring to there a moment ago was um a few earlier this week when the US President Joe Biden gave an interview to American Media where he said uh ra an invasion of RA would be his red line but then he backtracked and said I will never leave Israel and now we hear this from the National Security adviser what do you make of these is it mixed messaging I I think it is it is mix messaging I mean Biden look Biden cannot not to support Israel he can't afford it politically speaking he want to be seen as someone who's backing Israel in this war in Gaza and especially with the objective of the war is to dismantle Hamas and that's why he kept like sending them the weapons and and munition uh this is one thing another thing is that he don't want to be seen as as if as supporting ethnic cleansing and also targeting civilians because if the Israelis go on attack and attack ra I think you know civilian going to be impacted so I think he's in in limbo on the one hand he want to be seen as someone who is supporting uh um human rights but at the same time he's one who's who want to be seen as supporting Israel in his four objectives do you think that the Israelis still have the intention to go into ra until this moment it's really hard to tell uh but n wants the war to continue uh because putting an end to the war at this moment will put netan in in trouble internally and so he want to continue the war and he using the protect of of everything protect of the hostages in order to continue the war he I think eventually if he does not get into the war in in in ra it is really hard for him to liberate the hostages because a deal is not in the offering and the deal entails a lot of concessions on the part of the Israeli government and netan is not is unwilling to do that that's the thing I mean when it comes to the deal we heard from the CES today saying that look the both sides are still quite far apart Ian could he be using this threat of f as some sort of negotiating strategy a negotiating tactic absolutely uh he threatens to uh invade RAF and to it out but at the same time it is really difficult for him to do this without killing many civilians uh so he's using this in order to put a lot of pressure on Hamas to make them agree to his uh terms of ceasefire he wants to De braate the hostages in order to continue the war and this is the message where Hamas finds really hard to accept right and um look we just heard a few uh earlier uh in fact this hour from the unwa head of unur who's who's saying this that the you that more children have been killed in Israel's war on Gaza than in four years of worldwide conflict I mean just how devastating is that statistic it also shows how indifferent the Israelis when it comes to the human rights and when it comes to the civilians they just bombarded in in a blind way in order to put the pressure in order to turn the uh uh the Palestinian public against Hamas it it is a game that is being played by the Israeli they want to put a lot of pressure on Hamas and make him make them undesirable uh uh Partners H and that's why they killed the I think they killed the civilian civilian sometimes on purpose is there any sign that that pressure is achieving the results of the israelies wanteded to achieve so what is the result what is the outcome to liberate the hostages the Palestinians are unwilling to do this and until they come uh to to agree on a deal and the Israelis are unwilling to do uh to agree on a deal unless Hamas came in and Hamas I think is not going to came in at this moment especially after all this sacrifices okay Hassan barari thank you so much
