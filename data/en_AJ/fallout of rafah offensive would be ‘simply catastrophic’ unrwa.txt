we begin with breaking news from Rafa the Israeli military has ordered all residents and displaced people to leave the Eastern neighborhoods of gaza's Southernmost city it says they must move to the alasi area near the coastline that's ahead of what it says will be the use of extreme force in the eastern part of the city more than 1 and a half million Palestinians have been Sheltering in Rafa after the Israeli military forced them out of Northern and Central Gaza we are joined Now by our correspondent hany mmud he's live for us in Rafa firstly hany tell us about this evacuation order and how it's been conveyed to people there yes well as of this hour we're seeing a scores of people people have counted by the tens right now entire families have been Sheltering inside residential homes in the eastern part of RA City that includes the Salam neighborhood the Jan district and the surrounding uh areas of these two neighborhoods are start have started moving out of the area taking their stuff and uh their belongings and moving to toward the western part of the city when when when ask where they are going they're still not sure where to head there's a lot of uncertainty uh going on there really military after a terrible night quite Restless is Sleepless almost 11 Air Raids across the eastern part the central uh of raak City killing at least 20 people mostly women and children right now those people who were inside their residential homes they were bombed there the difficulties right now faced by any challenges faced by the uh the civil defense crew on the ground up till hour it's been more than 8 hours right now they're still working on getting people from under the rubbles in the areas that were bombed uh and overnight the attacks across the city there really military as early hour this morning it dropped leaflet uh and made phone calls sharply order ing people to evacuate the eastern part of RAF City and to start heading toward the evacuation zones in western part of the city in Al maasi as well as to the western part and the central part of Khan Unice that's the the evacuation Zone that's been designated by the Israeli military as well as now Moi evacuation zone or evacuation Zone in general designated by Israeli military stretch from d City at the western part passing it through kanun all the way to ra City the western part of the city all the way to the Egyptian uh Gaza border now this particular evacuation zone or sliver land at the western part of the the STP from the Central Area kanun hasn't been absolutely a a safe there were attacks there were was repeatedly attacked by either the artillery Shilling as well as by the air strikes at the time when kanun was was invaded by the is really military people were killed inside the tents that they set up and in the areas they were told to evacuate uh to right now there's a state of chaos going on there's a state of panic people did not expect it to happen rapidly this way chaos and P Panic you're saying Hanny just so soon after people in Rafa were really hopeful that there could be a ceasefire before those negotiations ended and not only as you've mentioned we've seen the Israelis repeatedly attack maasi since they designated this area a safe Zone we know the condition that KH yunas one of gaza's largest cities was left in after the Israeli forces withdrew from there so the options now while the Israelis are telling people to evacuate really I mean the options for them for where to go that safe it doesn't sound like there are any absolutely I mean there is it has been improving largely for the past seven months uh right now there is no single safety place across ra City and just to give you an example of how this evacuation orders have been largely as people describe it with a frustration contradictory vague and and misleading for the most part we have documented cases of people arriving to evacuation zones and within hours within days of their arrival they were bombed and killed inside the very areas they were told to evacuate to in order to avoid being bombed uh in the northern part of Gaza City and more recently in the city of KH units now that has created a sense of mistrust in the narrative about evacuation Zone and led people into a conclusion that you can't create a safe Zone in in a war zone pretty much we look at an entire Gaza Strip being equally bombed with more of it within the past uh few weeks concentrated in ra City and the central area now the central area uh we've seen attacks constant attack repeat attacks on refugee camps the central part of the central area which makes it less safe right now for people people are heading toward these areas but they're knowing they're walking with a shattered sense of safety and the the the the the feeling that they have it it could they're going to die here they're going to die in the evacuation Zone everything everywhere is risky everywhere there is no safety whatsoever honey thank you very much for that for now that is our correspondent honey mm live in Gaza with the latest on the situation there after the Israeli military has ordered people in Rafa to evacuate sah had the spokesperson for Norwegian Refugee Council and she's joining us live from Aman thank you very much for your time firstly just how problematic is it for Israel to tell people to evacuate to an area that it's attacked a number of times it's completely problematic it's inhumane uh and unsafe uh because the elmasi area where people are being ordered to evacuate to uh is not equipped to accommodate and host more idps uh the area itself already uh hosts hundreds of thousands of Palestinian idps uh it does not have enough uh humanitarian assistance and services to support additional uh displaced population uh and also if Israel is going to order people to move towards theunis area well that's completely been destroyed uh throughout the Israeli bombardment over the past period uh so these areas uh that are being ordered for evacuation are not safe uh they cannot uh accommodate further displaced people uh and people right now feel as though they have nowhere to go to seek safety uh this evacuation order right now is the start of uh a nightmare scenario for people uh in RAF uh who have been terrified for months now over what is to to come and and as Aid agencies we're also terrified about the coming period because if a ra offensive takes place um in full force that would lead to the collapse of the aid response that is really reliant on the Raa Hub to uh distribute Aid to organize Aid throughout that area yeah you say a night a nightmare situation for people in Rafa who will tell you that the last seven months they have been living through a nightmare already you say that there are already hundreds of thousands of people in masasi refugee camp can you tell us about the conditions that they're facing and from what we know about the conditions there can it take thousands if not hundreds of thousands more people the conditions are woefully inadequate uh there are not enough humanitarian uh assistance and and services being uh given to the population there it does not have the basic infrastructure in place to uh service and support the current displaced population there let alone an additional um group of people moving towards there and these are evacuation orders have come really rapidly as well so they're not giving enough time to the humanitarian sector and Aid agencies to support uh and ramp up aid aid at the moment that's coming through into Gaza is inadequate it's insufficient yeah um to support the current population that are displaced it cannot cannot support another wave of displacement we are talking about over 1 million people in RAF uh who now have to face further displacement but also death because we've been warning that a military offensive in would cause Mass atrocities it would C cause Mass civilian deaths and we've been urging the International Community and allies of the Israeli government to put a stop to this right now we need every Ally of the Israeli government including the US government to increase its pressure stop the armed sales uh put pressure on Israel to put a stop to this offensive which would lead to less atrocities and organizations such as yourself had been urging Israel since the start of the war on Gaza to open the Karam Abu salm Crossing and with the onset of famine in Northern Gaza many Aid organizations had said it is completely unavoidable famine in all of Gaza is unavoidable unless kadam Abu salum is fully functioning again Israel has closed kadam Abu Salam not long after opening it because of the attack on Israeli soldiers in which something like three Israeli soldiers were killed what impact is that going to have now on the humanitarian situation in Gaza well closing any further Crossings right now would just lead to to catastrophic humanitarian conditions uh people are already suffering from the in the significantly ins inadequate Aid that's coming through uh into Gaza and a r offensive on top of this would actually lead to the closure of the ra Crossing which is really really necessary right now to get in the supplies to support the displaced population in southern Gaza but also across Gaza as well so we need um all Crossings to be opened urgently um we need humanitarian Aid commercial uh supplies and goods to to enter Gaza as well because of the famine that's underway in Northern Gaza but our fear is now that famine could spread to Southern Gaza with this military offensive because of the cut to Aid that we'll see over the coming period this is why we are pleading and urging with the International Community to put an end to this military offensive otherwise Gaza will face its deadliest chapter moving forward where people will die not only from the bombardment but from inadequate aid from dehydration and and starv which is of course something that we are already seeing very much happening over the last few months that is the Norwegian Refugee council's s joining us live from Aman thank you very much for your time on this today we really appreciate it thank you well let's stay with this we are now joined by the anra spokesperson that is of course the United Nations relief and works agency Jonathan Fowler he's live in occupied East Jerusalem thank you for your time firstly your reaction to this Israeli evacuation order telling people in the east of Rafa to leave well as the the previous um speaker from the norian refu refugee Council put it uh I mean we we're in in a situation where any large scale offensive from Israeli forces in Rafa is simply going to mean more suffering and death um the consequences would be devastating the population in Rafa is 1.4 million that's about six times the pre-war population half of that is uh a children um and most of these people have been displaced many times already so we're simply not in a situation where it's possible for people to continue in these repeat waves of displacement evacuation um the the the challenges are just insurmountable at this stage and there is just so many problems and challenges aren't there I mean we've spoken with our correspondent and with the Norwegian Refugee Council about just how incredibly problematic it is to ask people to move to masasi given the lack of facilities given it already so overcrowded given it's been attacked multiple times but if you look at the areas of canun that people are now looking at going to to try and escape this Israeli offensive we know that after the Israeli forces withdrew from can Yunis after after weeks of fighting the not only the state that can yunas is in but the United Nations has said that there is many unexploded ordinances in canun for example absolutely I mean for anybody to return to an area area um I mean this this is the same in in any war zone around the world in in the wake of fighting in any area you simply cannot have people returning to to to zones of combat um precisely for that reason unexploded ordinance has to be cleared before people are able to to return and live in safety otherwise all that's happening is you're pushing people back into a Zone where their lives are at risk from the the remnants of the the previous fighting in that area so again how is this how is this being allowed to happen Mr fer how is Israel being allowed to order people to evacuate to places it's attacked to evacuate to people where there are unexploded ordinance we again we were hearing from the Norwegian Refugee Council they were saying how they're pleading with all countries including the United States who have leverage with Israel not to do this I wonder what's your experience of speaking to these countries of speaking to Israel about their plans well we we constantly Advocate with all parties um to this conflict and indeed across the International Community for a ceasefire and that has to be the bottom line I mean whether you the question of why things are allowed to happen is is another issue but the thing is these things have to stop the nowhere is safe in the Gaza Strip people have been constantly displaced over and over um even contingency plans are off a little Solace I mean the the Grim reality is that when you're moving people around when people have to flee there's no way that people can be adequately prepared for the potential consequences so the The Fallout from such an offensive would be simply catastrophic and it cannot happen Mr F thank you so much for your time on this that is the United Nations relief and works agency uh spokesperson Jonathan Fowler live in occupied East Jerusalem make sure to subscribe to our channel to get latest
