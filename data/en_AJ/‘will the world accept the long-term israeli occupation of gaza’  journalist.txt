Anthony Lowenstein is a journalist and author of The Palestine laboratory and he's joining us live from Sydney always good to have you with us on alaz Anthony so Israel knows that taking control keeping control of these key parts of Gaza cannot be acceptable to Hamas or to Egypt so why is it insisting on this because it can and because the US really Biden and frankly carela Harris have not really put any serious pressure on isra frankly since October 7 last year I don't think Washington would want a regional War which I think the lack of a ceasefire in Gaza threatens that possibility that it's quite much more likely that Iran or Hezbollah and Israel get involved in a serious Regional catastrophe but without any kind of serious pressure on Israel to actually remove troops I noticed in your comment a minute ago you say that Anthony blinkin who was in the region said that the the US is opposed to any kind of long-term Israeli presence in Gaza well they say the same thing about the West Bank and here we are 57 years on and it's hardly temporary it's permanent and I think what you see here really um that I'm feeling and hearing more and more is that what Israel is doing here is similar to Oslo Oslo was negotiated for years decades ago creeping creeping negotiations while at the same time the occupation of the West Bank deepened and grew this is a very similar situation in Gaza where without massive pressure on Israel to actually forcibly remove any kind of military presence in Gaza you will not see 10,000 settlers suddenly appearing in Gaza but you might see some outposts of radical right-wing jury settlers that is quite likely because the government in Israel that's what they want but the International Community could not would not allow Israeli settlers back into Gaza would they well would they I mean the question is when one talks International Community that really is one country which essentially is the US I mean much of the world virtually the entire world in fact is against what's happening in the West Bank for over half a century and firstly I think you will find not not small support within Israel itself for some kind of So-Cal Israel would call it a security buffer it's an occupation the idea of separating the North and the South of Gaza where Israel potentially has control the north some form of Palestinian group and it's Hamas or Palestinian Authority controls the South with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians if not more I mean the idea that the world would not accept this I think my feeling is there was an interesting piece written in the last 24 hours by the editor of haret the Israeli newspaper essentially saying that netanyahu's thinking the Israeli government's thinking is that yes the world's outrage they express opposition to what this potentially means occupation but that pressure will go the world will move on and no one's going to care now I think people will care and there'll be pressure from from Civil Society boycotts divestments Etc But ultimately will there be actual pressure from say a Harris presidency or a trump Administration and Israel is betting that they will not be do you think then that the ceasefire negotiations that are starting again in Cairo today most people as you're describing including the families of captives being in being held in Gaza don't think that Netanyahu is willing to compromise to get a ceasefire done so what then is trying to do by keeping the negotiations going like I said before you drag out negotiations with the illusion of believing in some kind of outcome when you know that your opposition Hamas is almost impossible to accept they're not going to accept that kind of condition now obviously we don't know exactly what was discussed between Anthony blink and Netanyahu But ultimately again there is no serious pressure on Israel to relent I do not see it I haven't heard it for 10 plus months and ultimately without that pressure the idea of endless negotiations it is possible it is possible that there's some agreement struck where some hostages are released from Hamas captivity and some Palestinians are also released from Israeli jails but the desire from Israel which they've made very clear is the war continues at the end of that period because they want to maintain that military presence in Gaza and again within Israel itself there's very little opposition to that there are some Israelis of course who oppose it to be sure but not huge amounts of people they don't there are people who want the hostages back in Israel totally understandably of course but ultimately there is no serious International pressure yet from frankly the Arab countries most of them from the US from the EU actual pressure not verbal pressure economic pressure threatening weapons you know ending arms sales to Israel none of that what will it what will it take to change that because if that doesn't change there can there can be nothing to help the Palestinians in Gaza can there I'm not saying that there is no hope I think Civil Society has been totally um empowered frankly in the last 10 months and in many states there is going to be huge pressure on countries to either cut uh some kind of economic ties arms ties I see for example in grow growing amounts of countries there's massive pressure on super enation funds to cut ties with Israeli companies I'm not suggesting for a second there's no hope that's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is that politically without massive pressure in the US particularly on a incoming Harris Administration or even the Trump Administration this will not change and that because the world has essentially accepted more than half a century of occupation of the West Bank we on the precipice of the world potentially an inverted commas accepting an occupation of Gaza unless there is massive pressure on Israel to stop it Anthony Lowenstein thank you as always for your analysis we appreciate it
