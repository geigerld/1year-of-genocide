strikes have been Landing only meters from the NASA hospital it is OB we've been reporting gaza's last remaining Hospital how would you describe the situation there now yeah uh uh thank you very much for interviewing me again uh before we stting actually recording my interview we just had here uh they were were they were bombing all over around the the hospital I I guess you already seen this bombing yes uh the situation here at NAS hospital now became very difficult as you know many of uh evacuated people already left the hospital and many of medical personnel now they couldn't attend the hospital and this put a a lot of pressure over our heads and over our shoulders since we have to compensate and more more more more and more and more uh yes uh situation uh became more disaster and I'm asking uh again as people are passing hundreds per day they are passing away and how how how many of us have to die and uh how many days do we have to go with this horror really I don't know it is an impossible question to it is an impossible question for you to have have to ask I wonder as head of plastic surgery and the burs Department there how many patients do you have and what sort of injuries have you specifically been dealing with Believe Me Brother I'm telling you I have just finished my work at the main operative theater every day every day I'm doing 10 cases 10 cases every day I'm doing I have here at the hospital hundreds of these patients so I can't tell you the exact number but every day we are performing surgeries since the beginning of this war so you can guess the number since the beginning of this war actually we used to do by myself I used to do around 20 cases now I'm doing like between like 10 to 15 cases per day per day we are working continuously brother so I have here at the hospital my patients SC scattered because they are a lot they are scattered at this hospital at gynecologic at gynecological department and the orthopedic department and the be unit everywhere patients is scattered here here at the hospital they need key they need care they they need proper food they need clean water they need uh how to say they need everything so this is actually impossible to to stand more here in this situation and Dr mcrai we are hearing in the background as you are speaking the very loud buzzing sound of aerial vehicles are those Israeli drones could you explain what we're hearing there yes I'm I told you since we start recording there were there were all over around bombing around us actually that's why people like C you know they starting running away at the the hospital that's why and actually right now maybe the ambulance will bring patients from these explosions or these as as a result of bombing now the world obviously watched in great concern with great concern about what happened at the AL shifer hospital um close to Gaza City are there concerns now that a similar situation will unfold at the a hospital and if so how are you possibly preparing for that my God my God I can't tell you this is this is real horror Real Horror if it is if this will happen this will be a real horror this ler hospital is a is the main hospital
