all right let's bring in maram bashara Al jaz's senior political analyst so Mar and there we saw a bit of the the history there of this long-term uh strategy of assassinations against Hamas leaders Israel's also talking about this time not just picking them off individually but wiping them all out I mean how how does this fit into to the longer term narrative well that certainly has been the policy of the past 50 plus years um in fact since the um independence of Israel it has had a policy of assassinations against Palestinian leaders but certainly accelerated in the 1970s against the PLO leaders the fat leaders later on the popular front leaders and then the Democratic front leaders and then it went on against um Al Jad islami on onto hisbah Hamas and so on so forth It's been 50 years of assassination programs run by military intelligence and the Mad throughout the the world really whenever they could get them they targeted them but the thing is that after those dozens of assassinations and more right notably we think about the three main assassinations 1995 against al Jihad Al islami founder fat shikaki 1995 2004 against the founder of Hamas Sheik Ahmed Yasin and 2015 it was the assassination of Ahad Mia was considered the military man of hisbah right now in between as I said there were dozens of other assassinations or attempted assassinations but what was the result I mean Israel could have declared victory at each time it as assassinated one of those leaders but if you look at the scope in general of the history of it Al Jad islami became stronger Hamas became stronger and hisbah became stronger and all three organizations and other organizations somehow found it in their ranks to find even more potent more more charismatic more powerful leaders to be leading those organizations so as the leading Israeli expert Yosi milman on the Mad assassination program put it only a few weeks ago he said 50 years of it there isn't much to show this time though they say they're not just trying to Target people pick them off this is part of a systematic attempt to just wipe out Hamas as a military and political entity I mean is this a way of them showing that they are starting to do that having not really got very far in that particular War aim inside Gaza I I actually think this is uh very much so I think the objective at this point in time now that the war on children is winding down the war on hospitals and is winding down the war on doctors and engineers and schools and residential buildings after 20 plus thousand of Civilian casualties and tens of thousands of other so sorts of casualties among the Palestinians now Israel decided not that it run out of Civilian targets it's running after Hamas leaders apparently in Lebanon I've been saying for the past uh few weeks that the main target of Israel war in Gaza has been the civilians because they're the ones who really died the collateral damage has been Hamas leaderships but yes as you say Israel has made it an objective of this War to assassinate all Hamas leaders if it can and clearly it's starting here now with in Lebanon now is this is this just part of a general abstract opinion I mean program or is it or is it a timing now here the Lebanese prime minister Minister says that the assassination in Lebanon is meant to project the failure in Gaza onto Lebanon I'm really sorry M we have to stop there cuz we are breaking
