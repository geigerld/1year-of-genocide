well Washington's unwavering support for Israel has been criticized by many around the world and that criticism has increased during the past few weeks of the war on Gaza Rosalyn Jordan looks at the history of the ties between the two countries including how it hasn't always been as harmonious as many think thank you for having me and Joe Biden is the 14th US president who has tried to resolve the Israel palestin conflict on the first day of the war in Gaza Biden offered complete support for Israel no calls on it to show restraint we must be Crystal Clear we stand with Israel Biden's support hearkens back to that of President Harry Truman who in 1948 recognized the state of Israel within 11 minutes of its Declaration of Independence but some subsequent presidents took a more tough love approach Dwight Eisenhower Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan all condemned Israel military action on occasion but Reagan also started the practice of awarding Israel $3 billion in Aid every year a strong secure Israel is a shared interest the George HW Bush Administration was the first to threaten to cut Aid to Israel if it didn't stop illegally building settlements in the occupied West Bank thank you for your statement the Obama Administration took the unusual step in 2016 of withholding a veto in the UN Security Council after Benjamin Netanyahu now prime minister ignored Washington's request to stop settlement expansion the US's exstension cleared the way for the security Council to demand Israel's stop construction notably the question of us aid for Israel never came up at either of the Camp David Summits and it was never raised by either presidents George W bush or Donald Trump Trump's support gave Israel what it craved the recognition of Jerusalem as capital of the Jewish State now with the war in Gaza in its fifth month and the death toll Rising some in Congress say Aid to Israel must be made conditional there should be no blank checks for any country we cannot continue the pattern where prime minister Netanyahu says Thank you Mr President for America's generous military assistance and then thumbs his nose at America's legitimate requests there might be a subtle change in US policy of foot the US has circulated a draft Security Council resolution on Gaza that includes words it has refused to use before now a temporary ceasefire but still no definitive plan to leverage billions of dollars in US Aid to convince Netanyahu to change the way he's conducting the war the show of support yet to be matched by what Washington says is its alarm over the situation in Gaza Roselyn Jordan Al jazer Washington we're going to bring in maram Bashar Al jaz's senior political analyst to discuss all of this so rosen's report there saying that we should understand that the relations between the US and Israel have not always been as strong as one might anticipate but to listen to what we were Hearing in the international court of justice just a few hours ago it is quite clear that the US is put Israel's security as the priority for anything that happens in the future true but it's also true that um American Israel relations after 1967 war and the occupation of Palestinian and Arab territory has generally been strong despite the ups and downs it has maintained and remained and even became stronger with the with the time um but 1967 was uh an inflection year if you will in the relationship in the two decades before 1967 Israel got in from the United States something like a billion plus dollars in 20 years a billion or so dollars in the following two decades after Israel occupied Palestinian and Arab land it got 50 billion dollars plus so you can imagine the difference suddenly Israel's occupation of Palestinian and Arab territories became an American Investment America started investing in Israel not when it was weak and let's say vulnerable and let's say in a smaller territory without strategic depth as it was between 1948 and 1967 after Israel won against the combined forces of Arab militaries and occupied a territory three times its size that's when America got on the action and doubled quadrupled and then it basically went from 1 plus billion dollars to $50 billion in American Aid and in the past uh 50 60 years if you take it in $224 it's like 300 billion dollars of American a so what's America getting for its money this is the thing right so I think it Israel and its occupation of Arab and Palestinian territory became a geopolitical asset for the United States and at the time from 1967 to 1977 America was telling the Arab world and Israel the only way you can get your land back is if you stop allying yourself with the Soviet Union and start allying yourself with the United States that was the primary condition at least on Egypt in the beginning it had to move from the the Soviet Camp to the American Camp during the Cold War in order to recover the Sinai and it was the same thing for the syrians it when that as lucky but also for even for American assets like Jordan it became even closer to the United States and its relationship with the United stat would help it recover and establish peace it was the same thing as of the PLO in 1988 you they would have to distance themselves from anything denounce as it were terrorism and and align themselves with the United States if they had any chance to recover so occupation of Palestine became an asset for the United States that it would invest money in Israel in order to maintain it and refuse reject any notion of surrendering it except if the Arabs start accepting American dictates so the I I understand what you were saying about the Israel being essentially a front line for one of a better for us interests in the Middle East particularly against Arab states but in the Trump Administration we had the Abraham Accords where the UAE and Bahrain signed normalization agreements with Israel the Biden Administration has been pushing Saudi Arabia to do the same thing with Israel so if that is beginning to coales to some degree and these are significant Powers within the Middle East where does the US see the benefit still in maintaining Israel as that front line when Biden first became president in the so-called Biden Doctrine in his first major speech on foreign policy he made very clear America is back America is not going to leave any vacuum for Iran Russia and China to fill in in the Middle East so it was a clear message to all America's Nemesis around the world the three main Regional and international forces that America was going to use its leverage and influence again under Biden in order to make sure that it will keep all three countries all three powers outside the geopolitical calculus to the Middle East and hence it started investing in the Abraham Accords and in new normalizations of relation between Saudi Arabia and Israel as well as other countries in order to build a new axis of the so-called Israel moderate Arab regimes against or devoured of Russian Chinese and Iranian influence in order to Serve American geopolitical interest in the region malan we appreciate it as always M Bashar thank you very much indeed
