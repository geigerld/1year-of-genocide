our view is to John Kirby speaking at the White House has already brought halt to the fighting together with a surge of humanitarian assistance now in order to extend the pause Hamas has committed to releasing another 20 women and children over the next two days we would of course hope to see the pause extended further and that will depend upon Hamas continuing to release hostages the president has been deeply engaged on this process throughout the Thanksgiving weekend he spoke with the Amir of cutter at a very critical moment to help resolve an impass on the second day of the pause and then yesterday he spoke with prime minister Netanyahu with a focus on working towards an extension of the pause the extension that Frank quite frankly we're seeing today uh his team then worked on that overnight and through the morning he was briefed this morning by the National Security adviser Jake Sullivan on the ongoing talks to extend the pause he and his entire National Security team will obviously stay engaged on this over the coming days as we work to implement this extension of the original agreement as well as efforts to extend the pause even from there uh just a quick update on the figures as of uh this the morning of November 26 200 trucks were dispatched to the Rafa Crossing and 137 trucks of supplies were offloaded by the United Nations reception point in Gaza making it the biggest humanitarian Convoy received since the 7th of October this brings the total number of trucks uh of Aid and assistance including fuel to over 2,000 since the 21st of October our team has prioritized getting this much-needed relief into Gaza to alleviate alleviate the suffering of Palestinian civilians there of course most of them have nothing to do with Hamas uh and to date we have assisted over 840 Americans and their families who have departed and sought the support of our team on the ground in Egypt that take some questions thank you Admiral um few things here the president uh called conditional aid for Israel a worthwhile thought is he actually considering conditioning Aid or not what he also said right after uh acknowledging that was a worthwhile thought was that the approach he has chosen to take so far has produced results and outcomes many of them I just walked you through in my opening statement um so the approach that we're taken with Israel and quite frankly with our partners in the region uh is working it's getting Aid in to people that need it it's getting a pause in the fighting it's getting hostages out it's getting Americans out uh and quite frankly we continue to urge and will continue to urge the Israelis as they conduct military oper ation to do so with the utmost care for innocent civilian life Democrats in the part in his party who say we need to start conditioning it going forward what would he say I think he would say exactly what he said to y'all yesterday when he got asked this question it's a worthwhile thought but the approach that I'm taking Now is working the approach that we're taking Now is working it's getting results the increasing dangers to US military personnel in the Gulf um I I know you outlined in a series of appearances this morning what happened um but are we we to continue seeing this sort of let me put it as way is that strategy of of dealing with it as it happens going to continue to be the Strat you've seen some say there should perhaps be a more robust response to these ongoing attacks whether it's from Iranian back militias in Syria or Iraq whether it's the houthis is the is there any thought of changing up how that's done I don't think we're going to get in the business of telegraphing our punches head uh We've uh we've responded uh forcefully against the threats to our forces in Iraq and Syria and now uh our forces in the Gulf region the Gulf of Oman Gulf of Aiden uh will continue to do that as appropriate is striking in Yemen still an option again I'm not going to sell the gra punches we will take these steps appropriate to protect our troops and uh and our forces uh in the Middle East region I would add that the Mason is attached to the USS Eisenhower carrier strike Group which the president dispatched to the region specifically to address the increase in the tensions uh any possibility that Americans would be among the 20 that we release over the next few days well we certainly hope so I mean we're going to watch this very very closely we're certainly hoping that another batch of uh hostages gets released today as part of the fourth and final day of the original agreement um we're going to be watching closely to see if any Americans are in that group as it as it has come out over the last three days we don't really know until you get into the end game who's going to be actually on that list and and then even then you got to watch closely to seeing if who's on the list is folks that actually come out so we're watching and and hoping and you spoke of the president's conversation at a critical moment to break that impact can you talk a little more about what that impact was and how that was broken his conversations I mean it was really it came down to uh you talking about over the weekend it was really more about the the lists and who was on it and um and I don't want to get into more detail than that it's a similar issue to what we face today uh the reason why there's been a little bit of a delay because there was a um a difference of a view if if you might uh over the the list and the fact that mothers were not originally going to be allowed to come out with their children and that's been resolved so it really had to do with the The Who and very very quickly uh the newly elected leader of Argentina says he's coming to the US also the DC uh and he meeting that scheduled with Administration officials uh with president with anybody else while he's here yes president uh Malay will be coming to Washington DC largely to meet with the IMF over and the World Bank over uh um of their fiscal and economic issues uh but while he's here in town he'll have a chance to meet with some National Security Council uh folks including Jake suiv no plans to be with the President right no plans to be with the president the president will as you think you know be on travel in the middle of the week thank you uh on the remaining Americans who are being held do you have any more clarity on whether they're being held by Hamas or with one of these other terrorist groups no and you know all along you've been very clear about concerns that a broader ceasefire would only benefit Hamas Sullivan was pretty clear yesterday and saying that you know Hamas has been able to gain some benefit from this how concerned are you that the longer this truce lasts now 6 days um that Hamas will benefit and how do you weigh that it's a real risk um uh you have to expect a group like Hamas a terrorist group uh which clearly doesn't abide by laws of war we try to take advantage of any pause in the fighting for their own benefit so we're watching that closely as well as our Israeli counterparts you can you can bet that they're watching that closely uh but and I don't want to speak for uh the Israelis but I mean this is a calculated risk that prime minister Netanyahu and his War cabinet are willing to take in order to get those hostages out so it's a it's a balance um and as you've also heard the Israelis say that once the pauses are over U they intend to go right back at military operations and when you say that you know Hamas has been able to get some benefits so far is that restocking resupplying what is that benefit you know I would just say that without getting into intelligence issues that any pause in the fighting uh could benefit uh uh your enemy in terms of time to refit to rest your fighters to rearm them re-equip them um uh you know a pause in the fighting can can be seen as a as a benefit but I again I want to stress and this was always part of the calculus any discussion of pauses um was always part of the calculus that that Hamas might try to benefit from it but so too have the Israeli people benefited by the return of of their loved ones and hostages so too have the American people benefited now with little Abigail back with her family so again it's a balance um and um again I won't speak for the Israeli Defense Forces but when but but when they have when these pauses are over then they have made it very clear that they're going to continue to Target Hamas leadership John how many Americans are still being held hostage and do you have proof of life we think the number is um well it's less than 10 probably in the neighborhood of you know about 8 to nine um but we don't necessarily have firm solid information on each and every one of them and why haven't the two American women who are with the with Abigail what what happened with that why haven't they been well we certainly hope that we'll see them uh in in hopefully today and if not today certainly over the next couple of days we want to see them back with their families where they belong as well the the lists are developed by Hamas and then of course there's the Israelis developed their list of Palestinian prisons that they're going to release we're not involved in the specific drafting of the lists and the determination on the Masa side of who's going to come out on any given day obviously we want to see those two American women released as soon as possible the truce being extended two days what what happens now you want to get like 3 days next or a permanent truce what what what's the thing it's like I said in my opening statement Steve we're grateful that we've got an extra two days to work with here that'll that'll result in the release of 20 more individuals women and children and as I said uh right at the top we'd certainly like to see even that extension extended further uh until all the hostages are released that's really the goal here get all the hostages home with their families where they belong and we you know however long that could take thank you um just to follow up on the question about M visiting you mentioned that most of his meetings would be with the INF but who will be he meeting at the White House at the NC and what are the expectations of the White House for this meeting and more broadly what are the expectations of the president for the relationship between the two Nations I already answered that question he's going to be he'll have a chance to meet with Jake Sullivan um and potentially other folks here at the NC we'll have to see how that shakes out uh president won't unfortunately be able to meet with them because of domestic travel um but uh obviously we want to continue to look for ways to cooperate with Argentina Argentina is a a healthy and vibrant partner uh in this hemisphere on many many issues um and so we're looking forward to obviously hearing what the president elect's ideas are and where he wants to go on policy issues and all right that's the tail end of a press conference at the White House by John Kirby the National Security advisor
