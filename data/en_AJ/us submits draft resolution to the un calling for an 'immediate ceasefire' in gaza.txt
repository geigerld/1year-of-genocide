begin with breaking news the United States says it submitted a draft resolution to the UN Security Council calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza Secretary of State Anthony blinkin says the resolution is linked to the release of captives and that he hopes countries will support the move the US has previously vetoed attempts to achieve a ceasefire at the United Nations let's get more with our diplomatic editor James space who joins us on the line so James what more are you hearing about this us resolution well these comments have come from Secretary of State blinkin in the last half hour and clearly sound very important indeed uh what we need to know is exact the exact language of the UN Security Council resolution to which he's referring and I can tell you that Al jazer has obtained a copy of the latest we thought it was the latest us uh Security Council draft just a few hours ago and this is I think where the language is important because he's talking when he spoke to reporters a short time ago about immate ceasefire the resolution the copy we've seen does use the words immediate and sustain sustain Ceasar but this is where it gets complicated and this is important the language have says the security Council determines the imperative of an immediate and sustained ceasefire to protect civilians all sides now determines determines the imperative means that an immediate and sustained ceasefire the security Council believes is important what other members of the security Council want is the immediate demand for one to take place and it's not clear in this resolution that that's actually what the US is demanding and I have to be honest with you it's not clear whether this copy of the resolution that Al jazer obtained just a couple of hours ago is the copy that secretary of state blinkin is talking about uh it may well be this is a fluid document it's being updated all the time that the language has been changed it is certainly the strongest draft that I have seen with regard to the situation in Gaza demanding immediate aid uh go into uh Gaza uh talking about International humanitarian law being compliant with it is a lengthy document this is something the US has been working on a draft resolution for some weeks now and it's been constantly evolving certainly the strongest language yet but is it quite what the rest of the security Council want a demand for an immediate Cesar or is it just a resolution where the security Council would say an immediate cesa is something that's very important um and he may then of course be able to refer to the ongoing talks that are taking place uh in Doha to try and get a six week ceasefire as you say James strong language uh in this uh draft resolution that the US is putting forward and this is of course a significant uh change it would appear given the US's uh previous vetos uh at the security Council on Gaza yes we have for three times we've had uh the US representative in the security Council sort raise their arm in veto against the rest of the security Council only the UK has been on two of those resolutions not supporting the resolution in exstension um but the US is the only one that with veto Powers blocked those resolutions the security Council would have called for an immediate Ceasar at the end of last year if it hadn't been uh for the United States and I know from diplomats uh in New York and elsewhere that there's been um considerable concern about this among the security Council but also I think among the US diplomatic Community uh diplomats senior diplomats have told me they believe that the US ambassador herself Linda Thomas Greenfield has been uneasy about the US position and has been advocating for the US to take a stronger position given uh the scale of the deaths caused by Israel's bombardment James thank you very much for the moment that's James Bas our diplomatic editor on the line there we'll have have more on this breaking news story throughout the day here of course the US reportedly submitting a new draft resolution at the security Council calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza
