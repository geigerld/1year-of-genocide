Gabriel Alando joins us from the United Nations Headquarters Gabriel you've been you've been tracking the language in this resolution and the various drafts um since pretty much the beginning of the week so you are best place to tell us exactly what this says and what this does what do we need to remember from uh un Security Council resolution 1029 what does it do well the big picture the big umbrella if you will is it is now binding under international law since it passed and it is calling for a huge ramp up of humanitarian Aid into Gaza uh and then a ramp up of its distribution as well now that's the big picture beyond that sometimes what is not in a resolution is as important as what's in it and that could be the case here in the final uh draft resolution that is now uh was voted upon and is now part of intern is binding under international law uh it does not call for a suspension of hostilities instead it just calls for a conditions leading to a sustainable cessation of hostilities and this was a real point of contention particularly for uh Russia and some other members of the security Council who wanted much much more than that uh and you say why is that so important because in order to get this Aid in uh safely and ramp up this Aid uh you got to do that with with with with safety right you can't do that as as a as a place is being bombarded so uh that's key also it also calls for the Secretary General to appoint aaran I have to jump in because we see the ambassador of Palestine at the UN who is speaking so let's listen in had been killed by Israel the occupying power in its Siege and aggression on the Gaza Strip the council is now meeting after over 20,000 Palestinians have been killed almost half of them children and 60,000 people have been wounded and 2 million Palestinians have been Force forcefully displaced it is meeting as homes shelters schools hospitals have been destroyed and as hunger and disease are spreading like wildfire no one should forget that what we are talking about are 2.3 million Palestinians who have been fighting for their life and facing death every single day for 75 days they have been fighting for their lives for their very existence for over 75 days Mr President the Arab and the OIC groups with the support of an overwhelming number of UN member states have been mobilizing for three objectives and we said that from the beginning end the Carnage immediately immediate seiz fire humanitarian assistance at scale and no Force displacement we meet today as part of this continuous effort to advance these three goals Mr President allow me at the onset to pay tribute to all the humanitarian and health care workers who are who at Peril to their own lives are struggling every single day to address and alleviate an occupation made humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented scale they are operating under conditions where no place and no one is safe under widespread and indiscriminate bombing where hospitals and shelters and ambulances are shelled and with minimal to no access to humanitarian supplies necessary to sustain and save lives we pay tribute to the Palestine red crescent in which many of you have met them in your trip to the Rafa Crossing to Palestinian medical and civilian rescue teams to the Personnel of the United Nations and its agencies notably Ona to the members of Palestinian and international humanitarian organizations on the ground and to the icrc their work is heroic and deserves our utmost recognition and respect the draft resolution presented by the United Arab Emirate is to allow them to conduct their sacred mission to assist civilians in need to save human lives as Israel the occupying power continues to ignore the the global demands for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and to deprive the Palestinian people of the humanitarian Aid they desperately need there are thousands of trucks of humanitarian Aid on the Egyptian side and Egypt's full willing willing uh willingness and mobilization to this to see this Aid delivered us saw those thousands of truckloads from your trip from Alish airport to the Rafa Crossing there are over 2 million Palestinians in desperate need of such Aid on the Palestinian side this inhumane and criminal Israeli Siege this use of humanitarian Aid necessary for the survival of the population as method of War has to end and it has to end now Mr President on 4th of November the deputy head of the Israeli civil Administration stated from inside Gaza and I quote whoever return whoever returns here if they return here after will find scorched Earth no houses no agriculture no nothing they have no future end of quotation this is just one statement among far too many demonstrating in shocking terms that what we are dealing with is an attempt at the destruction of our people and their displacement forever from their land this is Israel's goal it's true objective no future for Palestinians in Palestine that is why it is bombing everyone and everything that is why it targets homes hospitals schools bakeries agricultural Fields water and sanitation networks so that sustenance of life becomes impossible and it has become impossible that is why it targets the landmarks of Gaza which stand witness of its ancient history and of Our Roots in the land our historic churches and mosques our monuments and our architecture Israel also targets the storytellers those who capture our people's lives suffering and death including the journalist conveying to the world the truth about the massacres about this grave and unbearable Injustice being endured by Palestinian people and their families but Israel's Target is not only the past and the present of our people but indeed the future that is why it kills our doctors engineers poets academics artists this is why it is destroying our cities and towns our universities and cultural institutions that is why it kills our children and terrorizes and traumatizes them scaring and disfiguring their Futures we often quote the number of children killed an unbearable tragedy but we should not forget get the 25,000 children orphaned and the tens of thousands wounded and amputated a 12 year-old Palestinian girl with the most beautiful of names dun which means dun in Arabic it means the whole world lost both her her her sister and her brother all killed in israeli's Shilling over her house she also lost her leg and I believe she was interviewed by the CNN journalist that United Arab Emirate managed to let her enter the Gaza Strip and to make that important report that she did andonia said that while she will never forget her loved ones she has to continue living that she would become a doctor to help children as doctors helped her but Dunya did not live to become a doctor or to memorialize her family she was killed a few days ago later in the strike and the maternity word of anas Hospital Israel wants to convince to convince us that we need to choose between life and our country by making life in our country impossible our people want to live in their country they want their children to grow safely in their country there is no simpler dream there is no aspiration more sacred than that Mr President Israel's treatment of Palestinian civilians and its uphor and its abhorent crimes against them were further starkly revealed after Israel killed three people raising a white flag and representing no danger it later discovered that they were three Israelis who had been held captive in Gaza it could have saved them had it observed the laws of war but it thought they were Palestinians and shut them and yet another display of total abject disregard for Palestinian lives this confirms the many reports of summary executions of Palestinians being murdered in Cold Blood by Israeli soldiers in Gaza Israel has also continued its ill treatment and mass arrest and hum humiliation of Palestinian in Despicable scenes filmed by its own soldiers boosting about their dear depravity those are the soldiers of a ragu Army unhinged and un and empowered by the impunity it enjoys certain that it will not be held accountable an army that commits atrocities every single day in the words of Israel's closest allies its indiscriminate bombing and its killing rage needs to stop that means its crimes need to stop Gaza is like a patient whose wounds you are trying to treat while the killer keeps shooting at them you need to stop the killer or you will never be able to save the patient Mr President death is everywhere in Gaza in its different manifestations destruction deprivation disease people are starving they have no water no food no medicine or barely any the draft resolution that the council voted on today is intented to help address this inhumane situation to alleviate the untold suffering and pain being born by millions of civilians we welcome the decision to establish a un mechanisms to accelerate the provision of humanitarian relief Consignments to Gaza and call for its rapid implementation the council also called for Urgent steps to immediately allow safe unhindered and expanded humanitarian access the Secretary General and all un agencies as well as humanitarian organizations have all said that this requires an immediate humanitarian ceasefire now backed by 153 states around the world it took this Council 75 days to finally utter the word secession of hostilities to utter the word secession of hostilities 40 days after the general assembly first referred to that objective and tens of thousands of Palestinians killed later we support the Russian Amendment and the United Arab Emirate as Arab representative reflected that support in its vote of course that that paragraph which was endorsed in the blue form the original one by the 83 co-sponsors the resolution is also clear about the unwavering commitment to the two-state solution consistent with international law and UN resolution resolutions and in this context on the status of the Gaza Strip as an integral part of the territory occupied in 1967 and as part of the Palestinian State and on the unity of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and the role of the Palestinian Authority and the complete rejection of forc displacement in violation of international law Mr President let us act now to save lives to provide life saving assistance and life sustaining hope this resolution is a step in the right direction it must be implemented and must be accompanied by Massive pressure for an immediate ceasefire I repeat immediate ceasefire there is no way to stop the war crimes crimes against humanity and genocide underway but an immediate ceasefire ceasefire again there is no way to start addressing the occupation made humanitarian catastrophe but an immediate ceasefire ceasefire again there is no way to release those held captive but an immediate ceasefire this resolution calls for protection of civilians deplores attacks against civilians rejects Force displacement calls for immediate and safe humanitarian access and for humanitarian Aid reaching the Palestinian population all that requires an immediate ceasefire immediate ceas fire as requested and as called for by the Secretary General in his famous letter to the security Council Humanity must Prevail International laws law must Prevail millions of lives hang in the balance and I think thank you very much Mr President I thank the permanent Observer of the Observer state of Palestine for his statement I now give the floor to the representative of Israel thank you Mr President Just A Week Ago jel Adel carried out a terror attack in Iran in which 11 Iranian police officers were killed within one day the security Council released a statement condemning the act of Terror it took the security Council one day to express their condolences and sympathy with the families of the victims it's true terrorism must be condemned even if the attacks are perpetrated against police officers of a rogue regime and the world's leading sponsor of global Terror Mr President 77 days ago Kamas intentionally murdered raped and mutilated 1,300 Israelis and took 250 hostages and this Council still has yet to issue a sing sing Le statement condemning Kamas and their atrocities in addition to the council's inability to condemn hamas's attack the 130 hostages women children and the elderly are still being held in Gaza and must not be allowed to become a footnote humanitarian Aid is pouring into Gaza every single day yet the hostages being held by Hamas are not even allowed visits by the Red Cross this is the most heinous War crime imaginable the hostages must be at the top of this council's agenda council members there is no doubt that humanitarian Aid is crucially important Israel is already facilitating hundreds of truckloads of Aid into Gaza every day Israel is also willing and able to exponentially increase the entry of Aid trucks into Gaza Israel has already opened the km Shalom Crossing in order to ensure the entry of more trucks and has also facilitated the entry of dozens of trucks that arrived from Jordan the only roadblock for Aid entry is the un's ability to accept them enhancing un monitoring or coordination of Aid is not a cure all and any enhancement of un Aid monitoring cannot be done at the expense of Israel's security inspections Israel not only has a right but an obligation to guarantee its security this is why our mission to eliminate hamas's capabilities has not changed and this is why security inspections of Aid will not change Israel will not permit the regrouping and rearming of Hamas as the atrocities of October 7th can never be allowed to repeat themselves Israel recently exposed another huge Hamas Terror tunnel that stretches 4 km was constructed 50 m underground this Terror tunnel is wide enough for vehicles to drive through can house hundreds of terrorists the amount of cement and equipment needed to build this tunnel alone is immense this is just one part of kamasa subterranean city of Terror the missile and Rocket manufacturing facilities and terrorist training complexes across Gaza it cannot be claimed that Israel did not give any warning for years we have sent letters outlining hamas's Terror threat and growing capabilities we have held countless meetings with officials we have done everything possible to make it clear that action must be taken but our words fell on deaf ears Mr President if this Council seeks to end hostilities it should start by supporting Israel's mission of returning the hostages and eliminating the Kamas threat at the very least it must prevent hamas's empowerment just as this council is committed to increasing Aid it should also be committed to blocking the smuggling of arms and transfer weapons to the Hamas terrorists and just as this council is committed to ensuring Aid reaches GS and civilians it should also be committed to ensuring the said Aid is not diverted to hamad's terrorists who do not care about the civilian population the focus of any resolution should also hold Hamas accountable while taking every step to prevent them from entrenching themselves and regaining power Mr President Hamas is a genocidal Terror organization Hamas is a direct threat to the security of Israel to gazans and Regional stability in order to promote security this Council should first recognize hamas's Terror regime and then focus on the elimination of its threats it should be focused on freeing the hostages it should be focused on preventing Hamas from exploiting Aid it should be focused on ensuring Kamas can no longer expand their Terror infrastructure any resolution adopted by this Council should be focused primarily on these points and this is the council's responsibility and this is key to security I thank you Mr President
