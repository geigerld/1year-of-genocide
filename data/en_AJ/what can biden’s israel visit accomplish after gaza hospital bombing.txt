Joe Biden leaves the White House on an unprecedented Journey a US president traveling to Israel as it wages War the prime intention to visibly demonstrate us support in the most dramatic of ways he goes with the full backing of Congress the US Senate at work to push through a bill providing material Aid to Israel as well as humanitarian relief for Palestinians the Senate must above all work quickly and swiftly to draft consider and pass a strong Aid package for Israel as soon as we can that includes Military Support intelligence support diplomatic help the Senate minority leader adds other elements to the presidential to-do list he needs to make it clear that his administration will do everything possible to keep Israel the time and the space it needs to conduct the required military operations for as long as it takes how many more hold out sir the house is still in turmoil with majority Republican sharply divided over ideology leadership and policy yet amidst this division there is one point of agreement among all support for the state of Israel well I think the resolution first to show that the American people through their representatives support Israel and condemn Hamas and these Terror attacks the deadline to refunding the government is f approaching but for most Republicans the priority is to get a pro-israel bill through the house this on top of the $3.3 billion a year that Congress has never contested the US was the first country in the world to recognize Israel the recognition by President Truman coming only 11 minutes after the provisional government declared statehood on May the 14th 1948 and President Biden is likely to point to the drive to pass an Israel bill in the Senate and the house as clear evidence that recognition and support has never wavered Mike Hannah aljazera Washington now President Biden has also reacted to Tuesday's attack in a statement he says he is outraged and deeply saddened by the exposion at Al Ali Hospital in Gaza and the terrible loss of life that resulted he goes on to say the US stands unequivocally for the protection of civilian life during the conflict our correspondent Alan Fischer is in Tel Aviv for us so Alan this Hospital strike has thrown Biden's atiny into disarray what's his plan now after he lands in Tel Aviv in a few hours time well his intention of course was to come and act as an onest broker to show support for Israel which he's done since hours after the Hamas attack but also urge them to take care when it comes to their operations in Gaza to minimize the humanitarian uh impact that it has that argument has been made a lot easier after what happened in the hospital and Joe Biden has instructed his National Security team to carry out their own investigation to find out exactly what happened he sees this is hugely important the Israelis of course have already decided that they weren't responsible for this but clearly he's flying into a situation that's a lot more volatile than he expected uh but it may may just strengthen his hand when he goes to argue with the Israelis that there is a danger that an extended operation in Gaza would leak Global public support that they they had immediately after what happened 10 days ago but and now that Jordan has cancelled this Summit with Egypt the Palestinian uh president Mahmud Abbas how does that affect Biden's credibility as an honest broker here it it's embarrassing and it's a setback Joe Biden believes that when he gets people in the room he can negotiate he can get people to come together that's just disappeared because when was the last time you heard of someone walking away from a meeting with the president of the United States and that's exactly what the jordanians the Egyptians and the Palestinians have done now the White House is putting a spin on it they understand the need to mourn those who died but this is embarrassing there's no doubt about it and it certainly hinders his ability to do he was going to do which was active inh handed visit Israel then travel to Jordan for his his his Tri country Summit so it becomes a lot more difficult he will speak to Mahmud abas and president CeCe of Egypt on his journey home but this is a long way to come to show support for Israel when at the end might be struggling to show anything for it Alan on Tuesday SE say Anthony blink was talking about a humanitarian plan an aid plan what happens to that now well of course it's all been given to David saterfield who is the the new presidential Envoy the special Envoy to deal with humanitarian Affairs and he's trying to set up some sort of first of all safe Corridor but also to make sure that International Aid gets in uh to Gaza that now becomes uh a bigger task for him uh again it's hard to know how the dynamic of what's Happening in the hospital will change things uh but it might make things easier to try and get International Aid into the Gaza Strip because the Israelis while denying that they were responsible have undoubtedly been rocked back on their Heels by the international reaction to what happened in Gaza uh late on Wednesday night okay Alan fer joining us there from Tel Aviv thanks very much Alan
