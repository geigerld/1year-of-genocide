well South Africa has filed an urgent request for the international court of justice to impose more provisional measures on Israel in order to prevent famine in Gaza it says there is already widespread starvation in the strip and additional orders are needed to protect Palestinians in January you'll recall the un's top court ordered Israel to refrain from any acts that could fall under the genocide convention along with five other provisional measures South Africa claims that Israel is already breaching those orders well let dig into this with aler senior political analyst Maan bashara he's in London Maan help us understand a little more about what's happening at the international court of justice right now it's already imposed these provisional measures on Israel what sort of additional provisional measures could we see what does South Africa want well certainly just the idea of invoking what Israel is doing and reminding the justices at the icj that Israel is not only not responding in Israel is uh basically uh stepping on and humiliating the court itself by turning its back on all its recommendations and uh taking a the opposite root not only is it continuing uh with the bombing Siege with the attacks on hospitals and residential buildings and of course uh the lines for food but it's also starving uh people starving children the malnutrition the diseases and The Siege now is killing people silently so genocide is clearly uh taking place unraveling in plain sight with intent because we all understand now that the an TRS are waiting on the borders hundreds of them and Israel won't let them in even won't respond to its own Al the United States that's been begging begging the net government to let the food in because it doesn't want to look this bad in front of its own public and internationally Maran you've been saying that Israel is acting with impunity is anything that South Africa or the court does is any of that likely to make any kind of a difference well judging from the actions of the Israeli government it seems not it seems like they are sort of rest assured that the United States will protect them as it has in the past now it's been five months of more of the same the Israelis the American tell us give them assurances that they will uh allow the humanitarian Aid that they will reduce uh the casualties among the Palestinians but they don't do that they don't follow through if anything it's all turning into an insult on top of the injury that Israel is humiliating its Ally it's embarrassing its Partners In The West while it continues to carry on with its genocide the scenes of children dying the scenes of children begging for food the scenes of the destructions in Gaza and let's all remember that this has been a war on children a war on women a a war on hospitals and civilians that Hamas has been the collateral damage here so this all continues unabated and the West continues to assure us that they are putting pressure well guess what the pressure is not helping and the theatrics of dropping food from the air as we just heard from the United Nations official is not only doesn't work it's once again it adds insult to the injury in the sense that everyone is allowing Israel to act with imp Unity no one is able to use their leverage or willing to use their leverage with Israel and hence the icj needs to take up what is going on and make a judgment accordingly Maran you talk about pressure from Israel's Western allies Israeli War cabinet minister Benny Gans has just been in London and before that he was in Washington DC what's your assessment of his tour of Western capitals I think it's more theatrics I think the Biden Administration has been unable and unwilling to put sufficient pressure on the Netanyahu government for example stopping the arms stopping the support making its support un making it support conditional if anything and it's creating instead this uh political storm about some divisions in Israel and that they are appealing to one side of the war cabin on the other well let's remind our viewers around the world that Benny Gans is and has been a war criminal for more than a decade now I mean he is the one who boasted of bombing Gaza back to the Stone Age in the 2014 War he is the architect of the ongoing genocide in Gaza Netanyahu sits in his office and takes political decision The Architects of the war the ones who are managing the genocide are Benny Gant and Galant and and eot and other gen on Israel so for the United States to make them look like they are the good guys like as if they were the moderates is utter humbug it is just in crisis it doesn't know what to do and benan uh shuttles and goes between uh Tel Aviv Washington and and London and of course in London he hears the the same thing he heard from Washington and it all washes away because the war continues and we know for a fact we know for a fact because we heard it from American officials that they support the war even after whatever temporary ceasefire is going to be carried out so they continue to support Gans in his War they continue to support the war on Rafa andus in the South part of Gaza what they're asking the Israelis to do is simply try to reduce the casualties a little bit because it has become so embarrassing for Israel's allies in the west because now they are implicated in the ongoing genocide in Gaza Maran Bashar aler senior political analyst there for us in London today thank you Maran
