the Saudi and Turkish foreign ministers have held talks in Istanbul and called for an end to Israel's war on Gaza the two ministers once again stressed the need for an immediate ceasefire Turkish foreign minister hakan fedan says the International Community should increase pressure on Israel to accept a deal cam CI is in Istanbul following that meeting Saudi foreign minister F Salin farhan's visit to turky is actually the third Minister level visit paid by Saudi officials within the last two weeks H he was first received by Turkish president reab T ardogan in Istanbul and then he held talks with his Turkish counterpart hakam fidan of course along with the bilateral relations and aims and Targets in economy and politics one of the main key topics was the war in Gaza two top diplomats underline that a two-state solution is necessary based on 1967 borders and independent Palestine is a must on the way H to peace and permanent ceasefire and they both emphasize that more uh Western countries must recognize Palestine as an independent state while International Community must pressure Israel to accept the peace deal that recently Hamas has accepted Turkish foreign minister underlined that Hamas didn't accept this peace R because it was weak or desperate but that was necessary uh for uh safety and stability in the region and they pointed out the potential uh International risks if Israel continued its attack on Gaza of course turkey Syria normalization was also one of the topics asked to Turkish foreign minister and he mentioned that the syri turkey's uh stance towards the Syrian opposition is the same uh and uh opposition and Turkish military fought against isil and other uh terrorist organizations inside Syria shoulder-to-shoulder and the return of the Syrian refugees back to their home can only happen on the voluntary basis cam KOLO aljer Isam let's bring in Hassan barari he's a professor of international Affairs at Qatar University he's in the Jordanian Capital Aman welcome uh Hassan so we we just heard there the Saudis are in Turkey trying to collectively push for an end to the violence fears of course of a regional spillover are high especially given tensions between Hezbollah and Lebanon and Israel how would you describe the pace of Peace efforts right now well it is very important n um that the the Turkish foreign minister and the Saudis um see eye to eye on the on what is happening across the Jordan uh in in the occupied territories um the realization is very important that short of having um two solution end of this war you know the region is um is going into a kind of of chaos if I can say and this is very important because at the same time uh they call for uh uh more pressure on Israel uh but also on Hamas in order to reach a deal uh that would mitigate the situation and preclude the spillover effect of this 9month old uh crisis and has Hassan of course in the last 24 hours 48 hours in Gaza have been particularly deadly haven't they I mean two large strikes one at in almasi in Western Rafa on Saturday at least 90 people killed there many more people missing and strike on Gaza City 60 bodies recovered there were talking once again about High Caliber weapons being used in densely populated areas as of course the United States deals with its own political challenges do you think that's having an impact on the kind of pressure America's willing to put on Israel right now well I think um the United States is preoccupied with the internal domestic issues uh you know in particular the the field attempt in on Trump's life H I think they have a little time to put more pressure on on the Israelis and at the same time Nao is trying to appease his Partners in the government uh by escalating uh by escalating the the conflict with with Hamas but at the same time uh he he knows very well that you know that he needs to reach a deal because he failed over the last nine months to liberate even one hostage I mean they they manage Maybe three or four but you know the the the vast majority of the hostages are still held in in maybe safe areas in in Gaza and the only way is toate them is by having to deal with Hamas the pressure on Netanyahu is is mounting also internally you know giving the demonstrations and giving also the opposition and the collapse of the war cabin um so he needs to do something but at the same time you know he's trying to to balance between the to to appease his own Coalition partners and also the demand of of the public there is of course a very real risk that in a few months time we will have a very different president in the White House how is that being factored in to the equation by Regional powers do you think well we didn't have like one common position here and in this part of the region you know there are some players here I'm talking about key States uh that would be they're going to be upbeat to see Trump again um nany is one of them I think he's trying he's buying time and he's trying even to cause a kind of electoral loss on the part of Biden because he feels more Comfort comfortable with with Trump but at the same time there's some Arab regimes here they want to see um Trump back again because they see eye to eye with him uh he is more transactional in terms of his foreign policy H he wouldn't pay attention to the human right record for some countries uh so I think there's a mixed feelings in this part of the world but at the same time there are some countries that would feel threatened by by Trump you know Jordan is one of them because he Trump is one of yeah is one of the people looking for a deal of the century at the expense of the Palestinian Jordan okay Hassan many thanks for that Hassan barari
