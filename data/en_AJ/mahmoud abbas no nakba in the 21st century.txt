[Music] Israel's government has no red lines no more and it should be held responsible and punished since the beginning of the aggression there was a Bloodshed and given this massacre that took place tonight and having I decided to stop my visit and to go back home so that I can be with my people during this painful situation and hard times I've agreed with my brothers in Egypt and Jordan to cancel the summit That was supposed to take place with President Biden and I call on everyone for Unity and we call everyone to remain calm because this will only benefit the enemies of the Palestinian people it's been more than 75 years of pain and occupation and crimes and violations against and violations of international law while the world remains silent we have warned the International Community of the consequences of the crimes committed by Israel and I demand now during these difficult times to held the governments of Israel responsible and to provide International protection for our people dozens of decisions have been taken and made and many resolutions have been taken but have never been implemented because the United States does not want to implement it this aggression should stop and those crimes should stop as well we will not allow for another nakba during the 21st century and we will not accept that our people will be forced to move again and displaced they will remain on their land and we will not move we will not leave we will not leave no matter the sacrifices that we have to make we will exert all our efforts and do all what we can so that we can stop this Blood shed in Gaza any words or any statements except about ceasefire will not be accepted and the security Council should shoulder its responsibility and should take the initiative to issue a resolution to condemn this crime and to stop the aggression immediately we call our people our to for Unity during this decisive moment this is a dangerous moment we can only face this situation and to be able to stand by each other's side I salute all our people in Gaza STP Our Heroes and everywhere and I tell them that the isra plans to displace you and make you leave your land will never happen and we will face it and we will stop it and we respect the position of all the countries who stood by us all the Arab countries that are against the displacement do not allow it we appreciate their position our people will not surrender and we will make victory at the end peace be upon all our Mars and speed recovery for the wounded and we will free the prisoners we will be on continuous meeting as of now to take or make the right decisions in order to stop those Massac against our people the meetings will continue in order to make all the required decisions and the decisions that you deem fit and we demand from the world a world that has always been silent it's time to take action it's time to speak it's time to say something but you cannot remain silent as if this Palestinian people did not exist and their blood has no value everyone is silent we will never accept this we will never accept this from now on and we will not surrender but what is important is that we will stay on our land we will not leave our land and we will not allow anyone to force us to leave or to displace us as they did in the past the past will not repeat itself 1948 and 1967 events will not happen again okay that was Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas speaking after that Israeli air raid on a hospital in Gaza in which 500 people were killed let's bring in Imran Khan who joins us from occupied East Jerusalem Imran correct me if I'm wrong but up until this point we haven't publicly seen the Palestinian Authority president we've only received statements so what do you make of his comments now 12 days into this war well he had to speak he had to speak after that hospital bombing there's no way that he couldn't issue a statement particular ularly after he canel his meeting with President Joe Biden that meeting is now completely canceled uh according to reports we hearing um the jordanians aren't going to be meeting and the is the um Egyptians aren't going to be meeting he also knows the mood on the streets of the occupied West Bank everybody in the occupied West Bank is supporting uh the people of Gaza and everything that they're going through he couldn't get this ceasefire you heard him speak there blaming the Israelis squarely uh for for uh the attack uh but he also talked about a ceasefire that's something he hasn't been able to get so clearly he feels incredibly frustrated uh and feels like there is nothing to talk to the Americans about so addressing his people has become uh the priority here now remember he doesn't have any contacts with Hamas he doesn't have any contacts with the Israelis the International Community is really the only way he has of uh trying to put pressure on Israel uh to either maintain a either start and maintain a ceasefire or actually just entirely stop this war but now he's not meeting with President Joe Biden so that's an Avenue that's been cut off to him I think he feels like he is cut off from the uh International Community that he has to now rely on the Arab world he mentioned uh the Arab world there he said that um it's now up to the Arab world to try and put pressure uh on the Israelis to try and stop uh what they're doing so it was incredibly important that he was seen after everything that's gone on and remember this has only all happened in the last say six or seven hours this is all very fresh so he needed to speak to the Palestinian people that's what he's done he's got his message out there but it's not going to have any impact on the Israelis the president US President Joe Biden is still going to come and meet with Israeli officials including prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu he's firmly backing the Israelis and and there doesn't look like any ceasefire is going to come particularly in the immediate future Imran this comes after tension between Palestinians and security forces in rala they're angry at the Palestinian Authority that's absolutely right and though the Palestinian Authority Security Forces actually cracked down on all of those protesters they came out just as those pictures that we all saw uh from the hospital came out it angered them they needed to come out on the streets and show their support for the people of Gaza that spilled over into violence just goes to show you how people are feeling everybody is feeling like they are under attack if they're Palestinian doesn't matter if you live in the occupied West Bank or if you live in the Gaza Strip there is a Unity on the Palestinian Street right now that we haven't seen in a very long time time and that's why they came out on the streets my colleagues in Rolo will be able to give you a much more deeper analysis of exactly what took place but uh I can tell you that I'd spent about a week and a half about seven eight days in uh ramala just before I came to occupied East Jerusalem people were people were afraid that they would be next that seems to have now changed they out in the streets showing solidarity because it's not about them being next anymore it's about them being Palestinian but Emily I have to say we're in the middle of one of the biggest information Wars that I've actually seen uh covering this region for about 23 years now um the Israelis have come out and said uh that the bombing that took place in the hospital was Islamic Jihad not just the Israelis but prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu president Isaac OK uh Benny Gans the Israeli Army are all blaming Islamic Jihad Islamic Jihad for their part have said it wasn't them msf several other people including the Anglican Church have also said that this was an Israeli attack now there is precedent for what the Israelis are actually doing if you recall our colleague um Shireen Abu journalist for Al jazer Arabic when she was killed uh the Israelis in the first few hours blamed Palestinian gunmen for this they were very clear they said this was a Palestinian gunman that actually shot Shireen Abu AK a couple of days later they changed their story and they actually admitted it we've seen the Israelis do this when something like this happens they muddy the waters they try and push uh the blame on to the Palestinians RI Manor who was just speaking at the United Nations uh C United Nations there he actually also squarely blamed the Israelis for this as well prime minister Mahmud Abbas in his statement blamed the Israelis as well so there is this information War that's going on but by no means is that unusual for the Israelis they will come out in the initial stages and muddy the waters however we are hearing uh from Islamic Jihad and several others like I've just said that this was an Israeli attack Imran thanks so much for breaking it all down for us as always Imran Khan from occupied East Jerusalem
