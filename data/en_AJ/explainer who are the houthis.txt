so who are the houthis they began in the '90s as a moderate theological movement of the zis that say Shia minority group fighting corruption was one of their main aims the 2003 US invasion of Iraq was a turning point analysts believe the war transformed the houthis into a resistance group with deep anti-American sentiments in 2015 houthi Fighters seized Yemen's Capital Sona that triggered more than nine years of war between the Saudi Le Coalition which backs the internationally recognized government and the houthis supported by Iran on October the 31st the houthis entered the war on Gaza firing drones and missiles at Israel and earlier the earlier this month the houi said they would Target All Ships heading towards Israel we joined Now by Hussein Al bukti political analyst aligned with the houi movement and he's joining us live from saana very good to have you with us Mr bukti what's your response to this International task force are the houis worried about attacks by the US and its allies no I'm actually they are not worried at all because when they have taken the decision to Target Israeli ship or Israeli linked ship or any ship from any country going to the any port of Israel uh they will aware that the United State or Israel might take an action and they did their action because uh uh as they say it is in solidarity and it is actually an obligation uh uh to do so that's why as well if you see the alliance that the United stat now has formed Yemen has been under attack and blade for almost nine years and many country in this in this Alliance uh they were uh fully supporting the Saudi uh backed forces and at the end what happened German Army has become stronger they had they had actually defeated Saudi Arabia to reach it its goal that's why I'm sure as Muhammad Abdus Salam today had a statement few hour ago he said we will continue uh uh our operation against any ship uh as they declared before uh unless the food and medicine will be allowed into Gaza and they they are well aware that the United States might attack Yemen but they have said any country that will be involved in attacking Yemen their ships and oil tank and as well it this country itself it will be harmed and it will be attacked and I'm I'm thinking that United States might forcing the Saudi Arabia and United Arab emirat actually to break the truce that has been you worried that they might do that the Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are not part of this task force are you worried that they will join the task force what does that mean for peace between Saudis and the houis I mean uh they were in direct war against Yemen and they couldn't do anything and when they actually signed this agreement they were forced uh because of the attack against Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates we remember that this truce was in Yemen was actually announced after the major attack against aramu facility in in in jeda that's why Saudi Arabia and United States at this point I don't think they want Yemen to Target the oil infrastructure because as you mentioned in your report that the now the oil prices and gas prices has increased and I believe this is actually uh why Yemen have done this latest action because they know that you can only hurt the West in their in their pocket and especially as well Israel by targeting the ship has almost closed elot elot Port many of the ships that have been targeted have said that they have no links to Israel how are the houthis choosing their targets uh I mean in any ship that come under Target it have a link to Israel it's not only about being owned by Israel but maybe as example in cargo ship uh which have thousands of containers on them they have a stop in their schedule in to stop in in some of the port of of Israel to deliver some of these uh uh containers and some of the ship actually they try as well to switch uh their GBS and they don't actually uh reply to Yemen request for them uh to to stop that's why any ship that have link it will be uh targeted and we remember as an example the Galaxy leader uh that was taken by yenes Israeli has announced and Netanyahu they said it have nothing to do with Israel and this was actually all a lie if those ship actually have nothing to do with Israel why Israel now is crying out loud why they are asking United State and Germany to act uh this mean that they are really affected and those ship actually they are have some kind of uh ties or some stops that will be in in Israel and I just want mention Muhammad Ali he a member of the Supreme Court in in s he has sent as well the same warning he said that the attack will continue and that the United States they will F uh uh I mean bear for responsibility for any expansion of the war and countries who will be involved in attacking Yemen they will be harmed really really badly that is Hussein alati political analyst aligned with the houthi movement thank you for your time
