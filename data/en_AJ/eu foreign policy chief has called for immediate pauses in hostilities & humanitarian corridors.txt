EU foreign ministers are meeting in Brussels to discuss a number of issues including the Gaza War foreign policy Chief Joseph borl has just been speaking Let's cross to Paul Brennan who is in Brussels covering the meeting for us and Paul when it comes to Gaza what's been said so far there this morning well the International Community and the European Union here in Brussels has been watching the Carnage unfolding in Gaza with mounting horror and the foreign uh affairs Chief the foreign policy Chief Joseph Burell is really trying to Corral opinion of all 27 members of the European Union uh under one consensus it's proving difficult because there are differences of opinion as to how best to go about it uh but the what is agreed is that there is grave concern from all 27 members about particularly the attacks that we've seen on Hospitals now the statement that has been put out in writing in advance of this says for example there need to be Rapid Safe unhindered humanitarian access and that the uh the hostilities uh which are are taking a horrific toll on civilians and medical staff and the international humanitarian law stipulates that hospitals medical supplies and civilians inside those hospitals must be protected and what Joseph Perell said verbally as he went into this meeting was that action is needed without delay we ask for an immediate POS poses I'm saying that in plural not a single one but several ones poses but it is an objective is immediate poses and humanitarian corridors to be established in order to face the dire situation of the people in Gaza I mentioned the differences of opinion there they are preventing the European Union from calling for a full formal ceasefire instead they're having to ask just for discretionary pauses uh in the hostilities and the reason for that is because there are differences within the countries so for example Spain and France would favor a ceasefire whereas Germany is not prepared to go that far Germany just wants to see uh humanitarian pauses won't go further than that uh there won't be more today I mean they will discuss it uh there won't be a change of opinion today the statement uh tells us exactly where the Europe Union stands at this particular time but the pictures coming out of Gaza are putting mounting pressure on these foreign ministers and on their leaders back in their various capitals for for for more action okay thanks so much for that that's Paul Brennan for us in Brussels
