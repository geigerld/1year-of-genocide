the Israeli government says it's expanded its goals in the war on Gaza to include the return of Israeli residents to areas near the border with Lebanon the hostilities there have forced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border to leave their homes it's been escalating conflict between Israel and the Lebanese group Hezbollah since the war on Gaza began well Lebanon continues to be severely affected since Israel's war on Gaza began in October last year more than 100,000 people have fled villages and towns in southern Lebanon because of these crossb strikes between the Israeli Army and Hezbollah the UN says at least 149,000 people remain within 10 km of the Blue Line the United Nations patrolled boundary that separates Israel and the occupied Goen Heights from Lebanon let's speak to Alan pinkas who's the former Israeli Diplomat and chief of staff to former prime minister ahod Barack he joins us live from Tel Aviv um a warm welcome to you so there are a few domestic issues I'd like to start with the internal politics in Israel at the moment particularly interesting what do you understand to be the rationale Behind These repeated reports in the Israeli media that longtime defense minister YF Galant May well be replaced by opposition politician Gideon Sahar okay two two things NE um always good to be with you but two things now um Mr Mr Gallant will will not be replaced but he will be fired if the rumors are true and if the speculation proves to be accurate he will be sarily fired by Mr netan who many of the viewers may have forgotten who was already fired sort of uh in in in March of 2023 emid the uh uh uh the Constitutional coup that Mr netan instigated but 24 hours or 48 hours later was reinstate secondly Mr gona aside from the fact that he's completely unqualified to be defense minister is not really an opposition politician yes he's in the opposition in terms of where he's seated in the CET no he's not an opposition in terms of substance and policy uh so what you see here though uh NE it has nothing to do with Lebanon even though prime minister netan tries to portray this as you know I'm I'm I'm I'm All gungho About an operation in Lebanon and we got to get this fixed and Mr Gallant is impeding this is M Mr Gallant has reservations that's entirely bogus and untrue Mr Gallant For Better or For Worse has been advocating a military uh operation against balah ever since October 2023 so this is all about Mr Nan's political survival this is all about maintaining the uh intactness of his Coalition okay this is all about allowing him to stay in power all right understood before we move on to to other issues then I mean how do you then explain the far national security minister itamar Ben gavier saying uh quote a decision must be made in the north of course referring to Hezbollah in Lebanon and Galant is not the right man to lead it is that simply an extension of Netanyahu politics oh absolutely um um Field Marshal benier who has not served in the military for one day but claims to know a lot about uh uh military strategy and uh and Military planning is uh um is talking every day I mean he's you know as far as he's concerned attack Iran attack Italy attack U you know okay um um he should not be taken seriously as a person however he should be taken very seriously because what he says Neeve uh reflects the Prime Minister and any attempt to say that the Prime Minister thinks differently but is finds it difficult to Reign Mr Ben in that's nonsense say understood Alan okay look we've got the US Secretary of State heading back to Egypt for talks with mediators there the Palestinians believe netanyahu's uncompromising insistence that Israel continues to occupy the Philadelphia coridor between Gaza and Egypt is quote a tactic to sabotage talks purely because it violates US President Joe Biden's earlier proposal what does Israel now anticipate Anthony blinkin is going to say to the Egyptians um you know a secretary of state blinkin who's going to come to the region for the 13th time I think since October 7th is going to try and resuscitate this deal I mean no one has done more to make a deal happened than the government of Qatar um and yet both the qataris and the Egyptian and the Americans have came to the conclusion that Mr netan and Mr senoir uh each for his own reasons have a vested interest in prolonging the war and and are not both are not really interested in in a deal now Israel expects um um Secretary of State blinkin to present to the Egyptians a new American plan that they with the qataris but maybe just the the Egyptians will present to Kamas with the hope that Hamas accepts this um and and that includes a clause uh NE in which uh um Israel maintains only a temporary uh um um control of the Philadelphia Corridor but the Philadelphia Corridor again is is a uh is a distraction and a uh and and and and disingenuous um a host of Israeli generals who know the the the area who know the terrain who who know the uh uh the risks have been saying that Mr netan has been uh mendacious about the Philadelphia Corridor that this is not um um a major deal this is certainly not a make or break deal in terms of a ceasefire and hostage deal and he is only using it as a pretext uh to avoid a deal so um to make a long story short um I don't think anyone expects secretary blink's uh uh uh trip to produce anything tangible right right all very very interesting analysis Alan Pinkus almost really Diplomat and chief of staff to the former Israeli Prime Minister ER barck
