back to the heg there's a a press conference being held on the steps of the he let's just listen it is that what we heard today was not really an engagement on the facts some engagement on the facts but not really rebutting what South Africa is trying to assert is essentially trying to DCT um and blame you know cast political aspersions on the intentions of South Africa um and what we are hoping for is that the judges will actually look at the strength of Our Own pleadings not only now but also in terms of our responses to Israel's written reports as required by the courts um because we do believe that our own intention here has really been to bring to the four key concerns around International crimes in particularly the crimes of crimes which is genocide in this case and we are very serious about that from a human rights perspective um and not essentially here as alleged by um Israel that we are here to defend or protect Hamas from destruction and I think that if one looks at the evidence base that's been brought to not just this court but to all of us through the various means available before journalists were disallowed is the evidence of the massive destruction of people um the lives but also you know domicide is a new term emerging the destruction of homes hospitals schools universities all the means necessary for a group to sustain life which is essential at the core of the genocide convention some of the specificities um when we made our first application in December and we followed that up with our Auto pleadings we were very clear in how we looked at October 7th we were very clear in our application that while we recognize under the Geneva conventions especially protocol one of the 1977 Geneva Convention that oppressed people have the right to use Force they cannot Target civilians targeting of civilians is a war crime and it's for that reason shortly after October 7th we approached the international criminal court to ask for both Hamas and those involved in the armed attacks to be investigated for war crimes under the under that um Geneva Convention protocol one but also in terms of their R statute we also asked for of course for Israel to be investigated for war crimes and in the case of Israel also be because of genocide because of the unfolding genocide so to argue that we are here again as they did in January on behest of Hamas is completely false they then refer to a conference that took place in South Africa it was a civil society conference that Civil Society conference expressly invited Civil Society people that had nothing to do with government um and it invite included Civil Society formations from Palestine including from the Palestinian Authority where there's an a a a a a section dealing with anti- aparted and an anti partic conference so to suggest as they did that this was a government hosting of Hamas is completely false um and we just needed to clearly rebut that I want to go back to the Geneva protocols and just to to put the context for how South Africa approaches this the South Africa has got a Liberation movement not government um that signed the Geneva protocol um of 1977 in 1948 where they that um that Liberation movement is subsequently become the majority governing party and in 1948 they voluntarily signed to adhere to all the prescripts of that Geneva Convention that they will not Target civilians that is something that is script into how government approaches these things so we are defin we are signatories to the Geneva conventions I must point out that Israel is not a secondary to that very same Geneva Convention they've recognized that they may have some obligations under International customary law but um essentially they are not adherance to the Geneva conventions that we hope that now that they are mentioning it will find themselves bound to it given that International customary law is binding too um and important you know um article 75 of that convention prohibits expressly as a war crime Collective punishment it prohibits expressly as a war crime torture and we've seen that happening in the current context so if they are want to point out to the war crimes perpetrated by Hamas then clearly they must see that what they doing is a war crime and it's more serious in that case because they are State and bound by various various obligations as a state even if they are not a party to the Geneva conventions particularly protocol one and protocol 2 of 7 7 so I wanted to clarify that and um hopefully the other issue that I think we need to to touch on is the unconditional release of hostages on the steps year our Minister of Foreign Affairs when the judge the court made the Judgment in January expressly agreed and stated that the hostages must be released unconditionally we have made that expressly clear in various statements as well because we recognize in terms of that very same um Geneva Convention 75 that we hold daily that hostage taking breaches the Geneva Convention but that also then includes the unlawful detention of Palestinians without dral thousands of them which is tantum out to aage taking so we call for that um for Palestinians work arrested without um essentially what we call detention without Dr um that it's it's essentially tantamount aage taking in the current context so we hope that this will be something that will be factored in as well um with regards to the attack on the data on the fatalities the use of AA in in this report reflects similar incorrect interpretation of what AA is saying AA has released a statement that it says that it's not reducing its numbers it's essentially just trying to verify in a in a close as possible way Mr Zay danger director general of the Department of international relations and Corporation for the South African government speaking there to the assembl Press cor outside of the international until the ver criminal uh International court of justice there in the ha uh we have been uh following Israel's presentation uh to the icj and it's rebuttal of South Africa's argument and appeal for special measures for Rafa and for Gaza as the ongoing Israel war on Gaza continues
