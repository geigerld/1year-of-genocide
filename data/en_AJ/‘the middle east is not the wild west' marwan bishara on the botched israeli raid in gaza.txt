Aran bishara is alzer's senior political analyst he joins us from London so talking about the escalation we've had reports I think it's the first ground contact between Israeli ground forces and Hamas what do you make of that well clearly the Israelis were testing the ground like literally testing the ground and to see what they're up to and uh clearly Hamas was uh ready for them and definitely uh you know did strike them as it were and and uh push them or forced them to pull out I think that probably proves once again why the Israelis have been preparing so hard the past two weeks and why they have been uh bombarding pounding Gaza the way they have because the the ongoing bombing is meant to pave the way for land Invasion and the more severe the more painful uh the more persistent and uh the more destructive the bombing the easier it would be for uh the Israeli military to take on Hamas through at land Invasion problem here is that the human cost is getting to be so unbearable so unbearable that one wonders how many more days how many more weeks could Israel go on massacring the Palestinians the way it's doing and we're hearing hardened rhetoric from Israel's prime minister talking about devastating consequences and at the same time we're seeing the US sending troops Hardware into the region all of these ingredients they point to the ever increasing likelihood of this conflict widening it does but it also brings us back to point zero or square one as it were I think the main focus of uh the nanaha government and Biden is the Gaza Strip is the inhalation of Hamas uh is the total control of that place and then deciding what to do with it and everything else is secondary and in order to do that in order for Israel to be able to take on Gaza destroy it and take on Hamas it does need the United States to shelter it from any possible ramification in the region including the possibility of hisbah or others joining on a on a second front so isra Israel is trying to scare the Lebanese from uh taking on any such uh second front and certainly the Americans are also doing the same telling everyone don't in order to Shield Israel there is because of that uh a chance or or a possibility or or a danger that this might widen because of the continuous Armament built up by the United States but once again I think their main focus is the destruction and the flattening of Gaza in I know we've spoken about this before Maran but it might be helpful to remind ourselves of the context as well Especial Especially given that another war is going on in Ukraine in which the Earth has been calling for the end of occupation are we seeing at all in the discourse in the US any discussion about pressuring Israel to deal with the root causes ending occupation ending Siege ending what international and Israeli human rights groups call apartheid policies by Israel well thank you for bringing that up Samy because sometimes I think even we at Al jazer who Master the uh The Narrative of context because journalism without context is is not journalism it's just wire service we in journalism we have to provide context without context there is no narrative there is no understanding there is no possibility to really place what is happening now in its proper historic context but for the Israelis and and the Americans and and their other supporters in the west especially in the western media the idea has been is that history has started in October 7 everything prior to October 7 should not be discussed even journalists and presenters and anchors are you know given guidelines not to discuss anything before October 7 as if that was The Day the Earth was created and that's the problem with much of the discussion that's going on today in the United States and even in Israel because as you said there there are there are uh root causes to this thing and and it's not like there are cliches or anything Gaza has been under siege hermetic siege for 17 years it has been occupied for more than five decades what do we mean by what do we mean by occupation it means the the spiritual mental psychological and physical torture torture of an entire people over so many decades that's what we mean by occupation it means the Israeli military dictates who lives and and and who dies who starves who gets medical treatment and who doesn't who can stay and who can go who can live and who must then leave you know it's just the the racism that has been involved over the past so many years the dispossession of the Palestinian so many years is the root cause of this thing so without us understanding that Israel carried more than 100 more than 100 bombing campaigns campaigns not one bombing bombing campaigns like what we saw today bombing campaigns killing hundreds of people over the past 17 years we don't understand why Gaza is what Gaza is today so the idea that Israel has has had such history of Oppression of of military control of another people a racist aparted regime if we dismiss that if we decide that history is starts in October 7 we will never understand what's going on and we will then lead to more mistakes more blowbacks more uis leading to even Graver situations I heard before you were discussing just briefly by the way S I heard you because I heard you been discussing the idea of lensy Graham and so on I get the feeling that the Americans think that we live in the 18th century and that the Palestinians are the IND Indians the new American Indians you know we all love American Indians but the Palestinians are not American Indians and this is not the 17th century and Israel is not America and the Middle East is not North America the Palestinians are not going to be inated as people the Palestinian people are going to exist and Israel a country of 9 10 million people needs to exist among 400 million Arabs and over a billion Muslims and it needs to behave it has to stop with the arrogance it has to stop with the racism and it has to stop believing as a small nation in a sea of Arabs and Muslims that it can live Only By The Sword it can it needs to live by peace and Justice that's the only way it could attain security all right thanks for your thoughts and Analysis Maran bishar there
