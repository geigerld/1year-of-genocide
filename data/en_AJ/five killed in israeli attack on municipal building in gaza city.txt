breaking Point Let's go straight to Al Han Mahmud in Dar alala for the very latest and hany talk us through what more we know about this attack on Gaza City yes well this is not the first time we've seen this deliberate attack on public facilities employees in the past we this kind of attacks were more concentrated on organization International Organization employes or local organization such as the uh the food Aid organization across the Gia but this time the target seems to be a facility that provides the services and it tries as much as it could with whatever in the in its capacity to do uh to clean up the roads from the rubbles and open road that have being blocked by the pile of rubbles because of the intense bombing campaign the four people pronounced killed at the side our municipality employees that were killed inside this public facility that is managed and operated by the Gaza municipality in addition to one person who was passing by the area the area where this public facility is located is densely populated with people who have been pushed from where they used to live in eastern part of Gaza from the density populated neighborhoods sh zun and and all the way to Western Gaza at this particularly at the center of Gaza City being displaced internally due to the ongoing artillery and air attacks carried out by the Israeli military uh this uh will hinder the work of the municipality already broken mechanism of services due to the the past for the past eight months and given the intensity of the bombing campaign in terms of scale and magnitude also within the past 30 minutes we have confirmed reports of more artillery and tank attacks near waza this is the area to the southern part of waza where Palestinians displ Palestinians on daily basis gathered there in groups either waiting for AED trucks or trying to find a way to get back to their homes in the northern par in Gaza City the reports that we received talking about at least close to eight people were critically injured at that particular p with difficulty right now for the ambulance and paramedics and civil defense group to get to remove the injuries from the area and from past experience they're like to die in these areas and be removed within the coming days because any ambulance any defense crew member get to or paramedics get to that area it's more of like a shooting range it will get shot at right away uh and hany of course gaza's healthc care sector nearing very much the edge of collapse given all of Israel's Relentless bombardment there well as long as this genocidal war is Raging across the trip we'll see more pressure put on the remaining Health Care Facilities the example of this is the one behind me right here we've been doing reports for the past uh 40 days and we've seen other Devastation and obliteration of the entire Health Care System inside the hospital I'm not exaggerating to say at some point the hospital is only a standing skeleton there isn't any medical services provided whatsoever the fact that injuries comes here and scores they on the floor of the hospital there isn't enough medical staff there's acute medical uh Supply shortage medical supplies inside the hospital to the point where doctors have to make uh serious decision about the priorities where to give the their attention to those are that are considered as hopeless cases are not getting the attention at the need then that's because of the influx of injuries arriving to the hospital on a daily basis this is a representative sample of what happened to the Health Care System across the G including the destruction of a shifa hospital the instruction of the Indonesian and Kamal adwan Hospital in the northern part Naser Hospital in the city of Hud is completely out of service and right now whatever is being done is more of a humble efforts to get these hospitals back on track they're not going to be fully back and providing all services but at least they are step by step and as a of now we can safely say the entire Health Care system is 100% crippled across the G stre we did manage to get a report from inside the hospital and we got access to restricted area like the operating rooms this is what we found out inside we're inside the lxa hospital at the emergency department here uh and as you can see it's overcrowded uh I'm joined by Dr Bushra man uh inside the hospital she's from panima medical Mission uh volunteering to help uh people and medical staff inside the hospital Dr ker we need to know more about what's going on inside the emergency department thank you Hy so um as you can see here there's extreme overcrowding in the emergency department um this is actually a time when it's not really as busy as it could get especially when there are attacks nearby um there's Limited resources in the department with only a few doctors servicing hundreds of patients family members are everywhere there's not enough beds for the patients you can see them either in wheelchairs or uh on the floor on mats surrounded by their family members um there are only three doctors generally in the emergency department so these doctors are overworked and underst staffed this is a hospital normally that would have a couple of hundred beds and doesn't necessarily get to treat a lot of patients there are now up to 800 patients and thousand thousand of displaced people living here as you can see all around us there are patients and their family members in the corridors in hallways living with their blankets family members um it makes it very difficult to be able to move around even to be able to actually even find your patients but a lot of times unfortunately because there's no structure and there's no system you actually don't know always where your patients end up or where you might be able to find them in order to provide the treatment that they require and we're going to take a look inside on the limited resources that are being provided here in the operating theaters in all the healthare facilities inza there are only a couple of hospitals that are still partially functional and this will be one of them on my left hand side here are the recovery rooms where patients come after they have finished their operations um we can't necessarily show you everything that's inside but there's very limited resources there's not necessarily the equipment to be able to monitor them in terms of taking their Vital Signs like blood pressure and heart rate what are we seeing here what is this case yeah so this is this is a young kid that's obviously had severe burns from an explosion or a blast injury um this is a very common and unfortunate scenario um a lot of these kids are in severe pain because of their wounds there isn't enough adequate analgesia to be able to give them uh they have to come daily down to the operating through room to get dressing changes because there isn't enough adequate Supply on the wards to be able to dress their wounds appropriately um and they require care actually that NE sometimes is unnecessarily not able to be provided here at OA Hospital
