thank you for joining us it's 18 GMT 6 p.m in Gaza in the coming hours a deeply divided Israeli War cabinet will discuss the latest proposal to end the war on Gaza a plan the US president has said was proposed by Israel prime minister beniman neto's farri right ministers have threatened to bring down the government if he agrees to the deal in Cairo meanwhile Egypt has told Israel that it must withdraw from the Rafa Crossing for it to operate again according to Egyptian media Israel took control of the Palestinian side of the Border several weeks ago here's why reopening that Crossing is so important no life-saving Aid has entered through the Border in weeks famine is taking hold and life-saving medical and food supplies are running low hundreds of trucks are stuck on the Egyptian side of the Rafa Crossing and the food they are carrying is rotting in the summer heat now let's find out what's happening with the Rafa Crossing which has been shut as we've been reporting Sarah hyad joins us now live from Aman Jordan she's reporting from Aman because Israel as you know has banned Al jazer from reporting from within Israel so these talks Sarah in Egypt about reopening this vital Crossing Rafa the meeting I understand has now ended what's come out of it that's right uh Egyptian local uh media source which has very close connections uh with the Egyptian authorities is reporting uh that Egypt has said that it won't uh be opening the Rafa Crossing as long as Israel remains there it says that it must completely uh withdraw from that Philadelphia uh Corridor uh and return Palestinians to be able to rule that side of uh the Border let me just give you a quick uh description of what the Philadelphia Crossing Corridor rather is it's 14 kilm long it's known as a buffer zone between Egypt and the Gaza Strip the Egyptians on one side and the Palestinians Manning it on the other uh side it was part of a Camp David agreement back in the 1970s and then in 2005 it was established that that was a completely demilitarized zone now when Israel decided to start its offensive in Rafa a few weeks ago it took over that Corridor completely probably about a week ago they said that they had full operational control of it they've gotten rid of uh Hamas in that area and this is the problem that the Egyptians have not only that it was only under the convi under the US convincing the Egyptians to allow Aid uh to come across otherwise those Aid trucks had been stuck at that border for a very uh long time but this is Egypt showing that it's not happy about this situation at all so no change in the status of the Raffa crossing the border will remain closed Sarah another meeting that's happening today is that of the Israeli cabinet divisions among the war cabinet members about the way forward and how they respond to the latest ceasefire proposal what can we expect from this meeting Sarah that's right Folly uh Sundays you'll usually have a war cabinet meeting that's nothing uh unique but what makes it different today is that they will clearly be discussing uh this proposed plan that the US uh Administration including the president himself put forward uh just a couple of days ago well before this meeting you've had the defense minister you avalant saying they're already uh discussing getting rid of like who is the next person that's going to uh govern uh the Gaza Strip so they're already said that they're looking into that but also adding that they will not end the fighting until they get rid of hamas's capabilities fully not just in terms of arms or military wise but also in terms of not being able to govern the Gaza Strip any longer but the problem that has been uh faced here is that some of those in the war cabinet have had a major issue Benny gance for example giving a deadline of June the 8 saying to Netanyahu you need to find out what your next plan is you need to share this plan we have to know what we're doing next and if you don't we will uh pull out of this government and then you also have people like itamar benav that's the national security minister absolutely Furious yesterday tweeting as soon as he can about uh this latest deal saying that it is an absolute noo he's absolutely Furious and has threatened him and bezal smrc they did this around the same time probably in coordination for that both their parties to pull out of this government why does that matter because if this government is dissolved this will be problematic for prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who's holding on to that power as much as he can and families of those captives are accusing him of putting his political interests first Sarah thank you very much Sarah hrat live there in a man Jordan uh because uh again the Israeli government has banned Al jaer from reporting from inside Israel Let's cross over to Washington DC now and shab banzi uh sheab what's the latest response from the Americans to the the ceasefire proposal they insist that this was an Israeli plan well I think that was always part of the you know the Diplomatic dance that we get in these negotiations clearly this was the result of the negotiations of the CIA director from from the USA Egypt Kat Israel Hamas and we were told by a senior Administration official on Friday that this is basically the same plan that was on offer a few weeks ago which Hamas had accepted and which at the last minute Israel reneged upon and at the time it really seemed like both Israel and frankly the White House had had left Bill Burns their own CIA director out to dry although the Egyptians were were blamed and so on and now this time the White House has put its foot down we need agreement on this deal we were told that there are a few modifications in the deal so whether that now means that this is an Israeli proposal maybe that's what they're they're trying to wiggle through uh but it was always a phase deal and so Biden made a speech but they never published what the deal was this four and a half page document so there was some confusion but only the first phase has really been agreed upon the the rest of it hasn't been agreed upon which is why what Netanyahu says and what Biden says can seem like they're Divergent even as theoretically they're both agreeing on the deal but this is how John Kirby the National Security spokes to clear it all up on the Sunday talk shows well it is an Israeli proposal one that they arrived at after uh intense diplomacy with our own National Security team and over at the state department in what it is a phased approach George so where we are right now is that proposal an Israeli proposal has been given to Hamas it was done on Thursday night hour time we're waiting for an official response from Hamas we would note that publicly Hamas officials came out and welcomed this proposal and so what would we hope would happen is they would agree to start phase one as soon as possible so uh I in the end though what we are seeing now is the White House is putting its foot down all this stuff about hamas's future where there seems to be Divergent noises from Netanyahu are one thing but in the end this is all about what Biden needs right now he needs sometime in the near future some kind of temporary pause that is what the Israelis have agreed to a six- week pause which will then be rolled over as negotiations continue into for for example the future of Hamas so that's what they're pushing for that's been agreed upon but that's why you can still there's still room for that debate about future phase two phase three who knows about phase two phase three Biden may not even be in office but all that White House is concerned about is that phase one that six week temporary pause that can be renewed now meanwhile Netanyahu shihab has been invited to speak to the US Congress but it seems that in Washington not everyone is happy about this Senator Bernie Sanders uh released a statement saying Benjamin Netanyahu is a war criminal he should not be invited to address a joint meeting of Congress I certainly will not attend we've heard ever since the Republicans issued this invitation to Netanyahu clearly in an attempt to bring out the divisions in the Democratic party that there was much hand rigging and discomfort amongst the amongst the Democrats should we attend should we boycott but what we know certainly in the Senate is that in the end they all go get on board despite all their expressions of discomfort about the alleged genocide in in Gaza only two Democrats and one independent voted against the last the last Israeli arms shipment in the Senate one independent Bernie Sanders and then two Democrats so in the end they they're very likely to to ATT 10 what we where we might see more discontent being expressed maybe with boycots is in the house where 37 Democrats voted against the latest Aid package and are indeed very vocal like Rashida Talib for example Palestinian American herself so I think there we might see we might see some more uh some more boycotting but in the end though Congress they talk a good talk but they all end up Turing the line all right chab thank you for that chab ranzi live there in Washington DC make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
