one of the main hospitals in southern Gaza is now empty after Israeli troops seized the Rafa border crossing patients and medical workers fled Abu yusf al- nja Hospital in Rafa fearing Israeli strikes the hospital was one of the few medical facilities treating patients wounded during Israeli attacks in the city let's get an update on the situation on the ground line speak to Al jazer hanim Mahmud who's in Dar albala that's in central Gaza honey many people from different areas of Rafa not just the East where the evacuation order was issued are fleeing Rafa to head to the central areas including Daryl Bala where you are can you tell us what the situation is like there gu well right now even for people who already evacuated and or still on the road to DAR bah City they are moving with a shattered sense of safety as Dar bah again is not largely safe there if every once in a while we hear this constant artillery Shilling and loud explosion at the eastern part of the city we are located right now at ala hospital that's at the western part of Dar B City that's the western side of salahadin road the city comes in between is is is separated by salahadin road to the Eastern side and the western side but ongoing artillery Shilling is causing sort of of concern and panic and what seems to be more of an expansion of the uh of the military operations by the Israeli military as of RA City the the confirmed reports that we're getting right now is the the intense bombing campaign is expanding outside the eastern part of the city to include right now the older residential Towers at the central part of RA so far we have confirmed reports of three residential towers that have been directly targeted by the artillery Shing and air strikes those are at the central part of RA City just forcing more people into further internal displacement within the past 24 hours alone in City atrocities against families and evacuates and displaced individuals uh we're looking at 35 people have been killed and the majority women and children and elderly inside the residential homes or on the road trying to flee the mom's 129 critically injured all it transferred to field hospitals at the western part or inside the Kuai hospital and with Abus ner Hospital non operation right now out of service is increasing the pressure on these field hospitals and a smaller sight facility the Kuai hospital so there's no letup in Israeli bombing across the Gaza Strip Aid agencies honey are warning that the humanitarian situation is only going to get worse in light of these latest developments and the Israelis have been preventing the entry of Aid through Rafa which theyve taken control of but they claim that they've reopened the Karim Abu salm Crossing has any Aid gotten through to that land Crossing well already the situations in terms of humanitarian Aid and humanitarian situations in general are getting quite difficult right now with the closure of RA Crossing that represent the artery of humanitarian Aid to the Gaza Strip but complete closure and it not only threatened the expansion and of a starvation in in overcrowded sudden part of the the of the of the the strip but also it cut off the uh the supply of fuel to health facilities across Rafa City right now with this full enclosure there's only a a small amount of fuel available to run power generators at the Kuwaiti hospital as well as the field hospital to the western part of the city for the pment they relied on the ongoing Supply that was not even not not was not not was not constant but it was disconnected somehow the operated but right now with the full closure it seems that they're going to run out of the fuel that keeps these Hospital oper this is one aspect of how humanitarian situations is going are getting much worse by the hour right now now the reopening of Kim as stated by the Israeli military is is providing the strip right now with a trickle amount of it because when we look at the amount that has been allowed since the uh the announcement that it has reopen is only a little bit of what needed right now with the expansion of the Carnage across the STP and only open because of the pressure uh placed by the US Administration and the American President Joe Biden on the Israeli government it it it's largely perceived as a way to absorb the pressure by the American Administration on the Israeli government honey thank you very much for that that's Al jazer is Hy Mahmud reporting their life from Dar Al balah in central Gaza make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
