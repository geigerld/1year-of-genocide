the leader of Hamas political Bureau ishma khier has issued a statement saying Ceasar negotiations were at their final stage when the nerat massacre was carried out he thinks that operation was meant to create obstacles to reach an agreement to end the war Kan go on to say that us support of Israel's actions makes it complicit in these crimes well the Israeli governments banned Al jaer from reporting in Israel so Imran Khan's joining us from the Jordanian Capital Aman so in the meantime of course US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is visiting after that raid which released four captives but killed 274 Palestinians it sounds as though that's had a knock on effect on the ceasefire negotiations as well that's absolutely right this is a big tour for the US Secretary of State he's had his meeting right now with um president uh fata ali um he's president Abdul fat of Egypt actually issued a statement saying the US's Secretary of State Lincoln agrees on intent ifying joint efforts to reach a Gaza ceasefire and a hostage exchange now before he's flying to Israel Anthony binin has blinkin has been speaking and he's effectively set out his stall what he's saying is this it's critical to work on plans for a day after the Gaza War uh the US is telling Regional leaders if you want a ceasefire then you've got to press Hamas to say yes and the only outlier to the ceasefire deal is Hamas um Egypt says that the the their count parts were communicating with Hamas as recently as a few hours ago that's a STK contrast to what you've just uh reported about isma hania saying we were very close to a deal and then the al-nur massacre happened so he's really set out his store from Egypt he flies uh to Israel he's got a meeting at 600 with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at 8:30 with the defense minister y Galant 950 with the Israeli Minister Benny Gans who's currently without portfolio cuz he quit the cabinet and then a meeting with the Israeli president Isaac Herzog then on Tuesday he's at the humanitarian assistance conference here in Arman uh and he's got a 4:00 meeting with the Jordanian King Abdullah then on Wednesday the he's got a meeting with the Qatari Amir and then with the qari Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs then at 5:00 on Wednesday there will be a press conference all eyes will be on that press conference to see what Anthony blinkin has has actually managed to achieve there are still significant differences over the ceasefire particularly from Hamas and from Israel with very different points of view on what a good ceasefire deal looks like so that press conference 5:00 p.m. Wednesday is going to be crucial let's see where we are then Imran thank you very much Imran Khan talking to us from Aman let me remind you of course that Benjamin netanyahu's cabinets banned Al jaer from working in Israel and it's extended that decision on Sunday and that's why Imran is joining us from uh neighboring Jordan we're going to hear from Anthony blinkin in Ciro as imram was explaining he says he's asking adab states to press Hamas to agree to the Israeli truce deal recently announced by President Joe Biden the only party that has not accepted the only party that's not said yes is Hamas the Palestinians in Gaza are waiting on it's who the Israelis are waiting on it's who the hostages and the hostage families are waiting on Hussein khidi is a former Egyptian assistant foreign minister and former Egyptian field artillery officer in the October 1973 War he's joining us now live from Cairo thank you very much indeed for being with us sir um Anthony blinken's been talking to uh the president what role other than negotiations can Egypt play how what is the leverage that Egypt can have in this well it's it's not a question of Leverage it's a question of history and strategy and and and and the Egyptian role in Regional politics and particularly in the Palestinian question I doubt very much if any power great or small can Sid step the Egyptian role in uh Regional politics and in the Palestinian question so that's why uh in the last eight uh trips of uh nited States SEC State Mr Anthony linkoln to the Middle East Egypt was has always been uh station where he held talks with the Egyptian president and his Egyptian counterpart on how to move forward and and and this time I get there are the Americans are very interested in uh listening to the Egyptian point of view concerning the Rafa Crossing on the one hand and the other hand on the other hand how to proceed with the uh road map that the United States president Biden outlined uh on on on Friday May the 31st and we are ready we are we look forward to coordinate with the with the United States in order to uh uh move ahead and bring this war to an end because the bottom line uh the bottom line is that this war in Gaza must come to an end that's the conclusion of President Biden last last May 31st and it's identical with the Egyptian position we I don't think that neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians nor the Middle Eastern countries can pay the price can pay the high price of this war continuing or going on like the way we have been witnessing lately the uh objectives the objectives uh of the American road map uh the release of hostages surge in humanitarian Aid to Gaza uh and and then a permanent ceasefire accompanied with a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces in Gaza these are uh aims that are shared by Egypt and I guess the talks today between the Egyptian president at TI and second of State Anthony blinkin uh dealt with these issues with a particular emphasis on uh how uh and when the Rafa Crossing would be uh reopened is there any indication uh that you have from from Cairo as to when that might happen what the timetable might be for the reopening of the Raa Crossing as we were discussing earlier on in the program it is absolutely key of course to getting humanitarian Aid into Gaza well before answering question let me let me point out to one one one one thing that should be clear and that's that uh uh uh the RAF Crossing is the is not the only Crossing with the Gaza Strip uh and of course uh we are working with the Americans and with the Europeans uh on the conditions uh to reopen the RAF Crossing and hopefully hopefully after this uh uh trip of Mr blinkin we with the United States can reach Arrangements that that would meet the Egyptian conditions that the Palestinian side of the Rafa Crossing should not be managed by uh uh the Israelis as as as it has happened after they uh exercise control on that part of the ra Crossing early May last May so I let let's hope that in the in in in the near future uh there there would be acceptable Arrangements uh according to Egyptian conditions that whereby the ra Crossing be reopen having said that let me say let me say once again again that there are other land Crossings between Gaza Strip and Israel and we call on Israel to reopen all these Crossings not less than three or four crossings that Israel uh has closed on October 88 and they they remain closed save for a brief period of time of the Reds Crossing uh between Israel and and Gaza in the north so uh it's not not a question of Raa Crossing only uh and by the way uh let me remind your uh your your uh those who are watching our your program that Raa Crossing originally is for passengers it's not for goods and all the other Crossing run by Israel on Israeli territory are for uh uh goods and and and shipments so um we have noticed that uh lately uh the international media has stressed on the Rafa Crossing understanda we understand the humanitarian reasons behind that behind that and we share these humanitarian reasons but uh the fact of the matter is the problem is the question the the the the question now is that Israel is incumbent on on on Israel to reopen all the rain Crossings between Israel and the Gaza um Egypt is in an interesting position with regard to the Gaza Strip and with regard to Israel as well because it has if I understand it correctly um had for many years an understanding shall we say with Israel with regard to the Gaza Strip isra Egypt has of course its own concerns with regard to Palestinians possibly making their way into the the Sinai desert does that give Egypt any additional um ability to uh put pressure on uh Israel with regards to avoiding that happening particularly with regard say to Israel's actions in Rafa well it from an Egyptian point of view it's it's much deeper than that uh uh it's much deeper than that we are mainly concerned about the future of Palestine we are mainly concerned about ending the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the lifting uh lifting of the Israeli boycott of of the Gaza uh we we have followed the Israeli statements official and non-official claiming or asking for a complete Israeli control over the Gaza Strip in the years to come and Egypt Egypt rejects this this Israeli approach what we are aiming at with the Americans with the qataris with the United Nations with the European Union is to agree H to agree on Way Forward as far as the future of the Gaza Strip is concerned plus the future of the political settlement of the Palestinian question now of course we are interested in in bringing the the Israeli War uh uh in Gaza to to an end but our position goes further than that once this war comes to an end we have to look at the future and for from an Egyptian point of view the future cannot the same as the situation had been before October 7th please forgive me
