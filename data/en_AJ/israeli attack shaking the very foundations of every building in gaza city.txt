welcome to the program the United Nations has issued a plea to end the inhumane Collective suffering in Gaza the Secretary General has describe the situation in the strip as a nightmare at least 10,022 Palestinians have been killed since Israel began bombing Gaza and calls for a ceasefire have so far been dismissed by Israel Gaza is becoming a graveyard for children hundreds of girls and boys are reportedly being killed or injured every day more journalists have reportedly been killed over a 4-week period than in any conflict in at least three decades more United Nations Aid workers have been killed than in any comparable period in the history of our organization the parties to the conflict and indeed the International Community face an immediate and fundamental responsibility to stop the inhuman Collective suffering and dramatically expand humanitarian Aid to Gaza The Way Forward is clear a humanitarian SE fire now well as the crisis deepens medical centers in Gaza can't cope with the constant flow of the injured many hospitals are simply run out of fuel and basic medical supplies at least 32 out of 35 medical facilities have now stopped working altogether meanwhile Israel Contin to bomb Gaza overnight two large air strikes hit across the road from alzer's camera position in Gaza City and a further Israeli strike killed at least 16 people in Rafa that's in the south of the Gaza Strip on Monday night y the bombing hit a residential neighborhood in the AL shabor refugee camp some of the victims include members of the same family all right let's bring in Al jaer hany Mahmud join us from KH Unice that's in the south of Gaza STP and hany uh several hours ago we were seeing what looked like sizable explosions um over Gaza City what more do we know about that latest operation and the impact of the operation in Northern Gaza yes nth well the bombardment continue over Gaza City as of uh early hours of yesterday's evening throughout uh all of last night and early hours of this morning Gaza City uh has been a a a major site of intensive air bombardment and air strike using all kind of unconventional uh bombs and and weapons uh the Israeli Arsenal uh has we're talking about large diameters bombs we're talking about earthquake bombs shaking the very Foundation of every single residential uh building in the Gaza stri bringing more residential homes and more residential buildings uh down to uh to the ground now the purpose as we hear from the Israeli military is the use of these bombs just to destroy bunkers and tunnels uh operated by Hamas element but in fact what we see on the top of the ground is just more residential blocks and more residential buildings are being destroyed uh leaving uh no place for Gins uh to to to to to sit in uh around the shifa hospital vicinity more bombardment and more air strike destroying major parts of the infrastructure and all the roads leading to the main entrance of the hospital making it very difficult for ambulance to move uh to bring injuries from targeted sites now if there is no uh place in Gaza more safe than the other everywhere where in the Gaza Strip has been a target of these Relentless air strikes at early hours of this morning and late hours of last night Rafa has been a Target uh of of Israeli strike where more than 20 people so far have been killed and and and others are still under the rubble just as I arrived to the site of Naser Hospital a major a strike hit city of KH un so far three people are killed in one residential uh home the three belong to one single family there are more people under the rebel this is the tragedy of these air uh air strikes the keep there are so many people that tra under the rebeles which increase the likelihood of increased numbers of injuries and those who are killed and hany just to point out to our viewers uh people have been told by the Israeli military to evacuate from the north of Gaza to the South but what you're reporting of course are bombardments precisely in the South uh around Rafa and extraordinary scenes from the Indonesian hospital with doctors working in almost complete darkness gaza's medical facilities clearly under extraordinary pressure [Music] honey yes yes well there all the places in Gaza are equally unsafe are equally dangerous and are equally under Relentless heavy air strikes people who evacuate earlier uh of last month the to the South I found themselves under heavy bombardment and air strike we've seen examples of so many evacuees who got killed in those air strikes they evacuated only to get killed in the homes that they took as Refuge with the people in the southern part of the Gaza Strip the situations in hospitals are very very dire very complicated hospitals are not uh not even 1% of a proper proper medical services are giving to people uh what we see now whether it's a shifa or in the Indonesian Hospital uh no medical supply extreme shortage of medical supply extreme shortage of fuel uh extreme shortage of of basic survival items just turn these hospitals these facilities into just a standing uh a skeleton they don't have any Services whatsoever to offer not only to patients but also to injuries and to to people who evacuated inside of them the Indonesian hosital is a is an example of of a a large health facility that is uh that has completely collapsed and and completely out of service and within just a few hours there will be an announcement that the hospital is completely out of any medical service to anyone which put the life of so many inside whether patient injuries or evacuates a Jeopardy extraordinary extraordinary pressure the hospital are under at the moment across Gara strip hany mmud speaking to us from Kan just many thanks for that
