the US media is reporting that Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is heading to the Middle East next week to discuss the war on Gaza his visit comes as Israel expands its ground offensive targeting areas in Central and Southern Gaza Regional mediator Egypt has put forward a three-stage plan to end the violence but that's yet to be accepted by either Hamas or Israel let's bring in Natalie toi now she's a director of The Institute AAR International she's the former special adviser to EU Foreign Affairs heads feder Morini and Jose barell she joins us from kir now welcome to the program firstly where do you think we are now in terms of any possible brokering of a ceasefire well I mean I think you know the Israeli government um and more broadly the military establishment has made it uh quite clear that it does not intend to to stop this War uh and so I think the next question question is you know sort of who and what is um actually putting pressure on the Israeli government to change course now you know we were just listening a moment ago to uh demonstrations within Israel it seems to me that um as was was being discussed you know this is still a very small minority in the country so the pressure is still not really building up within Israel of course there is the question of the hostage release and that is and has a dynamic of itself own but you still can't see it reaching that Tipping Point um in terms of actually getting the government to change course um now sadly you don't even see much of a change taking place uh within the United States let's see what uh Tony blinkin uh brings when he comes to uh to the region um however up until now Beyond obviously you know calls in terms of uh reducing indiscriminate bombing uh and more broadly the intensity of the war we have not seen the United States actually call for a ceasefire um and so you know at the moment basically you you know obviously there is the question of of Egypt and I think it's interesting the way in which Egypt has rather recently been stepping up uh more more visibly and obviously there there will be a dynamic between Egypt and the United States um which will increase pressure on Washington to push Israel uh towards a ceasefire because of course as we know the longer this war goes on and the greater the pressure it will be in terms of actually getting to essentially an ethnic cleansing of Palestinians uh moving into Egypt from Gaza which of course is what Egypt wants to avoid right you mentioned the dynamic there I what about the dynamic between US President Joe Biden and uh Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu how is that likely to play out now well I mean you know so far basically you know the United States as we know has um embraced the sort of be hug approach which Frankly Speaking has not really delivered so far um and um at the moment as I said you know you don't really see much of a change happening yet uh in the United States now of course as the US heads into its uh presidential campaign uh I think there will be an increasing pressure within the United States and on the Biden Administration in fact Biden himself will probably want this war to end sooner rather than later but as I said you know at the moment we don't really see much beyond words and words Frankly Speaking on this Israeli government don't really seem to be having much of an effect and after months of of War does the Israeli military have much to show really for its bombardment of civilians well no I mean it has absolutely nothing to show right I mean you know here we are sort of two and a half months into this war and there has not been um you know any visible quote unquote trophy basically to to show for meaning there has not been any uh sort of senior Hamas leader uh being uh uh taken or killed uh by uh by Israel so very clearly um you know Hamas remains you know sort of in control of of parts of Gaza so very clearly none of the objectives that Israel had set out for itself beginning with the quote unquote eradication of Hamas have actually been accomplished and of course the longer this War goes on and in many respects the weaker Israel appears now the question then though is does this actually increase Israel's incentives to continue or to pull back and uh tragically it actually you know the the worse it gets yeah the less likely Israel is to achieve its objectives the less likely it will be to want to pull back in the sense that obviously pulling back now will obviously very clearly be seen as a demonstration of failure and when it comes to other outside actors then what about the European Union and and and other Gulf countries how much leverage do they really have well I mean the European Union has and you know I I speak as a very sort of you know committed uh europeanist I mean you know sort of down to the bone um but I really cannot um sort of deny the fact that uh Europe has really put on a fairly sorry show over over this war um and in two respects I would say I mean firstly because Europe is and continues to be terribly divided you know we've seen this basically in the two uh consecutive votes that we've had at the UN General Assembly uh on uh on the war in which for on on both occasions basically Europe was split in three between countries supporting the ceasefire countries abstaining and countries uh rejecting it so Europe is basically divided and what we see is in a sense a similar pattern to what we have been used to in the past I.E Europeans essentially following a US lead now of course the problem there is that whereas Once Upon a Time the United States was the indispensable power that was actually able to deliver results today while it Remains the indispensable power it doesn't seem to be able to dispense much much at all right and let me ask you then what about forgive me for jumping in there but what about Benjamin netanyahu's position is he essentially playing a long game as it were yes I mean absolutely I mean I think sort of here there is um a broad convergence I would say although coming probably from different interests between uh Benjamin Netanyahu himself and the broader political military establishment so whereas in the case of netan there's very clearly an interest in remaining in power and therefore a avoiding elections given that if Israel were to move to elections very likely uh Netanyahu would be removed from power and so in a sense the only uh sort of opportunity that he has is on the one hand to prolong this war hoping of course that if one manages not obviously at this level of intensity but if one manages to continue for a number of months and perhaps you know almost into a year from now and miraculously for Mid Nano Donald Trump were to return to the White House maybe he could actually be the Eternal Phoenix sort of rising from From the Ashes so I would say as far as nany's concerned there very clearly is an interest in a long War as far as the Israeli military establishment is concerned I think here the interest is somewhat different although it's convergent and it basically boils down to the fact that of course the 7th of October was an absolute failure right for uh for Israel and so there is a very strong interest in the military establishment to basically demonstrate that it can somehow flip uh the tables uh around and as as we were discussing earlier so far there actually hasn't been much of a military result to show for which is basically why the military establishment at the moment inevitably has an interest in continuing this war okay we'll leave it there Natalie toi thank you very much indeed for your insights great talking to you
