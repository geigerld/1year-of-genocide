coming out of the United Nations the Saudi foreign minister is speaking message on this and we hope that the International Community will come together to support those civilians at what my fellow colleagues emphasized our presence at this important meeting at this very dire hour as this crisis is not oring well as further escalation is likely we call for an immediate and Lasting ceasefire so that we spare the entire region from the consequences or and repercussions of the conflict we condemn all forms of targeting of civilians any civilians regardless of their color or nationalities the internation the world conscience can no longer tolerate further suffering as a result of targeting civilians and innocent unarmed citizens we should refrain from violating any law international law or International humanitarian law at the same time we should also refrain from Dual standards and give Paramount importance to the protection of civilians a spade must be called a spade the gross and violent violations of international law and human law cannot be characterize other than crimes and violation of law we should all observe the international law international legitimate resolutions and international human law we should also refrain from Collective punishment of the Palestinian people and put an end to in to the sufferings of innocent civilians we should all work together to contain this crisis and categorically reject all the war crimes including the forcible transfer of populations at the same time we cannot tped the Palestinian CES at the expense of the neighboring countries the Palestinian people are holding steadfast to the established rights and they cannot abandon these rights nor will the neighboring Arab countries we call on the security Council to undertake its responsibility as defined in the charter to work for the cessation of facilities an immediate and sustained ceasefire and to Pro provide the protection for all civilians again we condemn the targeting of all civilians and we consider it imperative that the International Community undertakes its responsibility to address the issues of gross violations of international humanitarian law we must apply ourselves as we have done in the Cairo peace Summit to a political process a process that reemphasizes that the two-state solution we can no longer only address the two-state solution and Advocate as a matter of lip service that the International Community and the security Council do have the necessary resources and means to implement what has become recognized as the international community's consensus to the end of this conflict on the basis of a two State solution living side by side in peace and security and this is what we seek and this is what we expect Ed thank you the messages to send today following the peace Summit held in Egypt with respect to the release of cap the captives Egypt is sparing no efforts to address all the elements of this crisis including the humanitarian aspect also the release of captives and also the protection to civilians uh in addition to the delivery of relief Aid at the same time diplomacy is what we uh sold through the Egyptian Summit we aimed at agreeing upon the principles that should govern this conflict be it the dedication to the solution of the two State solution and also the delivery of humanitarian Aid we will continue in this course in coordination and cooperation with our friends and uh fellow colleagues in the Arab and world countries and we hope that the no more escalation will come in the coming days otherwise the repercussion will be grave not only on the region but the whole uh World from CBS News can you answer ministers the question that Anthony blink and the secretary of state raised it where is the outrage on the October 7th attacks and what is it that you think the UN can do you're here what can the UN do for a lasting peace thank you before anybody else we expressed outrage at the killing of civilians we have we went we met in the Arab League and we all took one unified stand and we said we condemn the killing of civilians we're outraged at where that moment has gotten us as well we're outraged at what's happening now in Gaza 6,000 people slaughtered children women daughters fathers grandfathers all all suffering all dying under under uh the bombardment of Israel uh we need the whole intern International Community to be outraged at the absence of Justice we must be outraged at our failure as International Community for having failed to solve a conflict that we all knew is going to get worse how many all of us all of us each and everyone standing of us here and our leaders and all our warned that unless we solve this conflict violence is going to erupt and the whole region will be dragged into the abyss of the war that you see now we should be outraged at failing the Palestinian people we should be outraged at failing the Israeli people by not giving them the peace that they deserve what we want is peace peace that will will fulfill the rights of the Palestinians to statehood Freedom will ensure the security of Israel and that's a position that we took in 2002 the Arab peace initiative we said that we said all of us are willing to have normal relations with Israel in return for one thing in the illegal occupation of the Palestinian land in the separation of the Palestinian people withdraw from Arab lands occupied and let's have peace so I I think we're all out outraged at the at the death of every child of every woman regardless the nationality the identity the religion the faith but we should face facts and we should stop just trying to avoid looking addressing the elephant in the room which is there is an occupation that is the root cause of all evil in the region and that must end this is our message this is where we should all be outraged and let's remember this is not the first time that we see people die how many wars have been launched on Gaza how many violent operations have taken place where are we now facing the same moment that we all have been trying to avoid facing death facing War facing the threat of regional War so let's just step back let's not let rage determine the future of millions of people in our region let's just all let's allow common sense and reason to come back and let's all together the whole world in this United Nations come and say it is time we solve this challenge this conflict once and for all and the only way is peace that will fulfill the rights of all and would allow all of us to start working together to create but a future for our people foreign minister Mr foreign minister Susan from we is the response for those who say that a ceasefire is only possible until the hostages are released and thank you for doing this I mean a ceasefire is a humanitarian imperative we are facing a desperate situation in Gazza right now we are facing an impending humanitarian catastrophe every hour we speak more civilians in razza are dying more people are getting injured the situation is getting getting worse a ceasefire is an absolute necessary necessity immediately that will allow us to address all of the other issues we have called quite clearly for a release of hostages and that is absolutely necessary but the protection of civilian life the protection of infrastructure especially hospitals and other uh infrastructure required for the survival of RZA is also an imperative that must be met immediately their English out their English out their English Minister can you please was there any American proposal Minister can I ask question un States what are your comments on concerns that this violence might spread across the region that threat is real we're all doing everything we can to stop it there's the threat of this expanding into the West Bank into Lebanon into other fronts none of us want that we're all working against that but let's face it unless this war stops uh unless those horrific images of death keep coming out we all face that real danger thank you so much the proposal by the United States is in Blueprint it might be subject to vote tomorrow this draft resolution does not include an immediate and Lasting cease fire nor does it condemn the assassination and the killing perpetrated by the Israeli settlers nor does this draft resolution identify the humanitarian aspects do you think this draft resolution acceptable by the Arab countries and if it fail to pass what is the course to be taken as the uh General Assembly may be convened at your request however their resolution are not mandatory I believe any draft resolution before any deliberation or voting depends on the balance of such draft resolution in case of absence of such balance therefore the entire case will be disregarded unless there are workable effective solutions to the interest of both the parties to the conflict and the entire region I believe the draft resolution will be flowed and erroneous I believe the members of the security Council will live up to the respective responsibilities and obligations and they will work together in order to achieve peace make no mistake that this organization was set up in the first place to maintain peace and security our Prime goal is to put an end to the war operations and to address all the political diplomatic and humanitarian aspects and without providing any justification for continued battling otherwise we will be deviating from the Mandate as reflected in the UN Charter question with respect to the humanitarian Aid and the pressure exercised on the Waring parties all of you have good relations with the United States what are the practical measures taken by you in order to exercise pressure on the Americans in order to their turn exercise pressure on Israelis to end War since the beginning of this war we have been in close contact with all the International Players including the United States we made it clear that there must be an immediate ceasefire and uh Aid humanitarian Aid should be delivered and we should engage in peace talks we all of us all our respective countries intensified our efforts in this direction and we could see that the humanitarian Aid started to access Gaza however they are very minimum what is now required is to provide safe corridors for food supply and medical supplies without any restrictions or conditions what is more important now which is in harmony with the international law is to lift the G Siege laying siegs to entire Gaza Strip is in violation of the international law and this is our main demand and we will continue in this path thank you all right you've just been uh watching and listening to a number of speakers at the United Nations um and now is the representative for the United Arab Emirates speaking live let's listen to the next to avoid this the United Arab Emirates affirms the importance of adopting a resolution calling for an immedate and sustained humanitarian ceasefire and to work seriously after that to find a just lasting and comprehensive solution to this conflict to allow both peoples to live in lasting peace and security the United Arab Emirates will continue its calls for dialogue peaceful coexistence and cooperation as the path to stability in the region today we ask you to support this Vision to achieve the aspirations of the Region's peoples towards progress and prosperity today to humanity is facing a critical test as responsible and conscious leaders in particular in this Council we must succeed in the test by advancing the choice of peace and Reviving the two-state solution which is needed now more than ever to achieve the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people this requires confronting and addressing the present crisis instead of just managing it makes no sense if we repeat the same approach towards this conflict and expect different results thank you Mr President I thank Her Excellency Mrs Al you've been listening to a number of speakers so we're going to reset for you for just a quick second uh all of this is happening at the United Nations if you're just joining us it is 1635 GMT that is 12:35 in New York where what you're seeing on your screen is currently unfolding and uh 80 plus countries are lined up to speak today on the Israel Gaza War um so okay we're keeping an eye on what's on screen so you just caught the closing statements by the representative of the United Arab Emirates who were saying uh talking about the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people and just moments before that we were carrying live the remarks by the Saudi foreign minister the Egyptian foreign minister the Jordanian representative as well they called for an immediate ceasefire the Saudi um the Saudi foreign minister was calling for a lifting a total lifting of The Siege on Gaza by Israel uh they were also asked whether they thought that the uh the violence might spread across the region the Jordanian Envoy saying yes that threat of that happening is very real indeed so that's where we stand
