now Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has acknowledged that the United States and Israel have different ideas of what Gaza will look like after the war but he has thanked Washington for its ongoing support Netanyahu specifically referred to the Palestinian Authority saying he does not want it to control Gaza I greatly appreciate the American support for destroying Hamas and returning our hostages following an intensive dialogue with President Biden and team we received full backing for the ground incursion and blocking the international pressure to stop the war yes there is disagreement about the day after Hamas and I hope that we will reach an agreement here as well I would also like to clarify my position I will not allow Israel to repeat the mistake of Oslo Imran Khan is live for us now in Tel Imran what more did we hear from Benjamin Netanyahu well there some context before I get into that that's worth just updating you on uh the Prime Minister there referring to Oslo he made a statement uh saying comparing the deaths of Israelis on October the 7th to the deaths of Israelis uh after the Oslo Peace Accords were signed in 1993 and then the inada happened that angered a lot of people in Israel but he's doubl down on it he's basically saying uh that um he's not going to allow any type of peace process that will allow Hamas uh to stand he also um clarified then uh that he's also not in really that interested in talking about the day after right now uh what he wants to do is keep a conversation going about what happens the day after he's under a lot of pressure when it comes to this day after what's is Ro's plan for the day after uh the Americans say they want to revitalize Palestinian Authority to take charge of the Govern the strip that's something uh that the Prime Minister hasn't um committed to as of yet most Israeli analysts that you speak to particularly um on the far right of things uh simply want a military occupation of Gaza and he's talking about that uh even more we've heard leaks from the security cabinet where he mentions uh the military occupation of Gaza that seems to be the only uh thing that he wants however there'll be a lot of pressure from the International Community and from within Israel itself to allow the Palestinian Authority to rule there but what shape that takes no one knows and no one has any idea certainly not uh the Prime Minister Iman Khan thanks very much indeed
