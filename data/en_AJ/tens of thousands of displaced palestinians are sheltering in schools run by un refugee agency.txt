tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have been Sheltering at schools run by the UN Refugee agency unra El jazer spoke to some of them met a facility in central Gaza I'm from Gaza and we found nothing here you need to fight to buy some water food is not good at all they shouldn't have brought such bad food we came from Gaza and we're being attacked here and there and everywhere our situation is miserable and our wives and daers are in the streets no Arab country wants to help why are we living we escaped we scared shelling is everywhere the world must understand our situation we have children and we have sick people and also also they displace people who are suffering from cancer we are terrorized and someone must understand how terrorized and horrified we are we have no food we have no water there no toilets we're left to stay on the streets they have destroyed my house I have no other place to live I don't know where to go our life is hell they told us to go to the South and here we are in the South I'm sick and tired of everything I don't need food I just need to go back to my house take me to my place and I will live in a tent there well our correspondent Muhammad Jim Jun is standing by for us he's an occupied East Jerusalem Muhammad you've spoken to unra what have they told you about the situation in G Tom we heard extremely Stark and dire warnings from the UN Refugee Agency for Palestinians from unra they had a press conference a short while ago here in occupied East Jerusalem let me tell you just a little bit about what we heard the UN commissioner uh commissioner General Philipe lazarini he said that they need to be able to bring supplies into Gaza that there needs to be a humanitarian Corridor established that no place in Gaza is safe he said that the situation was absolutely unprecedented he said Wars all wars even this war have laws and they need to be followed um he went on to say that Gaza is running out of water and electricity he said Gaza is being strangled and it seems the world right now has lost its Humanity if we look at the issue of water we all know that water is life and Gaza is running out of water and Gaza is running out of life so extremely dire warnings about what is going on from ANA now I asked the spokesperson for Ana Tamar about those reports that we've been hearing the last few hours that perhaps water had been restored by Israel to Southern Gaza uh she said that they have not yet been able to confirm that that has happened and explained more about what potentially might happen going forward take a listen to what she told me until about an hour ago our colleagues in southern Gaza our colleagues in ra could not confirm that water had been restored but even if the water is restored the water is going to go to big uh containers in Gaza which means that they the the the water will need to be trucked to different locations and to truck the water to different locations we need fuel for the trucks so it's really a chain of of events that need to happen before people can actually get water Muhammad what is the Israeli government saying about the potential for regional escalation Tom throughout the day uh we've been hearing just very bellicose rhetoric from Israeli officials uh with regards to the steps going forward uh we heard from the top spokesperson for the Israeli Army several hours ago he essentially said that Israel will be able to operate anywhere in the region in order to counter threats that they feel that they have to counter um that was clearly a message being sent to Regional actors that they should not think about attacking Israel but it was also a message being sent domestically to Israeli citizens that the country basically will do whatever is needed to protect itself um now we also heard from the Prime Minister earlier in the day Benjamin Netanyahu he met for the first time with that expanded emergency cabinet that has been uh established this past week and he said that Hamas will be demolished and then we also heard from the defense minister yoav Galant uh he a little bit later in the afternoon said that the country is going to do everything it can to destroy Hamas so this is the rhetoric we're hearing Israel basically telling everybody who will listen that they are going to destroy Hamas that they will operate in any theater in the region that they see fit to protect themselves um and it's going to be interesting to see if any of this language shifts at all tomorrow because tomorrow you have US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin returning here for his second visit in less than a week uh he is going to be meeting with Israeli officials so it will be interesting to see on the eve of this visit we've heard so much aggressive language today we'll see tomorrow what exactly we'll be hearing from Israeli officials going forward Tom okay thanks so much Muhammad this Muhammad Jim Jun for us an occupied East Jerusalem
