two UK ministers will present evidence to defend the government at a business and trade Committee hearing on arms exports to Israel let's go live straight away to Sonia GGA who's outside Westminster and Sonia tell us more about why this hearing has been called and what we expect to hear from both sides well it's it's becoming more of a process where uh the British uh export licenses the arms licenses to Israel are coming under increased scrutiny and not least because there was that letter that was signed among them by uh former justices of the Supreme Court that questions uh what the UK's role is in this and what it it can do to avoid uh any accusations of playing any part in breaching International humanitarian law and one of those justices and the signatories of that letter was indeed presenting uh statements to uh the committee uh that is taking place and he said basically that the two uh the arguments hinge on two accounts whether it's ascertaining on the looking at the uh findings of the the provisional findings of the icj that were made on the 26th of January looking at how Palestinians are a distinct group who are perfectly entitled to protection and also the scale of Civilian loss and the Damage uh that is also being done to civilian uh destruction now there is in his words evidence of a genocidal intent with regard to statements that had been made from members of the Israeli government and the fact and the circumstances would seem to apply to what the icj have put in that provisional account now that of course was counted uh by lawyers for Israel and Natasha hdor was presenting that argument putting questions on the plausibility of that civilian count stating that up to a third of the casualties could not be accounted for and that there doesn't seem to be any distinction between combatants and civilians but of course while that is being acted out it is the UN as Jonathan sumption the the lawyer who has been the signatur of that letter uh saying that it is the the UN agencies and The Who that are looking at that and that's the evidence that they're relying on all right so and what's the government been saying about all of this well the government has been maintaining its stance that what it has been doing has been perfectly legal and that it has been taking a look at those export licenses but a high court uh ruling on on that earlier this week has seen that there has been evidence presented that David Cameron the foreign secretary has renewed licenses on the 8th of April uh there was a letter that stated that certainly the processes could be improved and that is certainly being questioned by other ministers of the government stating that there certainly isn't any International consensus that such uh careful look at these uh export licenses uh would indeed be able to prevent the UK from being drawn into accusations of partaking in any potential breaches of international humanitarian law and looking at countries such as Italy which have already suspended those export licenses it is stressing that the UK would need to look more at what it is doing and how it is continuing to sell those licenses without breaching those laws all right we'll see how that hearing pans out as a day goes on thanks Ona make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
