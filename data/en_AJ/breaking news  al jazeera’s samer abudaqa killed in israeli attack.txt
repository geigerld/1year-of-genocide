all right let's bring you some news just coming into to us here now our cameraman in Gaza samur abua has died our cameraman in Al Al jazer cameraman in Gaza who was wounded earlier on few hours ago in an Israeli strike has now died Samar Abu Daka was operating as an Al jazer cameraman in Gaza throughout this conf conflict he was working today with another colleague who was also wounded in that same attack they were covering an earlier Israeli strike on a school when they themselves fell victim to another Israeli strike initially samur was wounded paramedics could not reach him Reports say the shelling was so intense well they time they managed to get paramedics to try and head out on the road to reach him we understand the rubble blocking the road prevented them from reaching him well Al jazer has released a statement on the attack it says the network strongly condemns the Israeli attack that wounded alaz Arabic correspondent and Sam Abu Daka the Channel's cameraman during their coverage of the bombing of the farana school in Khan Unis on Friday December the 15th 2023 managed to reach a nearby hospital for treatment for his injuries however ambulance teams were prevented by occupation forces in rescuing Sam Abu Daka who along with several others were trapped in the school due to ongoing bombings Al jazer holds the Israeli occupation forces fully accountable for Sam's safe safety deeming this incident a deliberate attempt to Target its correspondents and their families in the Gaza Strip well obviously following uh that statement we have now found out that in fact the sad news that Sam Abu Daka the cameraman who we were hoping would be able to pull through this until he could be rescued has in fact passed away let's bring in Yousef bandel professor of political science in international relations at Qatar University in Yousef very disturbing news the first Al jazer journalist to be killed of course there were four others who lost family members in Israeli strikes so this is the first time in aljer journalist himself has been killed by an Israeli strike in Gaza this just underscores the difficulty the challenges the risk of life to work as a journalist or or even just to survive well I think uh journalists in Gaza are working under the most extreme uh conditions of journalists and also medical uh staff it must be uh stressed obviously the uh killing of this Al jazer uh caman is a very big blow to the truth it's an attack on freedom of uh speech and it's not tactic by the Israelis to make sure that only one narrative reaches the outside world obviously even though it's the first alaz journalist who was killed in Gaza let's not forget Shirin abua who also an Al jaaz journalist who was killed maybe a couple of years ago by an Israeli uh sniper so it's not it's not the first time that uh Al jazer journalists have been uh targeted in these kinds of conflict we can go all go back uh also to the invasion of Iraq when Al jaaz offices in Baghdad were targeted by the Americans and we know that following his injury that there were attempts there was a a desire and even an attempt for paramedics to try and reach him but they simply couldn't because the shelling just continued it underscores the the nature of this conflict which offers very little respite or Mercy to Injured people well this is a noal testimony to the Relentless efforts by the Israelis to go and uh achieve those three targets that Benyamin Netanyahu has outlined and Al also chose Israel's contempt and complete this disal to international law and to inter to uh the rules governing uh Wars obviously the paramedics tried to do whatever they could but they could not get into him because of a the rubbles on the streets and also the heavy uh shelling on that particular area let's hope that recovers from his injuries he was lucky that he would got into hospital and let's hope he recovers from his injuries and I'm sure that he gives back to doing what he does best report in those other cities yes we have to also point out that the cameraman sorry the reporter he was also injured in this tack although he was able as you said to to reach First Responders was able to reach him and and take him for treatment in some kind of facility there so we do hope that he recovers as well how disturbing is it when you listen to some of the people in that area who say it was the result of a drone attack and a drone a fairly sophisticated and precise piece of technology well I heard last week that uh Israel has been using some in intelligent uh bombs I I mean it's very very difficult to call uh a drone intelligent given the population density in Gaza they have moved people from the north to the south of Gaza and now they're bombing this very very high uh density areas in Gaza and no matter how intelligent precise these partic drones they will always uh result in huge uh casualties and today the journalists of Al jazer are just a proof of this indiscriminate um um attacks and the not so intelligent drones that are being used all right thank you very much Yousef bandel let's continue this now though with our correspondent in Gaza abum he joins us from RA in the south of the strip so T the sad news of Al jazer cameraman Sam abaka killed in that strike earlier today what details can you tell us yes uh Sammy uh we first would like to send our condolences to the family of our colleague Sam abua who had been killed after sustained to his wound uh after being left for hours bleeding on the ground of khuna city as he was reporting and uh uh filming all the latest Israeli air strikes that had destroyed life in Kanan yunes a city alongside with uh our colleague who has been uh minorly injured uh by an Israeli military drone strike uh that hit the vicinity of farana uh School in the uh in the Eastern areas of kanun uh may he rest in peace as we know samur as a professional cameraman who had devoted his life in reporting and filming uh the suffering of Palestinian people and the how much they are feeling despair uh desperate and uh feeling completely frustr frustrated as the Israeli a strikes had completely changed the way that they are living uh I used personally to share uh time and night with samur alongside with the Arabic uh with Al jaer Arabic team and he was telling me about his plans that he want to be reunited again with his family who are uh living in Belgium appro uh he just was showing me the pictures and the images of his sons and uh his family m members just to tell me that how much he mess uh them and he just planning to uh reunite and travel to Belgium in order to uh meet them again now Sam has left our world and he won't be again reunited with his family members as he was one of the uh uh important prominent figures of uh filming all the Palestinian misery as Israeli forces had uh expanded their attacks acrus Gaza samur was uh very professional his work de devoted and dedicated he just insisted on keep uh filming and uh keep uh recording everything that is happening on the ground once a time I've asked him personally like uh are are not you getting tired Sam he told me that this is our job we need to complete uh filming we need to show how people are suffering this is a message that must be sent to the International Community samur has been killed as he was doing and Reporting his message to the World on on the ground as Israel had deliberately targeted uh journalists across the territory where dozens of Palestinian journalists have been killed since the early beginning of this round of fighting uh now s now is in a better place may his saw rest in peace as the truth won't be will continue to be reported from the ground here inside the Gaza trip t just talk us through this commitment that we're seeing from journalists from Al jazer journalist that drives them to go on working showing the world what happened you mentioned the words there of Sam Abu similar words were uttered by an Sharif after he lost his father when he said I'll continue to cover what's unfolding similar statements from the reporter who is also wounded today when a few weeks ago he lost his family members and was back on air almost uh immediately to continue covering the story what keeps people driven and committed to their professional responsibilities despite the immense pain and suffering that they must be going through all of you yes uh Samy simply uh that's because Palestinians had completely uh suffered all shapes of pain and all kinds of misery as Israeli forces did not let anything just back to do against Palestinians they have destroyed the houses forced them to leave it behind they destroyed the memories their dreams and they only wanted to let the world know what is happening on the ground inside Gaza as no one uh till now had uh been uh showing the exact reality just except few media outlets and then jazer is one of the most prominent media Outlets inside the territory who are which is still reporting what is the latest on the ground and those people as as you mentioned s and a number of our colleagues who had been whose whose family had been directly targeted by the occupation forces they they just put their pains aside and they they returned to their commitment and their professionalism in terms of reporting all the suffering of Palestinians people on the ground people inide Gaza want us to keep reporting to tell the world how they are feeling with every single time we went we go to different locations for reporting and for uh filming people start telling us please send our voice to the world we want the International Community to hear and to listen what we are suffering on the ground we need to them to take a look on the reality that how that how Palestinians are trying to cope with the situation after Israel had completely destroyed everything left for them as right now they are living in makf tent and they are forced to uh to to live and to survive um these imparable uh situation and circumstances now those people are really her and as they are they are trying to complete the commitment as what our colleague had done before he he pred his family members he returned back again at the front of the camera to keep reporting now he had been injured and I'm absolutely sure that he will return back again and twice as he had uh uh as he's still alive to keep reporting and to tell the world what he was uh suffering and experiencing as the Israeli attacks on the ter do not differentiate between a militant and civilian and I know TK that you've worked with samur just talk to us a little bit about you've mentioned his professional professionalism but talk to us a little bit about what it was like to work with him as a person um samur was a close friend of mine since I started work to work with Al jazer team uh he was uh very close to me we were sharing food drink together at night uh sometimes he just came to me searching where s can I need him just Hy us what would you like to have for dinner he he was so close person as he was just all all the time ask me about my family members how I feel uh like uh what is the new uh new updates on the ground he he was really a brother before he was a colleague right now uh samur has left us alone uh we just uh I remember when when the first moment I've heard uh the news of his death I I immediately retrospect all words that had been released and had been told by uh Sam for me uh regarding uh the support regarding uh asking about my family uh and also regarding any kind of my favorite drinks and food in order to afford for me because he is uh one of the uh members who because his family members are residing in Kan I I clearly remember the nights that I've spent with him under the rain uh where he was uh just sit next to me we are sharing we were sharing uh drinks together he was literally a very professional even human being who was uh very passionate and uh very uh uh ambitious he was only uh planning just to reunite with his family uh members after the war because he had been uh he he was forced to evacuate them from the territory and they were and he was in daily contact with him sometimes he was showing me like the photos and the images of his kids telling me that this is his Elder son and this is the youngest one this is the prettiest he was sharing me his uh personal issues his problems sometimes when he gets annoyed now samary is a better place where he won't be annoyed again and pic I want you to talk to me now on a human level about what these constant losses of colleagues and colleagues families does to you as you have to try and focus on being a journalist but at the same time to survive as a human being because I think the loss of samon underlines the threat to to you as well as all of our team members operating there in Gaza well uh honestly Sammy uh uh the the the the repeated incidents of killing and death of our beloved ones personally affects on us but we've been trained in order to be uh an order to Casting our emotions aside in terms of work as we need to keep reporting and informing the International Community and the world outside about what is happening on the ground uh when we just uh when we switch off the camera and we just take aside uh here the the real Bane starts where we just try to recall all all past memories uh we we just remember all good days together and we start putting ourselves in the shoes of Samar and other journalists who had been killed or who had lost their family members about how they were able to uh continue reporting Amed uh these conditions Amed the very desperate pain inside their chests uh regarding the uh the the loss of their family members but meanwhile they just talk their decision to keep reporting and this is what we have been trained on uh since uh the uh uh since our work start of work in this field that uh emotions must be aside as we need to keep reporting and keep putting the world uh uh with the latest updates regarding the Israeli strikes on the ground now uh the majority of journalists in in Gaza started to believe that there is no any impunity had been uh uh granted for them but this is a matter of fact that we need to keep uh reporting and to keep uh telling the world the real story uh inside Gaza uh and people here in the territory after all kinds of bains and losses that they have endured they deserve to be uh they deserve that their voice must be delivered and heared uh across uh the uh around the globe as this is the main mission and the main responsibility uh that come in uh as the first the priority for reporters and correspondents on the ground to tell the world about and this is what we are doing and uh as much as losses as many as losses as we can uh have within the coming days we don't know who's the next uh we should keep reporting and uh personal emotions must be casted aside in order to let the world know about our suffering on the ground of course we believe that these kinds of incidents are not easy to be uh endured but we are trying to coup and with the situation in order to keep giving power for others who are surrounding us uh uh to be able uh to stand uh strong and to enhance the resilience uh as the circumstances around us are devastating and uh if we are surrendered or if we have been psychologically broken down uh uh no one would hear or uh let's say full anything regarding the situation on the ground inside the territory but this is our job this is our responsibility to let the world and to let the Palestinian voice heared around the globe all right TK stay with us I'm just going to point out to viewers we're looking at pictures of family members who came to identify and receive the body of our colleague samur Abu Daka the aler cameraman who's been killed by an Israeli strike we've obviously blurred out the picture of his body there uh for obvious reasons and we're we're seeing quite intense scenes I understand that's his mother uh state of obvious State of Shock and grief that many Palestinians are feeling as they lose their loved ones
