well turning now to the protests we've been seeing across universities in the United States against Israel's war on Gaza police have removed tents from the Palestinian solidarity encampment at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville let's take a look as you see there police moved in on that camp where protesters had been based for some 5 days now earlier in the week University officials had permitted the students to hold a demonstration on the condition that they did not put up tents or use loudspeakers well let's speak to Teresa B she's across this student movement for us from New York Teresa it looked like it got a little messy in Charlottesville can you talk us through what happened there between police and the students well correct what happened in University of Virginia is basically what we've been seeing happening elsewhere all across the country with students starting to protest uh and then setting up encampments and then those encampments being removed by force by the police in this case in particular it's been several days since students were protesting in the University they had several demands among them for example which is divestment from companies that students believe are profiting from the war this is not in a way what they're demanding they're saying that this is something that happened during the anti- aerte movement for example and that it was carried out by many universities in the United States and that's why their demand is a legitimate one so the university said that they were not going going to meet this demands and that's when they set up an encampment and the early this Saturday morning the police arve state troopers arrived they said that they had to remove the encamp bed there were around 20 students but then the group become became much larger there were some confrontations the police started using tear gas pepper spray and we saw how several students were dragged out from the campus University campus and detained and that's what we've been seeing happening all across New York City and in several other parts of the country you know students are convinced that they're fighting for uh justice that they are in this U civil rights movement in a way defending at just cost comparing it to what happened during the Vietnam War when students protesting against the war against Herer head among many other things and that why many are saying that they'll go back that they'll continue protesting until this war is over Theresa as you say there have been confrontations and and many arrests too in New York where you are I know you've been speaking to students there it certainly sounds like like there's an air of defiance you expect this to continue even even into the summer Beyond graduations we're going to have to see what happens what I can tell you is that on Friday where I am standing right now which is the new school in lower uh New York City at least 27 people were detained here on the building right in front of where I am 20 people were detained and even though they were taken to a police station later on many were released they are being charged with misdem Miner for example again the students took to the streets to protest across New York City there were hundreds of people that gathered there to demand an end to the war in Gaza to demand ceasefire to demand that the universities divest from Israel so certainly it is a moment time of regrouping in a way of of finding how they're going to continue with this movement let's not forget that thousands of students have been detained many of them are right now dealing with legal situation we know that for example in many universities across the country law students are assisting their other students that have been detained so there's a whole movement around what is happening in the country right now we're going to have to see how here in New York City the situation continue but the students that we have spoken to say are are telling me that they'll be on the streets uh once again Teresa B covering that student movement for us from New York thank you very much Teresa well students at the University of California and Irvine say that they will remain on their campus until all their demands are met protesters are demanding that their University divest from businesses as Teresa was describing with tires to Israeli and weapons manufacturers University officials say they'll continue to negotiate with students and that they're optimistic that they'll reach a deal soon well let's bring in our correspondent gabri alander he joins us now live from that campus there in Irvine Gabe I can see from well just behind you that the encampment is very much Still Standing so those talks are ongoing but the students are standing strong they are there are several dozen protesters here at this encampment that you see behind me it's day six and they are negotiating with the uh University administrators uh over several rounds of talks uh about trying to meet these student protesters demands one of which among many uh or several I should say is full divestment of any companies that this University deals with that has any uh business dealings with Israel of course uh so there are negotiations going on not today but they're going to meet perhaps again as early as Monday and the protesters here are hopeful that they could reach some sort of agreement clearly the pressure seems to be working and when I say pressure I mean the pressure of this encampment uh everything is very peaceful here uh there's actually families that have come out here with children that are going into the encampment uh taking part in lectures and and paintings and and you see uh elderly people here as well it's all very very peaceful and we're seeing scenes that are much different than what we're seeing in Virginia on Saturday where Riot police confronted uh protesters here actually uh there was one agitator a couple hours ago that showed up here and that was taking video of some of the protesters uh without their permission he was a clear agitator actually a campus police officer came in said please stop and escorted him away deescalate the situation so that is an example of uh here at least here in that one uh example of a deescalation no real police presence here at all it's not really needed and uh for the most part and that's why uh things here are moving along for the most part as when I talk to the protesters uh very well as this encampment will continue they say until their demands are fully met Gab by I can see some balloons floating in the air there behind you as you say it it's incredibly different between what's happening there and other campuses like the University of Virginia but certainly very different to what took place at UCLA which was not all that far away this is the same University a different campus right yeah that's right and it really shows you how um the the the administrators of each University really have a choice they have a choice to either escalate and call in police and be confrontational or they have a choice to actually listen to come to these encampments listen to what these young people as well as professors as I should point out are taking part in this as well it's not just students it's primarily students but it's it's also alumni it's professors as well and actually listen to what their concerns are listen to what their demands are to try to reach some sort of agreement and deescalate the situation and that's what you're clearly seeing here but uh uh this is pretty much uh the the the exception not the rule of course because as we see on our TV screens and from coverage from our colleagues all over the United States in the last several days uh many universities are taking a much more confrontational approach which quite frankly is unfortunate but one of the protesters I spoke to here said she hopes that this is an example of what can be achieved perhaps again they're still negotiating so we're not there yet but at least there is some discussion going on and we'll stay that stay across that for you here on alzer for now gabrielo there and at the campus of University of California at Irvine thank you for that update Gabriel
