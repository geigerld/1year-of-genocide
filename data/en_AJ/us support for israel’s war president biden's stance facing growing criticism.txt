thank you for having me and uh Joe Biden is the 14th US president who has tried to resolve the Israel Palestine conflict on the first day of the war in Gaza Biden offered complete support for Israel no calls on it to show restraint we must be Crystal Clear we stand with Israel Biden's support hearkens back to that of President Harry Truman who in 1948 recognized the state of Israel within 11 minutes of its dec of Independence but some subsequent presidents took a more tough love approach Dwight Eisenhower Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan all condemned Israeli military action on occasion but Reagan also started the practice of awarding Israel $3 billion in Aid every year a strong secure Israel is a shared interest the George HW Bush Administration was the first to threaten to cut Aid to Israel if it didn't stop illegally building settlements in the occupied West Bank thank you for your statement the Obama Administration took the unusual step in 2016 of withholding a veto in the UN Security Council after Benjamin Netanyahu now prime minister ignored Washington's request to stop settlement expansion the US's extension cleared the way for the security Council to demand Israel stop construction notably the question of us aid for Israel never came up at either of the Camp David Summits and it was never raised by either presidents George W bush or Donald Trump Trump's support gave Israel what it craved the recognition of Jerusalem as capital of the Jewish State now with the war in Gaza in its fifth month and the death toll Rising some in Congress say Aid to Israel must be made conditional there should be no blank checks for any country we cannot continue the pattern where prime minister Netanyahu says Thank you Mr President for America's generous military assistance and then thumbs his nose at America's legitimate requests there might be a subtle change in US policy of foot the US has circulated a draft Security Council resolution on Gaza that includes words it has refused to use before for now a temporary ceasefire but still no definitive plan to leverage billions of dollars in US Aid to convince Netanyahu to change the way he's conducting the war the show of support yet to be matched by what Washington says is its alarm over the situation in Gaza Roselyn Jordan aljazera Washington make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
