the year was 1948 around 750,000 Palestinians were expelled from their land and the state of Israel came into being the following year the UN General Assembly created unoa the refugee agency that works to offer basic services to Palestinians but Israel has long objected to the UN agency we have seen increased attacks on the legitimacy of unur and we read that has increased uh attempts to delegitimize the category of Palestine refugees altogether we see these attacks as very politically motivated Israel says the curriculums of unra run schools encourage incitement against Israel the UN agency denies that Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been calling for unra to be dismantled for years unra regularly is is uh accused of a set of recurrent things the use of our premises by nonon entities particularly by parties to a conflict or were being accused of complicity with parties to a conflict but Israel's latest accusation has led to at least 17 countries stopping their funding to unra threatening the majority of its budget and all on the word of Israel that 12 unra staff in Gaza worked with Hamas unra carries out investigations into every allegation and in this case has requested proof from Israel refugees say the funding withdrawal will be devastating to the 5.9 million Palestinians un provides services for if un is lost so many things are lost with it I won't be able to enroll my children in school I won't be able to take my children to the doctor or go to the pharmacy Ireland's foreign minister thinks it's no coincidence that Israel's allegation came on the same day as the international court of justice ordered Israeli forces to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza and he links the attacks on unoa to Israel's desire to erase the historic claim of Palestinian refugees and their right of return as part of a wider um position around uh the right of Return of refugees in the context of the establishment of a Palestinian State uh if we were to arrive at a two-state Solutions uh because the continuing of Contin continuation of un is absolutely essential for a Palestinian state to emerge something that Israel's prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu says he cannot accept imin Kimber Al jazer Chris gnis is a formera spokesperson and joins us now from London Mr gun it's good to have you on the program we'll talk about sort of the medical needs of of Gaz moment I just wanted to ask I mean the effects of occupation you know all too well I mean is this case that's come to the icj in the ha long time coming in your opinion it's 56 years too long in the coming but make no mistake this case is hugely significant and indeed unprecedented it's the first time in the history of the UN that a quarter of the UN member states have gone to the highest judicial organ of the UN the icj and demanded that the court make an urgent DET termination that is to declare the occupation doubly illegal firstly it's illegal in its imposition so the apartate system the colonial Jewish settlements with three quarters of a million illegal Jewish settlers living on Stolen Palestinian land the home demolitions the school demolitions the torture of children in the middle of the night the vicious settler violence the blockade and now this plausible genocide the list goes on but secondly a quarter of the UN member states are asking the court to say that the occupation existentially in and of itself is illegal because it denies the Palestinians the right to self-determination and Professor Philipe Sans one of the legal councils for the Palestinians made this clear that UN member states must bring Israel's occupation to an immediate and complete end and let me quote him no Aid no assistance no complicity no contribution to forceable actions no money no arms no trade no nothing so this was a major milestone in Palestine advocacy because the spotlight is not just on the illegal practices of the Israeli Army the Seas Etc it's now on the complicity in those Crimes of the UN member states the US the UK the EU they are now under the spotlight and guess what the people on the streets in the Arab world in the global South in European in Western capitals they are now going to be saying to their governments if you want Putin and Assad on the right side of international law you got guys get a better get on the right side too so a major major Milestone okay in terms of Milestones let's just focus in and put the spotlight then onto Gaza I mean to get your head around the issue of what it means to live under occupation is hard for the majority of us around the world um you can to a certain extent uh understand that because you've worked in Gaza can you put just into a few words uh what it's like for a person to feel and to live under occupation and the pressure that creates well I had an email literally a few hours ago from a colleague who i' done an amazing project will with in Gaza to help special needs children who couldn't see properly who were partially cited and he said that two nights ago his eldest son who was about to qualify to be a dentist died in a bomb which hit the neighbor's house he has now been displaced three or four times he's living with his wife his four daughters and his son they have lost absolutely everything he says they go to bed hungry the children go to bed crying because they're so hungry they wake up hungry they're buying water from illegal water carts knowing that it's not clean they all end up with diarrhea in Flats which they're sharing with with 30 40 other people it's that I hope that paints a real a really humanized picture of what it means to live in what the UN is calling an unprecedentedly barbaric attack that's what it means today for an individual that I know personally and that's one among many I know that when you were in position you always highlighted how difficult it was to get Aid into Gaza or the occupied West Bank I mean how difficult or what were what were the medical facilities like before October the 7th to obviously what we're hearing as we just heard from Dr Rick peppercorn I mean how how devastated that the medical um infrastructure is right now how difficult was it trying to get Medical Aid into Gaza look even before the 7th of October part of the Israeli strategy to impose a collective punishment an illegal Collective punishment on Gaza was to Debbe the main hospitals of the medical equipment and the medical supplies that they needed so it was pretty much impossible to get tertiary care for cancer those sorts of of care absolutely impossible and of course since um the 7th of October we hear of children having amputations without anesthetic women giving birth cesarian section without anesthetic it has become utterly barbaric and that is now on top of all this we're seeing the slow Massacre the starvation we're seeing people falling ill we're seeing communicable diseases we're seeing reports of people literally dropping down of exhaustion on the ground of hunger and exhaustion so you know that is a port if you like of a medical service which is not on its knees it's been completely destroyed the UN secret General has said that the humanitarian response the humanitarian system in Gaza is completely destroyed and that's why I say what we need to do is mobilize a massive International effort it's no longer no longer we can no longer leave the protection of Palestinians health education food water electricity all these things in the hands of the Israelis they're committing what the icj is calling a aible genocide we need to get a presidential order frankly signed by Joe Biden to get as he did with Haiti in 2010 20,000 American soldiers on the ground we need to see a floating Hospital off the coast of Gaza we need to see helicopters fing the wounded the sick the dying backwards and forwards because at the moment let me tell you this safe area in Al maazi that is no place for people there are no toilet facilities there are no medical facilities that is a recipe for further destruction that is a recipe for further plausible genocide when this attack comes in Rafa which it will do within a matter of weeks the world will have blood on its hands if we don't see a rapid massive Global humanitarian mobilization now and mark my words unless that happens we are going to see industrial scale loss of human life but the the world cannot say it has not been warned Chris gunness you uh paint a very Grim picture for us and certainly one that I think our viewers will be mulling over in the coming hours thanks so much for joining us from London thank you pleasure pleasure
