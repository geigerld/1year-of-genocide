we're joined Now by Robert mardini he is the director general of the international Committee of the Red Cross he joins us now live from Janita Geneva thank you so much for taking the time to speak to us in Al jazer now in the last 24 hours we've heard about two newborn babies at alifa hospital in Gaza who have died after a shell an Israeli shell shut down a generator which had been powering incubators in the neonate a ward we know many other babies are also at risk now how long can a newborn baby survive without being connected to an incubator well these are unbearable um reports and images we're getting from alifa hospital but also from other hospital alwan alut hospital and many other hospitals where U the vicinity of hospitals become War zones which is really unacceptable and we repeat our call to parties to the conflict that hospitals are sanctuaries they need to be protected they must be protected uh no patient no baby no woman no man should die in a bed hospital no doctor no nurse should should be killed in the line of duty those are uh unacceptable things happening before our eyes today it's worth highlighting to our viewers the pictures we are currently showing on the screen are those 20 or so babies that were connected to incubators but now can no longer be connected I just want to ask my question again how long do they have to survive if they're not connected to the uh to the niku there are the most vulnerable of the vulnerable and we have been saying very cons very consistently for many days now that uh one cannot unplug uh an incubator uh and expect that a baby will be surviving uh we know that hospitals need fuel electricity uh that severely injured people also uh are extremely vulnerable and that uh Medical Care should be protected and clearly what you're seeing happening today in Gaza hospital is is simply not acceptable it's not acceptable parties to the conflict need to uh to to do much more to protect civilians to protect doctors to protect the act of uh of of you know the life-saving act of of uh uh of of doctors and nurses uh Mr mardini today we heard from the Palestine red cresant Society they say alud Hospital which is again one of the main hospitals in Gaza that it's run out of fuel it is no longer operational but that their medical staff are still trying to treat patients without electricity can you tell us more about what is happening in Al kuds and how difficult a situation these doctors and nurses and healthc Care Professionals must be facing I mean we received those reports from our colleagues from the Palestine C in society that the hospitals is no longer in a uh in a position to to operate and still there are uh patients uh requiring critical Services here and the doctors and nurses are certainly doing everything they can with very limited means very often without anesthesia without electricity we know of doctors treating with the light of their mobile phones and not only by the way in aluts hospital but for in other hospitals as as well working conditions are unbearable uh and the nurses and doctors have been working around the clock now for a months uh with with limited support and with the deteriorating working conditions day by day hour by hour uh and this situation is simply not tenable and what are you hearing from your uh staff on the ground about military activity that is currently underway around these hospitals and on these hospitals well I mean the reports are very Stark uh we are really facing an unbearable human tragedy that is unfolding in front of our eyes this is what our colleagues underground are saying people are approaching us and are calling us day and night saying they are afraid to open their door for fear of getting killed and and pleading to help them to reach safety so uh what I feel from our teams on the ground is anger is frustration for not being able to respond to these calls uh because the working conditions are are not there to be able to carry out safely those life-saving activities in the worst of circumstances isra and apologies for interrupting but I I just want to say that Israel continues to stand by the fact that Hamas is embedded in tunnels under these hospitals claims that hospital staff deny are hospitals Fair game when it comes to the law of armed conflict well hospitals are to be absolutely protected uh by all times and I think the onus and the obligation is always on the parties to the conflict not to use hospitals to launch attacks or to use hospitals as a battle Zone uh this is very clear uh and even if a hospital uh is used by one party as a launching pad uh for attack uh it does not justify automatically uh that hospital be targeted at a time where uh women children and men are being treated and the health personnel is delivering life-saving AIDS so uh those are sanctuaries that should be protected and we reiterate our call to parties to the conflict to uh to stay away from hospital to stay away from ambulances evacuating critically injured to to stay away from uh health personnel saving lives in the most difficult of of times and circumstances Benjamin Netanyahu has said in recent interviews that the Red Cross should be doing its Duty and I I quote there and checking on the welfare of the Israeli captives in Gaza is that something the Israelis have approached you with and how would that be facilitated well we have been also extremely clear from from the beginning that uh uh those hostages civilians hostages should be uh should be freed uh urgently and unconditionally uh we have repeated our ask to be visiting them to check on their health to ensure that they get medicines to also allow them to exchange messages with their uh families and we also uh proposed to facilitate any release of hostages so far our teams were successful in uh facilitating the release of four hostages we are ready to do more of this and this is part also of our commitment and at the same time our teams are committed to help uh in the Gaza Strip um amid horrendous conditions uh and unbearable suffering the civilian population is living and there is no hierarchy in suffering there is no hierarchy uh in uh human dignity and we call really on the humanity of uh parties to the conflict to carve out a larger space for impartial and neutral humanitarian action that is needed today more than ever and if you did indeed visit uh to check on the condition of these uh captives Israeli captives in Gaza would you speak to the Israelis about doing the same thing for those Palestinians that are in in jails in the occupied West Bank I mean absolutely for us uh a deta dete is a detainee uh they require our visit and we have been very consistent from the very beginning and for many years by the way where we have been visiting uh detainees on on all sides of this conflict and our plea Remains the Same uh we need unconditional access to all detainees including uh the hostages today in Gaza uh we haven't been able to visit so far but this is uh a longstanding request and ask and um and we hope we will be able to visit them soon 1.6 million people displaced many people forced to live crowded in tiny spaces that are available what are the risks of disease in the near future well actually we see now the visible scars of four and this is uh unacceptable its heartbreaking is terrifying to see and what our colleague surgeons are seeing today day in and day out uh is is simply unbearable but there is also a silent picking bomb which is the public health which is uh the rising risk of epidemic that is starting to play out in many places with the four out of the five wastewater treatment uh plants in Gaza not operating uh and the waste water flowing into the streets where uh T of of displaced people are living in horrendous conditions uh this is recipe for epidemics uh we hope that there will be enough wisdom to deescalate uh this conflict and to allow um humanitarian activities to take place uh in better conditions that it is the case today where I think our colleagues from the icrc our colleagues from the palestin resquest society and many other organizations present in Gaza are are able only to do a fraction what is uh of what is needed and this is why it is absolutely critical to reiterate uh the need to have sustained humanitarian Aid getting into the Gaza Strip to to also get enough regular predictable humanitarian poses to allow first people to get access to services and humanitarians to be able to carry out their work Mr mardini just briefly one more question for you you are the director general of the International Committee of the Red Cross you have lived through many a humanitarian crisis have you ever experienced or seen a situation like this in Gaza I've been indeed many times in Gaza whether during um previous rounds of escalations or in the immediate aftermath uh and I think from what I hear from my colleague today on the ground what we bear witness to uh is uh not comparable by any stretch of the IM in ination the level of Despair the level of uh anger the level of frustration of human suffering uh is reaching U alarming levels and I think this should be a moment for the inter International Community to to get its act together and to ensure that uh a space for Humanity is carved out in the middle of this Mayhem Robert mardini director general of the international Committee of the Red Cross thank thank you for your time
