we can now report that uh Israeli hostages in Gaza have been transferred to the Red Cross and are currently on their way to the border crossing with Egypt the Rafa border crossing this is coming from reuter's news agency which is citing Israeli TV channel so I'll repeat that Israeli captives in Gaza have been transferred to the Red Cross and they're currently as we speak on Egypt so this is in line with how the deal was supposed to work 13 Israeli captives that have been held in Gaza by Hamas uh since October the 7th were scheduled to be released sometime after 4 p.m. it's currently 4:30 and the Red Cross was expected to be was meant to be facilitating this get them out of Gaza through the Rafa border crossing that's the border with Egypt where Israeli helicopters have been standing by waiting for them Israeli TV channels now reporting that that is currently underway let me bring in Daniel Levy uh Daniel is the president of the US Middle East project and a former Israeli negotiator you're joining us from London as a former negotiator you just heard what I said in this latest reporting this is coming from Israeli TV channels what's your reaction I've not done hostage negotiations just just to caveat that sirel well look we can only feel Joy that not only on the human level these people these Israelis the 13 in this first Bunch it seems some ties today as well uh will be getting out on the human level that Gaza is not subject to bombardment we will not see the devastation of the last weeks at least for four days we must not return to it maybe we'll come back to that Palestinians who have been held in Israeli prisons will be reunited with their family so that's that's all on the human level slightly different level we are now apparently already in the proof of concept that you can have a negotiated release you can have a sensation of hostilities that the Cy mediation has been successful that the pressure exerted by the families inside Israel on their own political leadership who were extremely reluctant to go down this path has paid off so there's a lot of and it's going to be fraught it's going to be tense there are things that could still go wrong but we have a crucial first step in a proof of concept which offers us a way out of the hellscape of the last weeks but we're a long way from achieving all of that Daniel just let me remind our viewers of what they're seeing on their screen right now you've got the center of your screen and in the top right center of your screen is the Rafa border crossing that is where the Israeli captives are now being brought whether we might end up seeing this on this live shot I I really can't tell you um and the top right corner of your screen is the ofer security facility um also a life shot that's in the occupied West Bank and that is where we are expecting P 39 Palestinian prisoners to be at some point today released um Daniel thanks for your your patience here where do you think this takes us you say we have proof of concept then what then what is the crucial question I don't know if we do get an extension beyond the initial four days there will be efforts to that effect I fear that even if that succeeds it will not give us the permanent cessation of the of this Israeli military campaign of this bombardment of the for 14 a half thousand deaths 6,000 children I fear we won't get that unless unless at least two or three things happen the pressure inside Israel with this new Dynamic seeing the people come out seeing this proof the pressure escalates on the military leadership because the political and Military leadership are saying in Israel that the two go hand in hand only the military campaign got us to this deal we can only get the Israelis out with a tough military campaign that's their narrative I think it's untrue I think this deal was available for a long time it only happened when there was pressure so I think the only way you get the next phase of a next deal for a release is if there's that internal dynamic in Israel which becomes even more ramped up secondly we need the external pressure what we're reading and hearing and I'm hearing in conversations at the moment is America is not pushing Israel for an overall ceasefire that the president and his team are asking the Israelis to carry out the next phase of the war in a more surgical way that sounds like a rash Act of irresponsibility of complicity because as we've all been looking at this you have a much larger Palestinian population civilian population crammed into a much smaller area in the South that's where the Israelis will go to next if they carry on the military campaign which they intend to and that will lead to even more loss Devastation destruction so we have to try and avoid that I don't think the Americans are there yet and unless they put pressure I worry that we're not seeing the end of the horrible images but the pressure may increase also just because Western media who haven't been in Gaza may go in there more they may get more of an accurate picture of what has actually been done so we're going to have to have this inside outside push well to be clear for the moment the ceasefire deal does not include any provisions for any other media to go inside Gaza I hear what you're saying but that question was asked directly of the uh spokesperson for the qari foreign Ministry he said for the moment no there's no provision to allow more journalists into Gaza um and if you're Israel you can understand exactly why they're preventing that by the way and I think they're also going to try and keep a lid on the stories I don't think it's going to be that easy a lid on the stories that you know these people are going to come out let's see how they are they be reunited with their families but at some stage we're going to hear how are they and again that could be proof of concept that the Israelis can come out alive in relatively good condition and that will induce I hope more pressure Daniel thank you very much for that snap analysis as we have just found out and hearing the reporting from Israeli TV channels that the Israeli uh captives are on their way out of Gaza as we speak leave you there thank you very much
