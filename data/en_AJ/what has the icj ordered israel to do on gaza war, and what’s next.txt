now Laura alono is a palestinian-american international lawyer who co-hosts the weekly podcast the Palestine pod and she joins us live from Paris a very warm welcome to you I'm sure you have been listening into to some of the comments that have been made there at the UN Security Council what do you make of the international reaction to the icj ruling so far because there seems to be some extremely big IR reconcilable differences of opinion between the US on other and others of whether it actually calls for an immediate to the funds thank you for having me so Israel and the US have been engaged now for several days in a media frenzy trying to spin doctor the icj order uh into some sort of a win for Israel and also take the attention of the order um uh off of the order by distracting with other stories like um attempting to justify um The Cutting of funding for unwa but um I think we have to be very clear that the Court's uh failure perhaps to include and express order um requiring Israel to Halt its military assault does not make this a win for Israel um the court rejected every single one of Israel's legal arguments and they ordered a number of provisional measures including requiring Israel to ensure that its military with immediate effect ceases killing and wounding Palestinians and imposing on them conditions of Life designed to bring about their destruction in whole or in part and a as was just mentioned many legal Scholars and experts South Africa's foreign minister as well has said this um that it would essentially be impossible for Israel if it were actually to try to respect the order to do so without halting its military operations in uh and on Gaza there's simply no way that you can provide Aid to all of gaza's 2.3 million people without ceasing um the the bombardment they simp simply no way that you can stop killing and wounding Palestinians without ceasing the bombardment now of course whether Israel actually wants to um follow the order is a different question and what we've seen in the last few days is that it simply has no interest in abiding by the the order yeah exactly what Riyad Manor the Palestinian ambassador to the UN suggested by saying that Israel defies international law is in in his words open War Israel is an open war with the United Nations what does that say about the effectiveness of any kind of ruling by the icj or indeed possibly by the international criminal court going forward well I think we have to remind the viewers that you know the order itself is incapable of making a difference merely by its being rendered um so um you know we have to keep in mind that the onus will always remain on people to organize to mobilize to build power um in order to oblige Israel to comply with its International obligations and to essentially use what we have now in the form of the icj order um as a tool in order to push forward the global movement calling for an immediate permanent ceasefire and eventually um an end to Israel's Siege of Gaza an end to the occupation of Gaza and the West Bank um and a dismantlement of the settler Colonial apartheid regime Lara alono we have to leave it there I'm afraid but many thanks for sharing your thoughts and
