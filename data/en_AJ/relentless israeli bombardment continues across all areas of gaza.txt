well there's been Relentless shelling across Gaza with four people killed in the ALU refugee camp and three also killed in a strike on the alaraj school that school has been housing displaced Palestinians in Gaza City Southern areas have also been targeted 12 people killed in Rafa another seven people have died in Kan Yunis near the NASA Hospital there let's speak to hanim mahmuda correspondent who live for us from Rafa in southern Gaza H we've been reporting dozens more killed overnight talk us through where the these strikes have been focusing the most yes well within the past hour or so many reports are emerging from Gaza as the there seems to be a surge in the artillery shelling and the air strikes on Gaza right now and it's continuing while there are a a a redeployment of the Israeli military in the northern part of the G namely we're talking about the eastern part of B hanon city as well as b l and pushing deeper in the vicinity of jabalia town uh right now as we we speak but there was a an air strike on a evacuation Center at the durj neighborhood the dur neighborhood is at the Eastern side of Gaza City and very close to a t neighborhood these are the Eastern uh neighborhoods of Gaza City there was also another air strikes on a residential homes in one of the major roads that are connecting the northern Gaza City with its Southern neighborhoods and better known as a nafak road and a residential home belongs to one of the families there that was Sheltering along with their relatives and in-laws inside the building that was targeted by a massive air strike there report about four people have been killed now the the concern is uh of of people who are still under the rebels we're talking about an area that has been largely destroyed there are no civil defense crew on the ground uh there are no hospitals functioning whatsoever so any injury or anyone reported killed the likelihood of be of of of getting them from under the rubbles or staying uh there in that targeted area is very very high given that there are no uh help available whatsoever in overnight air strikes here in RAF about 12 people were killed in a resid IAL home and the sad part about this is this family is internally displaced family coming all the way from the northern part all the way to the central area kanun ended up in RAF City within the past two weeks as area bombardment became more intense than kanun they ended up in RAF City in the northern part in Mirage area in a residential home it was targeted the 12 people five of them belong to one family we talk about father mother and their children were killed in in that air strike in Khan Unice once again not the first time air strikes targeting in discriminately residential homes the Israel military say in a statement it was targeted infrastructure but as of early hours of this morning we're seeing more of the residential homes that were that housed many internally displaced Palestinians many civilians many women and children are dying honey can you describe the the situation there for us on the ground we've heard from so many Aid agencies too that that the level of hunger is profound yes indeed and as of now there are more concerning and devastating reports of people are are for real hungry they they lack Food Supplies and water supply most of the water supply uh available in the northern part and and Gaza is contaminated which increases uh the level and the risk of of con Contracting infectious diseases among vulnerable groups children and women and those with critical health conditions or chronic uh diseases but as of a a famine the the reports about a the threat and a warning by a topu official about famine is is imminent in the northern part we actually started to see that happening in the northern part and and Gaza City we're talking about an area that has been largely destroyed all infrastructure all hygiene facilities as well as a more than 60% of its residential homes are destroyed what people end up doing are are concentrated in the remaining uh buildings that have not been bombed or they are they have been uh severely damaged but the still they can stay in them and evacuation centers we're talking about a honorous school United Nations for Palestinian refugees designated its schools and education centers and turned them into evacuation centers for internally displaced Palestinians but the fact that you have overcrowded areas like these evacuation centers or remaining residential homes with severe shortage of resources is just an indication of how hungry people feel they are hungry now they're largely unsafe and we've seen within the past two days that couple of trucks were on their way on Gaza on the coasta road and people storm these trucks not because they want to steal it but because they were really hungry and they want something to keep them alive in that in that area that experience hard living conditions H Mahmud there for us with the latest from Rafa and Southern Gaza thank you honey
