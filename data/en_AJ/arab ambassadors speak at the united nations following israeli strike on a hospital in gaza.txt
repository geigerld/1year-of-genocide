to the United Nations let's listen in we are all United in the United Nations and we stand by them by them we as Arab group as you see all of us United outraged by this massacre that has taken place committed by the Israeli forces against the hospital the Lutheran Hospital in uh the Gaza Strip in which according to the initial figures about 500 civilians have been torn apart and massacred in this outrageous illegal crime committed by the Israeli forces against our people in the Gaza Strip we condemn this uh action in the strongest possible terms and we hold Israel responsible for this massacre this crime and those responsible for this crime should face Justice and should face accountability and should be you know a punishment uh uh rising to the level of this crime committed against our people to be faced by them we as an Arab group demand immediately a ceasefire because the continuation of the war it means killing more Palestinians every moment had the security Council shouldered its responsib responsibility yesterday and stopped the fighting yesterday stopped the war the aggression the crime against our people yesterday then we would have been able to have those those 500 killed still alive and with us so the security Council has to wake up and we will not relent nor spare any effort that will uh stop us from going after the security Council and all component of the UN including the Secretary General not only to condemn this crime and they should but also to have an immediate ceasefire to save lives to save lives of Palestinians and to save lives across the board uh this is what we wanted to convey to you and I express my gratitude and thanks to my brothers the ambassadors of the Arab countries and maybe we have others who might be watching us and expressing solidarity with us other ambassadors we thank them for this effort we have to create a massive outrage in the United Nations against those criminals who have committed this massacre today against uh injured uh uh and sick individuals in that hospital that led to massacring them in that heinous crime and we should go after those from the Israeli side who committed this crime to face the justice and accountability and that they should pay the price for such crimes this is what we want to convey to you I think that my colleagues maybe they want to say anything the floor is open for them and their questions establish an international investigation committee and will you work on opening the border crossing do you have any other options than the security Council we will not spare the security Council they should shoulder their responsibility because they are responsible for the security it is a war that is threatening peace and Security in the Middle East and maybe in the world the security Council should not stay or remain silent they should shoulder their responsibility the ambassador of Russia have asked for an open session within the United Nations so that everyone in the security Council and all the others who will be able to speak to voice their condemnations against this massacre and the security Council should shoulder its responsibility and stop the aggression against the Palestinian people the Israeli Prime Minister today said and I quote the intelligence from multiple sources said that it's the Islamic Jihad is responsible for the failed rocket launch your your response he is a liar his uh spokesperson in digital spokesperson tweeted that Israel did the hit thinking that there is around this Hospital a base for Hamas and then he deleted that tweet we have a copy of that tweet and talal can share with you that Tweet now they change the story to try to blame the Palestinians it is a lie and they the Israeli spokesperson of the army about a week ago made a statement in which he said Evacuate the hospitals the hospitals are Target and in fact they hit one Hospital a week ago so they their intentions is evacuate or hospitals will be hit and they are responsible for that crime and they cannot fabricate stories to deal with it Ambassador Ambassador I'll ask I'll ask you English I'll ask you in English for the benefit of all of us uh now uh Abu Mazin has cancelled his participation in The Summit in Jordan and returned back to ramala uh just minutes ago uh the forign minister of and Deputy Prime Minister of Jordan uh has announced the cancellation of the full Summit uh uh your reaction to the cancellation of the four uh four parts uh Summit in Jordan and by the way uh the concerning the bombing of the hospital Israel has warned all the hospitals in the area last week that they will bomb them if they don't evacuate and many managers of these hospitals have already told the Israelis they have about 600 people in intensive care and they can't move them they have no fuel to move them even uh so uh and they hit the same Hospital a small hit last week right so so to say today that it's and and the confession of of Han naftali who's a digital spokesman of Netanyahu on Twitter that they hit it because they thought it was a base for Hamas and then he deleted it after the cooking of the story of hasbalah Rocket all this really point out to the guilt why do you delete a a a a a a tweet confessing to the bombing of the hospital if if if if if islami did that so uh we we we'd like to have you really your comments on the cancellation of the foresight Summit in Amman and the fabrication story you're correct I have nothing to add to it on uh the uh cancellation of uh uh the summit first of all president Abbas uh said that he cannot attend and he uh went back to ramala and I expect him that he is speaking to uh uh giving a national speech as we speak now it might be in your uh uh you know uh in your outfit you know Al Arabia and Al jazer and all of them he is talking to the Palestinian people and to everyone as we speak I believe and he asked for a meeting for the Palestinian leadership so that's what he did I understand that our Egyptian Brothers canceled the hotels of their this today after this massacre therefore they canceled the participation but I think my brother will speak to that yes and then of course our Jordanian Brothers said that it can we cannot have a summit uh with these conditions we don't know what the other President Biden is still going there or not but he canceled President Biden too okay so that because the only thing that would make sense if he made ceasefire immediately and I'm coming to imple to force the implementation of ceasefire I don't know what he said but the summit has been cancelled but my brothers from Jordan and Egypt can say yes in a minute please just you know that horrible uh uh crime and attack against the hospital uh in in Gaza earlier today is a stark reminder of everyone that what what we have been warning against to happen we have been telling everyone that we're we're fearful that violations of international humanitarian law is going to happen we have seen that before and we have warned everyone to uphold uh their responsibilities we have asked the security Council to uphold its responsibilities uh uh uh the permanent members have a specific especially those who have special ties here or there there there should no there should be no conditional uh support ever we we're asking everyone for for having a ceasefire immediately and so on and uh uh speaking now to the issue of of the summit Cairo is hosting the summit as scheduled we're speaking about the Cairo Summit next Saturday where parties in the region uh permanent uh uh P5 are are invited and are gathered the Secretary General has confirmed his participation with the view to seek uh uh to address the humanitarian aspect of the outgoing war and how to to to uh put it to a ceasefire and as well a very serious attempt to have a political Horizon to address the fundamentals of the whole issue this is what I wanted to say and of course I add my voice to to Ambassador Riyad Mansour in the issue of the accountability there is there is no party above international law no party ever would be as much as the Arab ministers did condemn uh uh uh attacks on on civilians the same applies Whoever has perpetrated that that horrible crime of today should be hold accountable and and we we work to that end and we're we we're hopeful that the council will be up to the responsibility concerning The Summit in Egypt can there be uh uh continuous um uh humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians in Gaza without a full and and permanent and durable ceasefire we're we're we're we're engaging on on extensive talks trying to to reach a modality whereby humanitarian access and and humanitarian corridors will be be secured with having sufficient space of course for humanitarian ceasefire no no humanitarian access would happen but that is linked to to some other issues that has to do with with uh uh the hostages and and and so on and those aspects that has to do with foreigners in Gaza but we're working around the clock and Egypt is taking that responsibility very seriously and we're hopeful we continue to hope that this would happen soon thank you very uh thank you colleagues for for coming uh as a chair of the Arab group for this month I would to like to reflect the common Arab position that we are uh condemning this massacre that took place against innocent civilians the figures now are talking about 8 to 900 civilians uh sick and wounded the medical facil facility the medical personnel all perished in this hyen attack perpetrated by Israel uh we call on the security Council to assume its responsibility and call for a ceasefire unconditional ceasefire we also would like to see those who have committed such a crime uh under international law such a heinous crime to be brought to justice for de decades and decades Israel has and it's uh the perpetrators of the is in the Israeli military and political leadership who committed these actions were enjoyed impunity not a single one faced Justice this has to change and this is our common position as an Arab group we think it is very important that we concentrate the security Council concentrate on ceasefire and to allow humanitarian medical access into Gaza and also at the same time stop any Mass transfer of the population which is one of the intent of those who perpetrated it is to induce this mass movement you heard all of you have heard the Israeli officials in the past few days and past week who called on people to move to the South and that the facilities the medical facilities have to be evacuated waited this is a message and it's not the first time that Israel resorts to this kind of message to induce the mass displacement of population it happened again and again and again and it will continue to happen if the International Community does not stop it importance of accountability what's the importance of the Arab unity and have one stance and one position to uh ask demand ceasefire and stop the aggression is there any possibility to have an action or a one United Arab position to for accountability regarding accountability as Palestine State and as well other Arab countries we were able after many efforts to start investigations in those crimes that have been committed against the Palestinians by Israel including the ongoing War crime which is the occupation as well as the crime of Israel perpetrated several crimes against Palestinians now the crime is bigger and the scope is bigger as we've seen today in the massacre of the hospital so what is required now is to be to pressure the ICC so that they can expedite the investigations that are still ongoing there is another side which is the violation of international law and all the related details that are that were raised by during questions asked by the International crime court and many Arab countries have presented several reports and we are now finalizing the second re we are finalizing the reports that will be sent to the international court and this will be finalized within a week after that we will wait from the international Court to set up the time and the date so this mechanism is ongoing and we would like to expedite the process and we want a larger participation from all the Arab countries and our brothers especially when the second round will start when the court will announce the dates and who can participate as actually has the Arab Arab this question for the Arab group the United States is the only country that was the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations again demanding for a ceasefire so far on day 12 of this war those pleas have been ignored they condemned the attack
