but Biden's decision to stop sending bombs and artillery shells to Israel if it invades Rafa had set off a political firestorm in Washington uh Patty K standing by as you can see joins us now from the Washington Capital sorry from the US capital of Washington uh so Patty the Israeli Prime Minister saying that Israel will stand alone if it has to how's that all going down in the United States well it depends on what your what Your political party you belong to quite frankly and you know this is been going on for months we do know that the B Administration is triying to pressure Israel on reducing casualties try to Red try to get more Aid in but they never admitted it publicly they never talked about what the consequences were going to be well that changed recently and you saw President Joe Biden come out and say look if they do this large scale Invasion no bombs no artillery shells perhaps no none of the Technologies needed that turns uh dumb bombs into smart bombs uh and he's not just saying that that's going to happen showing that it's already sort of happening we do know that from the Pentagon briefing today that there was a shipment of bombs uh 1800 2,000 pound bombs those are the ones that cause a lot of Destruction and 1700 500 PB bombs those are supposed to be shipped to Israel and that's been delayed so sending a message of what's going to happen telling them this is already not happening and at the same time one of the more significant things is we for the very first time heard US President Joe Biden say specifically Al American bombs have killed innocent civilians in Gaza and they are again sending the message with the briefings throughout the capital today that there is simply another way they have talked I think quite openly about conducting a major military operation uh in Rafa we are opposed to that but we'll see what happens we have made quite clear we don't want to see it happen we continue and and I should say we do continue to engage with them about other options that they can pursue we have presented uh a full range of other policy choices that they can make uh that we think would achieve the goal of dismantling Hamas and choking off the Hamas battalions that remain uh in Rafa without um without further endangering civilians there and without causing this mass population displacement with no place for them to go all right Patty so what about Capitol Hill what are they saying there oh they've had so much to say so many tweets or whatever you call them now on x uh so many press conferences so many press releases so from the Republicans you are seeing a tremendous amount of anger at first the Speaker of the House Mike Johnson tried to dismiss it said Biden was maybe having a senior moment because he said he would be blindsided if that is in fact the policy because remember Congress just passed tens of billions of dollars to go to Israel for weapons and for humanitarian Aid and so we've seen Republicans in the house they some are saying that they're going to start crafting articles of impeachment we saw a US senator Republican say that Biden needs to be impeached that seems highly unlikely that not sending Aid to Israel would reach the level of high crimes and misdemeanors some Democrats are also saying that they're concerned by this move but you're seeing the progressives in the Democratic party really applauding it saying this is a necessary First Step they want him to do more uh because this has become a real political reliability with the president in his quest to get a second term among Democrats especially young Democrats you've seen what's happening on college campuses all over this country so a lot of Anger from some on Capitol Hill that said there's not much they can do about it under the Constitution Congress is the power of the per strings they said give Israel this money it's the Secretary of State decides if uh they need to give them that money and it really is up to the president so he has the authority throughout history to Simply say no you're not getting these weapons and there's pretty much nothing congress can do about it all right Patty thanks for that Patty Gohan there in Washington DC protests and solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza are continuing in US college campuses students at John's Hopkins University in Baltimore have defied orders to end their demonstration hundreds of protesters have set up camp by pitching tents on the campus they've been there since last week College authorities had asked students to leave by the end of Wednesday the students have set up the encampment in front of the the John's Hopkins Library this aart called the beach Alan fiser was there the protest started here last Monday inspired by other protests that they'd seen around the United States John's Hopkins University is one of the most famous in America it is a very prestigious medical school and many of the people here have been saying how they feel really sorry for the doctors in Gaza who they're fighting against almost impossible odds to try and treat their patients now this is one of the most famous views of the University looking back towards the library and as you can see the yard here is covered with tents and in fact over the last few days the number of tents has increased the number of people protesting here has increased and it's not just students it's people from the local community as well now they've made demands to the university including a disinvestment from any connections they have with Israel and also making sure that the university Cuts its military ties as well uh they say that is helping to fuel the Israeli War Machine in Gaza now the university has asked people to leave the yard and said that if they don't then there could be consequences it could impact their permanent record it could impact the possibility of graduation and many people will be graduating from this University in the next few weeks or so but as you can see even though a deadline to move has come and gone people are still here now it's unlikely that the police will move in because the mayor has said as long long as this protest remains peaceful there is nothing for them to do because the people here are simply exercising their first amendment the right of freedom of speech and not breaking the law so for the time being this encampment stays Alan fiser aler in Baltimore make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
