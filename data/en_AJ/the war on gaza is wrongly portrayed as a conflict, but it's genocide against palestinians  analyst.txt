well for more on this let's bring in Abdullah alaran his associate professor of history at Georgetown University here in qat and a specialist on history of the US policy towards the Middle East thanks again for being with us first of all what do why do you think that we haven't seen another ceasefire deal what does it come down to essentially yeah I mean it's it's an excellent question because I do think that we've been having the same discussion for months now about you know the failure to reach this agreement we know what the parameters would look like we know exactly what the outcome is supposed to be uh the problem I think is that we we have this false framing of this being a a conflict between two equal Waring parties and in fact what we're really witnessing is a genocide being committed by one side against a defenseless essentially besieged population and historically we've never seen genocides come through these kinds of negotiated settlements what really needs to be there is a political will from International actors that would essentially stop Israel from what it's doing and we haven't seen that the United States continues to to say concerned right that speaks in these kind of very vague terms and yet it continues to arm Israel just the same day as this massacre we saw $3.5 billion worth of weapons approved yet again to Israel to be able to continue to commit these crimes just on that I mean we saw uh President Biden the say exactly the same thing that we've heard time and time again we want to bring this war to a close we need a ceasefire deal why don't you think that there is the political will especially from the United States to because like you say they do have the power to get this done if they really really wanted to well I mean it's a it's a complex question because there are domestic political factors of course that this in many ways is an extension of us domestic politics in which of course support for Israel has always proven very beneficial for elected officials um and then of course there's the sense that uh the United States as a whole tends to see itself very much in line with Israel being a regional hedgemon it's of course supported it ever since its foundations has continued to arbit has continued to protect it using its un Security Council veto over many decades and sees it very much as a a strategic asset in the region despite of course all of the horrific crimes that it's committed over over many decades we also heard that in that story there that it's in netanyahu's best interest to prolong this war but surely it would also be a political win if he was able to get uh more of the captives back to Israel like we saw in November well I mean when we actually pull back a bit and and we look at essentially what is the um you know desired outcome of this massive kind of Total War that's being inflicted on Palestinians in Gaza and of course even in the West Bank as well um it is about uh completing a job that has been uh in progress for let's say 76 years going back to the original neba right that this is much more about the mass displacement of millions upon millions of Palestinians this is about the killing of tens of thousands and maming of probably hundreds of thousands more um this is about accomplishing much more broader goals than something like the return of of captives which of course has has been given given very much secondary importance to this uh to this government right now talks are meant to get underway later this week between qat Egypt the US Israel and Hamas in some way shape or form I mean do you hold out any hope that anything positive is going to come out of those um so far it's been unlikely right because the the Israelis of course have uh actually undertaken attacks against the people they're supposed to be negotiating with and of course have have not faced any significant pressure have not faced any real backlash for any of the the um actions that they've taken and so it's unlikely to see any material outcomes from these kinds of negotiations what there really needs to be is external pressure um exerted in a very kind of uh emphatic way more than anything we've seen up to this point thank you as always for coming in and really talking us through these main points it's Abdullah Al Aran thanks so much make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
