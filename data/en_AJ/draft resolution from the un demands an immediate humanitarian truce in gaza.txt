let's bring in Mar Bashar who's our senior political analyst Marin the goings on toing and throwing in New York quite interesting isn't it it was the vote was due to take place this morning New York time then was pushed forward several hours and now it's been brought back again going to take place in less than an hour apparently now unless it changes again what's going on well there's clearly a lot of uh behind the scene pressures uh on the Biden Administration to at least abstain like it did last time uh because the the urgency of the situation is becoming uh untolerable uh as portrayed by the UN Secretary General uh both by calling for the meeting and in his speech the unraveling of genocide in Gaza is becoming truly unbearable and it's exposing uh America's uh lack of credibility on this issue the way it's blindingly following in Israel's footstep without acting like a the super superpower it is in the sense that it does have legal moral strategic diplomatic and other responsibilities it also has responsibility towards the American people I mean let's all remember that uh that some 70% of the American people are not happy with the way Biden is managing the war in Gaza I mean imagine I mean he's he's in an election year he's not not just that the International Community opposes the way America stands alone basically in its blind support of Israel's war crimes in Gaza the American public opinion in its majority does not support Biden's uh blinded support to Israel and the continuation of gor and Gaza so what the International Community is asking what the majority of the general assembly is asking what the what all the Arab and Muslim majority countries are asking what a good number of European countries are asking is for a ceasefire they're not asking for you know end of the occupation as they should right the end of ethnic cleansing the end of um the dispossession of the Palestinians the end of Israel's nuclear uh you know power status they're just asking for Aire after 60 days of non-stop bombardment that's been compared to one the Allies bombings of German cities during Second World War and the German bombings of London cities during World War and those happened over two years now we're talking about two months of comparable bombings of Gaza so what the International Community what apparently the majority of the UN Security Council Members are asking the United States to do is not to move on with Israel to the dark side it's just simply stop the war right it's a US isolated on this I think it's worthwhile listening to the US spokesman again to what he said uh to the UN and then we'll have another child and as of today Hamas continues to pose a threat to Israel and remain in charge of Gaza that is not a threat that any one of our governments would allow to continue to remain on our own borders not after the worst attack on our people in several decades for that reason while the United States strongly supports a durable peace in which both Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace and security we do not support calls for an immediate ceasefire that's Robert Wood and curious because he was talking about our people and our borders and just before that when he talked about you know any member of States would not accept any such threat on our borders but Israel is not dealing with just our borders need dealing with the occupied territories on its borders it's occupied territories for 56 plus years so the people in Gaza are occupied under sieg and most of them are refugees from areas that are today Israel so this is not just the United States dealing with Mexico this is the United this is the United States dealing with I don't know occupied Iraq for example right but this is on its borders and its occupied second thing is when he start confusing our people with their people calling their people our people they just go to tell you that this is a culmination of two months of American officials parting Israeli officials repeating one sound bite after another deceptive sound bites that the Israelis have come up with and Americans blindingly doing that and this is just the deputy Ambassador I what about the American president why has the American president been parting netanyahu's lines and lies everything from the very beginning of the decapitation of babies to to weaponizing the rape of Israeli women to uh you know talking about things like uh uh what is happening in Gaza today is self-defense when we all know that there is no such a right of self-defense in occupied territory so when the American president himself continues to par it non-stop you won't be surprised when you hear the um Deputy Ambassador going like our people their people I'm not sure it's our people their people as if is is the 51st state of the United States how unusual is it in the context of us backing for Israel for this kind of support and backing to go on for so long given the paror state affairs in Gaza right now you know the best example of all examples that have to do with this kind of kind of unconventional war is the 1982 invasion of Lebanon right Reagan was one of the staunchest supporters at least until then among all American presidents he was a stanch supporter of Israel he considered Ed Israel a strategic asset and as Mike Hannah said in one of the packages that it's under him although it's also started under Carter that Israel are getting more than3 billion dollar a year now it's getting $4 billion doar a year in military aid right but Reagan despite his support for Israel considering it a strategic asset when Israel invaded Lebanon started bombing Beirut even not as much as it's bombing Gaza today President Reagan on the phone with prime minister Bean at the time and said you need to stop the Holocaust against beut an American President telling an Israeli Prime Minister you need to stop the Holocaust which was the bombing the continuous bombing in beut which doesn't even compare to the bombing of Gaza today right and seven 6 or seven starting with un Security Council resolution 508 509 I believe 511 512 515 517 the United States either voted for the UN Security Council resolution or abstained and all of these resolutions had to do with stop the fighting Israel needs to withdraw from Lebanon stop the bombing in buut allowing for humanitarian Aid and the collective punishments against Lebanon that was Reagan the most stuned then Israeli American president in support of Israel now we have a genocide unraveling in Gaza it's been 60 days it's been compared to the some of the worst atrocities in modern times in terms of the killing of children the attack on hospitals it's an unraveling genocide right in modern day times in plain sight and the Biden Administration won't get itself not just to not call for a ceasefire a perent ceasefire it won't even say to us whether Israel is or is not today today in violation of international law or not all all right well we'll see what happens with the vote we've got less than an hour to wait in theory it might yet change again but we'll see Mar thanks a lot in the meantime thank you
