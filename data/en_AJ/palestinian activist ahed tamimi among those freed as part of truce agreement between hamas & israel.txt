well as we mentioned earlier The prominent Palestinian activist ahead Tamimi was among the 30 prisoners released on Wednesday the 22-year-old rose to prominence back in 2017 when she she slapped an Israeli soldier who raided her Village in the occupied West Bank at the time she was sentenced to 8 months in prison Tamimi was arrested again earlier this month on suspicion of inciting violence let's speak now to Dena to kri she is from Al jazer plus she's written a book with Ahad Tamimi called they called me a lioness a Palestinian girls fight for Freedom so obviously you know her quite well you've spent uh quite a bit of time with her uh tell us a little bit about uh how she came to such prominence I'm sorry can you repeat the question tell us a bit about why she be she came to such prominence um well I had to grew up in a prominent Palestinian family that was known for non-violent activism she grew up in the West Bank Village of nebis which is right across the street from an illegal Israeli settlement that for years has been illegally confiscating The Village's land and its natural resources so in response in about 2009 um her father and members of The Village decided to wage a nonviolent protest movement where they would just simply try to March down to their natural spring that was um confiscated by the settlers and in response every single week they were met by brutal force by the Israeli military we're talking tear gas opening fire with rubber coated steel bullets skunk water and even live ammunition um from a very young age from her childhood she witnessed her uncle killed before her very eyes her cousin killed before her very eyes her parents shot her parents repeatedly arrested she herself getting um injured and then eventually it culminated into that iconic moment in7 in 2017 at 16 years old when she was arrested for the first time so at that time she spent eight months in prison I believe uh do we know much about her experience in prison um during the first time yes it's very well documented in the book that we wrote together in her Memoir um the conditions in prison were difficult then and if they were bad then they were extremely um unbearable now as has been documented even by Amnesty International calling it degrading and um torture in the in the conditions um when she was imprisoned as a 16-year-old she spent 8 months there as you mentioned she was able to in defiance of the Israeli uh you know jailers was able to complete her secondary uh education complete her high school behind bars um and really uh there was able to develop more of a political Consciousness she took a class on international law and international humanitarian law and was more clearly able to understand the very many violations that she and the Palestinian people living under occupation have lived um through because of Israel and Dena she was uh Tamimi was arrested again uh earlier this month can you tell us a bit more about the circumstances that she was arrested under she was arrested on November 6th in a nighttime raid as it always is a nighttime raid so just to be clear this is after the war after the October 7th uh events correct uh 10 days prior to her arrest in fact her father Basim Tamimi was arrested while he was on his way trying to make his way to Jordan he has been he is still um being kept in over her prison under administrative detention meaning no charge or trial so she already had her father taken away from her and she was part of this giant wave this bloody crack toown that we have seen in the occupied West Bank of Israel arresting thousands of Palestinians after October 7th it was in under this context that Ahad was arrested uh she was beaten during her arrest as her lawyer La has confirmed um she was beaten after she was being transferred uh to prison and she has she was being kept in Deone prison which is in Israel which again is a violation of international law to transfer Palestinians from the occupied territory outside of the occupied territory like um the many harrowing testimonies that we're hearing from Palestinians who are being released from the prisons um she suffered abuse uh she was never charged they were never able to bring charges against her so last Sunday the military Court moved move to try to keep her under administrative detention which means she could remain she could have remained incarcerated without charge or without trial okay uh Dena many thanks for your time Dena takori from AJ plus talking to us there about the prominent Palestinian activist ahead Tamimi who was among the 30 prisoners released on Wednesday night
