hezbollah's leader Hassan Nala has called Tuesday's assassination of a senior Hamas official flagrant Israeli aggression on Beirut Salah Al aruri was killed in a drone strike in the Lebanese Capital along with six other Hamas members Israel has not acknowledged responsibility for the strike but says all Hamas leaders are targets following the October 7th attack theala also offered his condolences to Hamas following the killing of Salah alri we offer our congratulations and condolences in our brother the great Commander Deputy head of the Hamas movement political Bureau as well as his companions the kadr and the commanders of Hamas who fell as Mur yesterday as a result of a blatant Israeli aggression against Beirut Southern suburb on the same night where where andj AB also fell as martys I offer my condolences to my brother is and to all of our companions in the Hamas leadership the Alam leadership and Palestinian resistance factions as well as the Palestinian people I offer my condolences to Noble family and to the noble families of all the Martyr who were with him and fell with him I offer to them my condolences and my congratulations and may God grant them patience and fortitude and they have shown that Let's cross over to Z our correspondent in Beirut who is also listening in to Hassan Nala's speech one minute 20 1 hour 20 um a minute speech and address address many issues uh that pertain to hezb itself but it was really at the end of uh his presentation that he really sort of talked about uh the situation uh in Gaza as well as the attack uh in Beirut that has riled Hezbollah and basically allowed him to quite clearly say that Hezbollah will retaliate on this attack on Beirut well yes he said that this crime will not go unpunished the assassination of hamas's second in command Salah aruri who was killed in hezbollah's stronghold but at the same time it was a very delicate balancing act that Hassan nasah first of all he talked about the front in southern Lebanon Hezbollah is engaged in a low intensity conflict with the Israeli Army along that border he is saying that it will continue both sides really have been uh calculating their attacks ensuring that it doesn't become or trigger a full-blown conflict he's saying that that that will continue but at the same time he's saying that that doesn't mean Hezbollah is not ready for war and that Israel if Israel decides to launch a full-scale offensive Hezbollah will fight back with its full military capabilities and threatening the Israelis that it they will pay a a heavy price but Hezbollah nalah also kept talking about strategic national uh considerations that each of the so-called resistance groups in this AIS of resistance across the region have to take into account and in Lebanon Hassan Nala knows that Israel can destroy this country Israeli ministers have said that they will level Beirut that they will level the southern suburbs of beu where half a million people live yes it's known as a Hezbollah stronghold where Hezbollah has bases and offices but it is also a residential neighborhood where half a million people live where will these people go so in many ways his hands are tied but at the same time uh reiterating that Hezbollah is not afraid of war and that if it if it comes to that it is ready to wage a confrontation Zena Hass nasala may not be afraid of War but Lebanon might be as a as a country I mean what has the government said if anything at all they've remained pre-s silent so far well the Lebanese prime minister has been holding contacts with the Western governments the United States France envoys have been uh visiting Beirut shuttling between Israel and Lebanon to try to diffuse tensions but at the end of the day Hezbollah is stronger than the state hezbollah's Army is stronger than the Lebanese Army Hezbollah takes decisions on its own and it has gained opponents and in this country who say that it is not up to the group to decide whether whether or not you know Lebanon will be dragged into war so a lot of people will be in Lebanon will be relieved that at least on hezbollah's part there is no intention uh to trigger a wider conflict or expand the conflict that is now confined and contained to the Border area but at the same time many people here feel that Israel is trying to drag Hezbollah to war and it is something that nasala was boasting about that Israel was not able to restore security and this is you know a major blow to the Israelis if you think about it tens of thousands of Israelis cannot return to their homes in Northern Israel or in southern Israel so he said that that that is one of the achievements that the group has achieved um you know since engaging in Conflict to try to help relieve its Ally Hamas in Gaza so Hezbollah promising a response it didn't give any further details but also uh we assure assuring in one way or the other that for the time being the actions and the military operations in the South will remain calculated unless Israel changes the situation Zen there for in Barett thanks very much for the update there Z Let's cross over to Tel Aviv now as SRA kyat is also standing by and SRA I have to say I can't believe that uh Israeli officials weren't watching that Nala speech they would have been watching with great detail I'm sure they were watching it with great detail we haven't had reaction but in the same way we didn't actually hear any claims official claims from them for carrying out that assassination onuri in Lebanon yesterday um now what we do know is that uh interestingly uh the Israeli Army Chief has been visiting those Northern commands on that border with Lebanon and saying that that they are on high alert we've known that uh since overnight when we also heard it from the military spokesman Daniel hagari saying that they are ready for any possible scenario how this will be taken here it's yet to be seen however uh what we do know is that Israel has said time and time again that that all of those Hamas leaders uh will be killed they'll go after them no matter where they are not just in the Gaza Strip but any other country as well they said that it's not just a case of getting rid of Hamas in the Gaza Strip not just militarily but also politically they want Hamas to not exist and that it wouldn't be able to function ever again or to ever carry out such an attack and of course they're keeping their eyes very closely on Hezbollah because Hezbollah the Iranian B group has been launching attacks every single day since this War Began on those Northern borders towns all along from West all the way to the east uh and said that they will continue to do so as long as the war in Gaza continues Sara in terms of your analysis about the troop movements in and out of Gaza the reservist being rested before they are redeployed is there going to be a recalibration do you think now by the Israeli government as to how many Gob back potentially into Gaza and how many might be redeployed North I mean it it's now a case of a a very serious conversation most probably within the war cabinet about where they deploy their strength well a discussion that was meant to be held yesterday as to what happens what they call the day after the war in Gaza was actually postponed as the news uh came out about uh salahi um now we know that's been postponed supposedly until Thursday again it was already postponed from last week after some of those in the ministry were up in arms about not being included in that discussion but away from that the redeployment of troops them coming out they were the reasons given was because of fatigue needing to give some of them rest it doesn't necessarily mean that that's because they're redeploying them to the north uh prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu a few days ago in his statement uh sent out a stark warning to Iran and to the Iranian back group groups including hisbah as well as other countries saying that they will ensure if they have to fight back militarily they will and that if diplomatic efforts don't work they will consider that tens of thousands of those troops have been lining that border for weeks uh they are also have been training in a situation where an attack could happen now hasbalah we know that they've been carrying out those attacks every single day whether they will step that up here we don't know but it could potentially not necessarily be be on a full scale uh War but it could be potentially taken out uh in attacks elsewhere not just in Israel but in other countries have we as we have seen uh previously in the past saky there for us in Tel Aviv thank you
