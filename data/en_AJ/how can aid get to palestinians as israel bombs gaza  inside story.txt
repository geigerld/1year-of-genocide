hundreds more killed in Gaza since Friday's un Security Council vote for more Aid what practical impact will the resolution have and how can Aid get to 2.3 million people living under constant attack among destroyed infrastructure in a live Battle Zone this is Inside hello and welcome to the program I'm D abuga celebrations among diplomats and officials after the United Nations security Council on Friday finally passed a motion to allow more Aid into Gaza but that mood wasn't shared in the strip Israel's attacks have continued raining down Western supplied bombs on an area where many of it's two 2.3 million people don't have the food or water they need to survive the war pursued by Israel's far-right government has killed more than 20,000 Palestinians in just over two months more than 50,000 have been maned or injured and nearly all gaza's population has been forced to move so what does the UN resolution for more aid mean in reality and what is the reality of those in Gaza today both its people and those trying to help them we'll be asking our guests this and more in a few moments but first this report from Kum [Music] Sharif staff at this charity organization know meals they are preparing won't be enough to feed all people queuing up here in Rafa a city in southern Gaza tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians depend on food handouts they wait for hours to get a single meal to lovech the day honestly people's situation is very very difficult we are heading towards a very severe famine may God protect us so that people do not die of hunger but not everyone is lucky in a city housing most of gaza's 1.9 million displaced people food water and shelter are hard to come by Israel's continuous air strikes and its expanding ground operations have isolated the strip and stopped its businesses stores have no stocks and people have neither work nor money to buy basic Goods they depend on humanitarian aid but only a trickle is getting in we stand in a long queue for about 2 hours or an hour and sometimes we don't get any food and sometimes we do the chaty says it's feeding about 10,000 people each day but stocks are running out we suffer from food shortages there is no food lentil are out of stock as well as peas beans and Bulger wheat all the foods have run out at the market people need food water medicine but none is available everything is cut off perhaps today is the last day we can provide food for the people un agencies are warning of a risk of widespread famine more than half a million Palestinians a quarter of gaza's population face what experts classify as catastrophic levels of hunger we are fed up this is not alive I swear such a war has never happened before now there is real hunger my children are dying of hunger Aid coming from Rafa at the border with Egypt is subject to Israeli inspection another crossing point with Israel has just been approved whatever can enter Gaza is restricted by Israel with deliver held up by border checks Israeli bombardment has destroyed much of its infrastructure making the delivery of Aid a logistical nightmare the UN Secretary General blames Israel's Relentless bombing for preventing humanitarian aid from entering the besieged strip the real problem is that the way Israel is conducting this offensive is creating massive obstacles to the distribution of humanitarian Aid inside Gaza I urge the Israeli authorities to lift restrictions on Commercial activity immediately in Gaza people in hospitals witness some of the most desperate scenes most are barely operating with no fuel power medicine and even doctors as Israel continues its attacks on medical facilities across the territory exensions a un Security Council resolution passed on Friday is meant to scale up the delivery of Aid relief for diplomats and officials in New York with the coming weeks will tell whether it brings any respite for Palestinians ulsum Sharif for Inside Story okay let's now bring in our guests joining us from Khan yunes in Gaza is the resident Mansour Shan from Hamman we have Ahmed bam who's the regional media and Communications adviser at the Norwegian Refugee Council joining us from Vienna is Le attenberg who's a senior adviser with the Arab Renaissance for democracy and development and he was also the former Chief of Ethics at unwa thank you for joining us thanks for your time Mansour um from Gaza since the resolution which calls on parties to the conflict to allow and facilitate the flow of humanitarian Aid to Gaza through land sea and air routes tell us what you're seeing on the ground has there been a scaleup of humanitarian Aid hello everyone um thank you for having me I think it's too early to tell um let's uh let's observe what happens here inside the strip over the next three to four days to see what kind of um impact that resolution had on the ground here um currently uh the issue is that there's a lack of security there's a lack of safety in all of Raza strip uh I'm currently here in Nas hospital I've been here for the last 70 days uh together with 30,000 other refugees in one medical complex and until now I have only seen come to NAS Hospital which is the biggest operating hospital here in after the destruction of asifa around 28 trucks and one fuel truck that's it so uh I think that we need um much much more when it comes to providing AIDS and providing repealed hospitals and fuel supplies in in order to ensure that the lives of 2.3 million Palestinian civilians continue to be sustainable mansur I hear what you're saying about observing over the next few days the impact that that resolution may or may not have but one of the points mentioned in it was the opening of kamam Abu Salam that border crossing that is crucial are you hearing at all whether that border crossing has been opened I haven't seen any any information on that personally it might have been however what we did hear about was two days ago the IDF um uh hit with an air strike three of the people or four of the people which are trying to operate Abu and killed all killed all four um uh I I honestly don't have any information on that right now okay we will be following up on that uh in the next few days but just one more with you man before I bring in my other guests um look the Israeli ambassador to the UN has said that this resolution is unnecessary and it's disconnected from reality and according to him Israel is already allowing Aid deliveries at the required scale now clearly what you're saying is that's not what's happening in Gaza but tell us how much Aid um is actually entering on a daily basis what do you know about this uh we know that less than 5,000 trucks have entered intoa strip since the start of this conflict so you are talking about over the last 75 days um you know less than less than 70 trucks a day uh normally gazza's trip during non-war times gets at least 500 trucks uh of imports inside uh however this is not when um over 80% of the population is displaced uh thousands injured uh and uh and many in need of urgent medic supplies and uh and fuel supplies in order to ensure that electricity continues to run here um I think it's more of a PR stunt on the behalf of the Israelis what happened earlier on the RAF border even the trucks that came in a lot of them after being searched by the Israelis were emptied we only received two or three pallets of supplies many of the supplies that we received after being Ted by the Israelis had expired food products many of them had things we don't need like masks gloves and L for our dead okay man thank you for the time being Lex tackenberg thanks for your patience let me bring you in here look speaking of f the resolution that was passed at the security Council also States it says rather that states that are not party to the conflict are welcome to permit free passage of humanitarian relief now this particularly refers to Egypt and uh and the RAF border crossing from your experience how does it work on the ra side does everything have to be coordinated with the Israelis absolutely the uh there was quite a discussion in the lead up to the latest resolution uh about handing over uh control over the um passing of eight into Gaza from uh the Egyptian Israeli mechanism to the UN uh with the UN sort of directly having the uh the ability and responsibility to to coordinate the the the importation uh of of g into Gaza but that was one of the reasons why the why the passing of the resolution was delayed so many times and effectively uh under the uh under the resolution uh the uh the current mechanism or whereby Israel maintains full control over what gets into Gaza and at what pace is is kept unchanged from your experience Lex do you think that Israel will will comply with parts of the resolution this whole resolution what do you think I mean the the the resolution is a is a reflection of of the mood of the International Community and so it's one of the factors that that I believe Israel will weigh uh along with uh with pressure from from from the us uh so far we have not we we're 70 uh we we're 11 weeks into the war we have an abandons of Prima fasia evidence of genocide and ethnic cleansing uh from Gaza and increasingly also from the West Bank so far this has not neither uh restrained Israel nor those governments complicit and and enabling it to continue its Onslaught on the on the people in Gaza so things don't look good from that perspective okay let's get the perspective from the Norwegian Refugee Council uh Ahmed bam let's bring you in look even if more Aid does go in I mean unless those trucks and that Aid can actually move about first of all freely and then safely then and we understand from uh Gaza that that's not possible right now so so what is the point of this resolution um it's a step in the right direction however it's nowhere uh near um it doesn't bring us any closer to a ceasefire which is what we all want to see ultimately in the aid Community like you say I have 50 colleagues in in Gaza they have all being pushed into these small pockets in Rafa and we are um of course operating under probably some of the most impossible circumstances even by the standards of of the Gaza conflict even by the standard of of conflict zones we were there in in Syria and Yemen in Iraq even in Gaza during conflicts past conflicts we were always able to move around and provide Aid this time we are grounded this time we have colleagues who have experienced loss in their families how do you expect Aid workers to to move around when you know shelling bombardment tanks are in your neighborhood it's we're asking here The Impossible here evade workers and and we expect them to to to be superhumans they are actually as as we speak they are providing whatever they can the hot meals and the the potable water that they can provide and some protection for for families but you can't do that in in in a in a in a death zone you know in probably the largest open air crater in the world that um you know Israel has reduced Gaza to yeah I mean you're asking the question that I was going to ask you next Ahmed which is how do you actually have meaningful humanitarian assistant when the genocide continues and when the bombs continue to fall yeah and the answer is we're hardly scratching the surface here and to be frank with you um I mean my team are now split between providing some Aid and you know installing tents for their extended families that's the reality of it you have to wake up in the morning and and fend for yourself and for your family my my colleague tells me that you know all children his children had for a full day was was a can of food of dry food or beans um we're asking we're asking the impossible here and I think anything short of a lasting ceasefire anything short of um you know complete lifting of this Siege 16 years on top of that 70 or 80 80 days now of of a total Siege nothing else can can you know can can lead to a solution here and can help aid workers perform their job Mansour the UN Secretary General has said that four out of five of the hungriest people anywhere in the world are now in Gaza I mean that is a shocking shocking statistic give us an idea mansur of tell us what what people have been telling you what what you've been seeing on the ground when it comes to this issue of food and starvation what amount of food Aid is entering right now if any at all yeah I think this is particularly true especially inaz City and the north of STP there is hardly any news coming but whenever we do hear news we hear news of people actually uh going through starvation mode um I was actually sent a video of people trying to make food out of plants uh from their own ground from their own soil they do not have any grains any rice any Wheat and they're trying to look through vegetation on the ground to make any kind of food for themselves there so this is in particular true for R the city and the north especially with the lack of a trucks and and Logistics going to them up there however in the middle region and in the South where I am right now it's a little bit better but like you said every day it's it's it's uh it's like a it's like a 12 to 14 hour um uh mandate you know by the heads of the families the fathers the mothers uh you know they have to go and fence for to have to try to find something to feed their children they have to try to bake bread in some kind of clay stove uh they have to try to get some clean water from any of the filtration units somewhere beside them so um it is it is difficult there is definitely a malnutrition happening here and again we are not seeing at least inun the eight TR coming in maybe it's more in ra because it's close to the Border but not inun however hopefully with this UN resolution a does slowly start tickling in because especially with flu season coming with the winter with the cold people here need to eat well as soon as possible Lex comment on this issue of uh the real lack of food and people starving in Gaza and also the UN has said that the entire population of Gaza faces an imminent risk of famine indeed and and in this respect uh what is called for Beyond a full sensation of hostilities uh a comprehensive ceasefire is also uh beyond the unhindered excess of international uh of of of humanitarian supplies also of international humanitarian workers and international journalist I mean one of the big differences with the previous Wars is that at that time uh International un colleagues were able to stay in the north uh International journalists were there to monitor the situation and to to report in real time on on you know the humanitarian needs and the and the state of the of the assault you know in in all parts of the gasa Street and this is today not not possible and crucially needed so uh this is also a call for for more efforts to get humanitarian International humanitarian Personnel to support their local colleagues I lived in Gaza for a decade and and one important function of of having International staff there was was yet to provide support and protection to our to our courageous bisan colleagues um Ahmed organizations like the like Oxfam has warned that starvation is being used as a weapon of of war against civilians in Gaza in an act of collective punishment does the NRC share that assessment yes and um Israel as the occupier under international law is responsible for the security and the food security of the people it occupies as a um of course Israel as authorities they they do control areas uh they do control borders um the the crossing the B Crossing uh with with with Gaza which has been the main point of entry for food over over these uh over these years um there is another element of it which is the destruction of agricultural lands of green houses we have seen this in in U in rights reports the destruction of all means of life really I mean there's probably we can't think of a violation that hasn't been committed here but of course the security of the people and and the food and starvation has been used of course destruction of destroying water networks for example that's again against International humanitarian law um you know not facilitating the entry of food to people who are at increased risk of of starvation that's again that's one more violation and of course even businesses and um shops and supermarkets that have been that that have been hit here and you know Strawberry Fields and and Fields that you know used to feed families and businesses and small businesses there's there's hardly you know any violation you could think of that you know has not been has not been committed here and you know when we talk about just a point here about a trucks that that come into Gaza we talk about 100 200s 300s not all of these trucks are actual food uh or or water or you know um any kind of sustenance that people need some of them includes shelter support some of them medication and so when when when we have 100 trucks coming in a day I mean that that can that is hardly enough for for a neighborhood really for a street for a for a shelter and that's why we have been saying that the all of this with the forcible transfer of the people of residents in Gaza all of this together constitutes a grave violation of international law so just on the point Ahmed on um you saying that the Norwegian Refugee Council says that War having made that assessment and that declaration what can organizations like yours do about it we can only speak out to be honest and we can only press and pressure um allies of Israel in the in the the West internationally in the security Council to push for more aids to push for more humanitarian aid while at the same time pushing for our ceasefire we have been saying this all along you can't use water or food or electricity or con connection even internet which which is you know we we we also see examples of starving people of of connectivity in Gaza which is just just horrific for people not be able not to be able to check in and and you know speak to their families and and confirm that you know someone is alive or not right all of this together I mean without the pressure without International Community pressuring Israel we're not going to have a solution to to this um um Ahmed from Gaza um I'd just like to talk about the issue of pregnant women for moment because look there are lot of vulnerable groups in Gaza of course right now I mean the entire population is vulnerable but we're hearing stories of pregnant women who are at particular risk uh because um and baby formula cannot be found and milk of course is in severe short supply for toddlers who are relying on it you speak to us from nasad hospital how are these women coping and their children I'm I'm located in a tent right adjacent to the maternity War here in N Hospital the wall I'm touching is the maternity W it houses dozens of of women in labor and and and babies who have been delivered and five days ago an Israeli tank Strike It Strike the third floor of this maternity World killing one female and injuring a dozens of uh women in labor and newborn babies it didn't kill more because that bomb didn't explode and I'm trying also to help a lot in the charity work here and the number one thing that is needed is things related to hygiene and things related to baby food formula so you are right there is a lack of baby food formula there is a lack of diapers there is a lack of woman pads and um and and the only solution for it since there's no Manufacturing in Gaza is to import it to get it from the outside so hopefully this UN resolution will allow more baby formula more food more Wom medical needs to come in as soon as possible to help to support the civilian population here on the ground Lex um look as we're discussing I mean the needs are so immense and so huge if there is another humanitarian pause a corridor or or you know these sort declared safe zones that turns out are not safe in Gaza the needs are are so huge are these momentary pauses enough to be able to supply the people of Gaza with everything that they need absolutely not I mean in the face of as I as I mentioned already the the abundance of Prima FAS evidence of of atrocity crimes I mean what is called for is a complete sensation of hostilities so that uh indeed the UN can sort of properly together with its humanitarian Partners such as the NRC and many others exercise its its its responsibilities and and and uh and reach uh Reach people at all parts of the of the strip uh as long as this does not happen and as an international lawyer I believe it is beyond continuing diplomatic and political pressure including from Grassroots I believe it is critical to use to to now make use of all available legal Avenues uh to hold those perpetrating or complicity in the commission of atrocity you talk about all legal Avenues what are you referring to here yeah what I'm referring to I mean there is an ongoing investigation by the ICC we're aware of that and and further submissions to the ICC and pressure on the ICC prosecutor Karim Khan is is critical uh then there is also the opportunity offered by the genocide convention uh for uh for states to engage the international court of justice including an urgent an urgent request for provisional measures uh the why do you think why do you think that we still haven't seen a state invoke that genocide convention yet Lex well one of the main reasons is I think honestly uh fear of taking on Israel and uh and uh and by extension the the the the US and and Europe uh there 153 States party to the Gen sign convention they are roughly the same states that supported the recent General Assembly resolution uh but but putting you know expressing expressing a strong denunciation is one taking legal action uh there in a court of law and especially in the world court is uh is an you know a critical is is quite a threshold and yet in in in face of the Prima fasi you know evidence that we are seeing this critical that you know one or more of the of the 153 States parties step up to the this pressure and and and uh and do the right thing as myar as as scambia did in in the case of of of Myanmar with respect to the genocide against the rohinga and and finally there is also uh mul a multitude of avenues through National courts quite quite a few have already been pursued in the US in the Netherlands in in the UK in in Scandinavia but much more can be done and there is a lot of collaboration between lawyers around the world and and and and supported by Palestinian human rights organization and this is really really critical at the at the present time only efforts at accountability can bring you know restrained by by the party and and and those complicit in in in the ongoing genocide okay we'll have to leave it there on that note thank you so much for joining us gentlemen Mansour Shan thank you for joining us from Gaza Ahmed Bam
