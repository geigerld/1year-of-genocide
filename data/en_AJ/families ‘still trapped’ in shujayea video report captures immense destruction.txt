for more than a week now the Israeli military has bombed Gaza City's Shuan neighborhood there are also reports of heavy fighting between Israeli forces and the kasan brigades a Palestinian journalist in Gaza has documented the destruction in Shaya we are here just a few meters away from aaya neighborhood as you can see relentless bombardment on the neighborhood the neighborhood is subjected to extensive air strikes from this are early morning HRA Ground Forces enter the neighborhood from multiple directions forcing civilians to dis place and the situation where man's dire families still fra neighborhood with unknown Destiny this is this [Music] is as close as we can get from a sha neighborhood let's go now live to our correspondent Han Mahmud who's in darl balah central Gaza for honey what's the latest you're hearing about uh the Israeli military operation in sua yes F well within the past half an hour we received a report talking about Israeli military conducting what seemed to be a tactical withdrawal from limited parts of Shaya neighborhood particularly to the northern part of this densely populated neighborhood and the southern uh western part of it and repositioning itself in much more open uh areas but the eastern part NE is still under full military control and this tactical withdrawal is coupled with heavy presence ofad capters and uh surveillance drones that covering the entire neighborhood making it very difficult for people to move around or even to try to evacuate from the residential homes that they've been Sheltering in or they've been trapped inside unable uh to leave so far this almost a week now seventh day in a row and ongoing trail of Devastation and destruction of this particular residential uh neighborhood at the eastern part of of Gaza City where more people reported killed with more as well in the streets uh paramedic civil defense cre are able to get inside and remove these bodies from the streets of sha neighborhood yeah and and elsewhere um Israeli attacks continue of course what's happening in can Yunis in the South with the the latest Israeli evacuation order there have most people now left that Eastern area of canonist yeah well the Israeli military created very intimidating and difficult conditions for the resident of eastern part of kanuni City these people just were making their way back to the remaining parts of their residential homes and areas and neighborhoods in the eastern part of the city after a a a months of Destruction and Devastation and and Relentless air strikes and as soon as they are trying to resettle their the Israeli military started to carry out this uh air attacks on the eastern part of the city claiming that they're they're dismantling infrastructure and Facilities for Palestinian uh resistance and Palestinian fighting groups in the eastern part of the city and doing so pushing hundreds and hundreds of families already displ it traumatized more than one time in terms of displacement into the center and the western part of the city the vast majority of people end up in the streets of hanun now just given their terrible experience in the past in terms of evacuation in terms of the uh the safe zon that is really military pushed harder uh to uh uh make people believe that these PE these areas are safe for them to evacuate to but we have a documented cases of people as soon as they got to these safe zones they were bombed and killed inside uh these areas particularly and notorious among them is Al maasi evacuation where people were targeted and killed inside their tents of this part there's still more people moving to the center of the city some other others decided to stay where they at because there's simply no saf place to go to thank you honey for the update that's Al jaz's honey Mahmud live there in darl balah well let's now speak to Mansour Schuman about this he's a Gaza resident who lived through uh this war and the recent Israeli operations in Rafa and Khan units before moving to qat mano good to have you with us again on aler let's start with what's happening in the south in kanun it's an area you know very well Israel has issued another evacuation order for Khan units this is an area that they' already uh bombed they had been an operation there they left on April 7th but now they're back first of all when they issue the evacuation order to people what happens how much time do people have to leave before the actual operation begins few hours um what happened in this case is that um as for the people I know on the ground first of all pamphlets were thrown on them from the sky and then there would be rumors online through different WhatsApp groups that you know the Israeli forces are going to enter the eastern part of so you need to evacuate and finally they would see an official um order come to them through speaker phones and through Facebook pages and internet pages of the different areas that they need to evacuate within the next hour or so so that the israelies can come and cause whatever they want to do this is a never-ending scenario uh it's happening not only in kanun but in other cities and locations across Gaza Strip and unfortunately no one is able to put a stop to this so the people on the ground are suffering hunus is suffering and this we need to put an end to this as soon as possible as Han correspondent was telling us there some people even with the evacuation orders choose to stay because they have nowhere to go nowhere safe at least they can go to yes not only know we're safe but there is like you said nowhere to go to unfortunately and U even if they are safe the areas that they're going to relocate to has no food or water or shelter for them and their K their children and their families so a lot of people are saying you know what if we're going to die let's die on our homes let's die where we where we need to be unfortunately um it's very it's very sad that we're watching this happening time and time again to different areas and nothing to be done about it yeah what does that suggest the fact that this is happening time and time again in different areas areas which is Israel had said they cleared uh in the past like sha in in Gaza City that been in there like car Unis there was an operation in there in April they said they' cleared it and then they go back what does that suggest to you about the way they're conducting the war and the type of resistance they're facing from the the Palestinian factions I think it's a genocidal way of conducting the War uh it's a way of trying to Exterminating the people trying to uproot them from wherever they have been living for centuries trying to ensure that civil unrest continues and um it's a kind of psychological warfare against the ordinary civilian on the ground in order for them not to feel safe and in order for them to completely submit to any demands made by the IDF moving forward in any of the negotiations that are happening they're facing stiff resistance it seems from the Palestinian factions whether in kanun or Shaya not only stiff but escalating and uh I think that's one of the things that is bothering the IDF is that despite 9 months of get of putting these people through everything gruesome the escalating violence continues from both sides and I I don't understand why don't the same people in the Israeli uh side see this that they're only making the Palestinian people stronger and people who are on the neutral side are now starting to see that no we need to also fight fight back right whether it be through uh peaceful or non peaceful means manour always good to talk to you thank you so so much for joining us aler man Mano Schuman a Palestinian journalist and
