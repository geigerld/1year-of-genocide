Ramy curri is a distinguished fellow at the American University of Beirut he joins us now from Boston New York welcome to the program firstly as we've mentioned the US justice department has announced criminal charges against hamas's top leadership and what's your take on that it's no surprise the United States has been heavily uh enthusiastically um and vigorously supporting Israel in its current um um actions in Gaza and the what the UN calls a gen plausible genocide and it has long um opposed groups like Hamas andb calling them designating them as terrorist groups that view is challenged by much of the world um and especially in light of the un uh affirmation and the uh Geneva Protocols of 1949 saying that uh people who are subjugated uh under foreign occupation have the right to defend themselves by all means including armed resistance so these are questions uh I'm not saying that Hamas is totally innocent I'm saying that the allegations are by themselves like the Israeli allegations that are made uh cannot be taken at face value they need to be uh substantiated and this is presumably what a court action uh will do the second point is that um the United States is very keen to to hold Hamas responsible for its actions but has no similar desire to hold Israel accountable for its actions and therefore in the eyes of most of the world the United States is not an honest broker but is a is complicit in the Israeli genocide and of course you see the support of the US and funding and arms and diplomatic protection and now this kind of uh judicial action against uh Hamas so what what are the ramifications of this if I if I can ask you when it when it comes to the ceasefire talks overall then it's hard to tell you know the United States has long had a tradition as most Imperial powers do when they carry out International armed Adventures uh like in Vietnam they negotiated with Viet Kong and Paris while they were fighting with the Viet Kong and Vietnam and Afghanistan they negotiate with the Taliban while they're fighting with the Taliban so this is how Imperial military adventurism Works uh they cannot resolve their uh they cannot achieve their goals militarily so they're forced in the end to negotiate with the party that they're trying to kill um and I think something similar is happening in the Middle East they're negotiating indirectly with Hamas uh while uh trying to uh pulverize it through the Israeli actions on the ground uh and now through judicial actions which are the judicial actions are pretty meaningless they're not going to uh capture these any of these people who are still alive and take them to an American court but it indicates that um you can negotiate with a party that you think is a terrorist group uh and most of the world will not pay much attention to this because you don't really have much credibility and it also detracts from the United States's credibility as a mediator um but the problem is there's no other mediator that the Israelis will trust so you have to deal with the United States uh but the United States is not an impartial uh party um and this is you know the problem here is is essentially the same one it's been for the last 100 years under the British in the Middle East and the US now which is Imperial Colonial uh Behavior Uh and this is what Imperial Colonial powers do and uh we we just have to keep pushing back against it and asking that the principles of international law be applied uh equitably to all parties who may be accused of war crimes or terrorism or or whatever uh this is something we've been calling for for decades you know take any Arab party you don't like hisbah Hamas PLO anybody uh take them to court but also take the Israelis to court the evidence for what the Israelis have done in Palestine not just now but in the last 70 80 years destroying Villages and taking uh uh throwing people out and ethnic cleansing on a mass scale is massive but the the US will not uh take this to court anymore than the United Kingdom okay let me just ask you this if I may if I may what do you make of the huge protests that we've seen in Israel then to what extent does that put pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu uh it it seems to put pressure on him but it doesn't really put pressure on him in the same way that the massive public support in the US for a ceasefire among the American people um does not seem to put pressure on the American president either um these systems um allow the person in power to do almost anything they want as long as they have a either a parliamentary majority which n who does with his fascist colleagues or uh they have been elected um as the Biden Administration has been so there's there's we're not going to see Street demonstrations making Netanyahu change the only thing that'll make him change is serious external pressure uh arms embargos uh maybe loosening up the Western resistance to the international criminal court taking more actions or the international court of justice decision being implemented as more countries around the world stop inviting Israel to sporting events or cultural events as happened in South Africa that's the kind of thing that will cause the Israelis uh to change but it's very hard to see that happening uh with right now without any International pressure okay we'll leave it there Ramy Curry we very much appreciate your insights thank you thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
