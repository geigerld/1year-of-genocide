We are following the story from Tel Aviv and from Gaza in a moment we'll go to tzo but firstly speak let's speak to T [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Zoom he's in arfer in southern Gaza and TK the need for medical supplies is desperate and now we are seeing limited supplies Crossing into Gaza yes uh there is another today uh a new wave and conoyers of humanitarian supplies had been allowed to enter the Gaza Strip under the agreement that had been broken by Qatar between Hamas and Israel on the ground in exchange for delivering medication for the Israeli captives inside the Gaza Strip who had been uh captured by Hamas during its October attack near the borders and this is completely a new kinds of humanitarian supplies being delivered by this time to the mostly highly affected and vulnerable areas uh that did not receive much humanitarian AIDS within uh the last few uh weeks now uh we can see that the amount of the humanitarian Aid and also the medical supplies being delivered to the medical sectors is still very limited as the number of injured people Day by days climbing at had reached more than 61,000 Palestinians being injured since October the 7th so TK and give us a latest update on what the situation is on the ground in terms of fighting yes uh and past uh 24 hours it was completely bloody for the majority of gazans as 100 uh more than 160 Palestinians being killed alongside with more than 350 others being wed as the attacks had been guided and concentrated on khun City where they have also uh LED they have injured two Jordanian workers working inside the Jordanian uh field hospital that had been set up in the vicinity of an nasar hospital as the military yesterday and overnight had managed to encircle the entire area where they have destroyed a cemetery that is just in the back side of the anaser hospital where people had been a number of residents of course have been uh taken from their graves as after being killed by the Israeli forces where they have destroyed a number of Graves there in a part of the military operations but what what what is completely new in kanun is the constant blowing up of residential neighborhoods they completely throughout the par last 24 hours destroyed more than three neighborhoods in kanun city and the ongoing military operation there the situation is considered to be also very dramatic and dire in the middle goat and also in Gaza City where overnight air strikes had killed 20 uh Palestinians at least belong to almasri family they were have been uh pulled from under the reels today and have been transported to aifa Medical complex as well this the ongoing bombardment of the middle governate did not stop as the Israeli forces are making different tactical uh operations in these areas that have been confronted also by the Palestinian fighters on the Eastern areas of Al Alat and alghazi refugee camp T thanks for that t Zoom there in Rafa in southern Gaza let's whip over to Tel Aviv Tera Teresa Bo joins us there so Teresa some very complex negotiations of course to try and get this limited supply of Aid in how's it all going to be processed well these are extremely complicated negotiations it's not only Israel and Hamas involving France and katar in order to get this deal going it's the first time that there is an agreement between Israel and Hamas uh since the freedom of the the captives back in November that left 100 captives uh that after negotiations happen so this an example of how complex the situation is is that those much needed medicine cens landed in the Alish Air Base close to the Gaza border on the Egyptian side of the Border however they were going to meant to go straight into Gaza and that's not what happened because of internal Israeli politics and they had to be the trucks taken further down south in order to be checked in Israeli checkpoints initially apparently Hamas had demanded that those medicines are not checked apparently they're concerned that those medicines could be traced back to where the captives are being held apparently the Israeli government had agreed with something like this but coming under pressure from farri ministers who are saying how can this happen how can medicines get into Gaza without those trucks being checked so now the Israeli government changed their position and now uh those trucks are heading to the southern part uh to the to the gate Karam Salam further south and then they'll be distributed in the Gaza Strip what we do know is that they're going to be taken into hospitals distributed into patches and then take the Red Cross is going to take them to where the captives are located so as I mentioned you know we we're including among these are medicines for at least 45 of those captives including antibiotic medicines for the clinically ill um baby food among other things and Hamas had demanded that for every box that enter the Gaza Strip there be a thousand more for the Palestinians who are in desperate need we've been hearing in the past few weeks of of surgeries ongoing of amputations ongoing without anesthesia for example so there is much needed need for medicines ongoing and and what's interesting also if of all of this that's been going on is that in the meantime here in Israel the tension the fear of the fate of those captives continue to increase uh the operations on the ground continue the fighting is ongoing and many of the relatives of those who are being held in in Gaza are concerned about whether any type of negotiation is going to happen whether after this negotiation there might be another one that will lead to their loved ones being released because as operation on the ground continue of course there's the fear that those captives might be killed that's a picture from Tel Aviv Teresa reporting thanks Teresa
