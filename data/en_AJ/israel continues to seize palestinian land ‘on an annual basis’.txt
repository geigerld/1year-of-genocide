ABD Arian from Georgetown University is still with us here on S let's talk about land day obviously you know the anniversaries come and go each year the ideology is set in stone as far as the Israelis are concerned and all that the Palestinians can do is remember yeah I mean you know all of us I think are quite familiar with that map that famous map of the shrinking of Palestine going back from 1948 until the present um you know so there's there's something to be said about the fact that the theft of land has been part and parcel of the Israeli state going back to its establishment in 1948 very soon after the Israeli State uh established certain laws that basically permitted them on under this this massively wide umbrella of of security concerns to be able to seize any land at any point uh specifically from Palestinian residents and citizens of the state and so we've seen this of course over the years 1976 was the very first commemoration of lande with a with regard to a specific incident in which um you know a parcel of land was taken from Palestinian those who were happened to be citizens of the state of Israel and yet obviously had no rights whatsoever to challenge the theft of their land and since then we've been seeing this marked on an annual basis and we're continuing to see it today you just mentioned I think before the break uh about this new announcement of yet more land that's being confiscated unilaterally by the state as announced by one of the Israeli ministers something we haven't seen at least not on that scale uh in decades really so we're we're continuing to witness this happening not just you know 40 50 years ago but even today and of course it runs in Tander with exactly what's going on in the war in Gaza so the Palestinians have this this front that they have to deal with you know conflict and land grabs and it it's not lost on on Arab the Arab community in the region I mean we we've seen demonstrations were in Jordan only only last night uh on on Friday evening yet the question that's continually asked even to me when I'm away from camera by people across Europe and when I visit is why do the Arab countries that have agreements and recognize Israel not cut their diplomatic ties seems It's always left to Central American countries to actually take the lead well I mean I think to to understand that question we have to really look at the state of what uh Arab politics looks like in this day and age I mean if we think back just a decade ago we had mass uprisings in which the will of hundreds of millions of people was being represented in the streets and in in these attempted revolutions but what happened after that of course is that there was a kind of an authoritarian retrenchment we had these um you know unrepresentative monarchical and dictatorship regimes that are essentially installing their will and imposing their will at the expense of their population's demands and they're doing this in part obviously as a means of of securing their own power all of them are quite deeply unpopular um but in addition to that because of just their absolute dependence economically militarily diplomatically on Western countries and so they're completely beholden to the whims of not just uh Israel but the United States and the EU and many other countries and so in that sense it's it's quite understandable that they would be simply echoing the same policies we see coming out of Washington and London and Paris for the moment we'll leave it there of course we'll keep uh your analysis going throughout the day Abdullah Al Aran thank you for joining us
