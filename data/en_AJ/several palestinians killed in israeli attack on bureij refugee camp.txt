we begin in Gaza where Israeli strikes have killed at least nine people from the same family five children were killed when their health was targeted in the alur refugee camp in central Gaza the bodies have been taken to alaka hospital to prepare them for burial meanwhile the Israeli Army opened fire overnight on Palestinians waiting to collect food Aid in Gaza City at least six people were killed and 83 injured in the attack Israeli forces have repeated targeted starving civilians who wait for humanitarian Aid trucks at the Kuwait roundabout the intersection is on the Salah Adine Road that's a main route linking northern and southern Gaza at least 400 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks on Aid deliveries so far and the attack happened on the same day that Israel targeted a un Food Distribution Center in the southern city of Rafa at least five people were killed including a staff member of the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees Andra the facility is one of the last remaining food distribution points in Gaza the agency has called for an independent investigation Felix NADA reports blood stains the floor of a un relief Distribution Center in Rafa a stark reminder of the dangers humanitarian workers face in Gaza staff members mourn the loss of a colleague one of five people killed in an Israeli attack this is forbidden we are an international institution all of this is for the people we stopped returning to our homes we work here day and night to serve refugees we take all of this to the elderly and the children what is this unra says that it frequently shares locations of its facilities with all parties but that has not stopped the Israeli military from targeting it the Israeli Army described Wednesday's attack as a successful operation targeting a Hamas Commander since October more than 150 unra centers have been struck in Israel's war on Gaza this includes schools Sheltering the displaced at least 400 people have been killed while Sheltering under the United Nations flag the UN called this latest attack devastating it has a negative impact on our ability of staff to to to work it has a negative impact on the ability of those who need Aid uh to get Aid it's it's another it's another tragic symbol of the conditions under which our humanitarian colleagues work every day in um in Gaza Aid agencies say unr's role in Palestinian territories is irreplaceable deaths from Hunger are already being reported in Gaza in a meeting with the US Secretary of State the eu's policy chief called for the opening of more channels to deliver Aid we need to clear the humanitarian access through SE by air that's good that's not enough you cannot replace hundreds of trucks by sending parachutes the most important thing is to open the borders by land under international law Aid facilities are supposed to be protected during armed conflict but as War rages in Gaza incidents like this seem likely to continue unchecked Felix Nara Al jazer responding to that attack on the UN Distribution Center US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has urged Israel to ensure the safety of humanitarian workers in Gaza Patty Khan reports from Washington DC a very brief press conference with US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin here at the state department he wanted to talk about a video conference call that was hosted with Cyprus the US the European Union United Kingdom UAE cter and uh the United Nations they're really trying to coordinate how they're going to do this temporary pier in Gaza to get Aiden by sea he said it's going to take time but he said he hopes that when it is up and running they'll be able to deliver two million meals a day he did say though that this can only just complement Aid that really needs to go in the most effective way which is over land now he did say that it would be good of the Israelis to provide a very definitive list of items that are not allowed and to speed up inspections but when asked who is to blame for such little Aid getting in he did not blame the Israelis he was asked about just the latest attack on uh food distribution site in Gaza without getting into the specifics of this incident because again I don't know the facts I think it does as a general matter underscore something I talked about a few minutes ago and that's the imperative of having much better and much more consistent deconfliction humanitarian workers the agencies they need to be able to do their jobs in with as much security and as much confidence as is possible many of the questions focused on potential consequences for Israel as you know president Joe Biden said that there it was a red line if they were to invade Rafa he didn't go into any detail that there even may be potential consequences if the prime minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu does what he's been saying he's going to do and invade Rafa anyway Patty khaine Al jazer at the state department let's go to our correspondent hanim mmud now he's joining us on the phone from Rafa and Hy as we've been reporting over the last couple of hours nine members of One family killed in the latest attacks in ver Al Balan which of course has been one of the most targeted areas of Gaza since October 7th yes and the Elizabeth the more reports we're getting from uh the Lota Hospital confirmed reports of difficulties of the medical staff to intervene proper right now and to save lives from those who came with different injuries you know the de breath and TR know that that you can travel at a very high speed and and hitting people coming with really critical injuries just very difficult for uh the hospital particular when it comes to fractured bones and the fact that there's an specialized uh uh uh doctors who can do the operation necessary the surgery to save life is becoming very difficult and the vast majority of people so far not this case but also from the past injuries are run to the hospital they would go under amputation right away giving the fact that there isn't any medical supplies or or sufficient medical staff to intervene and and save lives and and and protect people uh nine people reported killed and we are looking at close to 18 different injuries that are being treated right now but with with so much difficulty uh right now similar situations are reported from a shifa hospital and a shifa hospital is a different totally different story right now because it's non-operational and the fact this number of injuries arriving to a sha Hospital with these situations going on is more of a death sentence to these injuries as within days they they are at risk of losing their lives as there's no surgeries no medical supplies and also the medical the back from an attack on the aid Seekers at a qu round that where uh six people reported killed and 83 injuries and we look at injuries that are either in the back the abdominal area the make very serious injuries that the hospital unable to provide any necessary intervention and a different on a new development Israel military pulled out of Muslim Hamed residential City but leaving behind sheer level of Destruction close to 17 residential Towers completely destroyed leaving thousand of people without a home right now all right hany thank you very much for that that is Han Mahmud with all the latest from Gaza
