Kallab, 27 years old, a general physician. I work in the emergency room of Nasser Hospital. In case of emergency, our work is divided into two groups, which pays 24 hours with 24 hours of rest. This war is different from previous wars, a complete difference, first of all, from the number of casualties and the quantity coming to Nasser Hospital, the nature of the cases that we came from. Frightening degrees of burns, including loss and lacerations of organs, especially the limbs, in many cases, for example, in previous wars in particular, and with these huge numbers, the largest percentages that I received were either children or women. Bombing any hospital is immoral, so imagine the pressure that would occur at any possible moment.  Do you think that you might be diminished from your workplace or the performance of your profession, especially if your profession is humanitarian, especially in an ambulance in front of or inside Nasser Hospital? The ambulance was inside, and in fact, I was at the head of my work. It was a majestic sight, especially when you see your colleagues who are being transported sitting in the casualties being transported in the casualties.  You suddenly find them with the same injuries that happen to those who work in the emergency. To be safe, especially during wars, or perhaps in Gaza in particular, we see things that the human mind cannot tolerate. Perhaps the most difficult case I have ever experienced was a mother carrying her child, a dead child, holding the father of her child while her legs were completely lacerated, and of course there were more than  She was injured and needs to enter the red station, meaning the station. I do not know whether to take her son away from her or whether to let her son in. I could not honestly take her son from her, and honesty also affected the situation, so I wanted to follow up with her. I mean, I heard her talking. I wish I had died before
