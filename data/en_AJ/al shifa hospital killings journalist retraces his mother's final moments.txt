remembering happier times Muhammad Kia with his mother NAA when Israeli forces withdrew from alifa hospital after a two week Siege he finally learned her fate some women had told me that they saw my mother here asking for help when I got here I found a body I knew immediately even before I recognized her that it was my mother I went closer and I saw her lying there covered as if she was sleeping it was as if she was asleep at home so I said wake up Mom I'm here Witnesses say the Israeli Army killed people who were Sheltering at the hospital one remember seeing naima's body I was arrested early in the day by Israeli forces for interrogation they released me in the evening and on my way back I saw her body I was only wearing my underwear and I asked the Israeli soldier to allow me to go home and put on my clothes he refused and said do you want to lose your life like this woman Nea refused to leave Gaza City without Muhammad who was covering the war she was one of thousands who took Refuge near gaza's biggest Hospital complex hoping to escape the Relentless Israeli attacks how I wished I could see her when she was looking for me to hug her and to take her with me away from danger her face was unrecognizable people told told me she was executed by the Israeli military they should have helped her I was her only son it was so hard for me to see her like this now all Muhammad has left is memories of his mother and questions about who if anyone will be held accountable for killing her Freddy AAR Al jazer make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
