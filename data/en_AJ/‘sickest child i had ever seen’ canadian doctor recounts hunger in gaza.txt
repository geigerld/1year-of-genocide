Israel's continued bombardment of gaza's Health Facilities has resulted in the Health Care System practically collapsing gaza's Health Ministry says it's detected about 1 million cases of infectious diseases describing the situation in the strip as extremely catastrophic 350,000 chronic patients are at risk because of nonadministration of medications another 60,000 pregnant women in Gaza are in danger because of a lack of access to healthcare and around 10,000 cancer patients at risk of death meanwhile a un team has delivered Essential Medical Supplies to hospitals in Northern Gaza for the first time since the War Began in October the situation there is described as Grim with severe levels of malnutrition children dying of starvation serious shortages of fuel food and medical supplies the UN spokesperson Stefan dejar gave this update a team made up of World Health Organization the office of the coordination if humanitarian Affairs UNICEF and the UN population fund all visited the AL AA and Kamal adwan hospitals in Northern Gaza yesterday they did that to deliver Fuel and Essential Medical supplies that the visits were the first to those specific hospitals since early October despite our ongoing efforts to gain more regular access to the north of Gaza the team delivered 9,500 L of fuel to each of the those hospitals but as you can imagine this is just a fraction of what is actually needed uh the director general of the World Health Organization Dr tedro spoke of quote Grim findings during the team's visits including several levels of malnutrition children dying of starvation Hospital buildings destroyed and serious shortages of fuel and food and medical supplies uh the Cal adwan hospital is the only Pediatric Hospital in Northern Gaza and it is as you can imagine being over overwhelmed with patience Dr tedro said the lack of electricity poses a serious threat to Patient Care and the lack of food led to the death of 10 children uh as the wh team was informed uh by uh doctors at the hospital well let's speak to Dr eang G who's a Canadian medic who spent a week treating patients inside Gaza and he's in close contact with colleagues uh in the strip and is joining us live from Ottawa on this newsour thank you so much for being with us doctor you've been speaking to your colleagues in Gaza what are they telling you about the current situation especially when it comes to these infectious diseases 1 million cases that's a staggering figure that's right I mean thank you for having me the numbers are staggering but I think the the human cost of what's happening on the ground the individual lives that are being impacted by not only the Infectious Disease and the continued violence that people are experiencing but also I think um it's really important to highlight the attacks on healthare that have since continued I had to check on the status of my colleagues and friends who are healthcare workers in the Gaza Strip to see if they are still alive only only in the past two days I had to um check in to see if my colleagues at the emirati maternity hospital to see if they were alive because the gates of that hospital was struck by a Dron drone drone strike that killed a paramedic on duty it killed a nurse a total of 11 people and over 50 people were harmed and injured including young children Yeahs on you know people do not feel safe to provide that kid care but they're still doing the you know essential care of looking after their patients in their Community it's just horrendous it is many many healthcare workers have indeed been killed in this war and and that makes it really difficult as you uh for them to treat people who are who are suffering I just wanted to ask you a bit more about the infectious diseases and and these 1 million cases what sort of diseases are we talking about here and what's caused them I mean with the overlapping food and clean water and housing insecurity that has pretty much left no one on not you know every single person has been entirely touched by those um overlapping um crises of food food and water and um shelter insecurity it has led to the conditions of overcrowding um dis displacement with people living in tense um uh unproper um sanitation and clean water to the point where we're seeing so much communicable disease in that of respiratory infections um gastrointestinal disease including a major outbreak of hepatitis A and and these are preventable infections and diseases that can also be vaccinated against and and to to heal from such things we need nutritious food we need clean water and without such things we're we're seeing um the worst of the worst with not only these communicable diseases these infections um which are entirely preventable and also treatable right and and we can't even treat them because of the lack of medications lack of antibiotics as you've already said Dr G well we we also have um children dying of malut nutition especially in Northern Gaza and this is happening at an extremely alarming rate there are the deaths of course but there are also long-term consequences to to these children not getting the proper nutrition they need you know I one of the children that I saw um was the sickest child that I've ever seen in my entire medical career they were carried in by his mother and wasn't able to walk anymore because of how you know uh malnourished he was and I could wrap my index finger and my thumb entirely around both the upper arm and the lower leg of this child and he was nine 10 years old and I'm worried that this is one of the children that have already died um since I met him two years two two weeks ago um and the number of children have died from severe malnutrition is now in the double digits um the these are entirely preventable deaths and these are children we're talking about that are you know uh suffer the the the most serious consequences from the ongoing genocide and and assault by uh Israel on the people of Gaza thank you so much for talking to us Dr Dr eang G joining us there from Ottawa in Canada thank you for your time thank you for having me
