Palestinians in Gaza suffer a humanitarian catastrophe bombed and besieged by Israel with nothing allowed in and no way out the UN is blocked on the ground and the Security Council is polarized and Paralyzed by veto what role can the UN play in Gaza this is Inside hello again I'm James Baye human suffering on an epic scale the view of the UN Secretary General Antonio gues on the plight of 2.3 million Palestinians under Israeli bombardment in Gaza in peace time cutting off supplies of food water medicine electricity and fuel would be a disaster in a time of War for a besieged Enclave with thousands killed and injured in Relentless attacks it's a catastrophe ropy heroic efforts by medical personnel rescue crews and civilians continue while Israel blocks desperately need humanitarian aid for most Palestinians the UN is a Lifeline the main source of supplies and the international witness to their suffering un staff have been killed in Israeli attacks and un schools and Clinics have been bombed but in New York the security Council has failed to back motions that could have facilitated humanitarian relief so what can the UN do to help Palestinians what es does the global body face in this war we're discussing all of this in a moment with our panel of guests but first the pal Palestinian journalist hanni Abu aseba tells us what life is like in Gaza today ongoing mass bombardment or better known by experts as carpet bombing has turned major parts of the Gaza Strip into a pile of rebels in a statement made by the Ministry of Health the air strikes have almost declaimed the life of 3,7 3,478 Palestinians lives 70% of those who have been killed by the air strikes are children and women there are also 12,000 Palestinians who have been critically injured with the number with number trapping under the rubbles the expected numbers of Palestinian victims is expected to rise to 6,000 making it closer to the victims of the serban Massacre Complete Siege on the Gaza Strip with serious shortage of of a fuel and and and medical supplies has pushed hospitals and medical centers on the brink of collapse we have hospitals so far that are running out of services adding only pressures to other hospitals who have who are already running beyond their [Music] capacities so let's bring in our panel of guests to discuss all of this in Geneva Mukesh capila a professor at the University of Manchester in the UK and a former un humanitarian coordinator in Alexandria in the US state of Virginia is USF Muna the head of the Palestine and Israel program at the Arab Center Washington D.C and in London we have Chris gunnis he's a former un relief and works agency spokesperson but he doesn't work for them anymore he's speaking to us in an independent uh capacity let me start with You Chris because we've already had four Gaza was before and you were there speaking on behalf of the UN from Jerusalem about the situation in Gaza when you see what has happened this time the fact that death toll has far exceeded the death toll in 2014 are you surprised in any way how bad things are I'm not surprised because the blockade has continued I am surprised by the sheer loss of life and the lack of Hope um looking forward um what what I'm hoping is that the UN will be allowed to take trucks in unra before this conflict was taking in 500 trucks a day so you know that's the level we got got it up to 1.1 million people in Gaza are dependent on unra for food so apart from getting in 500 trucks a day there's got to be a ceasefire for that already 13 unre workers have been killed already 13 schools have been hit now we hear the latest report from unra half a million people in unra schools um health clinics have been hit as well so we need a proper ceasefire and we need to look at the unra buildings unra has 11 food distribution centers across the Gaza Strip if they're going to get in huge amounts of food obviously those warehouses there may be structural damage after this intense Israeli bombardment and there's got to be a ceasefire so that people can come and collect the food so a massive logistical and I dare say political um operation in order to get this ceasefire going so so a huge amount of work I believe that unra 13,000 of my former colleagues are there they' have stood by the people of Gaza in their most desperate hour of need in the last four Wars they will continue to do that but make no mistake unra is on its knees financially also they've put out a flash appeal for a 100 million well that has got to be met because we've got to get food we've got to get water and by the way fuel Israel's not yet said it will allow fuel in well there's no point getting water I mean it's got the pumping station the desalination plant that's got to work so we need security we need a huge amount of trucks 500 today to go through Rafa Rafa was bombed recently it's a very small um one Road in One Direction one Road in the other so there is a huge amount of work Financial for unra logistical to get the uh the Rafa Crossing functional and also security there's got to be a ceasefire so that this massive humanitarian need can be met mesh we we know that there's been work going on trying to arrange some sort of Aid going into Gaza for well over a week now and finally President Biden it seemed got some progress but as Chris said you know hundreds of trucks before the war used to go into Gaza and initially the deal is just for 20 trucks you were a former humanitarian coordinator for the UN and Resident coordinator in Sudan how on Earth if you were in the job now in in Gaza how on Earth would prioritize what to send if you've only got 20 trucks well I think the 20 trucks I hope I just symbolic to test the uh the the the the route and uh to build confidence and I hope from 20 it'll grow to 2,000 or even even more uh having said that uh I think there has to be prioritization obviously food and water and Health Care dominates as elsewhere but at the same time as I think just been said it is not just to send in relief trucks there has to be enough peace enough truth so that people can get it and can actually benefit from it and so the idea that you can carry on fighting uh and then try to mitigate some of the suffering by sending in a few trucks here and there and then hoping that people will somehow get some relief is I think a very flaw Prospect and in fact uh I can imagine some serious security and logistic issues happening ahead and even costing lives if there isn't the dec conflicting of of relief provision and relief uptake and of course the ongoing bombing and fighting ussef what we're hearing though from the Israeli military is yes Netanyahu is letting some Aid in but there's no suggestion that they're stopping their military um operation the bombardment has been continuing including around Rafa in in recent hours and there's no suggestion that they're not going to go to the next stage the ground offensive that's unfortunately absolutely correct um the level of uh horrific violence that we are seeing Unleashed now on Gaza everything that we're hearing from folks on the ground who by the way have lived through far too many uh Wars uh are saying that this is worse than anything that they've ever experienced in terms of of the the the sheer level of of Destruction and cost um to human life uh of course humanitarian Aid is important uh the aid workers who are working on the ground despite this uh are doing heroic things but the reality is that humanitarian Aid is not going to do a whole lot for people who don't live to receive it uh even the little that does trickle in uh and so a um you know an urgent push needs to be made in this moment to bring a stop uh to the bombing for an immediate ceasefire uh not just so that the conditions can exist to allow humanitarian Aid to come in but because uh the most urgent concern now uh is saving lives that do not need to be lost um and we have seen far too many of them lost already if I can come back to you Chris what's just been said James yeah if I may I mean Palestinians do not want to be on Aid they want to live decent independent life so building on what has just been said of course all those things must happen but we need to make sure that ultimately the blockade is lifted so that the constant conversation is about what's being allowed into Gaza bread right you know all these we need to look at what's coming out of Gaza Palestinians are entrepreneurial they're educated they're motivated they're brilliant people Gaza could be the Singapore of the Middle East if it was allowed to be so as well as a discussion about letting food and and other materials in there has to be also at the same time some kind of discussion about what is allowed out Gaza is a hugely productive Society there was agricultural produce there was garment industry there's a food industry drinks there's all sorts of stuff and in order for G to be put back on its feet there must be a proper conversation about what is let out and that's very important even at this stage those conversations should start if I can stay with you Chris for a moment if you can help our viewers just a little bit more detail on you know the geography you know the logistics you know the Rafa border crossing just tell us a little bit more about the Rafa border crossing and uh alar which is the airport about 45 kilometers away where apparently there's now they've got a great deal of humanitarian assistance that's been flown in I'm told an estimated 3,000 tons is there um how difficult will it be getting that in through the choke point of Rafa and then Distributing it well I've been through the Rafa Crossing with Desmond tuti as it happens on his mission many years ago and it's a single Lane Road in One Direction at least it used to be coming out and a single Lane going north going into Gaza and it was bombed by the Israelis so it very very rapidly has got to be repaired um allish is nearby and you can get from allish to to Rafa very very quickly but can I say also James that when we had from the Israelis many years ago this security narrative that if we let stuff in or we let stuff out there's going to be weapons and bombs the European Union and others built the Kum Shalom crossing point it is a huge industrial scale trans shipment point of a sort you get in a point at a port with dozens of lanes for trucks and container lorries and that was built in a way which was apparently seing to Israel's legitimate security concerns now I don't know what state it's in now but the very purpose of Karam Shalom was precisely what we are discussing now and that is to get in industrial scale levels of products so that 1.1 and more million people can have the food and the water and the medicine and the fuel and all the things that a society needs so yes if Rafa is the only game in town sure it has to be used you've got Alish nearby things can be brought in but ultimately the World created this thing called the caram Shalom crossing point and it should be opened up immed immediately because only k k Sham in its present form will allowing in the vast levels of assistance and other materials that are needed Yousef when it comes to the things that are needed the needs of the of the people the desperate needs of the people of Gaza um Chris just mentioned fuel um tell us how important fuel is I mean for for pumping water desalination plants but probably most importantly for the hospitals in Gaza yeah it's hard for people to really wrap their heads around what life uh in Gaza is like the uh lack of electricity has been um uh you know a constant condition in the Gaza Strip now for years uh it has uh increasingly gone gotten worse over time uh at particularly since the Israelis bomb gaza's only Power Plant in 2006 it's never really been able to recover uh and um um uh the the presence of electricity uh sometimes can be a few hours a day sometimes can be um not at all and in many places in the Gaza Strip that is the case now of course so fuel has become really uh a a backup option for creating electricity through uh generators uh which so many different um uh homes uh institutions um and and um you know and and plants require to be able to function whether it comes to water desalination or you know keeping the lights and the machines uh on in hospital wards that are trying to desperately save the lives of people who have been um who have been brutally injured in uh in these attacks and I and I do want to just add one thing here in relation to the conversation about the The Crossings and rafah and so on um you know a a lot here depends on the United States's ability to get the Israelis uh to uh allow this to happen um and one episode that I think was missed by a lot of folks is the other day the United States Secretary of State Anthony blinkin uh was meeting with uh the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for eight hours during this time the United States was telling its citizens in the Gaza Strip to head to the Rafa Crossing so that they could be able to exit safely and it was during this time time while the secretary of state was meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister and telling his citizens to go to rafah because it was safe um that the Israelis bombed the Rafa Crossing again and so I think a a major issue here uh is that the the only player that really has uh leverage and the ability to restrain the Israelis um is unable to even do so for the protection of its own citizens even when its secretary of state is sitting next to the Israeli prime minister and I think that should send a great degree of concern to all of us uh about uh how much leverage there is uh over um Israel in this moment uh as it is denying access uh to humanitarian Aid to everybody there and also of course riging bombs down on the population Mukesh as a former senior humanitarian official um even if you get Aid in is it is it is it good enough if if you don't have a Ceasar to deliver that Aid I think it's extremely difficult I think that if you you know how the humanitarian scene has changed the in the old days when there were Wars you agreed a pause in the war and then you supplied Aid and then people went went back to fighting now we're expecting humanitarians to actually Supply Aid in the middle of the fighting for hospitals to function even as the bombs are raining on you and I think this is not a tenable situ in fact probably more people are being placed at the risk not just Aid workers who lose lose their lives but also people who are coming to that so I I and I'm really not sure whether the focus on Aid getting in is really that important compared to actually what we need to be doing which is to have a more sustained sensation of hostilities even if we were to increase the amount of Aid going in through the through the Raa border with the road repair and so on it is going to be marginal to survival chances of the people so either the people have to get out or they have to come to a safe Zone where AID can be supplied safely so I do worry that quite a lot of discussion about humanitarian Aid is almost to use humanitarian Aid as an alibi for not being able to do the other things and I think that tension has to be on the political side as much as on the age side okay Mukesh let me pick up that point about a possible Ceasar or humanitarian Paws because it's something that the UN Security Council had before them two different resolutions a Russian resolution that didn't pass the security Council and then a Brazilian draft which originally had called for an immediate ceasefire and after lots of negotiations including the US's allies the UK and France watering it down became humanitarian pauses and yet the US still vetoed that resolution it would have passed otherwise there were 12 other countries uh in favor of the resolution listen now to what the US ambassador said to explain why she raised her hand and vetoed a resolution calling for humanitarian pauses we are on the ground doing the hard work of diplomacy and while we recognize Brazil's desire to move this text forward we believe we need to let that diplomacy play out especially when Secretary General gues President Biden secretary blinkin and Regional actors are engaged in intensive Dialogue on the very issues we are deliberating on today yes resolutions are important and yes this Council must speak out but the actions we take must be informed by the facts on the ground and support direct diplomacy efforts that can save lives the council needs to get this right Chris listen to that I think the excuse was we cannot have a humanitarian pause because it will get in the way of diplomacy what's the point of diplomacy more to the point it will get into in the way of Israel's war aims it's absolutely disgraceful it's disgusting to hear that being said I've lived through these wars and let me tell you at the end of all of these Gaza bombardments when they're going on America always gives Israel I hate to use this phrase a grace period a period in which they say okay you go and achieve your War aims you carry on bombing you can carry on killing civilians but you know don't embarrass us too much let it be a couple of weeks but after this you know egregious this terrible violence on the 7th of October I imagine that America is giving Israel a much longer period a grace period it's utter hypocrisy to hear an American ambassador say these things about giving diplomacy a chance we've live those of us who've been there and seen these live through these terrible bombardments we all know that America says to Israel there's going to be a grace period for you take a while you know whatever try and you know deal with International humanitarian law I'm sorry to be cynical but this is what has happened if America wanted to put its hand up and vote with that resolution yesterday they could have done they could have sent a message to the Israelis that enough is enough you've destroyed more of Gaza than you've ever done in a single War the time has got to stop frankly as far as I'm concerned that is the use of international Aid as a political tool it's condemnable mukes you had a point I do have a point I I have many points but the first one is I don't hear Linda the American ambassador quite saying that what I heard more is that the American Administration wants uh to get credit for their diplomacy so how can you have a security Council resolution that when the US president is in the air coming to uh coming to to Jerusalem so I think there's a bit of national ego here involved more than anything else else the Americans have invested such a lot in that area and they somehow want to get the credit for whatever pauses or ceasefires or humanitarian access that's one thing and the second thing I want to say and this is even more important is that I don't think we should be too fixed up on this there have been many many Security Council resolutions in the past and on other situations before the security Council got paralyzed uh and it doesn't make any difference so I think we should be worried about the situation on the ground and practical diplomacy and practical action not worrying of but symbolic words as well as we shouldn't worry about small changes in phraseology to please every constituency on the security Council we are distracted by this nothing is going to be solved in the security Council or in New York that's not the action is the action is on the ground the action is whether or not people live or die according to what access they have and what practical diplomats can do on the ground in terms of affecting the the C so people should not get up to head up Security Council resolutions in my opinion okay well I am I'm still going to ask about it though and I'll ask youf about this um I'm hearing from diplomats that the US was signaling that it could probably support this resolution in fact the Chinese Ambassador said that in the security Council he said the fact they vetoed was nothing short of unbelievable yeah it's absolutely disgraceful and I think it's important to keep in mind that there were previous attempts at the security Council to put forward uh a uh a resolution calling for a ceasefire with different language that was rejected not just by the United States uh and of course there was a number of modifications made to language which uh was then uh agreeable enough to everybody except the uh United States um who of course vetoed it anyway I think that the excuses given for uh The veto uh are um also disgraceful but even if we take them at face value what has American diplomacy achieved in this moment uh the president of the United States was on his way to the region uh and uh could not even meet uh with his key allies outside of Israel uh to try to get a hold on the situation because the entire region uh is rejecting uh the American position on this issue thus far um every moment that goes by uh the United States is continuing to lose control over the ability uh to not just control the situation on the ground in Gaza but to control the situation throughout an entire region which is on the brink of regional War which might bring the United States into direct confrontation uh with with uh states in the Middle East again um the United Nations I I I would I would agree that what is happening on the ground is of of of the utmost importance but at the same time the failure of the International System uh to uphold um international law uh and to demand accountability for it is the reason why we are here at this moment and the continued failure to do that I think we should only expect will bring us to more dangerous and horrific moments um for which it will be much much harder to to get out of um and so I think there are tremendous consequences to this American policy uh thus far on this on this uh War has been to give Israel the maximum amount of space and time uh to exact what the Israeli Prime Minister called Mighty Vengeance um in the Gaza Strip uh this is unconscionable on a moral level uh and it is incredibly dangerous on a policy level uh in ways that will impact everybody around the world Chris the failure in the security Council under new um um Arrangements that came in last year means this actually has to go to the UN General Assembly they have to have a a meeting um on this within 10 working days unless there is an emergency special session called and apparently Russia's going to call one of those now when it comes to the court of 193 countries uh they are more favorable uh to the Palestinians uh potentially than the security Council where the where the US has um has a veto do you think this could be in the long run Dam damaging for the US with regard to the global South might it harm them for example in explain their case in Ukraine well can I say that when this does move out of the security Council I sincerely hope that a bit of balance is injected into this debate and into this narrative because at the moment the narrative is about terrorism and it's about Israel's right to defend itself which I think is partly why the Americans veto this in fact the Ambassador actually said we wanted something in the resolution about Israel's right to defend itself but make no mistake that when you you talk to Palestinians and other Arab countries about this there are three causes underlying causes of the conflict which must be addressed first of all the blockade of Gaza which has seen 2.3 million people subjected to utter indignities and that has to end it's an invisible thing it's not a new story you can point a camera at but it from a Palestinian perspective is the first cause of the conflict that must be addressed secondly the occupation that's gone on since 1967 and what we've seen with the last Administration that the rightwing the far right settler Administration is we've seen increased settlement expansion Jewish settlers and with that has come the most appalling settler violence protected by the Israeli Army the BL the the the occupation is the second cause underlying cause the conflict the Palestinians would like to see address it and very lastly the dispossession of the Palestinians in 1948 their entire communities their societies were dismantled and and that has never been properly addressed so unless and until we see those three underlying causes of the conflict addressed in a wider debate perhaps in the general assembly I think that Israelis are destined to live in a state of nervousness anxiety insecurity and the people of Gaza the Palestinians are likely to have further causes of resentment brutalization and radicalization so I hope that when this debate moves away from the security Council some balance can be rejected and the underlying causes of the conflict can be addressed as we move away from this Narrative of terrorism and Israel's rights defend itself of course Israel has the right to defend itself but we need to stand back and look at the underlying causes of this conflict thank you Chris thank you to all our guests I'm afraid we have to leave it there Chris gunnis Yousef Muna and Mukesh capila you'll find this program and all our
