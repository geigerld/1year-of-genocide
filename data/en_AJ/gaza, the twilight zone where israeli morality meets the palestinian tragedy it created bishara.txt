Maran bashara Maran what do you make of these extraordinary pictures uh that we are that we've just been playing uh T Abu aom telling us that uh this incident taking place in the North in Northern Gaza very close to the area where that Pier was built to bring in humanitarian aid from the sea I mean it's it's just so distressing isn't it I mean you know probably certain words should be invented uh for this sorts of thing I'm not sure we do have sufficient vocabulary to describe um this sort of um Twilight Zone really it's a it's a it's quite the Twilight Zone between um Israel's fantasy of the most moral Army and here it is now in black and white for everyone to see there there's there's there's no hiding behind these pictures about what is happening there's absolutely no hiding and this is the thing right I mean it's a Twilight Zone because there is and remains today every day we hear the Israelis boasting of their most moral Army it's a fantasy that meets the reality of um a genocide an attempt to uh kill or destroy uh much of Palestine and the Palestinians there and to hide the evidence and to lie about it um every time you think uh over the past five months that Israel has hit bottom it somehow finds a new law it hits a new law you don't know how uh and continuously lies about it and um accuses the world of hostility and anti semitism so airing this and talking about it and really questioning the morality of this Israeli Army I suppose that we should also make us anti-semitic this is what it is I mean it's speaks for itself in the sense that um there's a situation now it has been for decades whereby Israelis try to decimate an entire people people by some mean or another whether it is through starvation through destruction Siege hunger famine displacement ethnic cleansing and so on and so forth so this has been going on and now we see these scenes and and you could definitely underline the fact that this is the culmination of impunity when the Israeli Army can do all of these things can get away with it it it can only then do more of it knowing that uh it will not meet uh any punishment you know I was just listening only a few moments ago to an interview by one of uh netanyahu's Minister one of Israel's Minister drummer for strategic Affairs believe it or not and he was explaining on Fox News why Israel just got back to aifa hospital with a command unit and I'm quoting him now Israel killed 170 terrorists in a shifa hospital and captured 700 terrorists at asifa hospital this Commando unit and it killed no civilians no civilians as if Ian I guess probably people in Israel officials and people need to stop watching Al jazer basically that's the problem right they don't watch Al jazer they don't watch the scenes the facts that we show in real in real in real time in real life what is going on what they are doing in Gaza so the problem is once again it's impunity and deception they do it they think they can get away with it and hence they do more of it we've seen it as this war unraveled now we see it on the beach of Gaza but let's remind ourselves that this has been the war on children and women 20,000 killed and probably 10,000 more are under the rebels it was and is a war on hospitals a war on civilians on doctors and nurses on professors academics Engineers on young people old people it's just been going on the United Nations has said it must stop instead Israel is intensifying the killing machine in Gaza Maron stay with us because I I am going to come back to you uh I just want to move
