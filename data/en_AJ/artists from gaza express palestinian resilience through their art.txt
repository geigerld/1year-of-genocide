these paintings mean a lot to me as a defender of the Palestinian cause I feel proud because being from Gaza I'm conveying to the outside world the extent of the destruction migration and displacement we're enduring I'm showing the outside world the extent of the suffering we are living in the Gaza Strip when I paint about the Palestinian cause I feel immense Pride we are fighting for our cause regardless of the Israel occupation that is trying to erase our cause and as a people of Gaza we are resilient and optimistic she's screaming and calling for somebody to help her against the blockade imposed by Israel this painting depicts a broken Diamond the isra believe they'll take control but at the top of the painting I use screen which represents a glimmer of hope that the war will end as an artist from Gaza who's enduring the same suffering that everybody is going through in the strip I'm trying to convey the emotions Within Me and the life I'm living in Gaza The Hope pain and the despair that I'm feeling these days people from Gaza are very proud We are attached to our land yes we have suffered immensely but we remain steadfast I have created several paintings that convey the suffering but no matter how much I draw it will never convey the whole picture the actual scenes and the pain are so much bigger and have taken over us every day we witness massacres and bloody scenes I try to express all these feelings on the walls and I try to paint everywhere I go my last mural was one of defiance I drew the map of Palestine in an attempt to convey the extent of our attachment to our cause make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
