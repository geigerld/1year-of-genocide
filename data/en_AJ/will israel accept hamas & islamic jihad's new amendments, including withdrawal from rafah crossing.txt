now to Imran Khan who's over in the Jordanian Capital Aman and Imran of course these developments are just coming through to us in the past uh 45 minutes or to or so talk us through what we know so far about hamas's response well what Hamas have told Al jazer is there are amendments they want to the ceasefire proposal firstly uh what they're saying is they want a complete withdrawal from the entire Gaza Strip and that includes uh the Rafa Crossing and the Philadelphia Corridor the Philadelphia Corridor is basically the border between Egypt and uh the Gaza Strip now uh that was delivered by uh is Hanah uh the political bureau chief of Hamas all the way to the Prime Minister and foreign minister of Qatar and the Egyptian mediators Hamas have now responded to this they want to talk but they have these amendments it's all about whether Israel now is willing to accept those amendments the fact that Hamas have responded actually means that there is a movement on these ceasefire talks these ceasefire talks had actually stalled for a very long time Anthony blinkin the US Secretary of State has been in the region and he has always said during his visit over the last couple of days that this is about Hamas Hamas need to respond Hamas the onuses on Hamas to be able to say yes to the deal well Hamas have now responded so that kind of goes away now so uh Hamas also about four or five hours ago said that they were willing to send negotiators they so Hamas are now playing ball effectively but Israel has a problem now and here's the the effective problem prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been absolutely clear about the endgame of his war on Gaza he wants to dest destroy Hamas both politically and militarily he hasn't changed that effective um plan but now Hamas have responded they want to talk this is going to be very difficult for Israel uh to actually go oh maybe we can't talk about this because this was an American resolution in the security Council so there you go what we're what we're seeing now is Hamas responding Israel now having to go back and say well how much of that response can we deal with so it's going to be a very difficult negotiation um for the Americans for the Ceres and for uh the uh Egyptian mediators but the fact that it's actually happened is incredibly important and and Imran let's talk about this uh it amounts to essentially a push back from Hamas the demand for a complete withdrawal is you mention of Israeli forces from Gaza how does that sit politically do you think with Netanyahu a demand like that given the pressure that he's under from the far right well the far right part of his government have always been very clear go in flatten Gaza and Destroy Hamas that's something the Prime Minister has said publicly we need to destroy Hamas politically and militarily so the fact that Hamas are now saying well you need to withdraw from the entire Gaza Strip uh including Rua and the Philadelphia Corridor is not going to sit well there's a political consideration here 64 seats of the Israeli knesset that's all it takes for prime minister Benjamin NYU to remain in power as long as he has those 64 seats in the knesset he can actually stay in power and resist American pressure International pressure because the Coalition internally within the government is still holding the minute he starts to kind of weaken that Coalition by saying okay so maybe we withdraw our troops if that's what it takes to get a ceasefire maybe that's what it takes to get our captives out that's going to have an impact on the political future of this we're in this weird position an where domestic politics domestic desire to stay in power in Israel is actually influencing foreign policy that's what's going on right now Netanyahu has the Coalition and the Coalition is backing him but he's under so much International pressure the Americans have just pushed forward a resolution in the union Security Council that's legally binding the Irish the Spain uh the Spanish and other countries have recognized Palestine as a state there's the icg ruling uh there's the ICC ruling there's all of this International pressure upon him but he can resist it because he has the domestic votes that he needs to stay in power that's really the problem that uh the International Community faces because he's still in power and this is something that he can resist but the Americans are very clear they've been pushing the ceasefire plan for a long time now and Hamas have responded and the American response the American position was always well Hamas need to respond well now they've responded all right um for now
