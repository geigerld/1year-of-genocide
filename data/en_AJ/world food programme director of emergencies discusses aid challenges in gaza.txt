thousands of Palestinians are gathering on Al rashed Street in Gaza waiting for the arrival of flower and vital Aid some trucks managed to enter the strip but the limited supplies will only help a small fraction of the population Israel allows any a trickle of Aid into Gaza despite un warnings about critical famine conditions Samir Abdul Jabar is the director of emergencies at the world food program and joins us now live from Rome Mr ABD ja good to have you with us on the program sir in all the confusion and the various news lines that the audience are expected to digest over the war in Gaza the reasons behind why the world food program has suspended its operations can sort of get lost in all of the information can you just remind us why you've suspended deliveries to Northern Gaza and how long this may last sorry can you hear me now yeah we can hear you clearly sir did you get my question yes thank thank you very much soil and and I have to say that we are very alarmed also on that decision to pose the the assistance to the north one because there are many desperate civilians that are in need for our support but the reality on the ground is that we were able only to do little six Convoy since the beginning of the year two in in in February and uh under very very difficult situations that was putting the people receiving the aid at risk so we had to take that very tough decision for us and for the people to protect them uh but we are looking for every way to revert that decision and and and continue the assistance in a way that protects their lives and just to confirm because I think you really answered my next question is what is getting into Gaza you just mentioned six trucks there since the beginning of the year and and how quickly is it getting through those Israeli administered checkpoints not very quickly it seems so it's six convoys each Convoy of 10 trucks but I I think you touched on a very important point the delays at the checkpoints are making it impossible for us to reach deeper into the northern Gaza where there are lots of people that are in need of the assistance and that has been putting our convoys but also the people at risk um and that's why we've been actually negotiating with all parties to make sure that they make it a speedy access for us so safe Roots is is one of our requirements to continue assistance in the north and that can only be guaranteed if there is a speedy process for uh uh our convoys to move into the north can you give us an idea of the bottleneck um of Aid on the Egyptian side of uh the the Border as such trying to get into Gaza I mean what is waiting there to get into Gaza so we have enough food across the borders even from Jordan and and Egypt U to be able to support 2.2 million people I think all we are asking for and I think I think if like you mentioned earlier the ceasefire materializes we need to make sure that we have the right access into Gaza from different Crossings so that we can actually reach the people whether they're in the North or the south of the central areas uh the reports that you were showing earlier is is is showing the amount of desperation that we are voicing as well and that's why we need to make sure that we're reaching people and and making sure that where wherever Crossing that is open we're actually izing in a in a safe way for the people but also for our own staff in recent weeks we've seen statements made at the international court of justice about Aid getting into uh Gaza and food not being used as a weapon of War we've heard appeals at the UN Security Council in recent days from various Aid agencies explaining how difficult and how dire the situation is what reasons if you can tell us diplomatically what reasons do the Israelis give for those delays of Aid trucks not being able to get through the border from Gaza to Rafa I think has that has to be clarified I think there there will be a briefing to the security Council later this week on uh uh 2417 Security Council resolution uh I think let let's wait to see what would come out in the recommendations there because uh definitely we are advocating with all stakeholders involved in the conflict uh to make sure that we are able to avert any any risk of famine by reaching the people in in different areas we need to make sure to we're able to get the the sufficient levels of food into the the uh communities uh we need to make sure that we're looking at the malnutrition situation and the health situation and the Water Crisis and make sure that we are actually addressing this uh um collectively because that is the only way for us to avert all those risks that are affecting the civilians you mentioned the word famine there and of course we're now seeing the first examples of famine and a two-month old baby having died the alarm Bells have been ringing from the UN and the world food program about this as the world food program who do you call when you start hearing about this scenario unfolding famine children dying who do you call and speak to and say look we've got to alleviate this we've got to sort this out obviously the UN Secretary General will be my first point of point of contact so the the IPC that was issued in December is actually 18 agencies they work on it um and there is an update that's going to be done in in in March um that is how famine is declared I think at the moment the situation for us is terrible it's it's really worrying and I was listening to the report that H did just before I joined the call and and and I think we only can relate I just left that operation recently and I can relate to my own colleagues on the ground who have gone through those situation and still going through those situation where they need to secure for their own kids the food and and clean water and and and Health Services so I think the situation is really dire and and and we're doing everything we can we're talking to everyone we should be talking to to make sure that we're actually flagging that risk and and looking at M mitigation measures that allows us to reach people at scale it's not just about preaching them I think it's about preaching them in sustained a scalable way that they can trust that the humanitarian assistance can be reverting all of those risks that they're going through for the update thanks very much for joining us may Abdul Jaa from the world food program in Rome thanks for your time sir thank you very much
