in southern Gaza the Israeli Army issued evacuation orders for tens of thousands of Palestinians in eastern Rafa 1.5 million people who fled the attacks elsewhere in the strip have been seeking refuge in the city many of them in tents and makeshift shelters the United Nations says around 150,000 Palestinians have already left Rafa as Israel steps up its ground attacks the EU is calling Israel's evacuation orders unacceptable my children and I ran under Fire and people died in front of us the shrapnel hit our faces the houses were hit by strikes while we were running our situation is so bad while we were running my children and I hurt our legs I found a shoe on the road and I wore it to be able to run better we're running we have no money our situation is very hard and I came here but there's no place to stay we left but do we know where went heading no we don't imagine the stress anxiety lack of comfort I Can't Describe for you even if my eyes don't tear my heart is crying we are sad and depressed our children are very tired we don't have water we hardly get food and we struggle with everything the United Nations is warning that food supplies in southern Gaza are going to run out within hours Israel's blocked Aid deliveries in the past week but humanitarian agencies are calling for the immediate entry of supplies including fuel the closure especially Rafa Crossing um and K abalum has severed access for us to fuel to supplies and the movement of humanitarian staff it's also affected the movement of any civilians that could go out to medical evacuation world food program in Ura will run out of food for distribution uh in the South uh by tomorrow that means people will be left only with what has already been distributed uh in their in their shelters and their homes and on site as of today um we have 12 bakeries supported by humanitarian Partners here in South Gaza eight have ceased to operate due to lack of fuel in stock and four that are still operating have reduced capacities we'll be out of that stock by Monday a lack of fuel supplies has left many hospitals in the area close to collapse Julie dger has this report let me warn you some of you might find the images in a report disturbing 7 months of displacement and forced to flee yet again the Israeli military is ordering further evacuations in eastern Rafa but as Palestinians try to leave bombs are raining down leaving people scrambling to find safety in Gaza where every corner is a Target and no life is spared we are leaving because of our fear and due to coercion we are leaving for the unknown and there are no safe areas at all all the areas left are insafe the United Nations says about 150,000 Palestinians have left Eastern Rafa Israel is forcing them towards what it claims is a humanitarian Zone in al- maasi Aid groups have described conditions there as horrific but options for desperate Palestinians are rapidly diminishing what should we do here do we wait until we all die on top of each other so we decided to leave it's better as the Israeli military presses ahead with its PL to launch a full scale offensive in Rafa air strikes have been unrelenting elsewhere bodies are piling up in darl Bala in central Gaza another area where many Palestinians have fled but found no safety here they are in pieces here is my sister-in-law without a head my aunt also without a head what is this Injustice until when will this be going on we're exhausted just the injured here have nowhere else to go Aid is critically low with Israeli forces still blocking the entry of trucks into the strip as Palestinians trapped inside remain in a cycle trying to evade death Julie dger Al jazer Muhammad Al m is joining us now he's a political analyst he's also professor of media studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies good to have you back on Al jazer I want to talk to you about the words that are being used in uh this now we're used to to kind of judging the semantics and the phrasing that's used when it comes to ceasefires when we're talking about Rafa they're also important aren't they because from the start the Israeli government the Netanyahu Coalition had said they were going out for an allout assault in Rafa the Biden Administration in the US said nope major assault is not what we're going to accept we seem to I seem to get a feeling that there is a dialing back of the of the words that are being used what's your assessment of what is being said to describe what's happening in Rafa now and how that might play out might dictate what Israel does on the ground right I think it's really interesting um I've actually been following that discourse on Rafa for for many weeks now and uh what I noted is that uh the US was more or less saying that they were opposed to an operation in Rafa that it would be a disaster uh we heard Kamala Harris come out two months ago and say Israel is the one who told those people to go to Rafa so the the US was making it clear that they didn't want any kind of an operation in Rafa and then uh suddenly they sort of switched up and said they oppose they oppose a major operation in Raa and what I read into that is that it's actually Israel that's exerting a lot of political control over the United States not the other way around it's not the US exerting control over Israel but it's actually Israel exerting control in other words what's happening on the ground is that Israel makes it clear that it's not going to take the US's quote unquote advice and that it's going to do what it wants to do and so the US is sort of forced to shift its rhetoric uh and make it appear as though it's more or less uh uh you know that Israel is more or less in line with what the US uh with with what the US wants um and I think that's what's been happening for the better part of 7 months it's been the it's been Israel not willing to take the US's advice uh and doing whatever it wants on the ground and it's been hurting U the US Administration you gave us an example uh briefly just when we were talking about an hour ago where you said that spilled over into the way that the US was interpreting um the negotiations over the ceasefire as well in terms of what they demanding from Hamas yeah so what was happening for many weeks the US was saying in these press brief briefings and statements that they were putting out is that Hamas uh hamas's refusal to accept a ceasefire was the only thing standing in the way of Peace in in Gaza and then last week Hamas came out and sort of called the US's Bluff and said okay we accept we accept the ceasefire um and then the the Israelis came out and rejected that ceasefire much to the shock and I think embarrassment of the United States they had Bill Burns uh in the region negotiating the terms and I think he was quite pleased that Hamas agreed to it so Israel then rejects it so then the US shifted its rhetoric they could no longer say that the the only thing standing in the way of Peace was hamas's refusal to accept a ceasefire so they switched up and now they're saying for the last few days if you watch the Press briefings they're saying the only thing standing in the way of peace is hamas's refusal to put down its weapons and surrender so that's a subtle shift but I think an important shift um in terms of the Dynamics between the Netanyahu Coalition and the and the Biden Administration in the US um for those of us watching around the world it seems as though politically it's the Biden Administration who's losing out on all of this rather than the Netanyahu Coalition as we're getting closer of course to the US elections in November this is going to be a significant factor do you think that we're going to see a change in the rhetoric from the Biden Administration as we heard head towards those elections well we have a lot of data now and the more we get of data the worse it looks for Biden in November there was a really interesting poll done by uh Newsweek just last week uh and they found that 39% of American college students are now identifying as Pro Palestinian compared with only 11% ident identifying as Pro Israel this is very significant um there's also a lot of opinion polling data that you look at the the swing States for instance 538 is noting that Biden Trails Trump in all seven of those uh essential uh swing States these are states that Biden absolutely has to have in order to win the election so things look really bad so you're right I think that there might be uh more rhetoric from the Biden Administration criticizing uh criticizing Israel trying to sort of save face trying to win back some of these young voters but the question that I have and that I've had all along is um is it too little too late has has Biden already sort of committed uh political suicide here it's always interesting to get your thoughts on this Muhammad alash we appreciate it thank you very much make
