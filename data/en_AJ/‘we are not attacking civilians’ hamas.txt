bring in now osam hamdan he's the Hamas senior spokesman joins me on the phone good to have you with us so first of all we understand Hamas Fighters are currently engaging uh with Israeli forces inside Israel what is the point of their operation right now well thank you for having me uh was clear that the the whole operation is a response for the Israeli attacks against Alamos Jerusalem and and West Bank uh and I have to say that there was a great a big message for the Israelis the Palestinian uied lands is still a Palestinian lands regardless to the presence of the settlements and the settlers and there will be a time that those lands will be evacuated from the Israelis and it will be back for the Palestinians this is the the important idea of still fighting on our occupied lands and uh uh the year 1948 all right you're fighting as you say to end the occupation but why is Hamas attacking civilians well there was no attack against the civilians all what was declared by let me jump in there Mr hand down if I may because a statement by the UN Secretary General clearly says that he's appalled by reports civilians have been attacked and abducted from their own homes and we've seen videos in fact of what looks like israeli's been taken into Gaza are you saying the UN secret General is wrong the pictures we've seen wrong this well this is very important point to be uh figured uh through the last 20 years Israel hold attacks againsta and killed thousands of Palestinians civilians and no one has any comment uh I I I watched president uh Biden talking about standing beside Israel and and its attacks against the Palestinians it's a kind of hypocrisy he's not talking about the Palestinians who are being killed yesterday a whole family te members family shabat family were killed this night by Israeli bombing in an air strike and on their own house where there is no militants there they were only civilians uh while when you are talking about the settlers you are not talking about civilians like the Palestinians you are talking about settlers who are armed who came but if I the Israelis if the Israelis are targeting and killing innocent Palestinian civilians that does not mean in international law it's acceptable for Palestinian groups to Target and kill isra civilians right it's not accepted to attack civilians according to international law so so that to come back to my question why let me if I may read to a statement by Amnesty International which is condemning the targeting by Israel of Palestinian civilians but it's also condemning in a statement by October the 7th saying Palestinian armed groups must refrain from targeting civilians and using indiscriminate weapons acts amounting to war crimes is amnesty wrong well I have to say that you have to differentiate between the settlers and the civilians the settlers according to the international law they are not civilians they are they they attack the Palestinians the they they in fact shoot it against the Palestinians so you have to differentiate between both issues the civilians and the settlers who are not according to the international law civilians and under international law firing Rockets which is what amnesty is saying firing Rockets are indiscriminate weapons that can hurt and do hurt civilians well we hope we hope that amnesty can uh urge the International Community to either to make an end for the Israeli occupation or to urge them to send uh uh more developed weapons to attack just only the the soldiers uh because we are not targeting on purpose the civilians you know there is a huge amount of Civilian targets inside occupied lands 1948 which Hamas is not aiming on or targeting them we have declared that the s they are part of the occupation and the settlers they are part of the Armed Israeli power they are not normal civilians as they are named all the C some some of these towns though are are in the southern areas of Israel we're not just talking about settlements in the West Bank well uh we everyone knows that those are settlements and if you are talking about sidro it's a settlement if you are talking about it's a settlement those are settlements on our occupied lands 1948 everyone have to understand that the Palestinian lands is a whole complete land from sea to River and the Israelis who are who who who signed the oo agreement even they they did not implement the agreement and they are still taking over the Palestinian lands so what what the Israelis are doing they are telling the Palestinians there is no hope for the Palestinians to have their independent state blink when he paid a visit to R I'm sorry ask you to hold on for a second there is a live press conference we're going to listen into right now we'll come back to you in a minute so do stay with us all right we're waiting to uh get in some live translation in so we can hear what the Israeli Army is saying in this press conference I believe we have it now so let's listen in the Army is has launched a large scale offense against Gaza STP and we are targeting Hamas leaders we have superiority in terms of uh Firepower and we will disclose the results accordingly the Air Force as well as the Army personel have harnessed all their capabilities and they will be put to maximum use in the coming hours we will also use artillery and we will continue with our large scale offensive against Gaza all right so we uh caught there the remarks of Daniel hagari there saying a large scale offensive will continue let's bring in Sam hamdan he's a spokesperson for Hamas and uh you heard the vows not only there but Israel's prime minister vowing to turn Hamas sites into Rubble what's your response to that all right we seem to have lost uh the connection there with aaman we'll try and uh maybe we can try again all right let me try again so Mr Sam hamdan if you can hear me now we are hearing the vows there from the Israeli military but also before that from Israel's prime minister Benin Netanyahu is vowing to turn Hamas sites into Rubble what's your response to that yes well they have been doing that for the Palestinian people for the last seven decades and the Palestinians are still standing fighting for their cause Israel has to understand that they can't get rid of the Palestinians they they are the land of owners and they have their own right to build their own State Hamas will fight like the Palestinian people there will be sacrifices we understand that we know the consequences but we have also understand that at the end of the fight the Palestinian people will keep standing against the occupation and we will win our fight they have left Gazza and they will leave other parts of our lands we will determine we we will decide our future by ourselves Israel cannot keep controlling the life of the Palestinians and the International Community have to understand that the problem in the region the unstability in the region is because of the presence of Israel nothing else if Israel launches a ground defensive what will that mean for the people of Gaza well it will be uh a very big Massacre by the Israelis as they have done that from uh uh 1948 up till now uh but also they will not uh play a game it will be a very tough time for the Israelis not in Gaza only everywhere in Palestine and maybe from other places not only in Palestine all right we'll leave it there thank you so much hamdan
