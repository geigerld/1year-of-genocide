Trump began his 2024 campaign by glorifying the failed violent insurrectionist Insurrection at our on our Capital the guy who claims Law and Order SWS lawlessness and disorder Trump's not concerned about your future I promise you Trump is now promising a fullscale campaign of Revenge and retribution his words right let's speak now to John hendin who's in Bluebell Pennsylvania uh this is a major sort of tone setting speech for the Biden campaign presumably its location was chosen pretty carefully that's right Biden really announced his 2024 campaign here and he did it in Pennsylvania for very important reasons for one thing it's a key swing state he won by only one percentage point last time around but he also gave this speech right near Valley Forge Valley Forge is where George Washington in 177 7 camped out with 12,000 troops and that became really the Cradle of American democracy because the US had declared its independence from England a year earlier but it still had to fight to actually gain this fledgling democracy it was trying to create and Biden is saying that's what needs to happen now that the US needs to fight for democracy he will preserve it Donald Trump won't in his words uh and that's why it it was launched here in the state where Biden was born and he also did it at a key time this speech was supposed to be given a day later on January 6 on the 3D anniversary of those January 6 uprisings in Washington that Donald Trump is now accused in a court case in Washington of leading he's using this as an example Biden is of the threat that he says Donald Trump poses to democracy and so if his case is going to be about Biden as a defender of democracy and and really setting himself against this m major threat he describes in Trump how convincing a campaign case do you think that will be for the American voters well he started out strong today uh he spoke with volume and forcefulness that you don't always hear out of Biden and that's probably because he is passionate about this subject he's told people one of the reasons he went into this race in 2020 was to defeat Donald Trump and that's what he wants to do again in 2024 even though some polls suggest that's going to be a challenge for him Trump has only risen in the polls on the Republican side it's also important to point out that neither of these guys has won their party's nominations that happens later in the summer but Biden seems confident he's got no real rival uh Donald Trump is 50 percentage points ahead of his nearest rival in polls so Biden just jumped ahead to the end to the general election and made this all about Donald Trump who he mentioned more than 30 times in his speech all right John Hunden there in P Pennsylvania thank you very much for that
