let's bring in Maran bashara alzer's a senior political analyst he's joining us today via Skype from Paris Maran I'm wondering whether the debate performance and and everything we've seen subsequently from Biden is eclipsing the issue of Gaza in Michigan but I mean none of it is good news for Biden look generally speaking as I wrote uh on our website al.net uh back in uh was it. back last August Last Summer age is going to be a defining act uh factor in this election there's absolutely no doubt about that and a lot of these other important issues including the economy apparently is going to come second and because the age is already playing uh such an important role four months before uh the November elections I think that's really putting a lot of burden on Biden and really undercutting or diminishing uh his ability to influence events including in the Middle East including the question of for example of a ceasefire in Gaza and so on I want to come back to the ceasefire question in just a moment B but but just sticking with what's happening in Michigan because we do expect Biden there in in just a few hours the governor Gretchen whitner's name has been very high on the list of Biden Alternatives I see she is saying though that she won't run she's sticking by Biden but she did say very revealingly after that debate that she thinks that he's entirely lost Michigan is there do you think any coming back for the Democrats and for Biden especially given feeling on Gaza now too you know these are incredibly dramatic moments dramatic times uh for the question of America and the Middle East and the question of Elections and why do I say incredibly dramatic you know we Define drama uh it's a human choice between two irreconcilable Goods or between two EV evil for the Arab Americans who think of Middle East and Israel Palestine and so on as a driver for their vote this is a choice between two evils they think of both Biden and Trump are horrifically bad for the Palestinians for democracy in the Middle East for freedom in the Middle East for justice in Palestine and so on so forth for the pro-israel uh voices in the United States for the Pro occupation voices in the United States this is a question of twoo irreconcilable goods for them Trump is great and Biden is absolutely great whom to choose for the Palestinians the difficulty is choose between bad and worst for the pro- Israelis in the United States it's that choose between two irreconcilable Goods that are complete opposite Trump or B we don't know and it's really difficult to answer for for example Arab Americans in Michigan what should they do next really these are these are personal choices in the end of the day so as you say the perceptions of of who might take office are playing into ceasefire efforts as well I mean there have been suggestions that Netanyahu is waiting just waiting for for a trump White House and and he's wanting to drag out the war until then how is the upheaval that we're now seeing the political upheaval in the US how's that playing into ceasefire talks well you know there's absolutely no doubt that Netanyahu is trying to run the clock on Biden I am not as sure as he is that Trump is going to be even better uh than Biden I don't think in recent American in history in the Middle East there was a a more supportive unconditionally of Israel than Biden the way he supported Israel's genocide the past 8 months n months is really unprecedented so when Trump comes it if he ever comes and becomes president I am not really sure he he's still hurt by nany remember he used the fword against Netanyahu he thought he was betrayed by Netanyahu and he is in the end of the day not a Zionist per se he's a transactional president who really thinks that many American Jews are betraying him even though he is more favorable to Israel than the Democrats and so on so forth so there is that netan trying to run the CL the clock on Biden because there is diplomatic pressure but in the end of the day I think for again for many uh Arab Americans for many progressives and others in the United States the question is not just about who's worse on the question of Palestine there's also many other important questions about Justice freedom and human rights that face the United States and the next president that are just as important for many Americans come November Al ja's senior political analyst M Bashar there speaking to us today from Paris thank you m always great your thoughts make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
