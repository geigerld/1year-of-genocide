now un Secretary General Antonio gues has used his most powerful diplomatic tool known as article 99 to try and stop Israel's killing of Palestinians in Gaza he's directing the security Council to discuss the quote humanitarian catastrophe and is calling for an urgencies fire it is a very powerful move on behalf of the Secretary General and we hope that members of the security Council will be moved by it and we hope the International Community will be moved by it to uh to push and put in place a humanitarian ceasefire in response Israel accused the UN chief of bias against Israel saying a ceasefire would only embolden Hamas a comment now on un Secretary General Antonio gutter's Kafkaesque step to invoke article 99 of the UN Charter the Hamas October 7th Massacre was a threat to International Peace and security calls for a permanent ceasefire that would leave our hostages in Gaza and the Hamas Terror regime in power are also a threat to International Peace and security Israel's efforts to dismantle the Hamas Terror organization in response to the October 7th Massacre are designed to uphold and restore International Peace and security well let's go to Imran Khan who's in Tel Aviv for us now Imran and you know a pretty contemptuous really response that to uh the best efforts of the un's Secretary General and that's pretty much the same response Israel has given to all shows of of of pressure by countries around the world that's absolutely right it's always been the same Playbook condemn uh the United Nations accuse them of bias anti-israeli bias on occasion accuse them of being anti-semitic it's been followed up actually by comments from the foreign minister Eli Cohen who says Garis actions constitute support of the Hamas terrorist organization he goes on to say anyone who supports World Peace must support the liberation of Gaza from Hamas the Israeli ambassador to the UN Gillard Eran also said the UN needs a Secretary General who supports the war on terror and not a Secretary General who acts according to the script written by Hamas now uh that's the reaction from here but article 99 is about calling uh for a humanitarian ceasefire Israel couldn't even agree on getting in fuel into the strip humanitarian Aid into the strip there was a fraud security coun cabinet meeting last night where there was intense disagreement eventually they did agree but not the amount of fuel that the US wants to get in and nowhere near the amount of fuel the Palestinians need in Gaza Israel is very bluntly not in the mood for any kind of compromise right now and we keep hearing that so how far this ceas calls for ceasefire go within the UN it needs a Buy in from the United States and that's simply not happening right now Imran Khan with the latest from Tel Aviv thanks Imran
