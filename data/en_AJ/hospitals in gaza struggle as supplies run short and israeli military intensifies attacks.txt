ner is a medical student at the Islamic University of Gaza she's originally from Rafa n left earlier this month and she went to Egypt she's joining us from there thank you very much indeed for being with us can you describe to us what things were like when you were working before you decided to leave yeah thank you um for having me yes so uh as a medical student whose uh med school got bombed whose education was interrupted I just um found I don't know like the best decision for me to do is really just like to go and volunteer at hospitals and the thing is like life in Gaza currently and for the past 7 to eight months um the problem there is that you never know what the right thing or the wrong thing to do if you want to like stay alive or survive or if you want to be safe right like for example me going I started to volunteering at Nar Hospital in ra and that hospital is like around um about 20 minute walk from my house so I used to walk there and going there like on my way there like you you wouldn't you you couldn't know if it would be safe for me to walk there and obviously i' be walking because there's no gas and no fuel for cars like to find transportations the best uh thing to find would be like an you know hopping on an animal car and that wouldn't be always available and like a lot of people find it funny me like wearing scrubs and uh you know like writing on them and get to the hospital but most of the time I'll be walking and on my route from my house to the hospital there's so many houses and places that got bombed and that's the thing like they were bombed just not at the time I was walking by but if they did like if they were bombed when I was walking by I wouldn't I wouldn't be alive now that's the thing you know like um everywhere is risky um there's no place that you could you know you could look at and be like yeah okay I can be here and be safe you know and then when I get to Anar well that's a hospital un like proven by what what's been happening for the past seven to eight months hospitals themselves are even could be even considered even more risky than other places so yeah so I get there um I start volunteering at the emergency department and the ortho emergency department I I personally used to deal with um at least 100 patients per shift like we used to work on um I used to work in 24hour shifts and because especially at the time because like everybody was asked to move to the South and especially to ra and I think about ra I'm originally from RAF the thing about RAF just before October happened we were always like for years now we're always you know like protesting and calling for um a building of a hospital in RAF so RAF does not technically does not really have a hospital like not like shif or n any of the like the big kind of bigger kind of medical complexes that we have in other cities ra never really had a hospital and that was like one of the problems I could be intentional of asking people to move the South because Gaza City has more infrastructure more more institutes more hospitals more equipment more of kind of everything and asking people to go to the South is um really getting them to places where they're all already you know like less resources and all that so the UN hospital is really small but we had to deal with so many cases all the time you know like really just like starting with infections as simple as upper respiratory infections and U you know gastritis and like some gastric infections and also casualties from uh the bombings as well and we were always like working you know on the floor and um there has always been limitations on everything I studied the at school Pro years I did not study for so long but I learned some things and what what I was experiencing and what I was working at the hospital was so different than anything I ever learned like interrup you but I do want to ask you about that I mean obviously we around the world have been watching the pictures of the the the injuries and the suffering that people have been going through in in Gaza you have been there you have been in the hospitals of people have been coming in with with injuries who are are suffering can you describe to us what life has been like as you and your colleagues have been trying to work through the numbers of people who've been coming in to get treatment exactly that's what I was about to actually talk about like um I had to learn how to prioritize who lives or dies kind of like who we actually work on who we use our limited resources on who like I I hate to say this but like who deserves to be worked on who deserves you know like to use the limited resources and equipment and instruments and medication that we have on I also had to learn how um how to you know like prioritize who to give local anesthesia like when we're stitching you know like some patients even like if available if it's available we have to prioritize who we give it to like I personally had to stitch hands of mothers who just lost their babies who just lost their children without even being able to give them local anesthesia where I was you know stitching their hands um it was um you know like the resources part was really horrible there were no beds like n hospital had like around 63 beds and you're talking about a million and a half people who were like in ra at some point who needed like Medical Care at a lot of Cas like would go to Al Kuwait Hospital would actually also be referred to Anar because Anar is more like of a kind of bigger and more like you know the governmental hospital that had like more um kind of tools and devices so yeah so um we had to work on them on the ground um yeah no I want to ask you I mean you've obviously moved to Egypt as we mentioned what was it that made you decide to to leave obviously your medical training The Limited as you say training that you had is vitally important there clearly must have been a very strong reason for you to to want to leave Gaza yeah I never wanted to leave Gaza and I um it breaks my heart every day um since I got here um the thing is like my family already left U because um it just it it only got um more unsafe being there and um everybody everything was just stopped like they couldn't continue working on anything my um my siblings could not continue any of their education or anything like that um I personally stayed behind behind them and I was not really planning on leaving at all it only happened on Monday that was actually the last day when was working actually I woke up to the leaflets of evacuation orders to my house um asking us to leave and it was just like you know the only person left from my family and would I had to like at that point I had to find I don't know like make a tent for myself or find a place um for my only me like U to stay in and it just kind of like um did not sound very right to me like um I just I honestly just it was a mess what what happened so I really just like went to the border at 11: 11:30 people were there at seven um and I just left and I I it breaks my heart since please forgive me for interrupting you I am terribly
