hospitals in the southern parts of the strip are facing power outages as generators run dry sick and wounded patients face certain death if supplies aren't allowed in the director of the Kuwaiti hospital and Rafa has urged the International Community to provide desperately needed fuel the Zionist aggression is ongoing against our people in Rafa the Israeli Zionist forces hit more than half of the area and the world's still silent and unable to intervene we're now in the Kuwait Hospital which is the only operating Hospital in Rafa and it operates as a reception Point 24/7 we're sounding the alarm and urging the international Health Organization to live up to its responsibilities and provide the hospital with the necessary fuel to par the generators we want to urge every organization to live up to their responsibilities the Palestinian people must not be left alone to face their fate this Hospital still operating and has never been evacuated we will continue our efforts for the s of the patients and we're now trying to establish a field hospital as soon as possible well let's speak to Bridget Ros she's a midwife from the United States she's now been in Gaza for a month working at the emirati hospital she joins us now from der Al Bala Bridget I understand you've been working at the emirati hospital which is in Rafa you're now speaking to us in Dar Al Bala does that mean you've been [Music] evacuated um I've not really been evacuated quite yet but as the invasion continues um intoa there has been a huge displacement of patients um of people over 800,000 people have been displaced from Rafa so the census at Emira Hospital although still active is now low but you're a midwife can I ask you to reflect a little on what you've seen during the course of your work over the last month yes um at Emira Hospital in particular I've seen the bir of so many babies uh Emira Hospital a few weeks ago was the last functioning maternity hospital in all of Gaza Strip not just Rafa alone I have seen women who consistently have not had any prenatal care throughout their pregnancies women who do not get adequate postpartum care women who are suffering through kind of immense tragedy and pain as they're in this moment of their lives that's very significant of giving birth where there's supposed to be a lot of joy and love and support um I have seen a lack of supplies turn into no supplies in hospitals um it has been not only at maradi hospital but across the Gaza Strip the healthcare situation has become Beyond catastrophic obviously when you're dealing with any kind of complications around birth a lot of babies will need additional support you talk about that the lack of supplies we know there's been a lack of fuel we know there have been babies who who need to be incubated for for instance what is the situation right now yeah I think you make a really good point when it comes to fuel fuel I think um especially in a western context we think about it just for transportation but it's really important for everybody to know that fuel is literally what is running the Gaza Strip right now fuel is how we have electricity fuel is how hospitals stay on fuel is what allows incubators to stay on and with the closing of Rocka border um Crossing and the complete complete dwindling of supplies and fuel into Gaza we are constantly at risk of everything shutting down of babies dying because their incubators aren't working um we know that there's over 10 million tanks of fuel waiting outside of in Egypt um to come into Rafa and it is not here and it is so necessary bridet we understand there is some Aid including something well what's supposed to be four tankers of fuel now on its way into the Gaza Strip as a medical professional do you know where any of that might be going have you been informed of of who's going to receive any of these supplies I don't have specific knowledge of that as I don't operate in logistics but I know that fuel is always prioritized to hospitals sure um Bridget you you spoke about watching the births of so many children and so many women going through that experience in a in a very traumatic time of War can you explain a little bit to to our viewers about what that does to to a woman I imagine as a woman myself I can't even imagine giving birth in a war zone let alone what's happened in Gaza over the last 7even months that obviously has not only physical but mental consequences too I think it's really important to think about the framework of reproductive Justice reproductive Justice is a is the notion that women deserve deserve to give birth safely they deserve access to health care and that they deserve to raise their children in safe environments reproductive Justice does not exist in Gaza because of Israeli military violence because of the over 20 year long SE almost 20 year long siege that has been going on in Gaza because of the lack of resources because of the constant violence emirati hospital was deliver there was they were delivering over you know a, almost 12200 B of month a few months ago and now our census has dropped completely and that's because the patients have not only been displaced but they are afraid to go to the hospital Israel has had a systematic attack on all Health Care Systems not one hospital has been left unscathed by by their violence and this is extended to also the systematic killing of healthcare workers um the women need physiologically need a safe place in order to to go into labor in order to feel safe in their bodies and having a baby and none of that exists here Bridget roio there a midwife from the United States speaking to us there from Gaza where she's been working for a month at the emirati hospital thank you so much for your time Bridget we wish you all the best with your work make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
