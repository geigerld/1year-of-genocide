Africa has highlighted the Rwanda genocide during its case against Israel at the international court of justice it says the International Community failed to prevent the atrocities from being committed back in 1994 and warns history should not be repeated Victoria gon reports the genocide in Rwanda unfolded in full view of the world Belgian peacekeepers were tortured and murdered on the first day of the killings an appeal reinforcements was denied and as the number of those killed increased the United Nations security Council condemned the massacres but refused on the insistance of the US and the UK to use the term genocide US President Bill Clinton admitted regret when he visited Rwanda in 1998 we did not act quickly enough after the killing began we should not have allowed the refugee camps to become safe haven for the [Applause] Killers we did not immediately call these Crimes by their rightful name genocide a report published by Rwanda in 2021 found France bore a significant responsibility for not stopping the massacres despite prior knowledge they were being planned some estimates put the number of dead at around 800,000 France was accused of covering up its role in even protecting some perpetrators a French inquiry blamed the government for not foreseeing the slaughter and said it bore a serious and overwhelming responsibility but it absolved the French government of direct complicity The Killers who stalked the swamps the hills the churches did not have the face of France France was not an accomplice South Africa has filed a case against Israel at the international Court of Justice accusing it of carrying out genocide in Gaza and says history should not be repeated Rwanda stands out as a stem and severe rebuke to all of us for having failed for for the International Community having failed to prevent it from happening let us not have it live with the same regret when it comes to Palestine the international criminal Tribunal for Rwanda based in Tanzania convicted 61 people for their role in the killings hundreds of thousands Mo have faced trial in community courts in Rwanda 30 years on many see the failings that led to that genocide as a timely lesson and one that's never seemed more relevant Victoria gonb Al jazer well Charles Petri is former assistant Secretary General of the United Nations and United Nations Deputy coordinator in Rwanda during the 1994 genocide he joins us now from Aman good to have you with us you arrived with p P Tre in Rwanda about a month into the genocide tell us about your role there and the particular challenges you faced there as a un representative yes thank you for having me yeah no I arrived you're right um in May early May 94 a month into the genocide about half of the the people who were to be murdered were were killed um as the deputy humanitarian coordinator my responsibility was to try and get a better sense of what was happening on the ground reporting it to New York and then also facilitating um uh the activities of the different humanitarian Partners the first was actually quite challenging because there you know we we talk about the failure of the security Council in Rwanda I mean one has to remember that that the the security Council was addressing the the genocide in Rwanda barely four weeks after the withdrawal of troops from Somalia for me the failure Rwanda has paid paid the price for the failure of Somalia of the international operation in Som Somalia and that that really came to a head with the battle in Mogadishu early October when the US the US uh Special Forces lost I think up to 20 20 of their men and the us another internation another country decided that uh they weren't going to get involved in something that did not have a direct relevance to to national interests so you say that the UN Security Council deliberately failed Rwanda do you think that the same thing is happening today when we look at Gaza that the UN Security Council today is deliberately failing people there too uh well I I would say that Rwanda set the trend for what we've been seeing ever since uh I think I mean Somalia was was really the first postc Cold War intervention and there was an attempt to try and and sort of establish almost I mean it's it's pretentious to say but almost a new world order at least to get involved in in promoting some of the basic the the basic values and and it failed and as a result of the failure I think the the will of the International Community to get involved in something more more than direct national interests just dissipated so the the the man that our correspondent was talking to just then said that the world has not learned from the lessons of Rwanda would you agree with that I think the world has become almost darwinian so it's not a question of not learning it's it's a question of the forces that are that are confronting each other it's just what this new world order looks like and it makes it exceedingly difficult to sort of push through basic principles in in such a context when we talk about progress happening in Rwanda this drive for reconciliation we've heard a lot of people saying that it seems somewhat forced that it's too politicized when you're looking at Rwanda today are you seeing a nation that has healed or is there still a long way to go I think there's I mean one doesn't you know one doesn't heal overnight from from such a traumatic event um I mean look at Israel today and and how much the the Holocaust has defined the trauma of the Holocaust has defined the politics and and and Society it's exactly the same thing in Rwanda uh there's there's a trauma there there's I mean I'm not even sure time is is the the the only factor that will really help overcome that that trauma no I I I I think it's something profound and and uh and as a result something exceedingly complex to understand from outside as a witness to such a horrific chapter in in human history what of it do you carry with you uh I would say profound sadness uh um that I think many of us who were there have never been able to let go um and and uh you know the feeling that we were allowed to see uh what existed behind the veil of uh of normal social behavior you know not you know and and I think we've seen it even more I mean it's not specific to Rwanda specific to Africa it's it's we've seen uh we we were we were we were allowed to see a dimension of of of human nature that really exist exists and and has to be has to be it has to be understood that it exists and still to this day Charles Petri we thank you very much for taking the time to join us with your thoughts and experiences here on Al jaera thank you
