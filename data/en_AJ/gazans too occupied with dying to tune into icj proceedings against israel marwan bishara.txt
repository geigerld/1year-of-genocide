all right let's bring in Al senior political analyst Mar Bashar Mar as we see there that the terrible uh atrocities continue in Gaza don't they and I just want to bring this point to you the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin netan who is saying that Israel has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population it's fighting Hamas terrorists not the Palestinian population and we're doing so in full compliance with international law saying it's ahead of this icj uh case tomorrow that South Africa's we'll talk about in a minute but what do you make of that first of all I think the key word here is permanently that Israel will not permanently occupy uh the Gaza Strip of course Israel has for 56 years temporarily occupied uh West Bank Gaza and East Jerusalem it's always temporarily the biggest problem of all in international relations is when the temporary becomes permanent so while he's saying we're not going to do it temporarily I think no one takes him seriously because Israel has been occupying Palestinian lands for more than 56 years I think there's this there's a tone of desperation uh in the in the voice of uh prime minister Netanyahu especially when it comes uh after blinkin had apparently some tense conversation with the Israelis because you see I think we need to underline this once and again I mean Israel needs to be really grateful to the United States but not for the obvious reasons which is arming Israel financing Israel shielding Israel International Arena and so on so forth these are clear reasons why Israel needs to thank its stars for American uh assistant but above all today Israel should be grateful to America's advice the fact that Israel has not been listening the past three months makes it stupid I mean to put it simply and clearly because what Biden is telling the Israelis now for example is that there is a court the the the oldest the most the world's Court the icj the international court of justice is discussing your genocide you presumably the sons and the grandchildren of the Holocaust Survivors you are being accused of genocide and that's that's happening tomorrow morning at the ha Absolut the start of the process and there's a good case to be made and that's why the icj is discussing it and South Africa with a long history of being victim of aparted and and international silence and so forth is the one that's bringing the case with the international Court the fact that Israel would not even entertain for a good number of weeks now months humanitarian a to the Palestinians avoiding civilian casualties so much so that the American president talked about Israel indiscriminate bombings of Gaza which is a violation of international law and a war crime and so so forth that's by the American president himself so linkoln and other American officials have been urging the Israelis to act more diplomatically more humanely keep up the appearance at least at least the as the United States have been doing of respecting human rights and and the value of human life right but Israel has not been doing though until the last 48 hours now the United Israel is talking about allowing humanitarian in allowing the United Nations to go up to Gaza and finally the prime minister of Israel saying well you know we haven't really been killing it's Hamas been killing them it's desperate it's a bit too late unfortunately for okay we got a minute or so left Maran so this this case as I say coming before the the United Nations Top Court the icj hey tomorrow and what it's going to go on for some time for months maybe even years but what could come from it is this interim measure which would aim to Halt Israel's ongoing assaults uh what are the prospects of that do you think I think it's somewhere between possible and probable more I lean towards probable there's a very good case made by the South African I read it a couple of times the case is very strong against Israel for the way it conducted this war unfortunately I must emphasize that the Palestinians in Gaza will not be watching uh the proceedings of the court because they are too busy dying M they are too busy looking for shelter they are too busy looking for clean water and food in Gaza so the people who are being discussed at the hag absolutely have no time to watch because they are dying they are in hospitals and they are taking care of their loved ones so this will be somewhere between possible and probable hopefully there will be a decision by the court to ask Israel to seize and desist basically to stop the war until further discussions at the court will Israel listen probably not most probably not will the United States put then more pressure hopefully yes all right well we'll see how things pan out from Tomorrow Mar for the time being thanks very much
