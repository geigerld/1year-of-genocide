let's bring in Maha husseini she's a strategy director at the nonprofit euromed human rights monitor she's also a Gaza resident and joins us live from Gaza City Maha good to have you with us so you're in Gaza what does this outpouring of solidarity mean for you good morning um actually uh for Palestinians uh they have been failed by the International Community for the past 17 years especially Palestinians in the Gaza Strip where Israel has imposed uh ta a tight blockade on the G STP since 2006 following the uh legislative elections Hamas won uh so uh for for 17 or 18 years for gazans now and for 75 years for Palestinians as a whole since the uh Palestinian nakba in 1948 we have or Palestinians have been failed by the arational community that has allowed Israel to uh get away with its uh violations in many of the crimes that and the flagrant violations that have been committed against Palestinians since 1948 the United Nation itself and the um uh the International Community acknowledged that Israel has committed crimes that may amount to crimes against Palestinians including e ethnic cleansing and apartheid and um other mass killings of Palestinians and civilians but um this has been yeah I was going to just jump in Maha because we're pushed for time I mean in terms of the Here and Now many Israeli air strikes overnight you live in Gaza tell us uh what you saw and heard overnight uh in Gaza City actually it's been a very tough night here in Gaza uh one of the harshest nights we have witnessed for the past two years uh since 2021 uh particularly um Israel has been using actually concussion concussion bmps over uh neighborhoods and residential buildings these bums um are um are targeting several neighborhoods where we feel vibration in the ground and buildings before we hear rocking bombings and uh rocking the the the neighborhoods um this morning this early morning Israel has knocked down a 12 story building um here in the talawa street for example where I live in the south of Gaza uh we are bearing the brunt of this attack uh we have been uh witnessing uh bombings in on itial buildings every 5 minutes uh the uh explosions are rocking uh every place in Gaza is targeted now no place is safe um we can feel very well that any time at at any moment we can be targeted although we live in a completely civilian areas and residential buildings but it seems that Israel has been following this strategy for the past decade of inflicting the maximum damage to civilian property and civilians it's it's it's like part of uh its Collective punishment against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip or taking revenge on Gaza by the mass killings and inflicting the damage to the civilian properties the these incidents we have witnessed throughout the past uh 12 20 hours uh where Israel has completely knocked down at least presidential buildings housing offices startups and media offices and also clinics these offices prove have proven uh or these buildings have proven to be completely civilians um um managed mostly by startups and uh young people in Gaza who are running their businesses in these buildings um Maha we know that uh we've been reporting uh throughout the night and morning hundreds of Palestinians have already been killed uh and injured in Israeli air strikes there in Gaza where you are how is the health system coping what sort of update can you tell us about the difficulties and challenges facing what is a very fragile Health System anyway in Gaza well uh the health system in Gaza has already been collapsing uh as a result of the Israeli blockade since 2006 uh we have already been um facing difficulties even receiving proper medical treatment in the normal times in the regular times today um under military attacks the uh hospitals are over overwhelmed with the large number of people killed and injured uh Hospital have or the Ministry of Health has been calling on uh the residents of Gaza for blood donations uh we are talking about 44% of medications that are at zero stock in the Gaza uh hospitals already before the attack you can imagine now during the attack hospitals are uh um facing difficulties coping with a large number of people uh injured uh adding to this misery Israel has also targeted uh the Indonesian Hospital Hospital in the north of Gaza yesterday um killing at least one medical staff member and also inflicting damage to five ambulances uh also injuring a number of medical staff members according to the Ministry of Health so even staff members in the hospitals and medical facilities are can be and may be targeted at any moment adding to uh The Misery we have or Palestinians have already been living uh in the Gaza Strip uh and and we know the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned gazen residents to get out now um are people preparing for a possible ground offensive I mean this could be extremely costly uh in terms of Palestinian lives well Palestinians here in Gaza have started uh preparing their luggage and evacuating their homes and uh moving to relatively safer areas since the uh first hour of this attack since we have or uh Palestinians have heard that uh Palestinian armed factions have started uh an attack towards Israel they have already started before even the beginning of the attack because they know that uh the vast majority of areas and neighborhoods in Gaza would be targeted at any moment uh there is no need or there is no excuse for Israel to have uh or Israel does not have to to have an excuse to Target civilians we know very well that at any moment uh residential buildings can be targeted but the problem here and the the the crisis here is that um here in Gaza there is there are no shelters there are no tunnels or or um where people can hide or protect themselves so the only shelters people can seek or take refuge and are the unwa schools which have already been open for people who uh who were displaced uh especially people living in the Border areas and also people living in neighborhoods that have been targeted throughout the past few hours let me just get a final thought from you I mean what's what's your group doing uh on the ground in Gaza to help Palestinians uh who are bearing the brunt of these Israeli airri Ed monitor has been taret has been documenting these violations on the ground we have our staff members and field researchers on the ground uh conducting interviews and also documenting the violations on the ground uh we also have our staff members and our teams in Geneva now at the Human Rights Council uh who are um um advocating for uh the rights of Palestinians who have been uh actually uh with no voice for the past uh decades so uh we are now uh working on the ground but uh the problem is that our office also is located in one of the areas that have been heavily targeted uh throughout the past hours uh uh the office also inflicted some damages uh including uh the breaking of glass and doors Etc uh we have fear of uh the targeting of our staff members on the ground as well because we know very well that um uh this is this is another um uh air strike that has uh seemingly uh targeted my neighborhood again um we have been witnessing this for the past hours uh every five or 10 minutes uh we have been witnessing this amount of bumping uh that is very uh TSE and very immense um we can see actually smoke everywhere uh we can smell the uh air heavy with smoke and dust Etc so uh as I said uh I live in in a completely civilian area and a completely civilian uh place but every now and then I can see from my window okay uh the the the bumping and the smoke coming out of the buildings targeted yeah um Maha just in terms of your own personal safety and so on I mean you just recoiled there from what was uh a air strike near to where you are now um how do you and your family stay safe what do what do people do I mean we outside of Gaza we can never understand this kind of thing but you know what do you do when you have all these missiles raining down around you I mean there's no air shelters in Gaza what do you do exactly we don't we don't have anything to go or to do uh we already uh prepared our luggage our evacuation bags uh we have uh uh got the most important papers documents uh Etc and papers uh but uh when it happens we do not know what we can do actually we do not have anywhere to go uh we may go to other relatives homes or friends or Etc uh but until now we do not any place to go um the whole of the Gaza Strip has no show for civilians um um our most uh anxious fear uh let's say uh is that we can we we may be displaced to un schools like the thousands or dozens of thousands of civilians who are uh being U displaced now marah hus really really good to u to get your experiences and your thoughts in terms of what's happening around you uh as Gaza is being pounded by those Israeli air strikes many thanks indeed Maha stay safe will you thank you
