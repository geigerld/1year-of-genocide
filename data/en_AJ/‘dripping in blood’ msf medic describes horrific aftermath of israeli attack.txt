Javid Abdul MIM he is in uh the Gaza medical team leader for doctors with our borders he's with us from kanun in Gaza many thanks for joining the program the last week as we've been hearing has been one of the deadliest in Gaza since the War Began nearly 500 people killed in the last 10 days the pressure on medical facilities must be immense you've been treating patients at Nasa Hospital in kanun can you tell us what you've seen M thank you for having me uh in the last uh 3 4 days since Saturday we've had two Mass casualties at the NASA medical complex in the emergency room msf we run a 64 bed uh trauma unit with two operating theaters so of course we're invested in in in helping to manage the emergency room with the mass casualty events uh the the event on Saturday was exceeded any capacity that any health system the best of the world could uh could manage and that's not talking about the fact that we are on our knees we we were dripping in blood at the end of it the first case I saw was a three-year-old girl with her thigh uh peeled off her bone uh the second case I saw was a woman covered in dust uh she looked at me she was breathing it meant that she's globally okay but I took down the dressing on her belly and her a piece of abdomen a piece of bow was out and then suddenly a rush of healthcare workers fully dressed uh first aid responders in their uniform all injured it was so shocking to see healthcare workers injured in this way um uh and then I looked across at my nurse and and they were helping manage the airway of a boy that looked about 13 or 14 and she looked at me and and in a mass casualty if you have to manage the airway you have to call that person dead he was a boy none of us had the heart to call him dead and then the next one came in the next one came in and there were no beds and you're kneeling on the floor and you can feel your knee is wet with blood and you have to quickly decide who's more urgent and who's not this man looks like he has a brain injury he has to be left um for Dead uh this woman has her knee almost blown off take her straight to operating theaters very quickly uh all eight operating theaters in NASA medical uh complex were all the uh surgeons that were available were operating I still had two critical cases in the resuscitation room still surrounded by hundreds of patients in the yellow and green zone we had to try and send these patients somewhere one we kept with us waiting to go to the OT the other we sent to one of the local field hospitals even though he was unstable and shouldn't be moved I know that both those patients died this is in the context of looking up can I just say looking up in middle of managing all these patients and I saw my anaus colleague there and I was I said what why are you in here what's happened and he said I've just found out my house got destroyed and my family is in here somewhere and he subsequently found out that his nephew was killed and his two daughters were injured but thankfully alive and this was a strike in the soall humanitarian Zone on Saturday uh it it just goes to show that nowhere is safe and before mine before we even had a chance just to absorb what had happened the next morning we got a call from my nursing colleague in our clinic in Gaza City saying that his house had been destroyed and two of his three children were killed and his remaining child and wife were injured um it does it does carry on sorry clearly you are dealing with nonstop injuries from the non-stop targeting of the Israeli bombing and so on but are you also treating uh disease malnutrition how many cases of those are you seeing because increasingly we are hearing about the the problems related to sanitation and so on uh are also causing a lot of deaths there are um severe problems to do with sanitation water and sanitation and hygiene uh uh diseases and illnesses related to poor conditions for Hygiene feature High the top three or four condition out of five in the primary health care centers that we run as msf throughout um the middle area andus uh have skin infections diarrheal infections eye infections and scab infestation and those are classic water and sanitation hygiene related illnesses so that tells you that the response the facilities the provision of soap clean water latrines are are simply inadequate in this small area with regards to malnutrition we are running a severe acute malnutrition therapeutic feeding Center in Naser it is permanently full it is only of four beds we haven't seen what we would classify as a critical and emergency thresholds of man nutrition but the more vulnerable children people children with disabilities and other chronic conditions are the children that we're seeing come in with severe acute malnutrition and Dr NASA hospital was once the largest working Hospital in southern Gaza it's it's not been functional as a proper hospital since February of this year given that how challenging is it to treat patients I mean what are the biggest difficulties you are facing is it the lack of medicines is it the lack of equipment is it the lack of electricity Meen it's all of the above so given that nowhere is safe there are mass casualties seriously we had another one yesterday in the so-called humanitarian Zone uh we're operating in a context where fuel is not enough so that for example when NASA has to ration its Fuel and switch to a smaller generator we don't get water pumped to the uh inpatient Department the 64 beds that we have the operating theaters one Saturday last week we had no water across the whole department until 2 p.m. uh it means that they ration uh the air conditioning and that sounds like it's a frivolity but of course it's not when you have surgeons in this heat sweating into what should be a sterile field you have to cancel theaters so that they can cool down and and prevent uh infection uh our supplies have been uh minimally low we haven't had the supplies that we need so I've had to reduce the frequency of dressing changes for our Burns patients rather than doing every 2 or 3 days since June we've been doing it every 3 or 4 days it um absolutely essential medications for things like sedation fentanyl there's an internal Market Bar bartering that we have every day my Pharmacy manager with other NOS I was running I was within a week of rupturing fenil we need it for Sedation we need it for anesthesia we had an excess of sutures I did a swap with another NGO we're right now having surgical gowns tailored because we don't have surgical gowns we ruptured in examination gloves how how can you examine p patients without gloves on so this is just to show that we don't have enough supplies to do the work that we need to do add that add to that mass casualties add to that fuel and and cutting of water and so forth it really uh need to get out there the idea that the health system here is is on its knees we have in our pediatric department in NASA two to three children per bed there aren't enough mattresses for the beds there aren't enough beds for the numbers of patients the system is is beyond what it should be doing and it is detri menting the health of patients thank you so much for your time and uh given the challenges you are facing thanks for talking to us on aljazera Dr Javid Abdul Nim uh the Gaza
