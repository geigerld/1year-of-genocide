Al jaer senior political analyst mwan Bashar is joining us now I'd like to talk about how this was bypass this bypass Congress mwan in a moment but first is is there something to be said uh over the timing of this this particular deal considering what's happening on the ground and the Israel is widening their offensive and seemingly focusing a lot now on the south and on Kan yunes oh yes there's no doubt about that uh the netan government has decided to widen the war it is fighting all over Gaza now they say there's no place safe in Gaza there's no place where there is no war in Gaza so you can imagine that the Israelis are bombing every possible Target in Gaza includ including those places where Palestinians have taken Refuge apparently now for a good number of weeks the Israelis have been bombing uh places where Palestinians took Refuge which is you know kind of incredulous in so many ways but if I allow me just to put this all in his historical context because I've been listening to the figures you've been giving and they are accurate in the sense of they are to the letter I've seen estimates about how Israel has received between 150 to$ 250 billion dollars from the United States since 1967 because it depends how you count right or it depends your accounting I'll give you just one simple example when you give Aid to Israel when as an American give Aid to is gives uh um donations to Israel to an Israel Associated charity it's tax deductible in the United States you can imagine the number of said American Jews or American zionists American Evangelical Christians who donate to Charities that work in Israel it's all becomes tax deductible in the United States that's just one way of looking at it but I've seen estimates that are unprecedented in international relations since international relations became a thing five centuries ago no two other states have exchanged as much aid meaning the United States to Israel in modern international relations it doesn't exist in after 2014 when Ukraine become became a bit in in trouble in hot water with Russia from 2014 to 2020 Ukraine is few times bigger than Israel it got a fraction a fraction of the aid that America gave to Israel than that to that one America gave to keev at the time for many years so the nature of the US Israel relations is unique in human history the nature of the aid that Israel gets notably military aid from the United States is unique in modern international relations the fact that most of it could be spent in Israel not in the United States is unique in American Aid military aid to other countries because most military aid or financial aid gets to be spent in the United States like for example I went to Egypt right but Israel no it's a a whole other uh situation so when we look at the figures now and we look at what's happening in the sense of Israel's unraveling genocide in Gaza you still asked the question so why today Israel is rushing Aid to Egypt so Biden for a for many years because you know he was in the senate for something like 40 years or or something he's been in Washington since 1972 50 years so for many years he been saying if Israel did not exist we would have had to create it yeah because Israel serves our interest in the Middle East so maybe that was true in the 1980s we don't have time to discuss it now or in the 1990s or even the year 2000 maybe but where exactly is the national interest today when Israel is no longer a strategic asset presumed Str asset but it's a strategic liability Israel cannot even win a war against a militia basically a resistance group in Gaza that was under siege for 17 years right so certainly Israel is no longer military asset it's a military and a strategic burden on the United States well I mean it's not just the AIDS that the US as you're saying continues to give Israel but in this particular case and for the second time in a month uh the Biden Administration is willing to bypass Congress to give them this Aid how are we to explain that and what's the end game here for the US well clearly um this is uh politically suspect and I think we there are going to be a lot of criticism of that in Washington twice in a month to bypass Congress to give Aid to a country that's basically is involved in war crimes if not genocide and clearly the idea that this is self-defeating in the sense that America has a strategy that is built on the idea that we need Israel needs to exit the war as we know it today to another phase phase three what is less intensive and yet it's giving it arms that serves its phase two when which which the which is supposed to leave right so it doesn't make no sense whatsoever and we spoke about how morally defect how morally scandalous this thing is so the only explanation that I have is that the Biden Administration is so boxed in behind the Nan government it it can no longer see the um what do you call that the woods from the tree right it's clearly stuck behind netanyahu's schedule netanyahu's agenda netanyahu's personal ambition netanyahu's endgame in Gaza and it is unable to break away from that at the risk of alienating Middle Eastern allies its own public opinion I would even go further at the risk of losing the election Biden could lose the election in 2024 because he's so stubborn of risking his administration his legacy at that of unknown liar basically Benjamin Nel look very broad question for our last question Maran but uh we've just gotten the latest figures from the uh from the health Ministry in Gaza and they're saying that so far 21,6 72 Palestinians have been killed and 56,600 Israel is running our way running uh out of targets to hit in Gaza it's running out of targets after tens of thousands of bombings of different locations in Gaza sooner or later this hanun thing is going to end and what's what's next I think the Biden Administration as we've been saying also needs something some respite from this genocide that's unraveling in front of the entire International public opinion so they might reach a deal this deal could be somewhere in between what Israel insists on what Hamas insists on you know a third way a compromise of sort but I think Israel would want to continue with the war regardless so it might take a break for a week or two or three take a rest from the bombing from the killing of children possible in in return for dozens of captives Hamas would also benefit from that because it needs some kind of respite as well what about their plans to in their own words of some Israeli officials to ethnically cleanse the Palestinians push them out that's happening de facto because Gaza is becoming increasingly unlivable I've just read a report by a scientist who refers to other scientists saying that if the continuation if the situation continues as we know it today all things being equal a quarter of the population of Gaza could die out of disease a quarter of the population I cannot get my mind around the idea of one child dying what does it mean really one child dying for no reason whatsoever other than political power and ambition right and now we're talking about a quarter of the population in Gaza at the risk of dying from diseases not the bombing diseases all things being equal and if the situation continues as it is today all right thank you so much M thank you
