respondent step Farson she's joining us live from the ha and and and and step the judge uh went to Great length to explain how and why the court will make this decision he talked about how much the circumstances have changed since the provisional measures that were ordered in January and March you know noting that this is of course not the first time that South Africa has gone to the international court of justice why they have changed the risk the very real risk that they posed to the Palestinian people in Gaza before issuing those orders talk us through them yes it was very clear that the 13 judges of the 15 were all agreeing on the fact that the situation in Rafa is a red line uh the situation had changed uh desperately he said he was uh using words as a serious exceptional dire uh situation he said especially the fact that so many people are now displaced 800,000 and he also said he doesn't believe the words that Israel said that they were all giving enough safety and humanitarian uh access to these people that are being brought to these so-called evacuation zones uh he said he just simply didn't see that there was no evidence of that so that's why he has now made this very strong order that Israel should stop immediately its offensive and its military operation in Rafa and withdraw its troops from there it also uh he also ruled on the border crossings that they need to be opened as soon as possible to get humanitarian Aid in and also interestingly he said that the observers from the United Nations have to also get access as soon as possible to make sure that no evidence uh of any possible war crimes is going to be disappearing so they need to get that access as soon as possible to do these investigations and Israel has to report about all these steps within a month back to the court step thank you very much for that no doubt we will be coming uh back to you very soon but for now let's bring in our diplomatic editor James baz who has been watching the Court's proceedings with us and a lot to unpack here James before we get to the nitty into the nitty-gritty how significant is the ruling what do you make of this very very strong order from the court on this occasion uh they've had two previous orders um provisional measures they call them um where they've told Israel to let the aid in and stop some of these measures that could plausibly be leading to a genocide uh but now they've followed South Africa's lead which is was was asking for this um South Africa very specific this time they tightened their focus to the Rafa offensive and the orders are really clear stop the Rafa offensive now open the Rafa border crossing now and let any investigative body and un body into into um into Gaza through the Rafa Crossing very very clear orders that Israel and he said made it a point at the end this has binding effect there is an international legal obligation this is the top Court in the UN system it's elected by the 193 member states of the United Nations a joint election that takes place in the security Council and the general assembly Israel is a member state of the United Nations under international law Israel must do what it's told and but since it's been told the first time in January to not commit any acts that could amount to genocide among other things Israel has killed more than 15,000 people in Gaza I I know that you're saying there certainly very strong orders but if we look at perhaps the most important one the one that South Africa was asking for more urgently most urgently to immediately halt its military offensive if you look at the wording James I wonder if Israel will find room to maneuver here because it says it immediately halt its military offensive and any other action in Rafa which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part could Israel argue that its operations um don't inflict on Palestinians in Gaza you know the conditions of life that would bring about their destruction do how do you see Israel engaging with this I'm sure Israel will again say we gave everyone warning and there were evacuation orders and people should just follow them but the court talked about that ab and it's pretty clear it doesn't accept that yeah Israel has to comply with this but the second part of it is Israel will not we know how Israel operates we know there are numerous Security Council resolutions that Israel is not uh complied with I have no expectation that Israel is going to suddenly put prime minister Netanyahu on television in an hour and say we're ending the raffer offensive which means that this court has done its bit but this court has no enforcement power whatsoever in the UN system the enforcement power goes back to New York and it's then a question of uh the um Security Council and the general assembly particularly the security Council because that has the power under the UN Charter to put in enforcement measures if the security Council decided it it could send in an international Force to make Israel do what it wants so the pressure is on the security Council but in particular the pressure is on the United States we saw the outrage in the US earlier this week when the international criminal court that's a separate Court in the hay came up with um with recommendations from the prosecutor which then have to go to judges uh that Prime Min Netanyahu and defense minister Galant um should face arrest warrants for crimes against humanity and war crimes that that have taken place uh in Gaza it's harder for the US when it comes to this this is the international court of justice um all member states must abide by this and yes the US is saying the same thing as this court the US for weeks has been saying the raffer crossing must be open and there shouldn't be a Rafer offensive the US doesn't disagree with this so when someone brings this up in the security Council and I have no doubt that this will be the basis now of a resolution towards the security Council probably Algeria they're the current Arab member of the security Council how is the US going to veto that when do you expect this to come up in front of the UN Security Council we'll have to ask our colleagues in New York there's actually an interesting um security Council vote coming up soon on the whole issue of international humanitarian law which is what Israel is clearly defying here not specifically about Gaza but about International humanitarian law and how people are not obeying it and how to strengthen it um so so Ambassador is going to be meeting shortly I think given given that the measures here are so strong you could come up with a security Council resolution that is literally a few a a few paragraphs long uh because it simply could say the security Council demands that Israel abide by the provisional measures put in place uh by the international court of justice um I suspect though the way the security Council works and I've spent a lot of time in New York following their deliberations they'll be back and forth on this the US will try and moderate what others want to do but it puts I think the Biden Administration in a very difficult position and it puts Israel in I think one of the most difficult weeks it's had um it both diplomatically legally because we've had that I prosecutor saying the Prime Minister and the defense minister should face arrest warrants we've had this um very very strong ruling by the international court of justice and we've had fresh momentum in the recognition of the Palestinian state by three key European countries and when you look at the orders and judge Salam went through who's in favor and who's against it breaks down as previous orders that we've seen from the international court of justice with 13 in favor two against the two being the ad hoc Israeli judge and the Ugandan judge how much does this once again highlight what the world wants to see happen and how isolated the Israel and the United States are on this absolutely um yes it's worth telling you who that Ugandan judge is Julia seend she also voted against the majority of the Court um in previous um uh discussions around the court um on previous um provisional measures she's Ugandan and actually she's since become the vice president of the Court uh since the first uh ruling uh back in January but it's I mean and the only other person joining is is um judge Barack who is just appointed for this hearing the way it works is you have a set of Judges who are there permanently and then if a country is on is is on the um is being discussed in the court is facing proceedings in the court um and they don't have a judge already on the court they're allowed to have their own adah judge and so it's the Israeli judge who has joined her in these rulings it's worth telling you that these are um these judges of the international court of justice as I say elected by the security Council and the UN General Assembly for 9-year terms they are people at the peak of the legal profession some of them actually go beyond the legal profession I can tell you I know two of them and have interviewed two of them um the president of the of the Court uh who I know because he used to be the Lebanese ambassador to the United Nations he's a former president of the UN Security Council a former vice president of the Gen General general assembly and another one of the the judges uh bo Bogdan orcu is the former foreign minister he's a he's a lawyer and a distinguished lawyer he's a former foreign minister of Romania so people very well qualified to be undertaking these RS people that you can wonder how they're going to create a narrative that these are anti-semites because you're going to hear it absolutely James thank you so much for now that's our atic editor James baz make sure to subscribe to our channel to
