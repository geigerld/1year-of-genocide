well Israeli air strikes have targeted areas close to villages in southern Lebanon missiles were reportedly fired near kashuba the Israeli Army says it has hit Hezbollah positions Israel has evacuated towns along the border with Lebanon after repeated exchanges of fire zah hod joins us live from Southern Lebanon now and Z can you just explain exactly where you are and uh give us some more detail about these strikes well we're not very far from the Israel Lebanon border at the time being it is quiet but that border has been very much an active front line for more than a week now since Israel began to uh Target Gaza Hezbollah trying to put pressure on the Israelis telling them that they're going to face more than one front if they continue uh to Target Gaza Hezbollah you know targeting Israeli military positions along the boorder targeting Israeli tanks in return asra uh targeting sources of fire has Hezbollah does not have any military positions or bases along the border when Israel says sources of fire they're going after fighters who are you know hiding in the terrain behind me as you can see it's very much open terrain but this conflict along the border is very very much contained at least for the time being in terms of scope as you noticed I'm talking about military targets uh both sides are avoiding civilian casualties at least for the time being and in terms of scope the geography it's very much limited to a radius of 4 km on both sides of the border so both sides clearly not wanting this to to become a full-blown War uh but for the time being and Hezbollah officials have made this very clear that these are skirmishes and a warning but we heard a top Hezbollah official say yesterday that we will not allow Gaza to fall now the question is what will be hezbollah's red line before it engages in conflict with its full military capabilities is it when they feel Hamas can no longer resist assist the Israelis and Z there are also reports that Iranian backed groups are targeting US troops what more can you tell us about that well what we're seeing in the past uh few hours or so is an expansion of targets US military targets Iranian backed groups are believed they haven't claimed responsibility yet this we have to be very careful here but US troops in Iraq reported uh that they thwarted a drone attack on their troops a short while ago we're getting reports that a main US base along the border between Syria and Iraq TANF has come under attack by three armed drones It is believed that iranian-backed armed groups which are based in that area are responsible and really what we have been hearing either from Iranian officials uh or um you know officials of our groups Allied to Iran Hezbollah Hamas they're blaming the United States they're saying that the US Administration is directly responsible for the atrocities that Israel is committing and that you know in many ways this unconditional and unwavering support is is why Israel has this green light to operate so now we are seeing us bases the military presence coming under Fire no doubt trying to put more and more pressure on Israel uh to stop really its campaign against Gaza okay thank you so much that's Z for us in southern Lebanon
