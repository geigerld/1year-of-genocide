three European nations which are set to recognize Palestine as a state on Tuesday have condemned Israel's ongoing attacks on Rafa the foreign Ministers of Ireland Norway and Spain held a joint pressor in Brussels where they spoke about the need for a two-state solution to the conflict while they also accused Israel of breaching International humanitarian law by refusing to stop its deadly strikes on arfa there can be no military solution to this conflict and I repute absolutely any group using violence or terrorism to try and eliminate the state of Israel or to eliminate the state of Palestine as an idea or as a reality they will not succeed and I condemned the violence of yesterday the rockets that was that were uh struck at Tel Aviv and the heus attack on the Rafa tent refugee camp um last evening where again innocent children and civilians were killed um again in violation of the uh International court of justice and its instructions to Israel to Cease the bombardment of Rafa this stresses what we have been calling the three of us our three countries for a long time that it's an immediate ceasefire but the gravity is even larger because it comes after uh a decision taken by the international court of justice that once again I want to recall that are binding and compulsory for all parties they are for for Israel that is calling to stop this attack on on Rafa I think that uh this time we have to raise our voice not only for an immediate ceasefire but also to back international law and the United Nation Charter and Norway's foreign minister urged other European countries to follow suit in recognizing a Palestinian State we are in this low point in history when it comes to the Middle East it is exactly when you need to think about the day after uh our there's an imperative which is to get to a ceasefire there is another imperative which is to radically upgrade the humanitarian efforts but neither of these are actually Solutions the solutions have to be political and we need to think about that political solution now that is the context in which Spain Ireland and Norway chose to recognize we encourage all countries to do the same uh we know uh that a number of your European countries are either on the way to do so or contemplating and we hope they will follow suits Muhammad masri joins us now he's a political analyst and professor of media studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies sir thank you so much for joining us again here on the set uh let's start with um um basically I'm very curious to know what you think about the move by what we see now Spain Norway um and Ireland in recognizing uh the Palestinian State you know what type of impact will it have on the day-to-day lives of struggling Palestinians specifically in Gaza and and the West Bank well in the short term there's not going to be any uh impact at all I think as I said earlier uh in a previous interview um this kind of small symbolic Act uh can be meaningful over the long term especially when combined with other uh diplomatic acts but what gazin need right now is something more uh meaningful something more Sub sub substantive they need calls for you know they need the arrest warrants they need calls for sanctions and an immediate uh uh end to this violence I thought it was interesting when they were talking during the press conference they were basically uh adopting all of the us talking points they were talking about normalization with Saudi Arabia which is part of the reason why we ended up where we ended up they were talking about the revitalized Palestinian Authority um which is very paradoxical right to talk about the Palestinian Authority um which is deeply unpopular with Palestinians both in Gaza and the West Bank while at the same time talking about Palestinian self determination there's a there's a contradiction in terms there and then they were also talking about the two-state solution which is a practical impossibility given the presence of more than 200 Israeli settlements and outposts uh and more than 700,000 Israeli settlers all over Palestinian land so Israel has intentionally rendered the two-state uh solution an impossibility and then we we sit up here and talk about uh this Pie in the Sky idea and you know it's not going to it's it's just not going to happen so um that is that is something that I was taken back by but you know it is it a morale boost because I mean this does fit into the Palestinian drive for more and more recognition from that standpoint yes and that's why I started with I think over time this is the kind of thing that can that can make an impact right there's a diplomatic tsunami to borrow the phrase that was used by a former Israeli Diplomat being hurled upon Israel right now from the icj and the ICC and now you have the Palestinian uh you recognition of a Palestinian State you had a couple of weeks ago at the UN General Assembly the vote on enhanced Observer status so there's a lot going on right now and all of that um helps the Palestinian cause over the long term but it's it's strange to say the least to be talking about all of this in the midst of a genocide right what Palestinians need is something more impactful more direct and more immediate because you know especially after witnessing these distressing scenes overnight um it does feel like Gaza is on a precipice right now more than ever um I want to ask you what do you make of the fact that we have not heard anything from us leadership no reaction so far I mean it is Memorial Day weekend but still um are you surprised by the lack of reaction I'm not surprised at all um just as I was not surprised when the US came out and supported Israel after Friday's icj order uh commanding Israel to stop itsf Invasion um the the reality is that the US is in lock step with with Israel um there's really no resistance there whatsoever what you had uh last night was a very practical example of the doctrine which Israel imposes from time to time where they um it's basically a doctrine of disproportionate Force where they target civilians intentionally inflict mass destruction in hopes that the civilian population will turn against its leadership um it's a war crime in every sense it's a violation of the principle of Distinction a violation of the principle of proportionality and if there was ever a time for the US to speak out it would be it would be now but but as you said they were silent all right Muhammad thank you so much for joining us greatly appreciate it thank you make sure
