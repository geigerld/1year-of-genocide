Pope Francis meanwhile has called for an an end to the attacks and violence in Israel in an address to the crowd at St Peters Square he expressed his solidarity with the victims the head of the Catholic Church said fighting will not solve any problems let the attacks and weapons cease please because it must be understood that terrorism and War bring no Solutions but only the death and suffering of many innocent lives war is a defeat every war is a defeat let us pray for peace in Israel and Palestine and this was the scene in Istanbul where thousands of people marched to show their support for Palestinian Fighters many also waved Palestinian flags and chanted slogans in support of Hamas Turkish president Reb Ty erdogan is urging both sides to deescalate tensions erdogan says turkey air will ramp up its diplomatic efforts to achieve calm on behalf of Tura and in light of this morning's events in Israel we invite all parties to act reasonably and to stay away from impulsive steps that raise tensions rallies were also held in Yemen's Capital Santa people celebrated what's been known or become to be known as Al AXA flood military operation by Hamas and in Kuwait crowds also marched in support for Palestinians in Gaza let's head to the US now where President Joe Biden has been speaking on the phone with Benjamin Netanyahu our state department correspondent Roselyn Jordan joins us live now from Washington DC Ros what more do we know about the content of this phone call well according to a statement just released by The White House the US President Joe Biden told the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the US stands with Israel and that military assistance which Israel has requested for its Defense Forces is on its way to Israel we don't know specifically what is being sent but it is worth pointing out that the Pentagon has uh said in the past uh day or so that the defense secretary Lloyd Austin is Consulting with yav galad the Israeli defense minister about what uh support the uh Defense Forces need in order to repel this attack that was launched by Hamas early on Saturday we also uh note from the White House statement that the president said that active diplomacy has been conducted and continues to be conducted in order to try to bring this war between Hamas and Israel to a swift conclusion without further loss of life and certainly to uh try to uh help recover those persons who were kidnapped by Hamas and taken to to Gaza in the last 24 hours plenty of moving parts to the story thank you so much rosin Jordan live for us there let's bring in sheab branzi who joins us from the UN the United Nations security Council will hold an emergency meeting very shortly sheab what are we expecting if anything in terms of its power to deescalate the situation well we expect that meeting in about an hour and a half's time just over an hour and a half it's interesting the format of the meeting has led to some questions as to what exactly can be achieved in a from a from a security from the security Council in its official capacity because originally we understand the that malter asked for this to be a private meeting of the UN Security Council so that is a closed meeting the public wouldn't be able to see what was going on but that the affected parties in this crisis Israel and Palestine would be able to attend and participate but then that was changed to Clos consultations of the UN Security Council so that is not a formal meeting of the UN Security Council and only the current members of the UN Security Council can participate not the Israeli and pal the Israeli and Palestinian representatives to the UN we expect them to be briefed by the UN special representative for Middle East peace the Middle East peace process to wenner's land beyond that we don't have much more information as to what's on the agenda we do know however that the Israeli ambassador to the UN is about to speak to reporters outside the security Council within the next 10 minutes we'll be looking at that we'll also be trying to catch representatives from the various missions on their way into their security council meeting we've been hearing particularly from Amnesty International and other International organizations that the root causes of this violence need to be addressed I mean How likely is that going to be the case at this meeting currently though we've just had very kind of boilerplate condemnations from certainly the Western Nations and Brazil against hamas's incursion into Israel the UAE has asked for a resumption or reinvigoration of What's called the quartet that is the UN the US EU and Russia which was supposedly overseeing some sort of peace process but clearly you know what's clear is and what I think a lot of the reporting and the and the guests you've been talking to have said is there has been the sense of complacence see that this is all basically this is all just going to keep quiet I to be honest actually there's that pivotal moment of the UN General Assembly right here just just last month when Netanyahu the the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brandished a map of the new Middle East at the UN General Assembly on which there was no mention of the Palestinians it was just various Arab states and Israel and you have to look back then at that pivotal moment of the UN General Assembly as to I think we we'll all be looking back at that particular moment clearly as far as Benjamin Netanyahu was concerned the Palestinian question was over but clearly Hamas had other ideas the historical context must be considered you're right thank you so much sheab branzi at the United Nations for us let's head to London now where Harry forcett is standing by Harry a number of European nations have increased their security as a result of this conflict in the past two days how are they trying to reassure their citizens uh that's right a number of European nations talking about the potential threats to their Jewish citizens the Jewish communities so we've heard from the French that they plan to increase protection at schools and synagogues the police here in London talking about increased patrols and also planning for potential uh protests in the coming days uh presumably looking forward to the kind of Israeli attack on Gaza that we might be expecting in the coming days and any protests against that also so in the last few minutes we've seen a video from the British prime minister Rishi sunak in which he talked about this being no moment for equivocation and that he would be unequivocal in blaming Hamas and its supporters for what was taking place inside Israel Palestine at the moment also saying that he'd spoken to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and offered Britain steadfast support and any assistance that Israel might need that was one of four conversations that the Israeli Prime Minister had during the course of the afternoon on Sunday he also spoke to the German leader uh the Ukrainian president and the prime minister of Italy as well and so there is this continued very strong support for Israel and very strong condemnation of the kind of largescale Civilian killing that was carried out by those Hamas fighters on Saturday and also the uh kidnappings of some of those people and the taking them inside Gaza uh there are certainly growing reports that many of those people or Le several of them may be foreign Nationals uh there is one missing Britain for example so increasing levels of concern there's also been one line from the United Nations world food program based in Rome they are calling for the opening and the maintaining of a humanitarian food Corridor into Gaza uh ahead of what everyone is expecting to be this very large scale ramping up of the Israeli military action really appreciate the update Harry forcet in London for us
