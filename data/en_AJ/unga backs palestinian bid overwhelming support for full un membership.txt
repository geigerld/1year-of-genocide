a round of applause in the United Nations General Assembly after an overwhelming majority of member states voted in favor of a resolution that says Palestine qualifies for full membership and asks the security Council to reconsider its bid we did not trite the UN Charter we did not enact international law we just demanded to see them applied to us and have been until now denied their protection in an act of theatrics using a prop Israel's Ambassador said any new rights or privileges bestowed on Palestine would be akin to shredding the UN Charter a spokesperson for the Secretary General rejected this there's many Charters there's one right here the charter is intact its ideals are intact the draft resolution agreed to had some symbolic privileges for palestin like allowing them to sit among full members and also some more tangible benefits like allowing Palestine to participate in most UN meetings something they could not do before but the watered down resolution which the US voted against specifically maintained Palestine with non-member Observer status full membership to the UN requires Security Council approval last month the US vetoed palestine's full membership ship bid the US contends Palestine should negotiate the issue with Israel an argument refuted by Pakistan's Ambassador negotiations must have a Level Playing Field if Israel is negotiating as a full member of of the United Nations so too should Palestine while the resolution overwhelmingly adopted by the general assembly calls on the security Council to Recon consider palestine's bid for full un membership it's unclear if they will actually do so we should know in the next few days but even if the council decides to reconsider it it still faces the same obstacle as before the US has already said that if necessary they would veto it again Gabriel zando Al jazer at the United Nations in New York make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
