domestic pressure is increasing on President Joe Biden to stop weapons being sent from the US to Israel key Ally and former house Speaker ncy Pelosi is among those who have signed a letter from dozens of congressional Democrats the letter says this in light of the recent strike against Aid workers and the ever worsening humanitarian crisis we believe it is unjustifiable to approve these weapons transfers now it goes on to say if it is found that the strike violated us or international law those responsible must be held accountable okay for more on this we're going to go now to shab renzi who is in Washington DC for us and as we know for some time Biden has resisted these calls to stop weapons uh shipments to Israel is there any sign that this letter is actually going to make any difference at this point not yet John Kirby at the White House on Friday said two things related to this letter I suppose is that one the letter is calling for a US investigator into what happened to those World Central Kitchen a Aid workers Kirby said there's no plans for any kind of us investigation and there's no plans for uh any curtailment of of weapons uh of weapons transfers at at the moment so yeah I mean the problem with this letter is yeah this is all very well and it's significant Nancy Pelosi I mean really there was a sharp intake of breath and we saw her name on on this letter the idea that she would even suggest conditionality for for for arms shment even though that is actually the US that is the US law the Ley the so-called Ley law which means that you can't ship weapons to someone who's abusing human rights nonetheless having her name was significant given the power of the Israeli Lobby and so on but there's no kind of or else in this letter or else what so they've got their their names on the line now they've signed that this letter but they're not saying okay if you don't do that then we're going to do this I mean one way of testing how significant this was this is is if were a number of these these these these members of Cong Congress did actually vote for further arms shipments for Israel so if they withhold their vote that would be something but now we know that the Biden Administration is bypassing Congress to send weapons to Israel it's using accounting techniques it's it's it's shipping weapons up to the threshold that Congress has to approve more weapon tripment so it's unlikely that they will be tested now um so yeah it's it's it's unclear yet whether this is performative clearly as you say they are feeling pressure from their local constituents but what are they going to do about it other than write a letter that's what we have to see indeed and sheab regarding the phone call between Biden and Netanyahu how has that been received uh within the US has there been any reaction or Fallout from that as Biden continues to I guess outwardly put more pressure on Netanyahu I think the White House got the headlines that wanted that you know Biden is now is now putting the pressure and clearly Israel has said you know it's going to allow some shipments in I mean the problem for Biden there was that just proved to everyone just how weak he's been or whether I mean they raised more questions because it suggested that Biden could have done this at any point that there was no need for children to die of starvation Biden could have could have done this earlier so that was some sort of blowback then of course we have the the Israeli the pro-israeli lobbies here saying you know you're putting too much pressure on Israel so of course we're seeing the walk backs now we're seeing the letters being sent to Qatar and Egypt by the White House is just look we're we're pressuring all sides in the in the in the negotiation and then the most interesting story I think was even the Israelis were a bit confused by some of the headlines and what Biden said on that phone call the question was was Biden delinking the issue of the hostage release from some sort of immediate temporary ceasefire even the Israelis were confused by what Biden was saying and immediately the next day that was all walked back by the White House saying no no no no no no we only talk we're only talking about a ceasefire in the context of the release of the hostages if that had been delink that would be very very significant it turns out that isn't what Biden was saying much to the relief of the Israelis who had to ask for clarification themselves okay thank you so much shab shab ranzi there for us in Washington DC okay well eler senior political analyst M bash joins us again thanks very much for being here moan as we heard uh there from shihab he said that there are no consequences to that letter what do you make of that aspect of it even though clearly there is pressure ramping up on Joe Biden that's it I mean it's nuanced it's getting a bit complicated for the Biden Administration that doesn't mean uh this will automatically lead to a decisive action on the part of the uh American president but pressure is building up uh pressure is building up internationally regionally but also domestically in the United States and I think uh just looking at some of the uh you know signatories and and looking at how things are ramping up in in Washington My Philosophy has always been if you want to know how or where things are going follow the opportunists and clearly things are changing in Washington and in the United States and why that's why a lot of people are jumping ship or changing directions because they understand that uh at least in the Democratic party and among Independents there is an Israel fatigue there's a Netanyahu fatigue for sure the number I have been uh uh looking at close is not the 33,000 people uh who died in Gaza and not the 20 plus thousand children women who were killed in Gaza although this is the most important of all numbers but the Biden Administration is looking at number 47,000 and that is the number of Wisconson Democrats who went to the primaries they actually in a cold day got off went to the polling station and voted uncommitted M this is part of the anti-biden campaign that says we're going to put the president on notice their goal was 20,000 uncommitted they got 47,000 now Wisconsin like Michigan that had 100,000 uncommitted voters like Ohio like Florida like North Carolina Pennsylvania these are what you call swing States this is where President Biden won in in 2020 with a very small margin in Wisconsin it was 20,000 now you have 47,000 uncommitted so the pressure is building up in the Democrat in the Democratic party and in uh in the United States and so Biden has to do one of two things either he has to maintain the usual Keeping Up Appearances of doing something without really doing anything meaning the ice cream diplomacy or even the phone call diplomacy or he gets serious and does some serious diplomacy because we've seen just from the phone call that things are changing somewhat in Israel and on the part of the Israeli government so imagine if it's real weight that's being put in Israel okay so there's the option that he could get serious or can get more serious what would that look like what would he need to say and I guess more importantly what would he need to do it's some of the things that uh for example shahab has mentioned that Democrats are asking for he needs to do them for example example he says no more weapons we are freezing all shipments of weapons even the things that we agreed to before or this week we are not shipping no more ammunitions no more 2,000 PB bombs no more f35s right so at least you can start with the military then you can go into other forms of AIDS then you can simply put Israel on notice that we the United States cannot be complicit in war crimes or in genocide or what have you and this is an election year I don't have time for you and for your games stop lying to us so when we put pressure on you before you said no no it's technicality that's why we cannot get the aid in no it's not technicality it's political and it's racist and it's inhumane to starve the people in Gaza it's a war crime it's a genocidal War crime to starve the people in Gaza so now within 48 Hours we've seen that the the the the amount of trucks are multiplying that are going to Gaza so in fact there was no technical problem there was a political problem so you can see just by a mere phone call and and by the way it's it's fascinating right the past 72 hours I think 48 Hours we've all been hanging our hats on the damn phone call and it's just a phone call right imagine if he he Biden convenes his his cabinet and takes some serious decisions and really puts Israel in order says if you don't do 1 2 3 4 we're going to do 1 2 3 4 now we judging from the phone call that the that the sky doesn't fall in Washington if an American Administration uses its leverage with Israel in fact it becomes more popular at home right so clearly there's now a precedent just in recent memory whereby the American president can use his his influence his power his leverage on the Israeli government and changed things in Gaza it's unfortunate that he didn't for the past six months but but as one as one as one newspaper Ed editorialized it's maybe a bit too late but it doesn't have to be too little yeah America can use some serious pressure to get some serious results because enough is enough right in Gaza okay we'll have to leave it there but thanks as always M ma Bashar senior political Isa thank you
