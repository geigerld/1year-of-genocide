Dr. Saeed Abdul Rahman Mahmoud Maarouf, resident of Beit Lahiya, pediatrician. I have been working in the hospital for 23 years in the field of pediatrics. I was arrested from inside the hospital and stayed in Israeli prisons for 45 days under severe torture and starvation. I was released yesterday, and now I am at the head of my work at Youssef Al- Najjar Hospital, and we did not commit anything.  A human crime. My weapon is my pen, my notebook, and my earphone. I did not leave the place. I was treating children inside hospitals. I was arrested from Al-Ahly Hospital in the Australian prisons. The torture was very, very, very severe. I am a doctor. My weight was only 87 kilograms in 45 days. More than 25 kilograms of my weight. I lost my balance. I lost concentration.  I lost all my feelings. We were handcuffed for 45 days. We were handcuffed for 45 days. Description: How much do you describe torture and how much do you describe humiliation inside prisons? Only those who lived through it will reach the truth.
