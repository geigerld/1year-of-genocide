this is Al laa Hospital the only remaining operational health facility in the Central Area what you see behind me is the facility itself designed in one building here designed to accommodate 100 Cas on daily basis but judging from what we're seeing the hospital has been pushed to operate Beyond its capacity just from the crowd behind me right here at this health facility we're looking at 30 times more than it's capacity and just to show you the extent of the challenges and difficult conditions this hospital is going through we're taking you inside the emergency department of the hospital right here judging from what we're seeing large number of people are waiting in line here and to explain the large number of people here at the regist is because of the evacuation orders issued by the Israeli mil military that pushed the vast majority from Ala Hospital whether the injuries the patients they evacuate to leave the hospital immediately just adding more pressure on this small health facilities in the Central Area making it very difficult for the patients making it difficult for the medical staff and everybody to receive a proper Medical Care this is the pediatric department at the hospital here and as you see in the frame of the camera there's so many people here and when when we just talk to a doctor in inside the hospital describe the situation as very horrific here never seen this large number being in one place at one time here and he goes on to explain this is because of the evacuation orders took place at the laka Hospital pushing more people to move to a noat and other part of the Central Area mainly those who are in need of Medical Care ending up in this Hospital a hospital that is designed for minimum of a maximum of 100 Cas on daily basis now is set to provide medical care for close to 3,000 people on daily basis just adding more pressure on a really crippling Health Care System across the Gaza Strip make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaer
