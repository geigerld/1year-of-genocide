R SAR he's joining us live from DM in Western Tura where a has been laid to rest and R it is a devastating day for her family but they have been shown that they're not alone indeed it was a devastating day for the family um and we have just seen that her mother has just left her grave where she was buried her father as well and they both could just barely keep up with the help from some other people so they still it's difficult for them to accept that aaur is no more but it was not only family they had been her friends as well several of her friends from the United States and from across turkey they have been attending her funeral and now today we have seen that thousands of people also have arrived in her hometown did to attend her funeral that just the prayer funeral that the the funeral prayer that just taken have taken after the noon prayer and still people are coming and respecting paying their respects this is her grave where she is buried people have planted some of the flowers here and you can see a Palestinian cafia on the other side you will see a Palestinian flag and a Turkish flag together and of course alongside her family friends and thousands of people coming and attending her funeral they have been several senior politicians also were present here including the parliament speaker the foreign minister the leader of the opposition party the Justice Minister and several several others and we have seen that the parliament speaker has delivered the speech promis in that Justice is going to be delivered that's right R he said that ao's death will not be in vain so tell us what the Turkish government is doing about her killing well turkey has said that there uh they have launched their independent investigation and the reason for that is the lack of trust toward the Israeli investigation uh they said that Israeli investigation is not reliable there are lots of ambiguities around it is not transparent and of of course it doesn't make sense for them that is they because Turkish officials are considering Israel as the killer of aaur So based on that they have launched their own investigation and we have heard from ao's father mmed SWAT AI again again has been calling on the US United States government also to do the same but turkey is is taking a further step so it has done it's own autopsy on autopsy on on a Shan's body and the Turkish officials are saying that the findings of this investigation and also the autopsies are going to be provided to the international court of justice to be used in the ongoing War crime trial against Israel but according to the parliament speaker that's not going to be only that his promising that turkey is going to take several steps internationally Rell thank you very much for that for now that is our correspondent Rell sad he has been covering the funeral for us he was there for us even Yesterday When ao's body arrived in Tura live inm thank you so much for your reporting we're now joined by v basan he's a political analyst and assistant professor of history at ibben halun University and he's joining us live from Istanbul thank you very much for your time so we were just hearing from our correspondent about the investig ation that Turkish authorities are undertaking inter ao's killing but our correspondent was also talking about turkey hinting at possible other steps that um the country might take on the international stage we have to of course see what comes out of the investigation but based on that what Avenues does turkey have in getting Justice for one of its citizens killed by an Israeli soldier well as as uh we're witnessing currently and the last few days that aan res killing actually became a quite uh sadness Nationwide and president erogan even today in an International Conference press conference uh emphasized uh this killing and emphasized also that they will do their best uh to at at legal front uh to find uh out who did it and how that uh happened I'm sure turkey first launching an investigation locally within turkey's turkey's border uh borders and uh we know that do has been conducted as a as a you know necessary step but I'm sure as we see from um also senior officials and and and namely the foreign minister pan also today sent out a me message on the social media saying that they're going to be following this following whatever it takes at the international front as well the way turkey is seeing this and and the discussions also among the political analysis as well as the academics is this is a a clear indication uh That No One Is Safe And even if you are a US citizen or a Turkish citizen um and and and they just kill you simple um as that that fact and this has to change and someone has to do something about it because the death tole daily increasing in gazda now even International it's called as genocide so I'm sure turkey will be following this issue legally at International uh front as well and how might ao's killing impact tur's relationship with Israel is it the last nail in the coffin for normalization driven by economic considerations well since the beginning I mean let's say at least at the beginning turkey uh really I I I know personally uh that followed uh the necessary steps to be the mediator between the two parties but unfortunately um especially Israel rejected that and you know what happened and total Destruction it seems turkey politically and and internationally doesn't want to put the nail in the last nail in actually turkey trying to keep the doors open and because just just to stop this uh Massacre and killing of international I mean innocent people in Gaza so I'm sure they will still keep the option available there but turkey more than once at the highest level emphasize that uh there should be some International and uh legal consequence for what is going on in Gaza or in general in the West Bank as well and what Israel is doing this is unacceptable so now we can see that the senior official Numan Mr Numan mus also was at the funeral and he was uh saying the same thing so it is quite sad seeing in the one hand over 4 41,000 people daily being murdered and in the last 7 years they subjected to the brutal occupation and now we have this case um but I mean it's definitely making the relations between the two countries quite uh difficult and stange ban
