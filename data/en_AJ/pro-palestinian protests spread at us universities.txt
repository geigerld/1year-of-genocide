now it's just over a week since students at Colombia University began their protest demanding their University cut ties with Israel and accept no further funding from the Israeli government students at Harvard Georgetown MIT and most recently George Washington University are demanding the same protests have spread across the United States to campuses in several different States including Michigan Texas and California hundreds of students are gathering at George Washington University in the US capital to show solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza students from Georgetown University have marched across the US capital to the encampment at George Washington University across the United States students are demanding their universities cut Financial ties with Israel and divest from companies they say enable the war on Gaza while correspondents are covering the protests across the US Patty G ha is standing by for us at George Washington University in Washington DC but first to John hendin who's at Columbia University in New York and John I understand from your early reporting that negotiations are under way at the moment is there any sense the university will capitulate or compromise with the protester's demands well the university is in a tough spot as you said the students are demanding divestment from anything that enables the war in Gaza they also want amnesty for the students who are protesting but meanwhile billionaire donors to these universities including Robert Craft the owner of the New England Patriots football team he said he's going to stop investing and he's not the only one and what that means is that puts pressure on on the University from the other side from people who want these protests to stop and that presents a really interesting scenario here overnight somebody planted a sea of Israeli Flags here those were not here yesterday and if you look up Beyond those flags you see those blue seats those are going to be filled for the graduation ceremony here at Columbia on May 15th and if the students haven't moved by then walk with me this way and uh let me just show you those seats are facing this encampment about 8010 or so hundreds of students who have occupied the space in the center of the University right now there's a midnight deadline tonight that's about 4 uh am uh GMT the from the University president to leave this spot negotiations continue though and we're told they'll probably go on into the night so there might be an extension of that date but nobody really knows how this is going to end and it's important at other universities what happens here because this is where it all started this is the epicenter it was in 1968 during the Vietnam war protests that University president lost his job this one is hoping not to do the same so uh there are negotiations going on they're intense something might happen by midnight and something might not but these protests continue to grow around the country and they're certainly not stopping here where it all started yeah important lessons perhaps from history there many thanks for that John let's go from New York now to Washington DC and Patty hhan who's at George Washington University in uh the US capital so Patty I understand as we've been reporting there that students from two universities in the capital have now joined forces George Washington University and Georgetown how are they getting their message across well actually it's all eight universities that are here uh in the metropolitan area Maryland's included uh galludet which is a university for mostly a hearing impaired students so a wide swath of different uh students here but I want to just get out of the way real quick and show you what's going on there's uh this propped up this morning because they said of what's happened in New York that they wanted to send the same message so they've got about a dozen or so tents they've got a a tent for a bathroom they've got food coming in and they say that they are staying now I want to introduce you to Dias Meine she is one of the student organizers and we know that you're calling for the universities to just invest from Israel and God knows these universities have a lot of money what are your other other demands well our demands are obviously like you said divest um from any companies that sell weapons or um technology to the Zion state but also to drop all charges um against students who spoke up or students who are pro Palestine many of us uh in DMV SJP all across the DMV um are facing repression and charges and hearings from our universities for simply protest Tes in um even some students were docked and put and their faces were put on trucks um and not that that was done explicitly by the university but the university kind of manufactures consent for that when they don't create a space where students can speak freely and can express their Pro Palestinian stance you also want universities to not be in Israel one more time universities out of Israel universities out of Israel as well as cut all um trips to isra including Birthright trips and study abroad programs um cut all ties um speaking of being docks that's when your identity is put on the internet and you're harassed I noticed you're handing out masks for our audience can you just explain what it's been like to be a pro Palestinian protester what are the risks and why wear the masks yeah so not all protesters wear masks but many do just because of the heavy um targeting and the heavy doxing like you said against us um like I mentioned a student's face was put on a truck you know multiple students so this kind of heavy doxing is very dangerous for us because zionists are violent Zionism creates a violent culture so we do it to protect ourselves um of course especially at higher risk actions like this one this is something we've never done before we've never done an encampment in at a DMV school um at least within my lifetime so we want to make sure that we are protected while still um using our voices and expressing our demands yine thank you so much for speaking with aler English I appreciate it have a good day uh one of the things I should point out as the students do expect that the police are going to intervene today uh I've been told by the police that they the district police are in fact a Massie not far from here so we're going to stay on the scene and keep you posted but a lot of these students say they're willing to get arrested just like so many other students so many hundreds of other students across America all right Patty many thanks for the update there Patty hhan in Washington DC make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
