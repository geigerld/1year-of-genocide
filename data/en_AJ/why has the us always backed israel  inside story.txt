US President Joe Biden has reaffirmed Washington's support for Israel a day after hundreds of Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike on a hospital in Gaza what's behind steadfast US military and political backing for Israel this is Inside hello and welcome to the program I'm fully batibo the US has firmly backed Israel during the war it's launched against Gaza despite an intensifying humanitarian crisis for the 2.3 million Palestinians trapped in the besieged territory since Israel's foundation in 1948 the US has been its biggest donor of military aid it's provided funding and arms in conflicts that have killed thousands of Palestinians and made refugees of millions visiting Tel Aviv US President Joe Biden personally reassured prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu of continued support Israel as they respond to these attacks seems to me that they have to continue to ensure that you have what you need to defend yourselves and we're going to make sure that occurs well Biden arrived in Tel Aviv just a day after the worst single attack carried out on Gaza since October the 7th here's what he had to say about the hospital strike I was deeply saddened and outraged by the uh explosion at the hospital in gazi yesterday and based on what I've seen it appears as though it was done by the other team not not you but there's a lot of people out there not sure so we got a lot we got to overcome a lot of things well before we go to our panel let's speak to Alan Fischer in Tel Aviv Alan tell us more about what came out of this meeting between Biden and Netanyahu is there any shift at all in the US position no they're they're fully behind uh Israel certainly it was Israel's intention after what happened at the hospital in Gaza to convince the Americans that they were not responsible from Joe Biden's comments it appears that that wasn't much of a heavy lift that he'd already decided from what he was gathering and certainly he has said that the information he got from the Pentagon would suggest that the Israelis were not behind it uh he's talked about how his support for Israel is steadfast how they are fully behind what they're about to do and as far as taking on Hamas in the Gaza Strip uh certainly he would like to see some humanitarian Aid getting into Gaza but what is interesting is in the past when there have been conflicts in this area US presidents have tended to use the word restraint asking both sides to exercise it that word has not appeared in any statement that Joe Biden has made since he first commented on what happened last Saturday just hours after the event yeah it's he's had very little to say about the Palestinians in those comments how is this all playing out in the region well he did say that Hamas was not uh the Palestinians that they did not rep present the Palestinians and he's spoken about innocent people getting caught up in the fighting but people are in the region in the Arab countries are particularly angry that America seems to have taken uh Israel's site particularly with the growing number of bodies piling up in Gaza there is a concern that he has perhaps been blinded to the fact of the humanitarian crisis and isn't doing enough to deter the Israelis and that could have long-term implications we certainly saw there was anger towards Joe Biden when the three Arab leaders the the president of Egypt the president of the Palestinian Authority and surprisingly the King of Jordan who's a very close us Ally decided to pull out uh of the meeting with him that was scheduled in a man after his visit here to Israel that shows the level of dissatisfaction they are with the US response not least the fact that Joe Biden was not prepared to call for ceasefire and the Arab leaders felt that if they did not do that and were standing next to Joe Biden when he did not do that they would almost be complicit in what many people think is about to happen Alan Fischer in Tel Aviv thank [Music] you let's meet our guests in ramala in the occupied West Bank we're joined by Dalal irat assistant professor of conflict resolution and diplomacy at the Arab American University dalali is also a columnist for Al's newspaper in Washington DC is khed El gindi senior fellow at the Middle East Institute and author of blind spot America and the Palestinians from Baur to Trump and also in Washington DC Phyllis Bennis a fellow at The Institute for policy studies Think Tank and international advisor to the Jewish voice for peace organization uh Phyllis let me start with you in Washington to understand why we've seen a visit of support by President Biden uh to Tel Aviv to Israel even after the massacre at the Al Ali Baptist Hospital in Gaza even at a time when the region is boiling why why is the US so committed in supporting Israel today that's a very long story and we don't have time to go into the history but I think the question today is the consequences of this visit this be hug diplomacy that we've seen so far means that unless there's a public call for a ceasefire which I do not anticipate we will see this visit is going to be seen and should be seen as a real endorsement of Israel's continuing attack against Gaza there are likely to be vague references to uh urging Israel not to violate international law or expressing some kind of concern for Palestinian civilians but the reality is that the bombing is continuing Gaza is still under assault and threatened with a uh a ground Invasion and in that context the violations of international law are already underway so what we're seeing here is as much as anything else based on us politics Biden is proving once again his own pro-israel credentials and this notion of the the extreme one-sidedness using the the language of teams is just an expression of that this is not going to work unless there's a call for a SE CE fire if he had any hope of seeing this as winning any level of support in the region or elsewhere khed your thoughts an extraordinary show of support from the Biden administration at a time when the US should be calling for restraint and the key word restraint was missing from those comments in Tel Aviv restraint is something that previous administrations have used on calling for both sides uh to to exercise restraint in past escalations why has Biden not done this um uh the uh the it's actually been quite shocking to me as a as an analyst who's followed this issue for for many years the absence of calls for a ceasefire the inability to articulate even an expression of uh of basic human empathy for for Palestinians uh in addition to um the the the inability to uh uh to to urge sort of create red lines uh and and urge Israel to to show restraint these are all things that had had previously been uh fairly standard uh uh elements of of US policy in times of Crisis um even going back to the the second uh inala during the height of the violence at a time when Hamas was blowing up uh weddings and pizzerias the us officials even the president at the time was was able to uh to I identify um uh red lines uh and urge Israel to exercise restraint we're not seeing any of that right now and the the danger of course uh of giving Israel an effective green light is that we're likely to see more U more death and destruction why why why do you think we're not seeing that right now are domestic politics also at play here with the election coming up next to you I it's domestic politics sure but it's also the the person of Joe Biden he's deeply personally very committed uh to Israel he's expressed that many times and and I think it's sincere and I I don't believe that he's just pandering of course it it doesn't hurt uh in terms of domestic politics um uh but but there there there is a there's a real um inability to to see not just Palestinians and their suffering but even in terms of the long-term consequences of this I mean if you look at this rationally maybe too rationally uh and imagine well the the the the extraordinary pain and Trauma that Palestinians are experiencing right now and the anger that that will turn into uh it's hard to see how anyone would imagine that this scale of of death and destruction in Gaza would ever uh bring anything like security for Israel so there's a kind of suspension even of the ability to to reason in the long Dalal let me get your thoughts on this why why and what do you make of this unconditional us support for Israel we heard Biden say in Tel Aviv that he would continue to work with Partners across the region but do they want to work with him does Biden's Embrace of Israel set him on a collision course with Arab leaders well I think what we had just seen is another example of um the US shielding Israeli war crimes against the Palestinian people last night everybody has watched a massacre against 500 Palestinian civilians mostly children and women the least we had expected from Mr Biden today was a condemnation of the state organized Terror by by Israel as so as long as the US continues to reward the Israeli war crimes against the Palestinian people the Israelis will continue with impunity massacring the Palestinians one more thing that we have to focus on today the framing Biden had tried to mislead the audiences in supporting the Israeli narrative by saying that this is friendly Palestinian fire I want to remind you of Sharin abu's murder when they massacred Shan Abu they said they had evidence it is friendly fire we didn't see any evidence when they labeled six Palestinian human rights organizations as terrorists they said we have evidence the Israelis always try to spin the realities they want to mislead the audiences this is the message the Palestinians in Gaza are being massacred genocide war crimes force displacements and everything is documented we are living 2023 the whole world is watching diplomacy had failed the Palestinian civilians in Gaza 2.2 million Palestinians 50% our children 1 million children are deprived from water medicine food electricity while the International Community is watching the International Community has an obligation under article 146 of the force Geneva Convention they have to search for the criminals and hold them accountable in their crimes the Palestinian civilians are entitled to protection under under article 49 of the for Geneva conventions the UN has an obligation to enforce humanitarian Aid to the Palestinians besides ceasefire and the protection of the civilians dala let me come back to my question and and you are right the Americans have said that their national team would look into the explosion at the hospital but it seems that President Biden has already made his mind up as to who's responsible he said the other team in his words coming back to my question Dalal what about Arab leaders we've seen them snub Biden cancel the meeting that was scheduled in Jordan will this uh posturing and position by the US leader put put him in a collision course now with the Arab world listen when I when I remind the world leaders of their obligations under the for Geneva conventions the Arab leers are also included the Palestinians have gone into a 30 years peace process a sugarcoated peace process for 75 years for God's sake we have have been suffering injustices enduring the injustices under upper th extrajudicial killings detentions confiscations of lands settlements and settler terror terror all under the package of a prolonged Israeli military occupation we need to address the root causes of the reality that we are witnessing continued series of war crimes are being documented on every screen it is time that every leader every member state of the UN needs to invoke article 25 every country is now obliged to act upon their words and the security Cil resolutions and the general assembly resolutions by granting the Palestinians there the Palestinian people have a right to self-determination a right to defense and a right to resistance yet what we are seeing what we are witnessing hold on hold on please this is a translation of the deal of the century in the Middle East we are witnessing a change of the geopolitics map at the expense of the Palestinian blood they are eting the Palestinian people to the house to siai and then the scenario of the settler Colonial project will continue to the West Bank in the hopes of eliminating the Palestinian cause this war is not against Hamas it's not against Gaza it's against the Palestinian cause against the Palestinian people we have a right and everybody should stand for their own obligations philis your thoughts about what Dalal just said there uh and and the US position is it likely to ever shift or are we going to continue to see this bipartisan policy towards uh Israel in Washington DC for a long time it's been the case there was somewhat of a blip under the the Obama administration because he didn't have good relations with Netanyahu but it seems that it doesn't matter who's in the White House the policy stays the same the policy has been consistent for many many decades the so-called special relationship between the US and Israel that began around the time of the 1967 War began as a military relationship and morphed into the broad-based political diplomatic economic uh and political as well as military relationship we see now the United States taxpayers are paying paying 20% of the entire Israeli military budget I think there is one thing we have to keep in mind about this question of a ceasefire what is most desperately needed right now what we are hearing from all Palestinians across across Palestine across the diaspora everywhere is an immediate ceasefire we have to recognize the US has a history of rejecting ceasefires when there are international calls for a ceasefire when Israel is involved this goes back to 2006 in the Lebanon war in cast lead against Gaza in 2008 and9 in 2014 again in 2021 in each of these instances when Israel was at War as they defined it meaning they were attacking Palestinians there was a call for a ceasefire and the US answer again and again we don't need a ceasefire yet meaning not enough people have been killed yet we're facing that same problem now and the challenge of facing people who are protesting today in Washington who are out in the streets on Monday will be again on Friday is to demand an immediate ceasefire to break that refusal to call for a ceasefire on all sides an immediate ceasefire right nowed your thoughts and what's happened khed to the voices of Progressive Democrats in Congress who want the US to take a harder line with Israel over its military assault on Gaza what's happened to them well I I think uh I think those voices have uh almost entirely been silenced uh in in large part because of the the initial attack in Israel by Hamas the the horror of it and the scale of it uh has has really uh silenced people who might have otherwise been uh more critical of of how Israel has conducted itself uh we're starting to see some push back now there there are more calls from Democrats uh for for a ceasefire which uh seems reasonable but part of the problem here I mean this goes beyond the United States uh most western Nations have also failed to call for a ceasefire um that's different than in the past where you know as Phyllis mentioned it was usually the United States kind of blocking or dragging their feet on a ceasefire but they were usually alone now there is a kind of chorus of of Western Powers showing um unrestrained solidarity and support and unconditional uh endorsement really of of what Israel is doing on the ground in Gaza and to me that's even more shocking uh because essentially everyone is being ruled by emotions and there are no you know quote unquote grown-ups anywhere who who are able to see the the the horrible uh human costs uh of of what's happening but but even the medium and long-term repercussions of of serious uh erosion if not destruction of Western credibility as a whole with regard to anything resembling a rules-based order I think it will be impossible for not only Palestinians but Arabs Africans Latin Americans Asians um ever to take uh the us or European nations seriously when they talk about human rights or international law or or any of those things that have been completely thrown out the window in this case Dalal your thoughts about this as yes go ahead Phyllis go ahead phis before I bring in just one point on what khed was just saying which I think is so important just coming back to the US side it is important to recognize there has been now a uh an official resolution introduced into the Congress calling directly for a ceasefire very carefully framed to not try and win over views of what started at whose fault just calling for an immediate ceasefire that now has I think 13 uh co-signers and it reflects the fact that there has been a movement focused on changing the narrative changing the discourse in this country which has led to a situation where as of about two weeks ago the the most recent polls were indicating that 25% of American Jews 38% of young Jews believe that Israel is an apartheid state that's because there's been a movement mobilized with the Press with Congress at with the public for 25 years now and we're seeing that there's a threat to that accomplishment but right now I think it still exists and we're seeing public levels of support for Palestinians even now despite the incredible levels of terrible press yeah it is true that it would appear that more Americans are warming to the Palestinian cause according to the latest Gallop pole um Dal let me come to you now uh as uh said yeah as khed said things go far beyond the US of course away from the US today is there a single country that could uh be a fair broker here call for a ceasefire that would be respected agreed to by Israel and be a fan honest broker in this conflict let's remind the American public that this is an accumulative reflection of their 3.8 billion annual Aid of military aid to the to to Israel the war crimes that are being committed against 2.2 million Palestinian civilians living in a big prison of 365 Kil kilometers mostly children you know I want to also remember and and ask the Jewish American organizations for their voices I want to call upon all academics University the Harvard School of negotiations Scholars where are the people who work for peace studies and conflict resolution I am a professor of diplomacy we have failed our students you know I have looked into the UN un Charter the international law the international humanitarian law the for Geneva conventions the Roman statute I couldn't find one article that supports waiting for a permission from the occupier to let in humanitarian Aid what is the International Community waiting for why don't they send drones send the humanitarian assistance and protection for the Palestinian civilians two million Palestinian civilians are being massacred on the screens and the whole Humanity diplomacy had failed the Palestinian cause it is time we speak the truth please do not adopt the Israeli narrative anymore they are misleading the audience it's about time in 2023 to speak the truth to tell the stories of the injustices and the endurance of Injustice that the Palestinian people have been enduring for 75 years let alone the 16 years of total deadly blockade on Gaza it's about time we recognize the gazans as human beings Gaza is Palestine this is not a war between Israel and Hamas this is not against Gaza not against Hamas this is against the palestin runout to self-determination this is a translation of the deal of the century at the expense of the Palestinian blood this is again also part of the electoral process campaigns of Biden and Netanyahu coming in the next year all right khed what are your thoughts about what Dalal just said there she says diplomacy has failed has it is there still room you think to to get a ceasefire here and is there a country as I asked a loud that could step in today and and uh take that role of a fair and honest broker in this conflict which the US has been criticizing of not being uh unfortunately no I don't see any uh Power that that could play that role I mean but but yes there there is hope for a a ceasefire there there has to be I mean obviously that th this uh this death and destruction can't continue indefinitely although it can continue for quite a long time and and that's why I was saying um how alarming it is that there aren't any don't seem to be any reasonable rational people in the Diplomatic world who can see that who can see the dangers not just of you know certainly at a humanitarian level of of uh the just given the scale of the attack and in all forms and it's very clearly directed at civilians in Gaza but what really alarms me is the total inability uh to to see how this will uh impact any f future process um I don't see any political process happening um anytime soon but but let me one other point because uh I think it's important to to mention the the role of Palestinian leadership you know one of the things that history tells us the Palestinian people know this better than anyone else because of their history is when they don't have a credible leadership very bad things happen to Palestinians think of 1948 think of 1967 and I'm sorry to say right now part of the problem that we have in addition to the abdication of responsibility by the Western world uh is the absence of a credible Palestinian leadership that can advocate for Palestinians on the world stage and that can seek uh uh you know diplomatic opportunities uh right now we have a failed leadership both in Gaza and I'm afraid to say in the West Bank okay let me ask Dalal about that before I bring in phis Dalal says the absence of a fail of a Palestinian leadership has also contributed to the predicament that Palestinians find themselves in today well it's about time we go for our Unity it's about time we go for unific reconciliation and to end our division my my call to the Palestinian leadership of all different political factions is to un unite now because this had been a pretext this has been the Fig Le Bel that has been used against us from the International Community again they are looking at us and saying they're not worthy of a Palestinian State they are not worthy of um Independence and and recognition and this is a setback on the internal level that I recognize however we need to look at 12 days of massacres and war crimes of genocide and forced displacement as war crimes which are being treated with total impunity by the International Community 2.2 million Palestinian civilians are suffering under the Israeli fire and you know the company boing it's American company the the the military aid of money from the from the US that is pouring into into Israel this is again an international legal coverage for the war crimes that are documented on the screens being perpetrated against the Palestinian people and and civilian and this should not be accepted this should not be tolerated and this is not only in Gaza in the past week we had we had had more than 60 Martyrs in the West Bank this means that every Palestinian is Target no matter what you believe no matter your ideology no matter your color Israel is targeting every single Palestinian Israel is waging a war against truth whoever whoever tries to tell the truth about about Israel and its war crimes is being targeted philis your thoughts about what happens next year and and has President Biden given the green light to Israel now to do whatever it wants in uh Gaza I think whatever whatever President Biden says the the image of his be hug diplomacy is seen as a green light for Israel to do what it wants to continue these incredible violations of international law crimes against humanity that are being committed I think that we have to be looking for where there might be calls for uh ceasefire that can come from elsewhere not from as khed said not from the US not from the Europeans right now Brazil is chairing Brazil is the the president of the security Council Don are you hopeful that a ceas fire could be reached in the next few days I I hope so however it is really sad that while we are waiting for a ceasefire and that we are waiting for Action a diplomatic action millions of Palestinians are perishing and women and children are deprived from water from milk from medicine the hospitals the doctors are operating in the hallways without electricity and without Anastasia we are witnessing a human historic catastrophe which is documented on the screen and let us be clear yesterday's hospital is an Anglican hospital and King Charles is a that is the head of the Anglican Church what did he do we need to hear it from the UK we need to hear it from the US we need to hear it from every leader it is not okay that hospitals are being targeted that people are being eved and war crimes are being documented while everybody is watching humanity is at risk and we have all failed the humanity it's about time we see Palestinians as a human beings thank you all thank you to all three of you
