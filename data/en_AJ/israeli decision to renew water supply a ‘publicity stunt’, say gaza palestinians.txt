meanwhile Israel says it's restoring water supply to the southern areas but that's being disputed by Aid agencies TK Abu aom has more from Gaza according to the United Nation uh statement that said in it uh there is no any single drop of water has entered the Gaza Strip uh meanwhile the Israeli authorities claim that it will uh it had started to uh provide Gaza Strip with water sources Main in fact the uh the amount of water that has been delivered to the Gaza Strip were only to one area which is uh in the Eastern areas of kanun City this area is important to mention that the houses are critically destroyed and their citizens are completely evacuated from these houses so it seems that no one will get benefits from the uh from the water that had been supplied to that area it's also important to mention uh that without electricity the ability to get useful from the water provided to the Gaza Strip is still limited simply because water pums inside the Gaza Strip need fuel and electricity to be generated in order to allow for citizens to have a pure access for water sources in Gaza
