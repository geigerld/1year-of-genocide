nearly 8 months into Israel's war on Gaza Palestinians whose lives have been upended by death and destruction see some light in the darkness that's after President Biden unveiled a new proposal to end the war we welcome this we hope the war will stop in order for us to go back to our areas and our houses in the north we have suffered a lot we hope he will support the Palestinian people and we hope he is serious about reaching a ceasefire agreement we want a ceasefire because we are very tired physically and psychologically the proposal lays out three phases the first would last 6 weeks and include a ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza it would also include the exchange of Israeli captives for Palestinians held in Israeli jails in a second phase Israel and Hamas would work towards a permanent end to hostilities and the third will involve the reconstruction of Gaza this is truly a decisive moment Israel has made their proposal Hamas says it wants to cease fire this deal is an opportunity to prove whether they really mean it Biden described it as an Israeli deal but a statement from the office of its prime minister says Israel's conditions for ending the war have not changed the destruction of hamas's military and governing capabilities the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel the American pressure on Israel or maybe on both sides a and a a strategy of creating some ambiguity that will increase the pressures all the pressures on netan not only from the United States also from Europe and the rest of the world Hamas has also reacted saying the movement reaffirms it Readiness to positively engage and cooperate with any proposal on the foundation of a permanent ceasefire complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip reconstruction the return of displaced persons to their homes and the completion of a genuine prisoner exchange deal from massacres in displacement camps to being haunted by starvation and disease in a strip of land rendered uninhabitable many Palestinians are clinging to the hope that a deal will finally be reached that can change this reality Lura Khan Al jazer make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaaz
