world since its Inception in the aftermath of World War II the United Nations has been a pivotal Force conducting humanitarian operations worldwide aiming to ease the suffering of civilians caught up in conflict or disaster through its agencies the UN provides emergency relief and health care services and offers protection to those trapped in war zones in doing so sometimes the mission itself comes under threat a case in point is Israel's war on Gaza more than 9 weeks into Israel's military offensive un officials have warned that the conditions for staff to deliver humanitarian Aid are increasingly precarious the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees estimates Israeli attacks and evacuation orders have forcibly displaced 85% of the population many of them 1.3 million are Sheltering in un facilities more than four times their normal capacity and Israel frequently targets those facilities hampering their operational capabilities the killing of humanitarian workers adds another layer of complexity to the crisis it begs the question can the United Nations overcome these challenges to fulfill its mission in Gaza for some crucial Insight on this Martin griffi the UN under Secretary General for humanit Affairs an emergency relief coordinator talks to Al jazer Martin Griffith the UN under Secretary General for humanitarian Affairs thank you for talking to Al jazer you've had a long career with the United Nations your job is to coordinate all the un's humanitarian work all the UN agencies that are operating in the field with your experience have you seen something as bad as Gaza no I've had 50 years James 50 years of dealing with conflict and I started in 1972 uh with um the karou I was in the IND China war remember those days and that was bad that was bad you remember the Killing Fields um but Gaza somehow is worse not necessarily in the amount of suffering each individual has but in the lack of prospect because Gaza uniquely uh does not allow people to flee and we know that Sudan has had what two million people left Sudan for safety elsewhere not a great story for them but alive um but the problem for Gaza is that for so many people in Gaza the future is completely obscure so in some way Gaza is uniquely awful and that's before you start talking about the suffering the numbers the the Betrayal of the health system and so on Gaza is special and it's special in a bad way you've already said it's no longer possible to say there's a humanitarian operation in Gaza explain that what I mean by that is that we had hoped that when the war moved South we were in fact told that there when the war moved South that there would be a different approach to the military operation slightly more targeted perhaps precise and surgical are the cliches that are used as you know and we had a 10-point plan which we presented to the world as to how we would respond to it what's happened is that the assault on Southern Gaza has been no less than the North it's raging of course through conun at the moment it's threatening rougher the compression of the population is greater we cannot uh be sure of any of our points of operation to be safe through deconfliction through this process whereby you tell each side that this is a safe place for un operations or humanitarian operations we don't have that so we operate on a form of humanitarian opportunism it's not what is the characteristic of a norm humanitarian operation which is dependability reliability repetition you know in the next one's coming and a certain amount of safety both for Aid workers and for those who they serve those conditions don't exist in southern Gaza and they and the fact that they don't means that the humanitarian operation which can be improved by the way is a random one there are trucks going into to Rafa they are unloaded with great difficulty and bravery from the people who have to come from where the war is down to to to this these spots Aid does get to people from time to time there is some Aid going to some hospitals but it is random it is not dependable and in my mind that's not a humanitarian operation because a humanitarian operation is a safety net for people in war given the scale of the destruction we've seen the amount of homes that have been destroyed is it fair to say Gaza is now completely unlivable I think Gaza may become completely unlivable Gaza is already a place where there is no guaranteed place of safety which could be one Criterion for livability we still don't know where this will end we worry of course about whether the compression of the population down south and South and South is going to have them burst out of the borders of Gaza into new problems into Egypt so we don't know but what we do know is that the north of Gaza is barely livable and if we see that replicated in the South and I understand from the what I read and what I'm told is that Hamas um which the acts of which on October the 7th started this awful conflict through their appalling acts is also very present in the South always has been in fact in some sense is more than in the north so we can assume that it is very difficult to eradicate a terrorist group like Hamas with precise surgical operations it more it is more likely to be a mass military operation of the kind we see that creates an environment a landscape which is unlivable in but the worst aspect of it I think is that um we've had many many many negotiations daily with the Israelis on all these matters um is that people are asked to move to places which they are then defined as unsafe again and they have to move again now normally in most conflicts that you and I know from around the world you're asked to move to a place out of the conflict to a place of Greater safety that's why people can't trust these um I think probably well-meaning um pieces of information to say get out of the way of the fighting which is a good thing in itself it's a good thing but not if it means that you go somewhere else and maybe you get bombed on the way and then when you get somewhere else you have to go somewhere else further your your boss the Secretary General Antonio ceras said people are being treated like human pinballs yes the place that now Israel is saying to go to um one of those designated safe areas is a place called almasi which is a desolate bit of land by the coast where there are no facilities whatsoever do you believe that is a safe Zone the you recognized no we don't and we're very firm on this and we have been from the outset when there was a dis discussion about safe Zone started in the gazen context a couple of weeks ago um with quite a lot of pressure being put on the un for example to recognize the safe Zone suggestions from Israel and others um now the UN has a special history as you know on safe zones we have lived through shanit which was not a safe Zone as it turned out the requirements of a safe zone are quite clear it includes the need for guarantees of safety from all parties it needs to be a place that people go to and leave voluntarily it needs to be a place where humanitarian services are regularly and reliably provided and mamasi doesn't fit any of those requirements as far as we're aware and so we have had a continuing discussion with the Israeli authorities about what is a safe Zone and what is a safe area one of the worries that we have about um masasi is that these very well meaning and well-founded suggestions for a maritime Corridor May draw people down to that Beach area which we don't think is safe where there will be a collection of people who will be In Harm's Way and so they will be drawn by the possibility of humanitarian Aid so the United Nations the United Nations Secretary General has been extremely clear and we have published statements and signed statements by all the humanitarian agencies to say we do not believe that the concept of safe zones exists in all possibility in Gaza yes and places flying the UN flag and I assume you've given the coordinates of those places to the Israelis my understanding more than 90 of those places have been hit in some ways by the Israelis um isn't this Israel showing a willful disregard of the neutrality of the UN well it's it's it's it's a it's a it's a appalling situation we had our own my own staff who live mostly in one building in Gaza that building was rocketed which had just un stuff and the other they knew that was a building with un stuff it was it was part of the deconfliction operation and presumably they must have felt that there were Hamas operatives nearby or underneath orever um so the process of deconfliction this is another reason why my 10-point planners in tatters is because we haven't been able to trust the confliction and on top of that you've had more than 130 staff working for the UN most of them working for the UN agency that deals with Palestinians unra who've been killed well Israel says it's minimizing civilian casualties and it's managed to kill more than 130 un staff that just doesn't make sense their claims to be minimizing casualties does it well you know it's the most as as I know you've heard this before but it's the most the highest number of of humanitarian staff un staff killed in any conflict in the many many years of the UN history the other big pernicious pandemic I think of um the lack of principle is the targeting of Health Centers and health institutions and Clinics and hospitals it's it's a breach of international humanitarian law and Dr Tedros has spoken out very clearly about this and I think he has said recently that only what is it 14 out of 36 hospitals operate and that minimally and that minimally um now look it is also against humanitarian law to use the premises of a hospital or a school anywhere protected by the law as a place for military operations so if there are Hamas infesting parts of those hospitals or schools then they are breaking humanitarian law but then you have these principles of proportionality and and so forth and we haven't seen that happen the numbers of dead in Gaza children of course in particular being the most tragic statistic far outweigh the numbers killed in other conflicts of the day now there's something as the Secretary General said there's something completely wrong which is a nice way of putting it about this yes one can understand and indeed defend the notion that Israel has a right to respond to the terrible events of October 7th and I'm one of those who has seen the compilation videos of those terrible acts of those days but it doesn't justify for a second the impact on the innocent civilians of Gaza so do you think they're going to get pushed out of Gaza I don't know because the Secretary General your boss said in the security Council the situation at the moment creates increased pressure for Mass displacement into Egypt and some are saying that was the I mean the Palestinian Ambassador in the UN as well in the same meeting said that's Israel's plan in his view well I wish I knew I wish I knew what the plan was it's the absence of knowing what the plan is that also by the way in Gaza as in as elsewhere makes humanitarian plan difficult because so they're not telling you what they're planning to do with Gaza after the war is no over I mean you're one of the top un officials you're supposed to deal with the humanitarian situation neither Israel or the US is telling you what the what the plan is no what we're having with them and it is a good thing and it should be recognized is daily negotiations with the Israelis the US Egypt and my office the UN daily negotiations which are well attended which are serious which are detailed to try to improve for example the logistics of entry into Gaza but they're not a forer for us to be told this is what's going to happen at the end of the war the whole question about the day after the whole question about an administration of what will Gaza look like is something that is completely absent what I'm struck by is not so much that I'm not told I don't expect to be told I expect to be there react but what the world should be hearing more of is what the Civil Society of the Palestinian people who still exist as a people not just in Gaza but elsewhere in their camps around the region in the West Bank what do they think what is their answer to that basic question about how should Palestine be administered not to question the two-state solution but to talk about the first step towards where how to get there and that's missing we have very very um energetic and welcome diplomacy from the Arab region they've been round the West as you know Washington a couple of days ago talking about the needs of the Palestinian people we've had excellent discussions here in the Doha Forum about that one of the main points that the prime minister of the Palestinian Authority made was why aren't we asking the Palestinian people what they want to see and of course their ideas will be uh confused in many ways their views about starting a political process will be over ambitious No Doubt their voice just as in Sudan the civilian voice the Civil Society the civilian voice The Voice equally also by the way of Hamas and other organizations um who've been involved in the Palestinian um or um Universe needs to be heard we need them to be given the opportunity to tell us their views about the future I'm a stranger I get no vote in Palestine but there are many who do and they have strong views much better informed than mine and in the world Gaza is perhaps overshadowing some of the other conflicts for example you mentioned it briefly earlier on oh uh the situation in Sudan where two rival generals continue their battle how would you describe the situation there now it's very very bad I think Sudan it is it is one of the tragedies of Gaza or Sudan that Gaza has taken all our attention I mean you remember Ukraine there was a war going on there um and I'm sure it's still going um Sudan I think in many ways is a greater threat to International Peace and Security in a certain way the difference between Sudan and Gaza is Gaza is a jail Sudan people run out and indeed undermine the neighboring countries as we know but Sudan is falling apart um the Arab ability to reach people in Sudan and once again we're very underfunded maybe 30% funded for Sudan our access is very difficult icrc has had a convoy which was attacked even after an agreement between those two generals for it to go through and people killed on that Convoy Sudan is a place of broken promises we put a lot of effort as did the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia into a renewal of the jeda process as you know where we AA the United Nations was going to manage negotiations on access between the parties and I think it lasted what about a week before it ended and political diplomacy on Sudan is completely absent and that's just the beginning of the problem Sudan because it's consequences as you know through Africa it's consequen is to our sense of values is so catastrophic a distinguished actually he was a Catholic the head of sant jido which is a Catholic lay Community which has been involved in conflict resolution for many years said to me the other day he said what is striking today and Sudan is the place I think where we see it most clearly is that we used to believe in the values of Peace as our preferred option stability peace dialogue all that stuff that we've all been busy with for so many years we've rediscovered the virtues of War as the option of choice and when we saw Sudan start again between those two generals it was essentially them deciding I think I can make a better deal out of a war than I can out of an alliance and an agreement a dialogue and eventually remember a a government um screwed together together between them and the same has happened in Gaza and the same of course has happened in Ukraine the the world now suffers principally I think it's not so much a collapse in multilateralism and its values although that is difficult it's not so much a collapse in the Divinity of the security Council although that has been a disappointment it's worse than that is that war is not the default option anymore it's a credible useful instrument in certain cases according to certain people finally you mentioned Sudan your operations there are underfunded you've come up with your plans for 2024 your Global humanitarian overview you project that 181 million people in 71 countries will need assistance it's going to cost $46 billion to pay for it but if you look at this year you're not going to get any of that money or a large part of that money are you no the the what I I want to make two points about that because it's it's a big deal we just launched it here in Doha $46 billion is a lot of money it's 10 billion doar less than we asked for this year so the first thing is that we have cramped our style we have limited our Ambitions we the humanitarian agencies in countries to focus on absolute life saving activities the most important ones so we' reduced the budget in response to the fact that the funding Gap is is widening but we're still asking for twice what we're getting this year so what does that tell us that tells us a number of things number one we need to do much more on making money work better and I think there's two things I'd like to mention there number one use of cash use of cash as a a as a humanitarian methodology gives agency to the people it it is given to and they spend it always more wisely than we would number two listen to them listen to them a lot more listen to the communities because they'll tell you no I don't want another tent thank you I'd prefer to have a road whatever money better spent number three go for economics isn't it interesting that in Afghanistan one of the things that is more talked about than humanitarian Aid at the moment in a place which is so IGN another one of the places that explored it's the economics of Afghanistan that have become an area of possibility it is the economics of Syria which is driving it into the ground it is the economics of Myanmar as well as the the war which is driving it towards Misery the humanitarian Community next year 2024 with ambitions as it has it's not only about linking up with development organizations and making sure that we do not do it through high level panels in places like New York but we do it on the ground with the communities sitting together it's not just that it's about looking at the economics of how people live and making economics and economic interventions more acceptable politically to donors more useful and tactical to those who need them you know women are four times more productive in Afghanistan when employed than men if you if you want to help women in Afghanistan and we all do of course we want their education and we of course we want them to be able to work but we can also do it through investment in economics so I want my community to be focused on a partnership with local communities first and then a partnership with the others with the economists with the World Bank with the private sector with development organizations because if we don't change our business model we were going to have another year of a major Gap in which we will be what 30% funded and there's going to come that moment when people will be saying what happened to the other 70% what what what happened last year are they alive or dead or were you fooling us and we have because of that kind of question we've limited we've focused we've narrowed our desire down but we need to supplement that with genuine Partnerships which are not about patronage and it's not about I'll hand this on to you later we'll work at the same time together that's what we need to do now that means a revolution in the business model of the humanitarian community and we're trying to do that at a time of as we've been discussing some of the greatest and most intractable conflicts and by the way climate is going to hit us again worse next year even than this year Martin griffi under Secretary General for the United Nations for humanitarian Affairs thank you for talking to alazur thanks a lot James very good to see you thank
