2 3 4 for these young women in southern Gaza throwing punches is a temporary escape from Israel's brutal War their Boxing Club was reduced to Rubble so this is where they train now in the Sandy space between the tents when we were in Northern Gaza we had a club where we trained and we had equipment including hand wraps bandages and boxing rings but the club was destroyed in the war and we were forced to move to the South we tried to set up a new club with new girls and train with available resources with no gloves or mouth guards they use everyday items as protective gear we have nothing to help us hold proper training sessions we have only our hands pillows and blankets despite the terrible situation in Gaza we will continue training these teenagers even though we don't have anything mamed a has been displaced multiple times since October but his dead dedication to empowering these young women remains steadfast from one Camp to another he's building a community of boxers when I came to carun again we managed to set up a 70 tent camp where the initiative expanded to include a big tent for teenagers and adults boxing has helped girls become stronger and more confident to the extent that parents are now relying on them more they are more aware of how to protect themselves these young Fighters aren't just learning to defend themselves they are also trying to shatter gender stereotypes there was also bullying about the boxing because people believe this sport is only for boys my message to the world is that this sport is not only for boys it's for girls as well and there's no need to feel ashamed boxing has become a way for the young women to cope with the trauma of War offering them some respite and distraction from Israel's attacks we left the north to so many places in the south and this has affected us badly on a psychological level to help ourselves and give ourselves a push and encouragement we decided to join the boxing club here because Sports is very useful particularly for girls to defend themselves n and Rema hope one day to participate in international competitions like the Olympics until then they say they'll keep training no matter how many times they're forced to move channeling their aspiration into every punch Lina abak Al jazer make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
