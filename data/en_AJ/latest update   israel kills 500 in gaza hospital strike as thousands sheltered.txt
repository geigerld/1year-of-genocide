Israel has hit a hospital in Gaza with an air strike killing hundreds of Palestinians it's the most lethal attack since the start of Israel's assault on the besieged trip on October the 7th following an incursion by Hamas into Southern Israel that killed 1300 Israelis Tuesday's air strike targeted the alah Baptist Hospital in central Gaza at least 500 people are now confirmed dead it's believed thousands of civilians were inside the hospital at the time of the attack some were patients while many were seeking shelter from Israeli bombardments earlier in the day at least six Palestinians were killed in another attack on a un run School Dimitri medena begins our coverage bodies in the hundreds scattered across the backyard of a hospital a scene many have described as a massacre the result of a deadly air strike my son that you can see here on my phone my wife just told me he died he was sitting with us and all of a sudden he disappeared hundreds of families were Sheltering in the territory of the Al Ali Baptist Hospital displaced people looking for shelter after their homes were destroyed in 11 days of non-stop bombardment we were told the Red Cross asked the hospital to let the civilians in which had Di and suddenly rockets and missiles started falling on all the civilians who were there including women and children who had their bodies dismembered no one was spared hospitals are protected by the first Geneva Convention it states that medical personnel and Facilities cannot be attacked under any circumstances if they strike a hospital that means they have no limitations they've given the green light to execute all Palestinians it means they can shoot us here as well less than an hour before the the air strike Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said civilian safety in Gaza is the responsibility of Hamas war criminals they're committing a double War crime attacking civilians hiding behind civilians as human Shields the entire world should condemn it and should support Israel in its just War this strike comes just hours after a un protected school was hit killing at least six people as Israel's blockade of Gaza continues it's 2.2 million residents remain trapped with no certain safe place to hide from Israel's attacks Demitri medeno Al jazer well let's get more on this now from TK Abu AUM he joins us live from Han Yunis that's in southern Gaza at TK's earlier we saw that horrific bombing uh of the Arab Baptist Hospital 500 people killed just bring us up to date with the latest on the attack well uh just before a couple of hours uh this hospital has been been maded by the Israeli occupation forces claiming the lives of more than 500 Palestinians those 500 Palestinians are are really uh the majority of them were civilians they were just residing in the in the complex itself it thought that they they say they think that this place is entirely safe for them uh those people who were evacuated from the from the houses northern areas of of of the Gaza strep they thought that they will be entirely secured inside these buildings and inside even the the around suring areas of this complex this building has been uh bombarded without any kind of a prior warning uh till this current moment the number of casualties is still uh little bit unknown waiting for further confirmation by the Palestinian Ministry of Health inside the Gaza Strip uh this incident really uh can put other hospitals at the same level of risk that it might it might be also bombarded uh you are talking about different hospitals inside the Gaza Strip are quite similar to the uh to the hospital of Al alab which continue which really contains a lot of residents who are trying to be uh to be protected while they are residing inside the complex itself for example a shifat hospital contains more than 30,000 Palestinians who are who are just sitting on the grounds of the of the hospital and even they are trying to feel a little bit safe inside these medical complex yeah and tck as you've been telling us over the last few days I mean most hospitals in Gaza are now close to collapse so what's happening then uh to the casualties from at the Baptist uh Hospital bombing and where are they being taken well uh generally the medical health uh Cur system inside the Gaza Strip is witnessing massive deter in terms of the medical supplies the Israeli occupation forces continues continue to pan the injury of any medical supply even if you to generate uh enough electricity for the hospitals hospitals right now inside the Gaza Strip are working uh on their minimum capabilities in order to uh provide different kinds of Medical Care dis despite the fact that the even the medical teams have been bombarded and even killed by the Israeli occupation forces air strikes so uh the the current condition inside these hospitals are really are witnessing such a great shortage of every of every medical supply and even medical drugs different pharmaceutical warehouses were even debled uh even the inside the bank blood inside the Gaza Strip in different hospitals were also run out so it seems that the current situation in these hospitals won't really continue as the same level as it was before uh due to the Israeli ongoing closure of borders and even the the the prevention of injury of medical supplies yeah t and given the ongoing Israeli blockade and those air strikes you've just described I mean how are Palestinians getting the basics I mean Food Water Shelter the humanitarian situation is clearly getting worse well Palestinians really are struggling in order to uh to get their basic needs inside the Gaza Strip they depend on the local uh Market of the Palestinian territory inside the Gaza stroke they are consuming every single product inside this market now with the with the with the ongoing closure of every of borders and the prevention of the entry of Food Supplies Palestinians will deplete all of the possible products in the market which can bring us to to a possible or potential uh starvation if there is no any International intervention talk plays to provide Gaza with the humanitarian AIDS and Tark you've now moved South um in the Gaza Strip down to KH Yunis what's the situation there where you are then well uh the situation right now Kana city is similar to other other other other cities inside the Gaza Strip uh bombardment is everywhere in the entire Gaza Strip uh simply because uh just before a couple of hours uh different bombardments tooking place in Kana City uh leading to the death of uh several uh people and even to the uh injury of others it's important also to mention to mention that there there was during the last couple of days a mass uh displacement uh waves from the Palestinians who are living in the Northern and Central areas of the Gaza Strip thinking that this place is going to be much more safe meanwhile every single corner of the Gaza Strip had been bombarded and hit by the Israeli occupation forces now with the more densely populated population that had been uh right now in khuna City it seems that this area has been more densely populated which really can Pro such a such significant uh pressure and loads of medical teams in order to keep providing a treatment for the wounded people who are just turning to the hospital from time to another all right tar Abu aim live for us there in hanun in southern Gaza Tark thank you well the hospital Massacre has triggered Mass protests in O in the occupied West Bank with hundreds of Palestinian protesters taken to the streets in [Applause] rala demonstrators marched in solidarity with the people of Gaza after the Israeli air strike on the Al Ali Baptist Hospital there were confrontations with security forces it's been reported that one Palestinian demonstrator has been killed by Israeli forces in a village near ramalo well Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas has announced the attack on the Baptist hospital as a hideous Massacre saying Palestinians will not be forced from their lands Israel's government has no red lines anymore and it should be held responsible and punished since the beginning of the aggression there's been Bloodshed given tonight's Massacre I decided to cancel my visit and come back home to be with my people during these hard times we will not surrender but what is important is we will stay on our land we will not leave our land and we will not allow anyone to force us to leave as they did in the past the past will not repeat itself 1948 and 1967's events will not happen again well the Israeli Prime Minister has denied that Israel was involved in the bombing of the Baptist Hospital in Gaza in a social media message on X formerly known as Twitter Netanyahu said the entire world should know it was barbaric terrorists in Gaza that attacked the hospital and not the IDF those who brutally murdered our children also murdered their own children well Imran Khan joins us live now from occupied East Jerusalem Iman so what more reaction have we had then from the Israelis about the bombing of the Arab Baptist Hospital in Gaza and of course that un School shelter well once yeah that's right well once uh the Prime Minister actually tweeted uh that was backed up by lots more tweets from Israeli officials they included uh president Isaac Herzog they also included Benny Gans who's part of the war cabinet they are squarely blaming Islamic Jihad uh for this attack however um we have heard from Islamic Jihad they've denied all of this so there's this information War that's going on right now and this is very typical of the Israelis they do this every time there is an attack that doesn't quite go with their narrative or doesn't quite go with what they want to present to the world which is Israel's right to defend itself now remember Shireen Abu our colleague who was killed um inine um in 2022 um that attack actually during the early hours of it the Israelis said it was Palestinian gunman they muddied the water they put out information so it can it it distracts people a couple of days later they turned around and went actually sorry yes it was us no one's been charged for that attack uh but they did admit it was them whether that happens uh this time around we don't know but it's a very typically Israeli thing to do also uh the Anglican Church who owns the building who run the building uh the hospital that was bombed have said it was the Israelis msf several other people have said it it was uh the Israelis you heard from Prime president Mahmud abasa also confirming that ryad mansur the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations also saying it was the Israelis and now you see all of these protests taking place uh across um the Arab world uh against the US and Israeli embassies there so we are in this middle of this information war and expect the Israelis to continue that message uh blaming Islamic Jihad but like we say uh Islamic Jihad have actually denied it was them um IM we know that US President Joe Biden's on his way to Israel I mean this Hospital bombing uh will surely complicate his trip remind us what Biden's hoping to achieve he's it's an unprecedented visit firstly let's get that out the way completely what he's doing is coming to a place that is an active war zone now yes he did go to Ukraine um but he went to Ukraine to ke when it was relatively safe here there's a very complicated situation he's going to fly into borian airport he was supposed to go to Jordan and meet with prime minister um uh sorry president Abdul CCE also of Egypt who's also supposed to meet with King Abdullah of Jordan and Prime president Mahmud Abbas that actually got canceled it was firstly it was Mahmud Abbas who actually can on President joee Biden I think he was incredibly frustrated that there was no ceasefire so now he's actually flying straight to borian airport the Arab Street the Palestinian street is going to be looking at this visit and the those was two overarch overarching narratives here one from the Palestinian Street just going well now at least we know who he's supporting and there's no um we we know that he's not lying about trying to actually get a ceasefire and the other one is well we've actually been abandoned by the west but there's a much more interesting Dynamic here as well remember I just talked about Mahmud Abbas Mahmud Abbas has no uh influence over Hamas or any influence over the Israelis the International Community was uh the only real Avenue open uh to him and now he doesn't even have that anymore he doesn't have that relationship with President Joe Biden they they're not going to talk so that's actually been shut down so that's going to be a concern for the international diplomatic community but for the Palestinians who simply say well actually we weren't getting anything that we wanted even the basics that we wanted a ceasefire and humanitarian Corridor we weren't getting that so what is what was the point of sitting in that meeting um imra just a final thought to you I mean we've seen Palestinian protests break out uh right across the occupied West Bank certainly in rala and other places tensions clearly High across the occupied territories and Palestinians are also extremely angry at president Mahmud Abbas that's absolutely right but let me just tell you I spent since October the 7th in rala and you arrived here in occupied East Jerusalem today the protests that took place were peaceful uh they were small but they were frequent that were happening throughout the day there would be 10020 200 people they'd come into Manara Square in the center of ramala and then they would leave but today's events have been unprecedented the hospital bombing simply angered Palestinian to the point where they came into the square and they were chanting for president Mahmud abas to step down and that's when the uh PA Security Forces got involved when they were chanting for Gaza when they were chanting in support of the people of Gaza and the plight that they're in that extreme situation they're in the uh Palestinian Authority Security Forces allowed them to but the minute they started to criticize U president Mahmud Abbas that's when they decided to to crack down this may well backfire against President makas because um he's stuck between a rock and a hard place he understands that there's a lot of support for the people of Gaza on the streets of the occupied West Bank by not going to see President Joe Biden that may go some way to appease these protesters but when you see pictures like the ones we've just been seeing from that hospital bombing people are they don't the Palestinians are now United because this is Palestinians that are being attacked in Gaza and remember the occupied West Bank and Gaza aren't silos they're not separate countries a lot of the people in the occupied West Bank have relations have friends have cousins have family members some who they've never seen because of the blockade living in Gaza these are these are connected people so they are all Palestinians at the end of the day and those pictures brought out the anger in them and I haven't seen that anger uh since October the 7th all right aler enan Khan their life rest Us in occupied East Jerusalem Iran thank you well speaking alongside ambassadors from Arab countries palestine's ambassador to the UN blamed Israel for Tuesday night's air strike on that hospital in Gaza we hold Israel responsible for this massacre this crime and those responsible for this crime should face Justice and should face accountability and should be you know punishment uh uh rising to the level of this crime committed against our people to be faced by them we as an Arab group demand immediately a ceasefire because the continuation of the war it means killing more Palestinians every moment well the UN Secretary General Antonio GES has also expressed outrage at the massacre in a statement on social media GIS said I am horrified by the killing of hundreds of Palestinian civilians in a strike on a hospital in Gaza today which I strongly condemn my heart is with the families of the victims hospitals and medical personnel are protected under International humanitarian law well Gabriel Alando joins us live now from un headquarters in New York Gabe so a very strong statement from the UN Chief Antonio KES what more can you tell us about that statement after the hospital bombing in Gaza yeah that statement uh from Gutierrez just came over in the last 10 or 15 minutes or so you'll notice in that statement it's the first time we've heard any public comment uh from the Secretary General since that hospital attack you'll notice what he did not say though he did not uh call for an immediate ceasefire as the Arab ambassadors are demanding and pushing for and he did also did not place blame on that hospital attack yet either we are hearing from from uh secretary General's office that he is working on a more extensive statement and we could be getting that in the next hour or so so be watching that very closely as you mentioned there you saw the within the last couple hours uh more than a dozen ambassadors uh from Arab countries spoke they were unified in their front uh calling primarily for one thing one thing only uh at least right now and that's an immediate ceasefire now the UN Security Council voted against that uh uh yesterday uh there was a Russian draft resolution that called for an immediate ceasefire that was voted down uh the US France Japan and the UK voted it down it did not have enough votes to go forward uh and now we are hearing and this is important uh tomorrow or Wednesday uh morning there is going to be a briefing uh by the top un officials on humanitarian a uh humanitarian Affairs a briefing that was called by the security Council by Russia and the UAE where they are going to get a briefing about the hospital attack but perhaps equally as important during that meeting uh Brazil has called for a vote on their draft resolution that call that calls for among other things a humanitarian pause in hostilities in Gaza so uh the a foreign aid and humanitarian Aid can get inside so a lot of moving Parts at un headquarters right now and a lot of things coming up in the coming hours as well yeah Gabe as you say the Diplomatic effort remains extremely fluid at the moment we were hearing earlier that Russia and the UAE uh were calling for an emergency security council meeting over uh that hospital bombing just talk us through that yeah that was called a few hours ago uh that was by Russia and the UAE and this is the 10A am meeting on Wednesday that I was referring to uh and at this meeting they are going to be briefed by two of the top un officials on humanitarian Affairs uh we expect this to be an open meeting and because Russia feels quite frankly that because their draft resolution was shot down uh that called for an immediate ceasefire that was shot down about 24 hours ago Russia is basically saying and even the Arab ambassadors are saying the same thing if the security Council agreed to that we could possibly have been in a situation where we had a ceasefire on Tuesday and this Hospital uh strike would not have happened I mean that's all of course speculation at this point because uh of course but that's essentially so that's why Russia and the UAE uh again both of who of who voted for this draft resolution that was unsuccessful now are calling for this meeting uh at 10:00 a.m. on Wednesday now to get this briefing so again we expect it to be an open briefing we'll be able to to hear what is being said and at the same time probably just as important as we're expecting Brazil to call a a vote on their draft resolution as well it's unclear uh if if that draft resolution will be voted uh for or not uh the US and the UK and France have not given any indications if they're willing to vote for that which would cause for humanitarian pause there are so many events happening right now uh related to this war so much diplomacy going on behind the scenes right now uh the situation here at the UN headquarters is almost changing by the hour yeah Gabe um just a final thought to you me you touched briefly on the humanitarian uh situation I mean how worried uh is the United Nations the security Council Etc about the worsening situation in Gaza because the pictures we're seeing and they're seeing on their TV screens are absolutely horrific they are uh I've been covering the UN off and on uh for several years years now and I don't think I've ever seen the UN so concerned about the humanitarian condition that they're seeing right now in Gaza and they the UN as we all know deals with a lot of humanitarian crisises all over the world but the sense of urgency that you're seeing from various un officials and various un uh departments and and and so for example unra uh is really something that we have not seen in many many years they are very worried because they cannot get the necessary humanitarian Aid to people that need it and even un facilities as we've been reporting today Tuesday uh with this un school that was hit this is uh several un schools that were hit incl including two that were housing internally displaced people and the fact that un the UN cannot get any sort of Aid in there and they cannot get their people out or other people in is really and this is a word we've been using for the last week but it really is true unprecedented and that's what un officials are saying they are facing an absolutely unprecedented crisis in trying to do their jobs as humanitarians of trying to protect people innocent people uh in this conflict and not only protect them but provide Aid comfort and security the UN officials there saying we simply can no longer do it all right Gabriel alander live for us there from un headquarters in New York Gabe thank you now US President Joe Biden is on his way to Israel and has postponed a planned Summit in Jordan with Arab leaders following Tuesday's attack on the alahi Arab Hospital in Gaza the White House announced a change in schedule as Biden took off from the US Mike Hanah reports from Washington Joe Biden leaves the white house on an unprecedented Journey a US president traveling to Israel as it wages War the prime intention to visibly demonstrate us support in the most dramatic of ways he goes with the full backing of Congress the US Senate at work to push through a buil providing material Aid to Israel as well as humanitarian relief for Palestinians the Senate must above all work quickly and swiftly to draft consider and pass a strong Aid package for Israel as soon as we can that includes Military Support intelligence support diplomatic help the Senate minority leader adds other elements to the presidential to-do list he need to make it clear that his administration will do everything possible to keep Israel the time and the space it needs to conduct the required military operations for as long as it takes how many more hold out sir the house is still in turmoil with majority Republicans sharply divided over ideology leadership and policy yet amidst this division there is one point of agreement among all support for the state of Israel well I think the resolution first to show that the American people through their representatives support Israel and condemn Hamas and these Terror attacks the deadline to refunding the government is fast approaching but for most Republicans the priority is to get a pro-israel bill through the house this on top of the $3.3 billion a year that Congress has never contested the US was the first country in the world to recognize Israel the recognition by President Truman coming only 11 minutes after the provisional government declared statehood on May the 14th 1948 and President Biden is likely to point to the drive to pass an Israel bill in the Senate and the house as clear evidence that recognition and support has never wavered Mye Hanah AER Washington well US President Joe Biden says he's outraged by the explosion at the AL AI Baptist Hospital in a statement he said I'm outraged and deeply saddened by the explosion at the Arab Hospital in Gaza and the terrible loss of life that resulted immediately upon hearing this news I spoke with King Abdullah of Jordan and prime minister Netanyahu of Israel and have directed my National Security team to continue gathering information about what exactly happened the United States stands unequivocally for the protection of civan life during conflict and we mourn the patients medical staff and other Innocents killed or wounded in this tragedy let's get more now from Mike Hannah he joins us live from Washington DC so it seems events are already overtaking President Biden's visit to Israel Mike the jordanians have cancel their Summit with Biden and earlier as we've been saying we saw that horrific Hospital bombing in Gaza what impact will all of this have on Biden's trip do you make do you think well it's already had a major impact um President Biden was in his mcade on his way to Joint Base Andrews when the Jordanian foreign minister confirmed that that meeting in Aman had been cancelled uh the prior to that mahmed abas the Palestinian leader had also turned down the meeting he returned to rala in the wake of this bombing in Gaza so already you've had an impact the White House itself says uh that the meeting has been cancelled uh because of this event to give everybody a period of mourning but it does have an impact on the Biden visit now one of the reasons why President Biden is going to the region is to attempt to prevent a widening of the conflict that's what his secretary of state has been doing during a Whistle Stop diplomacy tour in the region in recent days President Biden wants to add his voice to this to reassure us allies that he's working towards calming the situation down not wanting to see any spreading of the conflict but we've seen that conflict spread in the course of the day the demonstrations that are erupting in many areas in the region so this has made President Biden's visit far more difficult it's raised the heat on what he's doing and is casting sharp focus on those critics of the United States and his relationship with Israel in terms of that relationship at a time when many believe that what has happened is a a tributal to the state of Israel that is something as we heard there that President Biden says his intelligence agencies are investigating but it certainly comes at a very very problematic time for President Biden as he heads towards the Middle East for this virtually unprecedented visit going to Israel in a time of War yeah Mike and and that's an important point you make because with protests now taking place across many Arab countries in the region how much secur security concern is there for President Biden as you say he's going straight into an active war zone well I think whenever US president travels there's always security concern but as you point out this is an increasingly heighten situation one must remember that President Biden did travel into Ukraine at the height of that particular War uh so it is not unprecedented for him to go into a war zone but the situation is so intense that obviously there is a element of security risk one that his advisers have clearly closely looked at and as I say the whole visit was uh positioned on discussions with prime minister Netanyahu on reaching out to us Arab allies in the region the whole intention being to try and level the drop the level of the conflict but also very importantly we've heard from the Biden Administration to get humanitarian efforts into place uh we've heard from Administration officials repeatedly in recent days uh that this humanitarian effort is absolutely essential for those Palestinians who have no relationship whatsoever with Hamas and who are suffering in this current conflict now this is a slight shift in the US position uh from the beginning of the conflict in which uh there were no calls for restraint but now you've got uh the US in the National Security Chief adviser for example saying that Israel too has a role to play in humanitarian relief along with others in uh in the region so all of these elements are coming together President Biden threading a very thin needle here in terms of maintaining what he says is US unquestion support for Israel with questions coming from allies uh like the president of Egypt like the King of Jordan about the role that Israel is playing in this conflict so the US president attempting to balance all these issues out and this made all the more dire by what happened in Gaza in the course of the day Mike just a final quick thought to you I mean there have been some hints that a further uh us mobilization aside from those two aircraft carrier groups uh any word on troops on the ground possibly well as you say you have got two carrier fleets having been sent to the region that's a massive show of force you've also got Marine Expeditionary Unit which has been moved in there we understand from the Pentagon now that is a different uh level altoe in a way the Marine Expeditionary Unit is there with Marines on board sometimes for a landing also of course it is used in a way of moving uh people out of combat conflict zones but the ramping up of a US military presence in that particular region is a sign of the concern of the US Administration about what is happening there and also a not too subtle signal to Iran who some Hawks within the US claim are actually trying to seek opportunity in this situation this massive uh us buildup both at Sea and also in the air lots of new aircraft being sent into the region uh so all of these things are coming together in the US gradually getting involved to a greater degree in this conflict than it has on occasions in the past all right Al jaaz is Mike Hannah there live for us in Washington DC Mike thank you let's bring in Abdel hammed sayam he's a professor of political science and Middle East studies at ruas University he was also
