and the US Secretary of State says Israel has an obligation to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza Anthony blinkin made those comments at his end ofe press conference and said Washington will focus on bringing the war to an end as quickly as possible we continue to believe that Israel does not have to choose between removing the threat of Hamas and minimizing the toll on civilians in Gaza it has an obligation to do both and it has a strategic interest to do both we're more determined than ever to ensure that out of this horrific tragedy comes a moment of possibility for Israelis for Palestinians for the region to live in lasting peace and Lasting security that out of this darkness comes light let's bring in Mike Hannah he's joining us live from Washington DC and what else did we hear from Secretary of State Anthony blinken Mike he was also so asked about what it would take for the us to stop vetoing resolutions at the UN Security Council wasn't he yes he was and he didn't answer that question directly he went on to say that the latest resolution which is now being put on hold again uh deals with humanitarian Affairs and the US is insistent that it doesn't want any resolution passed that will not help the provision of a humanitarian Aid to the people of Gaza so he didn't answer that question directly just as he didn't answer a question which was put to him directly does the US have a red line when it comes to the manner of Israel's operations in Gaza and the occupied West Bank once again he didn't answer that directly he continued to say what has been the line offered by the Biden Administration that Israel has a right and indeed duty to take operations against Hamas at the same time it has a right and a strategic duty to be able to minimize uh the cost of Civilian casualties he describe the uh this as vitally important how Israel conducts its operations so the Secretary of State like the Biden Administration walking the thin line here attempting to show that it cares about civilian casualties and is indeed deeply concerned about them at the same time wanting to publicly back Israel in its ongoing operations just to add the Secretary of State also spoke about over the year the US has strengthened its alliances uh throughout the globe with his partner organizations however another question that he would not answer is to what extent the US ongoing unquestioning support of Israel is impacting on these Global alliances and Mike we've also heard from President Biden who's been speaking what does he had to say well we heard from President Biden on the subject of a Colorado Supreme Court decision in terms of which it ruled on an unprecedented basis uh that former president Trump cannot stand on the ballot in uh Colorado because of an 1868 uh resolution in terms of which anybody who takes Parts in Acts of in Insurrection cannot hold an elected office now President Biden was asked about this first of all he said yes he had has no doubt that Donald Trump took part in an Insurrection however on the issue as to whether this should disqualify him from standing in the Colorado ballot that said President Biden is something that's up for the courts to decide he doesn't want to get caught in the legal e of this argument which very clearly is going to go all the way to the Supreme Court which just to add the Supreme Court has already accepted a brief from the special prosecutor investigating Donald by in terms of Donald Trump in terms of ruling on the question of his immunity now this is in regard to another case but clearly it has to do with the Colorado case as well first of all the level of insurrection whether it can be applied against Donald Trump secondly the question of whether there is any presidential immunity for president Trump for ACT heed while in office so in all likelihood we are going to see a US Supreme Court maybe binding these two matters together and ruling and it does appear as a matter of urgency ruling on both matters immunity and whether or not Donald Trump can be kicked off that Colorado ballot at the same time all right Mike thank you very much for that uh Mike Han with the latest on both of those stories live in Washington DC
