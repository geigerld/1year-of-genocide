let's bring in Tama Kut once uh more uh to talk through all of this now as we saw in that story it seems like the US and Israel has becoming more and more I guess pushed to one side by the majority of the rest of the world calling for a humanitarian ceasefire at the moment we are seeing uh the Turkish president f t erdogan uh with a huge huge rally in estanbul we were talking to our correspondent earlier and he said that there were approximately 1 million people that have turned out huge numbers we've seen huge numbers in London uh as well in support of Palestine does that uh I mean apart from I guess as a show of solidarity does it actually do anything for the people in Gaza because it does seem at this point in time that Israel and the US to a certain extent simply aren't listening uh Tom yes these developments are really positive and very much encouraged at this stage because the streets have have have spoken in different capitals in the world this is a public Awakening this is an an uprising in a way that the streets or the the people all over the world are not accepting the rationality and the narratives behind justifying this this this brutal War Israel is carrying on Gaza now because it it it cross it went it went too far too far in in the way it's it's it's being conducted uh so it's for me it's it's it's it's good to see I mean uh uh uh these demonstrations happening and and and and the momentum momentum needs to be kept in a uh So So eventually this will materialize into public pressure a change in the political behavior of the politicians in these countries and hopefully it brings an end to this uh to this SW yeah many many people now including many world leaders are calling for a humanitarian ceasefire needs to happen immediately clearly to help the people the civilians inside uh Gaza we've been speaking to you for the last several weeks as well about this and you have been calling for exactly the same thing but do you have more or less hope now after what you've seen overnight from that bombardment with Israel and all of the rhetoric from them do you have more or less hope that we are closer to a ceasefire Tom I mean personally uh I I see I don't see it coming in the very near future I still uh see that the US have a green light from the U Israel has a green light from the US to uh keep the the pace of this military operations and even continue escalated further because when we listen to Israeli politicians they they still keep repeating the same goal which is an utter defeat and uh and getting rid of of Hamas regime in Gaza so I didn't see the goals changing the the main goal is still the same now there is a discussion on the tactics how to achieve achieved this goal and this is where we see differences between the US and Israel uh where the Americans say or it seems they're not big fans of uh or not in favor of a land a full land inversion and they're urging the Israelis to learn from the fua uh scenario and you know mosal scenario and and just go through tactical surgical military operations into the Gaza Strip but it doesn't matter for me it's whether if it's tactical or a full invasion the the the scale of Destruction that is happening at this face in the Gaza Strip it's it's an utter disaster So eventually it could lead to a total implosion from within like Gaza really imploding with with the vast needs and the vast destruction and we don't see any movement on any important file like Aid delivery like electricity communication now being cut so things it seems like everything is worsening so you see the International Community is demanding and uh and wants to see an immediate Seas fire even the US lecturing Israel on on allowing some humanitarian corridors but in reality the actions of Israel is totally in a different path in a different way and it worries me that Israel feels it's protected and it has a green light to just keep doing whatever it's doing now it certainly appears that way with the communications with internet and phones being cut off about this time yesterday as well unbelievable yeah it's unbelievable thank you once again tamak Kut thank you
