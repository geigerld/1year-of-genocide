will Israel obey the ruling of the un's top Court the international court of justice has ordered Israel to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza and it says it has a month to report on its compliance but what does this ruling mean for Palestinians who are trapped and under attack this is Inside hello there and welcome to the program I'm nstasia Tay the United Nations top court has ordered Israel to take measures to prevent genocide in Gaza and to allow in humanitarian Aid the international court of justice issued their ruling on Friday in a case that was filed by South Africa judges voted overwhelmingly in faor of six emergency measures that included asking Israel to punish those inciting genocide so how will this ruling impact Israel's war on Gaza and how might other countries pressure Israel to comply there's plenty to discuss with our guests but first this report from Michael Apple takes a closer look at the icj's ruling in a historic ruling the world court has determined there's plausible evidence of genocide unfolding in Gaza a judgment welcomed in Palestine it means that the cries and suffering of our people in Gaza have been heard in the Great Hall of Justice the un's top Court also known as the international court of justice says Israel must take six provisional measures to ensure the Palestinian people are protected and submit a report within a month detailing its compliance South Africa brought the case to the icj accusing Israel of violating International laws on genocide in the territory and and it sees the ruling as victory for human rights our core purpose was really that it is vital to highlight the plight of the innocent in Palestine and to also uh alert the International Community to the great harm that uh is being done uh to the people of Palestine the Israeli Prime Minister's response was one of defiance condemning the ruling and calling it a disgrace Israel's commitment to international law is unwavering equally unwavering is our sacred commitment to continue to defend our country and defend our people like every country Israel has an inherent right to defend itself the vile attempt to deny Israel this fundamental right is blatant discrimination against the Jewish state but still for Palestinians this is a watershed moment in their struggle for Liberation from Israeli occupation and its war and many are now watching to see how South Africa will use this ruling to increase its diplomatic efforts in calling for an end to Israel's war inside the Gaza Strip Mike leppel for Inside Story well let's now bring in our guests in London we have Nim suani a reader in public law at soas at the University of London he is also the editor and chief of the Palestine yearbook of international law in Melbourne Australia we have Jeffrey Robertson a human rights Barrister and also the founder of Dy Street Chambers one of the largest human rights legal practices in Europe also joining us today from London is Chris gunnis a former spokesperson for the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees and also the founder of the Myanmar accountability project a warm welcome to you all thank you gentlemen for joining us today on inside story now the icj hasn't just said that there's the plausibility of genocide taking place it's also implemented these six emergency measures and I know there's been plenty of concern about the icj here not calling for a ceasefire but by my understanding the icj only has jurisdiction over States right so here it has jurisdiction over Israel it doesn't have jurisdiction over Hamas and and obviously a cire would actually take two parties in order to comply we've heard though from NED pandor the South African foreign minister saying that that these six measures effectively amount to a a deao ceasefire Chris you've worked on the ground there what do you make of that is this effectively a ceas fire without necessarily calling it one well first of all let me say that the icj ruling is truly historic a historic milestone in the Long Road of the Palestinians towards dignity and Justice and statehood and yes I agree I have worked on the ground and if the Israeli Army does what it's now legally Bing they've been told by legally binding a judgment by this court to do stop killing you know that's the first part of article two of the convention cease actions which harm both mentally and physically promoting conditions of life that don't see babies being killed if the IDF actually does that then as the South Africans have said it is a de facto ceasefire how can you deliver humanitarian Aid unless there's a ceasefire so I think the South AF the court was very very clever because ultimately what they asked for was American foreign policy towards Israel they said okay the ceasefire may be difficult but as Anthony blinkin keeps saying and the absence of that let us have adherence to International um law and by the way the other important thing that was said is that it's the clues in the name it's the convention on the prevention and Punishment of genocide and judge Dono made it very clear that three people in particular prime minister Netanyahu defense minister yav Galant and the president it Herzog they are guilty of inciting genocide and the convention is very clear they have to be punished and Israel has to report back within 30 days on the steps it's doing to implement that so I think when I say this is a historic Milestone it moves the whole debate about Palestine yes the laws of occupation all that matters humanitarian law all of that matters we can now talk about the law of genocide the crime of crimes and news organizations and commentator such as those on our program can legitimately talk about Israel's responsibility to stop and prevent genocide and the state parties to the convention America Britain they have to bring meaningful pressure on Israel I'm thinking here of America's four billion dollars worth of military aid and all the Diplomatic and political protection in the security Council they have to use all of that to see the convention implemented we've moved to a new phase and that's why yesterday was truly historic and N I see you you nodding there let me bring you in here and ask you to reflect on the magnitude of this ruling indeed I agree with Chris this is a Monumental uh decision by the international court of justice on the one hand once South Africa submitted its application to the international court of justice it already changed the conversation it changed the Western narrative over the war on Gaza and on the inan people and now that the interal court of justice the highest court in the international legal system have basic has basically accepted the South African narrative that there is a risk of genocide here that this is beyond the simply violation of international uh laws of war and that this risk of genocide uh against a substantial part of the Palestinian people uh require action urgent action first of all from the court but also from All State parties that are uh need to that need to discharge their obligation to prevent genocide and obviously as Chris said the provisional measures such as the requirement from Israel to allow effective and immediate humanitarian assistance require scaling down drastically Israel's military operations if not a complete ceasefire because the court also cited the UN Secretary General who said that effective humanitarian assistance is not possible with the continuation of the bombardment and the Israeli military uh ground incursions so in order for Israel to comply with these provisional measures it has to allow uh scaling down of the military operations uh in add in addition as Chris said the political repercussions of this legal ruling are far reaching on the one hand it increases pressure on Israel both internally externally we saw internally there is a lot of discontent now because the war hasn't achieved its aims declared aims by the government the families of the hostages are now increasingly protesting that is a beginning of protests against the war in some Israeli cities and there is ACC ations in the media that Netanyahu is prolonging the war for his political survival and now externally this ruling will embarrass all the Western backers of Israel because now they have been possibly supporting a genocide and now any action they will be taking will be judged Visa their obligation to prevent genocide I want to get into the nitty-gritty of of all those political consequences in just a moment but I want to pick up on something that that Chris mentioned earlier you use the phrase legally binding we know this ruling is legally binding but crucially the court the icj does not have an enforcement mechanism and we've heard already from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu he says that he's rejected the ruling outright so it doesn't look like Israel is likely to comply with what the court is is asking for here Jeffrey let me bring you into this discussion what legal recourse is there if Israel says no we just not going to do it there is no legal recourse the court the same court two years ago brought in an order against Russia which had most wickedly disrupted the order and broken the law against aggression by invading uh an innocent country namely Ukraine and Ukraine went to the court and the court immediately and unanimously ordered Russia to put its arms down of course it didn't Putin who is a massive war criminal on any view uh refused and so uh went on and was not brought up but I do think that the importance of the ruling goes beyond its unenforceability because this is not Russia where everyone is scared to do the right thing because it's got nuclear weapons uh Israel has nuclear weapons but it depends on the support of Western Powers particularly the United States but also European countries and if there's one Chorus Line that has been used by all Western countries in commenting on on the Gaza War it is we M Israel must obey international law and Israel has said that itself has bound itself and its support to international law now the court by first of all accepting the case what is called its jurisdiction that was the main issue and that's the issue that Israel lost so the court declares itself competent to give orders and does give a few the first order of course is that Hamas should release unconditionally the hostages that it has so obscenely taken from Israel the second order and perhaps the most important because it is uh enforceable by pressure from Israel's backers is that it should lift the threat of starvation and allow humanitarian convoys in and then there are other orders that Israel will no doubt say it is complying with and which other well let let me jump in there Jeffrey because mention important Point civilian sorry to sorry to interrupt you Jeffrey I just want to pick up on something that you were saying there about allowing access for Aid and one of the interesting things that I noticed was that um in this case so in this particular case both South Africa and Israel also appoint judges to sit on the court so instead of the regular 15 there were there were 17 and the the Israeli judge voted for two of these measures in favor of them so to punish incitement to genocide and also on Aid access and and primarily because Israel by my understanding is is saying that Aid is already unhindered Chris as someone who used to work for unra let me ask what you make of that assertion well I think it's absolutely right and I think an Israel as an Israeli a highly respected Israeli judge he was actually in charge of the Israeli Supreme Court when I was a spokesman for anra and I went to the Supreme Court and was amazed and delighted by how he was trying to professional the Supreme Court so he's highly respected but yes I think like a lot of people in Israel he's utterly disgusted by the fact that the politicians there have made it so easy for the South Africans to make their argument about the intentionality behind the genocide um threats which were very very clearly put by the South Africans and I think also on this question of humanitarian Aid it's absolutely the case that you know it has to get in it is a collective punishment to you know more than half of the G scrip are children and even more are women so you know it's it's it's something which is Israel simply has to step up to its humanitarian obligations but if I may I wanted to ask Jeffrey if I could just ask Jeffrey something very quickly when Jeffrey talked about the lack of enforceability um Jeffrey what about State parties what about the other 150 odd signatories to the convention surely as we're seeing in America where in the federal court in California Biden and blinken and Austin are being accused both of complicity in genocide and failing to prevent genocide now when it comes to enforcing what we heard yesterday surely the Judgment of the Court gives griss to the mill of those people in jurisdictions who are trying to hold the state parties to account for failing to implement the genocide convention what are your thoughts on that Jeffrey my thoughts on that are very clear because I think the court was scrupulous in not finding that Israel had committed genocide it had simply said it is arguable and it particularly pointed out the kind of statements that hurts of the president and the defense minister had been saying about Palestinians being animals who should be liquidated that's the kind of genocidal intent that shows but in fact there is another argument a traditional argument that Israel is not committing genocide because it is seeking to wipe out Hamas which is a political organization and so it is it is in effect committing politicide if you like but not genocide because it is acting out of uh attacking the politic these are arguments that are going to be made down the L Israel's right to exist let me jump in there Jeffrey because a lot of these discussions are going to happen as we look at the the broader case that the genocide case which could take years as as we've seen I want to bring in Nim here because I could see you shaking your head as Chris was speaking and I also have a subsequent convers um a subsequent question within your conversation gentleman which was around this question of intent and we have heard a lot of these statements from very senior government officials and and one of the requirements of the ruling from the icj was to punish the incitement to genocide and when we're talking about um politicians who perhaps have have some level of immunity I'm curious about how that's supposed to take place as well n let let me bring you in yeah I had a kind a minor disagreement with Chris with respect to the description of the role of Haron Barak so I and other Palestinian legal Scholars have at least since 2007 been writing about the ways in which Aon Barak legitimize the occupation and that and we coin the term a diplomat judge because his liberal rhetoric his human rights uh the image and the activist judge image actually was used by Israel including Ariel Chon in 2004 to whitewash Israel's crimes and under his uh leadership of the Supreme Court in Israel the apar system has Consolidated and the occupation became much more brutal when he was appointed to the uh as an adhoc judge in theal court of justice the Z media said okay now this is the time to examine what Aon Barak has been telling them TR them for decades that Jud judicial review expansion inside Israel will protect Israel and Israeli soldiers from persecution on the world stage and that the high court will be a shield for Israel on the international level and indeed in his uh uh like separate report for the international court of justice he rejects the genocide accusation he rejects the that there is a genocide genocidal intent and he said H that he agreed with these two measures because he thinks Israel is already complying with these and indeed his impartiality was questioned because in November he gave a statement to the glob and mail the Canadian newspaper in which he said that he thinks Israel has been compliant with International humanitarian law so he is a bias judge that was appointed by Israel specifically for a symbolic value and order to provide a counternarrative now with respect to your question the uh obligation now on Israel is that to they have to punish all these statements of incitement to genocide and the obvious problem is that the these statement have been so prominent so dominant for three months inside Israel that it really can be separated from actual State policy because why did Israel for 3 months not do anything about these statements even though they were daily on TV by senior officials by members ofet by Army generals Etc and now they Stand Accused that by fa by failing to discharge their obligations under the genocide convention because they did not prevent these statements they did not punish these statement and the only attempt to do anything about these statements was after South Africa uh submitted it application indeed this shows the importance of the South African application again and it's it as Chris was pointing out has changed the narrative and this ruling certainly has changed the narrative within the context of this new narrative that we're talking about I want to ask you Jeffrey I'll go to you first about the arms trade treaty because I I was looking at at the phrasing and it prohibits parties from armed transfers if they have knowledge at the time of authorization that the arms or items would be used in the commission of genocide crimes against humanity grave breaches of the Geneva Convention attacks directed against civilian objects or civilians protected as such or other war crimes so what is now at stake here when we're when we're using the phrase genocide and the genocide convention what's at stake here for countries like Canada the UK and and crucially the United States I'm glad you picked up on that because that is of course one of the great questions and there are already protests outside um arms manufacturers who are supplying arms for transmission to Israel and for use uh it may be in non- genocidal contexts for example uh providing uh fire hydrants and and means of peacefully uh although nonetheless forcefully stopping protest there's always been a question about that but if you can identify a shipment of arms that goes to uh the IDF the Israeli Defense Force for use uh as bombs cluster bombing or whatever uh indiscriminate bombing which kills civilians and by killing civilians kills uh all almost half uh children under the age of 18 and this is one of the red lines that Israel has breached the the killing of children U then it can be I think the decision can be prayed in Aid uh for injunctions sought by either Pro Palestinian groups or pro peace groups in Britain and Canada but again there are limits because this judgment does not say and it's very careful not to convict Israel of genocide it simply says that there's an argument to be made which may take a year or two being evaluated evidence is being gathered to theth I want to ask about a little more about enforcement because one possible route that's been suggested is the United Nations security Council they're meeting again on Wednesday to discuss Gaza obviously up until now the US has vetoed multiple resolutions trying to stop the fighting at the security Council now that we have this ruling if there is a resolution that that's proposed at the security Council as there is seemingly likely to be in line with the measures that have been described by the icj in its ruling does it then put a huge amount of pressure on Washington not to veto because essentially and let me put this this question to you Chris essentially a veto would be a vote against what the US has always been a proponent of a rules-based international order absolutely and I think that's what is one of the things that's so clever about what the court has done because its judgment Accords Almost 100% with American policy towards Israel it's not demanded as ceasefire though I argue that it's a de facto ceasefire and the court is saying Israel has to abide by and then the judge laid out a whole series of stipulations which Anthony blinken himself entirely agrees with so I think it's going to be very very difficult for the Americans I think Biden will come under huge pressure um to make sure there is not a Vita and the other wider question I think is as so much of the other congrations in the Middle East for example the houthis are holding up the Israeli alleged genocide against Gaza um as their causus belly and I think that the Americans will also be aware that if it does veto this then the anger that's fueling this wider conflagration in the Middle East will become deeper and can I just very quickly say that the point I was making about Barack is that within Israel itself he's revered and the fact that he has basically thrown his vot behind punishing Netanyahu makes it very very difficult I think politically it's a real problem for Netanyahu I wasn't sugesting for a moment I know very well what Palestinians think of him and I entirely agree I I want to pick up on on where we started this discussion which was how Monumental this this ruling really is Nim the global South for a long time has felt very marginalized when it comes to international law institutions and the way that that cases particularly in Africa for instance have been treated so let me ask you does the ruling that we've seen this week does it does it change things for South afria afca does it does it restore some Faith perhaps in international law institutions for not only South Africa and for Palestine but but also the broader Global South well first I'm I'm surprised to with the suggestion that the uh interal court of justice ruling Accords with American foreign policy I think the international court of justice ruling is in fact puts to shame all Western uh countries including the US who basically were treating uh the powerful states and their allies like Israel as above the international order and all their claims as uh of uh rules-based order since the beginning of the sth October at least have been exposed as hypocritical as selective as basically non-existent when the victims are not white Europeans or North American so this leads me also to your question which is uh Palestine in this casee and this uh uh situation of genocide in Gaza is a lmos test for international law it shows how international law fails to protect uh what is basically considered as Expendable populations compare how the international Court Criminal Court compare how the whole Western World treated ukrainians and Ukrainian civilians and victims of Russian aggression indeed heard a lot about double standards yeah with how Palestinians have been treated so South Africa making this claim is challenging the international legal system to stand by test for the international legal system indeed I'm afraid we'll leave the discussion there for now it's a it's obviously a conversation we'll be having again and we'll be following this case very closely as it continues on its way through the courts for now though thank you to all of our guests n salani Jeffrey Robertson and Chris Gunners and
