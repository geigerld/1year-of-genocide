let's take you to beay where hamdan from Hamas is giving a press conference ladies and gentlemen may peace be upon you all I would like to start by blessing The Souls of our people's children women and men in Gaza St and our Murs at the West Bank in Jerusalem and in the diaspora camps I'd like to Bless The Souls of the martyrs of our people who are offering whatever they can to support their brothers and sisters in Palestine and I pray to Allah the almighty to accept our Martyrs and heal the injured and we express our salute a proud salute to our people who are standing fast on their land in Gaza makers of the true victory in the near future Allah willing in G in Northern Gaza and Southern Gaza across all cities Villages and camps inal Al canun Gaza City and Rafa City to these areas people have moved thinking that there that it would be safe zones including the child who have been displaced forcibly from their home in their alal to the socalled safe zones and they were killed with her parents um I will start with this footage video in which this child has said her last words and her last breath cursing the oppressors and complaining about no we must liberate our beloved Jerusalem and return to our land we want to see good things oh Allah almighty despite this pain I will start by reassuring the people of our nation our pal inan people that their resistance is in good shape they still lead and manage the chapters of ala ala flood battle in its 62nd day defending their people defending their land defending their Jerusalem killing the soldiers of the enemy injuring the soldiers of the enemy with total blindness or partial blindness destructing the Zionist war machine from close distance rendering their machines and uh Vehicles out of service or destroying them un Burning It To The Ground while the Nazi killer soldiers and mercenaries who burn in such Vehicles who come from everywhere to participate in this crime in Gaza while we document the destruction of hundreds of Zionist army vehicles from the beginning of this aggression and killing dozens of of Israeli soldiers and commanders and officers either by snipers or by explosives and the enemy admitted the death of almost 100 of their of their soldiers however these declared numbers are not even close to the true numbers which we document every day admitting to 2,000 injured is much less than the actual number our Fighters across all lines of contact and engagement they engage with the Enemy from under the ground from between the rebels destroying tanks vehicles and Troop carriers killing soldiers and officers and confidently documenting this by video despite all this they continue to bombard and Target the cities and the settlements especially Tel that was Target by a salvo of rockets even after 60 days of War to make the picture even much more clearer to explain and to show what alasan brigades are doing in this battle yesterday Thursday our Fighters were successful in destroying 22 um Israeli vehicles and before that 24 Vehicles were destroyed and 18 soldiers were killed directly however in the Gaza City only Gaza City our fighters in 72 hours have destroyed 79 vehicles in partial or in full I leave you with these footages and after that we will [Music] comment these are only in Gaza City only jump up jump up jump up jump Brigade might release in the coming hour s a statement detailing the numbers of destructed destroyed vehicles of the enemy however now I would like to comment here about this video in which our Fighters very confidently fighting and engaging With the Enemy moving between the rubble and and they sto themselves colleagues they warn their colleagues not to launch the rocket um because it's just a bulldozer and we document and we document the burning of the troop carriers with confidently and this is for the sake of husin farad those who don't know Hussein farad he's the fighter far the son of Omid who was renowned 2002 she was bidding goodbye to her son Muhammad in his Mur operation in Gaza Strip and this and the sequence and the subsequent operations ended the settlements in Gaza this wisam is on the path of his mother omal farat these great sacrifices and they victories on the ground and in the field by our factions especially Alan brigades are just a Prelude to the Future Victory our resistance is ready to continue engagement and to stand against the oppression and the aggression no matter how long such an aggression would last with more than 2 months into this genocide launched by the Israeli and Zionist occupation against Gaza using everything in the American Arsenal not the Israel rather the American using all approaches starvation violating human rights receiving all sorts of support by the US exploiting the inaction of the International Community which in this war leaving more than 60,000 of our people killed injured and um and under the rubble majority of whom are women and children and here we would like to emphasize the following Netanyahu the criminal and his Nazi government having been able to accomplish any of their political military or um objectives our people despite the killing and the oppression they are still standing fast and our resistant resistance Still Standing fast in the field engaging With the Enemy across all points the occupation has EX side all sorts of killing and systematic Annihilation and genocide against our people in Gaza exercising and showing methods that have never been witnessed throughout human history these pictures are pictures from the Nazi concentration camps the Holocaust and these are similar pictures but but those who claim to have been killed on the picture in the top are the killers in the second picture at the bottom these are people being mistreated by the enemy who try to Blackmail the entire world with similar pictures we reiterate our our rejection to all the attempts to displace our people from Gaza and we would like to emphasize and confirm that our people will not Retreat will not surrender to any displacement plots but we would rather foil them and we will not accept any solution or any resolution that doesn't include stopping the aggression and admit and accepts our people's rights to freedom and self-determination all theic americ and Western support will never enable our enemy to achieve a claimed Victory and our people don't have surrender in our dictionary our People's Choice is a continued and comprehensive resistance to this occupation and this is a legitimate right enshrined by the international um legitimacy no one can deny us such rice and eny and the enemy claiming that they have surrounded um y's house which was surrounded and destroyed and stri earlier in aial Wars is just a marage and this is just ACC Claim by the enemy in an attempt to declare achieving one of their objectives against our people and against our resistance the Zionist regime creates delusional objectives building a delusional Victory including the aggression against alifa hospital as they claimed that the command post of the resistance is beneath the hospital and it was their lives were revealed and today and today they are claiming the about the house of Al we say to the families of the Zionist captives you're the continued the continued aggression of aggression of your government against our people will not bring back your children to you and the chances of them going back is diminishing with the long aggression and I would like to leave you and remind you with this picture that alasan Brigade has broadcast I deliberately removed subtitles in this footage to allow the families to hear what he said this is the Israeli captive whose family were killed by Netanyahu bombardments he's begging to bring back their dead bodies the enemy's Army we tell them no victory for you and you can't stay on our land in Gaza nor in Palestine your faith in this battle is either you killed or run away or surrender as for the humanitarian need and the need for continued flow of humanitarian Aid the massacres that have been perpetrated and the bombardments over the past two months have affected everything in Gaza and all there is no there is no safe place in Gaza as claimed by Gaza and as promoted by the American administrative one point 1.3 million are displaced now in Gaza living a true tragedy in the open in some shelters and in some hospitals and schools and their condition s are exacerbating on daily basis as they lack the base minimum of dignified life and and it takes days to deliver the air to them and with the spread of diseases as declared by the wh and international organizations working in the STP Gaza municipality have announced today that people in Northern Gaza are suffering from thirst and drought this reveals that the that the actual objective of Netanyahu blinkin and Biden is to eliminate the Palestinian people those who haven't been killed by bombardments and Strikes should die by femine and thirst or die due to lack of medication and health treatment what enters Gaza now doesn't exceed 100 trucks while gaza's needs are more than 600 trucks and some of the such assistance doesn't meet the basic requirements particularly food items I would like to remind that Northern parts of Gaza receive only small portion of such Aid because the occupation is preventing it from arriving there with a targeting of hospitals this occupation deliberately attacked the medical sector the operating hospitals in Gaza are four hospitals after 55 hospitals are rendered out of service due to daily bombardments or due to depleted Fuel and I would like to emphasize that Northern Gaza has no operating Hospital our great people in Gaza are sacrificing are offering sacrifices and they can't find food to sustain them as more than for more than one month people of Gaza are fasting they don't have any food their will and determination never broken despite the destruction and the killing they are holding fast because their equation is connected with Allah the almighty who will support these people of the exacerbation of these tragic situations in Gaza we call upon the leaders and heads of states of the Arab and Muslim states to translate their resolutions in the summit um and the Arab and Islamic Summit in Riyad since one month into practical actions our people are awaiting the break of Siege against Gaza and expedite the access of Aid and medical supplies we also call upon all Aid and humanitarian organizations from around the world to visit Gaza STP to stand on the humanitarian Disaster by the genocidal War perpetrated by the occupation with the support of the American Administration and such organizations need to shoulder their responsibilities to Aid and support our people we call upon the Ona and the w uh to shoulder their humanitarian and ethical responsibilities to deliver Aid and humanitarian Aid and medical supplies to Gaza Strip north and south and never heed to the pressure of the occupation and we say that the hon organization is not undertaking its role as required unfortunately the Palestinian the Palestinian red Cresent is falling short in performing its duties and the Ona and the Palestinian red crescent are failing to distribute the eight our people equally causing um imbalance and distribution of Aid these two organizations are required to perform their duties no matter what happens they are the responsible for the distribution of Aid and they shall bear the account be accountable for any short despite the pain I reassure the Palestinian people their resistance is still in good shape the words there of Assam hamdan senior Hamas member two months on from the start of the war in Gaza he showed some videos of Hamas operations against Israeli forces what
