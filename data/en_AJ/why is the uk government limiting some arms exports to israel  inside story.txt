the UK government says it will stop some of its arms exports to Israel fearing the use of certain weapons could break international law Israel's prime minister calls the move shameful and says it will help Hamas but what are the implications of this decision this is Inside Story hello and welcome to the program I'm FIB batibo the UK says it's suspending 30 licenses out of 350 for arms exports to Israel its foreign secretary David Lamy made the announcement in Parliament but his colleague the defense minister has been on the airwaves playing down the impact of the decision while Israel has responded in Anger with Benin Netanyahu calling it shameful some UK politicians however say the move is not enough and want a full ban on arms exports to Israel so why has the UK a staunch Ally of Israel taken this decision now is it linked to International legal action against the war on Gaza and what's the wider International implication we'll put that to our guests in just a moment but first this report from sahat on the same day that Israel was bearing the bodies of six captives held in Gaza and Palestinians were being killed in Israel's Relentless bombing of the Gaza Strip and Israeli military raids were being carried out in the occupied West Bank the British foreign secretary announced the UK's immediate suspension of around 30 licenses to export arms to Israel dat it is with regret that I inform the house today the assessment I have received leaves me unable to conclude anything other than that for certain UK arms exports to Israel there does exist a clear risk that they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law but critics say it's not enough since this affects only 30 out of 350 UK licenses that Supply Israel with everything from components for military aircraft and drones plus parts that facilitate ground targeting from 2022 to June last year the UK sent nearly $75 million worth of weapons to Israel the UK insists this latest measure is not a blanket ban and only affects weapons that could be used in serious breach of international humanitarian law Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has condemned the decision calling it shameful adding with or without British arms Israel will win this war and secure our common future in the UK the nation's Chief Rabbi says the move beggar belief and will only encourage our shared enemies the British government has faced months of widespread protests against the war in Gaza with tens of thousands calling for an end to British arms exports to Israel just last week the eu's top Diplomat Joseph Burell initiated procedures to ask member states to consider sanctioning some Israeli ministers Israel is facing accusations of carrying out a genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip more than 40,000 people have been killed since October 7 and despite International efforts and large protests in Israel a ceasefire deal is yet to materialize s Al jazer while a number of countries have changed their arms Supply arrangements with Israel since the War Began in February a Dutch Court banned the export of F35 fighter jets parts to Israel citing concerns about rights violations in Gaza but another Court ruling in May allowed exports to other countries like the US which could then send them to Israel in Denmark campaign groups have taken legal action against the government to stop armed exports to Israel Italy which has been one of the largest exporters of arms to Israel has stopped new sales but still continues to honor previous contracts in March Canada's parliament voted to freeze armed sales to Israel but it doesn't apply to permits worth millions of dollars already approved all those supplied through the US and a Japanese firm cut ties with an Israeli arms manufacturer after an order from the icj in January let's bring in our guests for today's show in London is Jeremy Corbin an independent UK Member of Parliament and the former labor party leader is a longtime advocate for the Palestinian cause in Tunis Franchesca albanesi the United Nations special RoR on the occupied Palestinian territories and in dundi in the UK Sam Perlo Freeman a research coordinator at the campaign against arms trade a uk- based organization working to end the international arms trade a warm welcome to all of you thank you so much for for being with us today on Al jazer uh Franchesca albanesi in Tunis let me start with you how do you view this decision by the British government to suspend some licenses will it have an actual impact on the ground will it make a difference for the Palestinian people uh I cannot tell you whether it's going to make an impact while not all uh arms transfers to Israel have been suspended the UK as you have St in the opening is just one of those who are of the member states who are providing weapons to Israel and not all licenses have been suspended but let me say because we need to put this in context um it seems to me that states have still to register the sismic sheet represented by um International Development that hurt the deer there has just been an international court of justice advisory opinion that declares Israel's presence in the entire occupied Palestinian territory unlawful to be dismantled um and um reparations have to be made to the Palestinians these are serious implications for member states who have under the law of State responsibility an obligation not to uh Aid and assist the legality of the occupation and at the same time by January 26 this year there has been a set of provisional measures ordered by the international court of justice which has recognized the plausibility that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza and these provisional measures uh oblige member states not to uh Aid and assist uh in the commission of genocide this is the context in which all arms exports including the transfer of crude oil that can be used to refuel jets for example have to be suspended yeah thank you for giving us the context there it was uh very important what do you think then Franchesca is the purpose of this step by the UK government my assessment is that there is a recognition an increasing recognition that Israel is committing a serious uh of international crimes and there is a huge pressure in the UK and in other countries for the the the UK the government in the UK not to be complicit in this but there is also the recognition that under the um the the the the order given by the international court of justice there might be complicity in Acts of genocide so there is a moment of Awakening but again this is the beginning and it's still not enough right I I will ask you about the implications of this in a little while Franchesca let me bring Jeremy Corbin into the conversation Mr Corbin uh David Lamy the foreign secretary has said that the UK has a legal duty to review arms exports but do you think this decision to suspend some of these licenses is purely legal or are they also political uh reasons behind this well he's required to assess the arms export regime anyway the previous government did the same and he has to do that the arms export licensing legislation requires every British government to do that but at the end of the day it's a political decision how much notice you take of the legal advice you received and uh David Lamy yesterday announced he was going to suspend 30 arms licenses out of 350 but then went on to say that this wouldn't damage Israel's ability to defend itself and today the defense secretary John Healey has gone a bit further to essentially say it doesn't make very much difference and so you then ask yourself the question is this a political decision in order to try and look as though they're listening to international law um or is it something that they're very serious about I am honestly not certain what the answer to that is yesterday I asked for clarification from David Lamy on the question of the use of British bases in Cyprus there um bases are in Cyprus held by the Royal Air Force these are sovereign bases so it doesn't require the permission of the suiet government they are being used for flights over Gaza and by taking planes directly into Israel and I asked if this is going to stop or not quite clearly the last thing I'd say is on this section that the use of British weapons in the face of both the icj view on genocide acts of genocide and the ICC decision to arrest issue arrest warrants for some Israeli leaders actually leaves Britain very vulnerable because parts of the F-35 jets are made in Britain Britain still supplies a lot of other weapons to Israel so I don't think the legal case against Britain is actually finished yet there may well be legal action taken against Britain who after all often Prides itself as being the country that always upholds international law so I remain skeptical that this decision will take us very much further and I remain deeply angry that we are complicit in the killing of now over 40,000 people in Gaza right and the arrest warrants uh have haven't been issued yet uh Sam let me get your your thoughts about what we heard from both Franchesca and Jeremy Corbin and your thoughts also think this is a purely legal decision or are are there political uh aspects at play also here I think the government was under a lot of both political and legal pressure there was outrage in the country about the UK being complicit in genocide there is a legal case coming up in October where the government's being taken to court over its refusal to suspend export licenses so I I think in in some ways they must have felt that it was inevitable that they couldn't avoid making some move but there is a huge glaring exemption a loophole in this in that they have Exempted components for the F35 aircraft the UK produces 15% of every F35 so long as those components go via a third country usually the us so you can't now export F35 Parts directly to Israel they said there's a clear risk they might be used to commit serious violations of IHL right but they can go to Israel if they go via the US exact so why do you think the F35 components RIS why do you think the F35 components weren't included in the suspension is it also in the interest of relations in the interest of relations with the US and the larger arms industry the industry absolutely um Al although Israel only gets a small proportion of all the f-35s made overall the F-35 program is worth billions to UK industry BAE Systems alone uh UK operations made over a billion pounds in revenue from the F35 program last year according to their annual report so that's for all countries not just Israel and so yes um the UK government is making excuses about this in the global supply chain they could simply remove Israel from the list of authorized destinations they could tell the us we supplies these parts for the F-35 but international law and British Law requires that we do not allow them to go to Israel but they do not want to jeopardize their relationship with the US their place in F35 program and so they are coming up with this convoluted excuse essentially making up rules as they go along to exempt the F35 and this was yesterday on the very day we had for the first time definite confirmation that an F35 was used to attack almasi so-called safe Zone in Gaza with 3 2,000 pound bombs killing 90 people an F35 15% of which is made in the UK the UK is Choosing by this they're admitting that Israel is not following international law but they are choosing to remain complicit with Israeli war crimes for the sake of the arms industry and relations with the us all right Franchesca let me ask you about the The Wider legal implications of this decision does this decision to to suspend some of these licenses does it Shield or steer the UK away in any way from the legal concerns of complicity in the genocide in Gaza again as I said absolutely no it doesn't Shield because it's not enough to um to comply to the fullest with the both The icj Advisory opinion which is based on uh not derogable law and uh with the icj provisional measures concerning the genocide case so these decisions um are legal pronouncement they require every member states to reevaluate their engagement with with Israel and aold international law because not doing that risk further normalizing the occupation and further eroding the multilateral systems International law-based order so there is a full gamut of actions that need to be taken in order and each government including the UK should do a due diligence and reassess all economic military strategic diplomatic and pol forms of partnership that it has with the with Israel let me just ask you Fran to clarify what does the UK risk today both uh domestically and internationally by continuing with this status quo so first of all let me say that complicity meaning having supported Israel's um 57 year old unlawful Endeavor it's something that predates the current moment but now under the circumstances and in light with what is happening in Gaza the genocide that has already been committed in Gaza and there are serious risks that there is a spillover onto the West Bank there is a risk that the UK government makes itself complicit with acts of genocide okay Jeremy Corin your thoughts and why do you think there is this ingrained official reluctance in the UK to to think about suspending arm to Israel despite the pressure from from both uh the public and uh political parties on on both sides of the aisle there is a very deep security relationship between Britain and Israel hence the overflying and intelligence that's collected from Gaza by the Royal Air Force there is an enormous pressure of the supporters of Israel both in the UK Parliament and in the media and there is a um very strong opposition mounted against Palestinian opinion and people in Britain so I think there's a combination of factors there uh but it's also a very strong Lobby from the Armament industry the Armament industry is very powerful and very big in Britain they have huge numbers of government contracts and international contracts BAE Systems is an enormous uh manufacturer in Britain and they are very reluctant to see any restriction on armed supplies anywhere in the world for all all those reasons and so what David Lamy tried to do yesterday was demonstrate that somehow or other he is um cognizant of the issues of Human Rights abuses in uh Gaza well who isn't because it's been happening for a long time and he thought that by making this statement he would some or other theate the very strong opposition to his strategy in the labor party party and amongst others in Parliament including my own group and um that he would come out of it as uh somebody who was getting on better with the pro Palestinian opinion in Britain he hasn't actually achieved either what he's done is upset a whole lot of people who are very pro-israel who believe that somehow or other he's actually seriously restricting arm supplies to Israel but he hasn't pleased any of us who want to see a suspension of arm supplies their response to that Jeremy Corin is that you know if they're upsetting both Israel and the US and and you know their allies with this decision as well as upsetting those in the UK who want a full ban on arms exports then they say they they they're doing something right well I believe they're doing something right when I see an end to the bombardment of Gaza an end to the killing of innocent civilians and children in Gaza there is nothing right about what Israel is doing at the present time they are are committing acts of genocide and we should be acting accordingly in accordance with international law from the icj and of course when the ICC arrest warrants are finally issued we should act and arrest those people that warrants have been issued against yeah Franchesca interestingly the British foreign secretary has said there isn't enough reliable evidence to make a definitive conclusion that um Israel has violated International humanitarian law what do you make of this and what more evidence do you think they they need to to prove that British weapons are being used against Palestinians not just in Gaza but also in the occupied West Bank as we've seen recently well first of all I disagree with him because there is enough evidence but doesn't matter it doesn't matter because in order to uh not to violate the genocide convention which contains an obligation to prevent genocide members States need to comply with um the obligation not to uh support a state that might be committing genocide and again member states have been put on notice that there is this risk as of the 26th of January this year so with all due respect um whatever the assessment of the foreign secretary the obligations imposed by the genocide convention are are crystal clear and even if genocide had not been committed yet because there is a risk there is an obligation to prevent hence supp all relations especially U military strategic relations have to be suspended okay I'll I'll ask you uh in a bit about these reports that uh the UK might be dropping uh its objection to the ICC arrest warrant uh uh for Israeli leaders when there is one and what do you think the significance of that will be just wanted to to bring back Sam into the conversation and ask you some a little bit more about uh the type of security cooperation that exists right now between the UK and Israel are there more arms that are being supplied at the moment to Israel uh than than what the export license is approved what's the extent of cooperation and is the British government being uh fully transparent about it uh they are not fully transparent the financial figures we sometimes hear quoted only apply to one type of single individual export license but most of UK arms exports to Israel go through open licenses and especially the open license for the F35 companies that are registered for that they don't need individual licenses to export anything to any of the countries involved in the F35 and we don't have precise figures the government doesn't monitor deliveries but we estimate that the value of UK components in F35 so far supplied to Israel there's 39 of them is about bartk 360 million pounds uh since since 2016 and that does not even include spare parts that's just the initial manufacturer of the UK's 15% share and there's also a lot of other uh UK equipment that goes to Israel indirectly so licenses which are for export to the US of components which are then um put assembled into larger equipment fighter aircraft or whatever that are sold to Israel and we don't even know if any of those licenses those indirect licenses are being suspended or if it's just the direct exports to Israel which is really only a action of the total and what about those countries that have suspended uh their arm sales to Israel like Spain for example what impact has that had some unfortunately not very much as the countries that have suspended arm sales are largely the ones that weren't uh supplying very much uh in any case and in cases like the Netherlands again uh unfortunately the courts have allowed them this loophole no direct exports but the indirect exports uh via the us or other countries that's okay for the F35 it seems that um everyone treats This Global supply chain for the F-35 as absolutely sacred and coming before uh international law and the genocide Convention as Franchesca has talked about ought to be the absolute priority through any country okay M Mr Corbin what what next here then I know you formed a group of independ MPS uh to campaign against armed sales uh against Israel among other things what impact do you think your group can make you you're surrounded by a labor party that's very much pro Israel the Tories who are very much pro Israel as well what difference what impact do you think you can make with this group well we're very clear the five of us that we are wanting to end the armed sales to Israel and we want to see peace for the Palestinian people and that means an end to the genocide and the bombardment we're not a majority in Parliament obviously we're nowhere near that however there are large numbers of Labor MPS who are very concerned about all this feeling an enormous amount of pressure from their constituents in many parts of the country the labor vote went down in the recent general election very significantly largely because of issues surrounding Gaza the demonstrations have increased in size not decreased in size the popular support for the Palestinian people is bigger than I've ever known in my lifetime so we will be upping our game upping our campaigning and going out more and more making the case and the armed sales to Israel to save lives and I think there's actually a significant number of people in Israel that have beginning to realize from the demonstrations yesterday that their government has got to do something in order to end the occupation and then the continual bombardment of Gaza franches albanesi I'll give you the last word do you see uh the tide changing now with this ratcheting up of public pressure as Jeremy mentioned there and also political pressure uh do do you see you know a change in international uh legal uh expectations soon o over this issue yeah I do see the change I do see the change of Tide because not only there is a a global movement in solidarity with the Palestinian people and with the Israelis who want the end of the genocide now and the end of the apartheid in the long term but it's going to be a very a very long journey because the system both in Israel and through its support particularly from Member state is tightening and so there is a lot more effort including from Civil Society than needs to go into supporting and making this uh uh change of Tide even more um meaningful effective and and visible thank you very much to all three of you for for a great uh conversation Franchesca albanesi Jeremy
