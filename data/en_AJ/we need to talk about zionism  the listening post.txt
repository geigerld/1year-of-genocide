hello I'm Richard gizbert and you're watching a special edition of the listening post when trying to explain conflicts historians and journalists examined the ideologies that helped create them but in the media coverage of Israel and Palestine one ideology deserves far more attention than it's been getting Zionism was the brainchild of Jewish intellectuals in 19th century Europe it was a response to the tidal wave of anti-Semitism sweeping the continent at that time their solution a Jewish state but on land already inhabited by Palestinians it was a reflection of Europe's Colonial thinking however after Decades of dispossession war and apartheid critics of Zionism call it indefensible if not racist in Western media those critiques are seldom heard instead we get the opposite a debate about whether opposition to that ideology anti-zionism is anti-Semitic later on in this program we will hear from a Jewish American Community leader about her transition from a True Believer in Zionism to a committed opponent of it but first the listening posts Daniel Turi on Zionism the discourse that surrounds it and what it tells us about the world's longest running occupation across the the Western World from parliaments to TV studios opinion makers have been pushing an alarming message let's call it out for what it is anti-zionism is anti-Semitism they say that a political critique of Israel anti-zionism is in fact a form of anti-Semitism but what almost never gets is Zionism itself I me there is no argument anymore that anti-zionism is anti-Semitism that is as plain as Day news audiences seem puzzled a poll last year found that most Americans either don't know what Zionism is or don't know what to think of it Zionism is the idea of Jewish nationalism and its ultimate goal was a Jewish state in Palestine this goal was achieved in 1948 with the establishment of the state of Israel Zionism is now the official ideology of the state of Israel Zionism is Central to understanding what's happening in Palestine and Israel at this moment Zionism is the motive force of the confiscation of land in Palestine and it is at the very core of the ethnic cleansing and genocide we are witnessing today like most ideologies Zionism emerged as a response to a problem in the late 19th century anti-Semitism in Europe had reached historic levels thousands of Jews were killed in a succession of pograms with many more driven from their homes among the Jewish intellectuals proposing Solutions was Theodore Herzel a journalist in Austria Hungary Herzel called for the creation of a Jewish State out side of Europe soon choosing Palestine as the promised land he knew this would entail the displacement of Palestinians but as Herzel himself noted Zionism was a colonial idea the colonial mindset was absolutely crucial to Zionist ideology all the founding fathers of Zionism were Europeans and Theodore Herzel thought of the Jewish state in Palestine as an extension of Europe he spoke about the Jewish State as Manning the ramparts of Western Civilization against Eastern barbarism at this point colonialism is not a bad word the United States and Europe are really subjugating non-european um peoples throughout the global South and it's at this moment that Zionism is really born this is one of the tragedies of Zionism and that Zionism was really a response to racial understandings of the hierarchies of humanity at the same time that Zionism sought an escape from those hierarchies unfortunately it would recreate them in Palestine the Jews saw themselves as running away from a Europe that was not working for them and making in Palestine something that could be of their own but this worked out for the Palestinian peasantry as being something like displacement the Zionist then thought well yeah but you have this immense Arab world so if you have to move a few miles is that so bad I mean this is the way they thought they were operating in a world of complicated Justice before World War II most Jews did not support the Zionist cause many opposed it and in Palestine Jewish settlers were a minority some advocated peaceful coexistence with the Palestinians but most Zionist leaders favored a more militant approach among them Z of jabotinsky the father of a new kind of Zionism on the right in 1925 jabotinsky wrote Zionism is is a colonizing adventure and therefore it stands or falls on the question of armed forces Zionist militias were established and soon played a decisive role in the wake of the Nazi Holocaust Jewish refugees arrived in Palestine and the United Nations approved the creation of Jewish and Arab states latest pictures from war Tor Palestine provide these impressions of Hagar forces consolidating areas under their control during the fighting that followed militias carried out the nut the catastrophe expelling roughly 750,000 Palestinians from their homes to make way for Israel we Palestinians have been talking about our condition as an ongoing NECA as an ongoing catastrophe my parents were both children in 1948 and both their families became refugees um they lost everything and so that is the Crux of the Palestinian condition that Zionism is premised on the very Erasure of Palestinian political rights what it has meant on the ground since 1948 until this moment has been dispossession separation condition of Relentless Exile the guiding principle of the state of Israel has been about building as large as possible Jewish state in Palestine with as few Arabs inside its borders is possible in 1948 Israel perpetrated the nakba 3/4 of a million Palestinians became refugees in 1967 after The Six Day War Israel traveled its territory and there was a quarter of a million refugees from the West Bank who were not allowed to return so this is the logic of settler colonialism ethnic cleansing in my opinion Zion ism is a racist ideology because it privileges one ethnic group over the other I don't think of Zionism as racism I think of Zionism as being a movement which is very internally focused it was trying to create something novel and because in order to create something novel it had to self-segregate other people outside of the rubric the precincts of Zionism may have felt excluded and may interpret that as racism Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu sees himself as the heir of the right-wing Zionism championed by z jabotinski a century ago netanyahu's father was jabotinsky secretary but the strands of Zionism that drive Netanyahu and the religious hardliners in his Coalition are even more extreme his government has ramped up the building of illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank the devastation of Gaza in response to hamas's attacks on October the 7th has put Israel on trial for genocide at the world's highest court and they plan to take it even further in the war Israel's aim was to render Gaza uninhabitable and the level of Devastation is unprecedented there is an Israeli Ministries plan for depopulating the whole of Gaza there was a meeting in Jerusalem for the resettlement of Gaza 12 ministers attended this meeting [Applause] and this is the climax of something that was inherent in Zionism from the beginning over in the US Israel's biggest Ally support for Zionism spans the political Spectrum starting in the White House 35 years ago I said you don't have to be a Jew to be a iist and I'm a Zionist there don't have to be a je to be a Zionist but with opposition to Zionism growing including among American Jews pro-israel Lobby groups have set out to delegitimize anti-zionism in politics and the media but anti-zionism I've long said is anti-Semitism I was wrong anti-zionism is genocide in December the US House of Representatives gave that narrative its official seal of approval passing a resolution that explicitly equates anti-zionism with anti-Semitism it's a conflation that continues to echo through the halls of power and newsrooms of Western capitals confusing audiences and stifling dissent against Israel's war so hatred of Jews had to find a new vehicle and in the main that became anti-zionism if what you mean by anti-zionism is that Israel never should have been invented in the first place I think that's historically lazy and I think it's a mistake I think Israel should have been created I think the Zionist movement should have happened but do I think you're being anti-semitic I don't really see the connection anti-Semitism is the hatred of Jews because they are Jews anti-zionism is not about Jews it's about Israel and its policies and this is a very dangerous Trend because the criticisms of Israel's behavior in Gaza are perfectly legitimate in relation to Zionism the media is its first moral and ethical and professional responsibility is to not alide Zionism with Judaism the elision of anti-Semitism with opposition to Zionism is cynical and it is harmful for the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip who are experiencing the warp speed fast death that the Israeli State armed by us Arsenal is wreaking on them that illusion has been the armor through which Israel can continue to conduct this Geno side the conflation of anti-zionism with anti-Semitism is provoking push back from a growing number of young Jewish Americans anti-zionist Jews have formed a major part of the anti-war protests that have taken place across the US and they are not taking kindly to being accused of racism towards their own Community given the importance of us support for Israel it is a movement that could prove pivotal Simone Zimmerman is one of the leaders of that movement the co-founder of if not now an advocacy group that aims to sway American Jews against the occupation she also campaigns against anti-Semitism and its weaponization by the pro-israel lobby but she wasn't always on that side of the argument Simone Zimmerman was raised a committed Zionist her transition away from that way of thinking forms the core of an award-winning documentary called israelism that was released last year I wanted to know answers from within my own community and nobody could answer those questions for me how is it that I am like the best the Jewish Community has to offer I've been through all the trainings all the programs and I don't know what the occupation is I I don't know what the settlements are Simone Zimmerman joins us now from New York City Simone thank you for speaking with us here today at the listening in that documentary israelism a Core theme was your personal turn away from Zionism to start with talk about your former self the pro-israel activist what did you believe at the time and how did you come to disbelieve it well I grew up with a narrative about Israel that was incredibly romantic and frankly simplistic um I grew up with a idea of my commitment to Israel as Inseparable from my Judaism I grew up grew up spending a lot of time in Israel and I planned to go be an Israel Advocate on my college campus we often said that that was the other Battlefield you know the college campus is the battlefield for Israel's legitimacy and so I wanted to go help tell the truth about Israel uh now that that all got quite complicated for me when I began actually meeting students on my campus who had different life experiences related to Israel in different ways I began reading texts by both Palestinian and Israeli historian who complicated the story of 1948 I learned about the Nea the mass displacement of Palestinians in 1948 that led to the founding of the state and very quickly um that narrative was was complicated and and shattered for me and you're not the only one because there's there's been a broader shift amongst young Jewish Americans towards opposition to or at least ambivalence about sist and we've heard those pro-israel lobbyists say you know we've lost the kids do you think they'll ever get those kids back for many Jews Zionism has meant a movement that led to the safety that offered an Escape Route and safety for our grandparents generation that's true in my own family story now it's also true that Zionism has always meant Mass displacement and oppression and Injustice for the Palestinian people for young americ American Jews they're asking these questions in the same prism that they're asking other questions about you know racial Injustice in America that what young people are seeing on our phones right now these live stream Horrors 24 24 people were killed here 22 of them are women and children the bombings the starvation the utter Horrors being committed against children and and we're seeing it on our phone live streamed To Us by young people who you know look like us who have the same aspirations as we do and we want the same rights and Justice and freedom for these people and and the the the basic ability to live freely and safely that we have and I think seeing that alongside seeing these videos of Israeli soldiers celebrating uh their war crimes and laughing and desecrating the homes that Palestinians have fled in this moment in which they are responsible for the largest displacement of Palestinians since the nakba that is prompting a really dramatic Reckoning among not just a younger generation but I think young people are experiencing in a particular way because we see it in such such unfiltered means a lot of Israel's supporters in the US uh we've seen it they've done it in the media they've taken to labeling anti-zionism as pure anti-Semitism what do you make of that argument that conflation is there a cross over there how do you see it look anti-Semitism can show up anywhere along the political Spectrum just like racism and sexism I think the real question is you know what are the animating values of a movement and a misrepresentation that we keep seeing consistently is the tarnishing of the movement for Palestinian freedom see something on Tik Tock and they're like Israel bad and Hamas good and they go out and they start shouting at Jews it's a movement whose core motives and goals are to stop this Mass killing in Gaza to protect Palestinian life to demand Justice and freedom for the Palestinian people and we see time and again the the misrepresentation of that movement with these false charges of anti-Semitism in ways that first of all are such an unfair and Grave attack on this movement and in addition they create deep confusion about what anti-Semitism is and it actually makes it harder to identify anti-Semitism and be able to root it out you also do important work combating anti-Semitism and anti-jewish hate has been on the rise since October 7th is the media discussion around that topic anti-Semitism doing anything to help people understand what it really is and to fight it yeah well I think that's why it's so important to actually talk about this conflation of Jews and Israel and to do our best to separate the two you know the so-called leading uh organization that is often the the leading uh Source cited in media around this is the Anti-Defamation League but the ADL actually has a a long history history of being opposed to Justice movements most significantly um the movement for Palestinian freedom and in the latest statistics that they've released and and this is not a new phenomenon post October 7th but they've certainly escalated in this campaign they include in their um list of anti-Semitic incidents protests led by Jewish organizations and Jewish individuals so how can we get a true picture of the state of anti-Semitism in this country when the leading organization responsible for telling us about it does not have reliable data I think that's deeply dangerous um for Jewish people and I also think it's important to say that you know we are seeing increased numbers of Jews in the movement for a ceasefire for Palestinian freedom and I believe that those thousands of Jews who are out in the streets not just in the US but around the world are helping fight anti anti-Semitism because we are breaking that conflation between Jews and Israel's devastating assault on the Gaza Strip there's documented evidence that whenever there is escalated violence in Israel Palestine Jews around the world who have nothing to do with that violence often are on unfairly on the receiving end of that blowback from individuals who Target Jews out of their rage at Israel last one for you as a result of the activism the exposure you got from that do dou umentary you've become something of a leader within the Jewish Community how hopeful are you that this movement that you're part of American Jews against Israel's occupation that something meaningful can be achieved in the coming years are we at an inflection point you know whenever I get asked this question about hope it feels important to say first of all that it's it's hard to answer that question in a moment in which Israel has reduced the majority of the Gaza Strip to Rebel in which we are living through the the largest attack on Palestinian life and displacement and destruction since the NBA of 1948 I feel deeply afraid for Palestinians right now and for also for Israeli Jews who are deeply endangered living this ongoing situation in addition to that in this moment of such profound darkness and tragedy it is incredibly powerful to see so many young people waking up asking questions young and old people joining these movements for justice and freedom for all people if I just think about college campuses you know I got to participate in Shabbat and Passover at the Gaza solidarity encampment at Columbia University and it was really moving to me to see all of these young Jews there in the encampment grappling with the histories that they've been taught having hard conversations with their friends with their community members that to me is hopeful these movements for justice and for accountability are hopeful because without that the the the red lines that we are seeing moved farther and farther away from any semblance of democracy and respect for human life um that is very scary and so seeing students rising up and demanding that is a path to an alternative Simone Zimmerman thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us thank you the Turning tide of Young Americans like Simone Zimmerman away from support for Israel and Zionist ideology could prove to be one of the major developments in the history of Israel's occupation of Palestine but it is only the latest act in this Century long story one that cannot be understood without at least a basic understanding of Zionism news outlets have a big part to play in that we need to talk about Zionism explain how it relates to Israel's past its present and its ongoing ethnic cleansing of Gaza its war crimes against Palestinians we'll see you next time here at the listening post
