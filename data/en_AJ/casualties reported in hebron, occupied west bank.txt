moving on now to what's happening in the occupied West Bank Israeli forces have carried out major raids across the West Bank killing at least three Palestinians dozens of military vehicles were confronted by Palestinian fighters in Janine all five hospitals in Janine were surrounded 203 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank since October the 7th Z BVI joins us live from romala um in the West Bank saying tell us about these raids and why hospitals were being surrounded well certainly Janine was the major flash point in overnight raids in the last 12 to 24 hours but just before we get into that some information we have coming into us just in the last hour of another shooting incident at a checkpoint the second in as many days north of Hebron the details are still coming into us but what we understand is that there was a shooting incident at a checkpoint north of Hebron a vehicle Crossing two Palestinians have been reportedly killed in that incident they were shot inside their vehicles we have so far just the account from the Israeli uh side of things from the Israeli military suggesting that this was an attempted shooting attack and that these two men were killed we'll get more details on that as soon as they come into us here in ramala but again the second such incident in as many days in terms of what happened in Janine Janine has become a major flasho in and around the city in and around the refugee camp there since this War began the the raids have been consistently targeting Janine 10:30 p.m. local night a large Force went into the area around the camp with bulldozers armored vehicles a large number of Israeli soldiers they uh were met with Palestinians who retaliated throwing rocks but also using explosives on those positions we've seen an observable rise in the amount of explosives and small arms being used by resistance forces on the Palestinian side to these raids uh a drone strike carried out by the Israelis killed at least three people one of them said to be a leader of the Janine Battalion of the military wing of Islamic Jihad 14 Palestinians were injured many of them remain in critical condition and we saw the Israeli forces um reportedly pursue the injured uh stopping ambulances going into the hospital reportedly in an attempt to try to uh arrest and detain the people injured in those altercations with Israeli soldiers we saw paramedics being called out with their hands raised questioned and interrogated doctors were also told to come out of the hospital and and uh surrender themselves they refused saying that they were taking care of their patients now Janine is a major flash point we've seen at least 203 people killed since the O in the occupied West Bank since the war on Gaza began 25% of those deaths happened in Janine and that is because this area is a major area of operations for Palestinian fighting groups the military wings of different political factions are concentrated there and the Israelis are very keen to make sure that the occupied West Bank these areas don't become another major flash point they're tackling Hezbollah on the border with Lebanon they've got the war on Gaza they don't want Janine they don't want the occupied West Bank to become a major area of operations continuously putting pressure on communities here which people here say is counterintuitive that Palestinian positions are hardening and the push back is growing but in any case that figure 25% of the deaths happening in and around Janine really tells you how seriously Israeli forces are taking what they see as the threat emanating from there Zay basravi reporting in rala I also note you were telling us about Janine but earlier you were telling us about this incident that breaking news on a shooting incident near hibron so you'll give us more information on that I know as soon as you get it zaye thank you very much
