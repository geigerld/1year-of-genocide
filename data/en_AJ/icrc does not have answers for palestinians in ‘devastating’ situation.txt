well let's get the very latest from the ground we can join hany Mahmud in K yunas inside the G Street but hany so 33 days in the bombardment continues tell us more yes well as the Israeli military along with foot soldiers and armored vehicle are furthering their presence uh in the uh in the heart all right all right all right so that was uh two cars are rushing to the hospital bringing uh two uh uh K two two people who were killed in in a previous air strikes I was going to come to that those seem to be pulled uh uh from underneath the rubble within the past hour the an air strike targeted the Eastern side of the of kanun a z area destroying a residential home killing uh four people right at the spot one of them was a little girl a child and what seems to be now is more people from underneath the rubble are being pulled out and brought to the hospital in those plastic uh bags uh but in within also the past hour uh another air strike targeting a residential home in aat a refugee camp this refugee camp is densely populated is in the central part of the Gaza Strip an area that was designated as safe for gazans and people in the northern part to evacuate to uh seven people reported killed right at the spot there are more people uh under the rubbles T injuries as well the number is likely to increase as there are people under D these these homes were full of people full of uh people who already own these homes but as well as evacuees who moved from Gaza take taking refuge in these homes find themselves uh under uh unpredictable uh bombs falling on them this is the the latest uh with with air strikes but the Israeli military is furthering its presence now and operating in the heart of Gaza with tens of Tanks push pushing deep into uh the Gaza City uh moving from the three main axes all the way to squeeze Gaza City the Israeli milit says that they are they have been able to locate some of bunkers and tunnels that Hamas leadership and Hamas elements are using to operate uh but there's no comments or a statement from Hamas about this so far very real the sense of chaos and urgency there in in carun hany and the awful reality of the bombardment what about the situation with supplies supplies into the country absolutely essential they've been at the bare minimum what's the latest well the latest is uh we we read a report about the number of humanitarian Convoy carrying medical supplies and and Food Supplies and other essential items com to Gaza in one month are are the equivalent of what Gaza daily needs of those supplies we're talking about it close to 500 trucks but this is what Gaza needs on daily basis 500 trucks is what Gaza needs every single day to sustain uh itself uh if we want to talk about Gaza and the northern part uh the situations are very complicated very very dire situations indeed people don't have access to food as the vast majority of bakeries uh came to a complete shutdown there was an announce about a complete sensation of these bakeries where people don't have access uh to bread right now uh L alone the Water Supplies as well most of the water in Gaza and the northern part and given the intensity of air strike is very contaminated and not suitable for human uh human consumption medical supplies are an issue as well as Hospital uh suffer to sustain their operations uh F fuel remain uh the major problem as the lack of a fuel forc many of these hospitals to shut down completely and as of now they are just a standing uh skeleton uh facility not offering any medical services whatsoever to injuries and patients let alone evacuees as well yeah desperate situation hany we'll leave it there for now that's hany mmud in carun in the South Let's cross to occupied East Jerusalem now Sarah hrat is there and Sarah we're talking there with about supplies with Hy and just how colossal the need is and yet we hear of an aid Convoy being directly targeted yeah and that Aid Convoy uh belonged to the international Committee of the Red Cross they had five um uh cars and two other vehicles that were heading to Al cod's Hospital uh on Tuesday when it came under Fire I spoke to the spokesperson uh Alana sinenko who spoke a bit more about the details of what happened there on the way to the hospital it was hit so we don't have we don't know exactly what happened the two trucks two trucks were damaged and our driver was wounded so they red diverted and went to shiper hospital instead and of course for us uh we were shocked to see this happening and uh just want to use this opportunity to remind and strongly stress that humanitarian convoys medical convoys facilities and Personnel enjoy special protection under the international humanitarian law uh Sor what do we hearing about the Israeli military entering Gaza City any clarity about what's happening they haven't confirmed how far deep they are into uh Gaza City they have said that they've been moving in deeper overnight however eyewitnesses have told Al jazer that they've seen themselves soldiers and armored vehicles not far from alifa hospital we're talking roughly 700 meters now we do know that the Israeli military and government for the last week um has been saying that Al shifa hospital is where hamas's what they called Command Center is underneath that they at the time had released a video a 3D model uh to prove that this was the case um of course in terms of those that are working there our own journalists that have been uh outside of Al shaa uh and Hamas itself they've denied that this is uh the case um despite that you have a 100,000 uh Palestinians still stuck in the north trying to make their way uh to the South the military says that it's reopened that three-hour window that we've seen in the last few days to allow people to move we did see a video from yesterday showing some of them w a white flag um but they've spoken to us and they've even spoken uh to uh the icrc talking about how difficult it has been for them with zero access to humanitarian Aid especially in the north they she the person I spoke to the spokeswoman said um that they'd even been asking them they were glad to see someone that could potentially help them once they got to the other side some of them uh just taking the clothes on their back and talking about number of dead bodies that they'd come across that were just rotting in the streets the weather here is incredibly hot even so more so in Gaza and concerns for the checkpoints that are there uh and of course the tanks Palestinians are very scared there and they're not trusting uh the Israelis when they say that there is a safe passage all right we'll leave it there for now thanks very much sah har there in occupied East Jerusalem
