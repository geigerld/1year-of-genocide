joining us now on the phone from dead albala in Gaza is amjad shawa the director of the Palestinian ngo's Network I'm J thank you so much for joining us we began our coverage with the very heartbreaking story of an 8-year-old girl and her brother two children from the same family who died of malnutrition if you could paint a picture for us um Jud how many families are going through similarly heartbreaking situations thank you this is the family that you could reach but there's other thousands of families that they have a chance to tell their stories about the femine about the situation that the hard situation that they're living in due to the Israel aggression and the same time the blockade that continue uh for the eight months and just to remind everyone that from day one of this war Israel declared that they will deny the entrance of the basic needs food medicine water and electricity to the Gaza F and during this eight months although there was so many positions from the international actors from the from the US from the Western countries from the UN calling Israel to left the blockage but there is also from the International from the EC and the ICC but there was clear position from Israel on the ground to prevent the entrance of the different items mainly the food items which getting Gaza with limited the quantities every day we have from in the good days we have about 200 trucks this is during the war this is during the biggest humanitarian catastrophe this is an unprecedented situation not only in Gaza it's all over the world who could imagine to deny the entrance of the basic needs and food for children and medicine and other different items which doesn't need as the fuel for example that which is needed to to for the generators in the hospitals and for the water facilities it's a serious concern of the lives of the children we have 50 children that recorded and the minist of Health died because of male nutrition and the same time that we we have strong indicators of the femin in Gaza trip and we called the UN in order in order to declare Gaza as a femine status that uh that we have also 3,500 children according to the records are suffering from severe malnutrition and there is a lot of so many children died on silence and they were puted in the graves with no goods and I'm we we've heard from the World Health Organization and I'll just read a comment from them despite reports of increased delivery of food there is no evidence that those who need it most are receiving sufficient quantity and quality of food that's what you're seeing on the ground isn't it yes what we see in the ground there is no enough quantities of food entering Gaza uh and just to tell you that before this war there was we to have 600 700 truck SLS entering Gaza now in such catastrophe we have the maximum we have 200 trucks in the good days so it's and nowadays that all Gaza population depend on the humanitarian Aid entered through the crossings so this these uh quantities are not enough to feed the children and so many amilies are spending all the day with less than one meal and most of them children also drinking water just to tell you that each person here the maximum consumption it's 2 liter a day in such hot weather humidity and most of the population are living intense and very serious deteriorated condition and pollute pollution is there due to the the untreated water which is the tunnels between the tent itself so we have concerns about yes food water medicine and if there have we have mtion cases it's very difficult to get them to the hospital which is full of injured people who are also in the corridors of the hospital and the medical teams are very busy on the uh on dealing with the the injured who are coming in each hour to the hospitals and ICU units are occupied by the injured who are in severe cases and I'm with such difficult circumstances for so many people in Gaza in particular for children are you already seeing on the ground the irreversible physiological effects of long-term malnutrition on the Youth of Gaza for example things like stunting yes I'm uh during our visit to the shelters and our program our activities on psychosocial support to the children we have our NGS who are working there to to have to offer such services and we could witness uh the children the orphans the children who are traumatized and uh who are bad need for psychosocial support but we're coming the next day and during the you know 1 hour after we leave the shelter we have uh you know an air strike or something happened we come back to witness the same uh implications same trauma to the children who cannot uh spend the night without nightmares without also it's scare feeling due to the uh discontinuous Rockets uh and air strikes towards the neighborwoods we are now overpopulated areas and it's open areas now so children uh scared from situation and uh mainly the children who lost one one member of the family the father or uh brother or sister and this is happened everywhere we talk about big number of people were killed or injured and now in each shelter you can find children without arms without legs because because of the these a spikes which is happened all over G Street this is end which is overpopulated as happened in ra before now we have about 1.2 million Palestinians who uh most of them displaced to the middle area and we had the massacre in inat area and most of the people who were injured and killed were children so stories are moved from one to another thank you so much amjad shawa the joining us from dead albala in Gaza the director of the Palestinian ngo's Network thank you so much sir for your time make sure to subscribe to our channel to
