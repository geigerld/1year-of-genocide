my name is Gabe I'm a senior at UNCC Chapel Hill and right now I'm on my way to the people's graduation an alternative graduation ceremony for me and other seniors who have been suspended from the University for protesting the genocide in Gaza and cannot attend our real graduation I'm here at the peace and Justice Plaza in Chapel Hill I'm really happy to have been able to have this graduation do this ceremony with uh my comrades you know the the people I really trust the people I was arrested next to um we've been suspended by the university we've been barred from taking our exams from graduating barred from campus and so this was our way of celebrating our own accomplishments of celebrating our own graduation as far as I'm concerned I graduated when I was arrested by this University for protesting genocide solidarity means we must keep doing what we're doing here today this University is trying to silence Us by barring us from our own graduation by barrowing us from campus but we're not going to have it we have built our own community we built our own institutions we built our own graduation we're not going to let them silence Us in fact the more they try the louder we're going to be I'm lucky enough to have the support of my parents in this they came down to see me but my mother is worried sick about my safety about my diploma she went back to work to put me through school and to see it threatened by the university for standing up against Injustice is uh is very hard on her make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
