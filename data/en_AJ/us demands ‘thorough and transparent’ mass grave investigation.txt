White House has described reports of mass graves in Gaza as deeply disturbing it comes after the European Union backed a un call for an independent investigation US National Security adviser Jake Sullivan says Washington wants answers those reports were deeply disturbing we have been in touch at multiple levels with the Israeli government we want answers we want to understand exactly what happened you've seen some public commentary from the IDF on that but we want to know the specifics of what the circumstances of this were and we want to see this thoroughly and transparently investigated so that the whole world can have a comprehensive answer and we the United States can as well I can't speak beyond that because of course we're in the early days of fully understanding what happened I'm going to go to our correspondent Mike Hannah who's in Washington DC for us so um Jake Sullivan say that saying that the US has been in contact with Israel about this it wants uh answers from Israel it also wants a transparent investigation what did has not said which other countries have said and the EU is that it should be an independent investigation that's correct yes uh what we've heard from the White House is what you heard there from the National Security Council advisor Jake Sullivan uh saying that this is disturbing they are awaiting further details on what happened he spe specifies too that they have asked Israel for an accounting of exactly what happened that statement was some 20 hours ago and as yet there's been no further statements either from the White House or from the state department so once again it would appear given the absence of any statement in the last 20 hours uh that nothing yet has been heard back from Israel we would assume uh that once the information is provided to the White House or to State Department then we will receive further details as to what Israel says happened and what the US ongoing response is going to be yeah Mike and Joe Biden another world leaders have just released a statement appealing for the release of capture captives captured by Hamas what more do we know about that yes this is 18 countries including the US which appear to be trying to step up pressure on Hamas in these ongoing attempts at negotiation uh these countries issuing a joint statement calling on Hamas to immediately release all captives uh being held in Gaza there's no mention whatsoever of any concomitant releasee of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israel by the Israeli government uh but this is stepping up pressure on Hamas it would appear as these negotiations grind forward uh the statement says as well that the release of the captives would allow for a greater influx of humanitarian Aid into Gaza uh this is require regarded as utterly essential but looming behind all of this is ongoing concern about an Israeli operation in Rafa in the South this would create massive issues within Gaza and would certainly derail any possibility of ongoing negotiation Mike thanks very much indeed Mike Hannah talking to us from Washington DC make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
