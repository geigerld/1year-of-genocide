we begin in Gaza where Israel's continuous bombing of the besieged strip has killed nearly 400 Palestinians in 48 hours the Israeli Army is targeting areas from the north to the south at least six people have been killed in new strikes in Rafa in southern Gaza they include a 5-month-old baby the injured are being treated in an overcrowded Hospital the southern city of Han yunes is also being targeted in aerial and land attacks as the Israeli Army expands operations in the city it says it's conducting face to-face battles after doubling troop numbers in the area the Israeli offensive is also cutting off access to food and water across the strip the UN is warning of a devastating famine if the war continues more than half a million people in Gaza that's a quarter of the population don't have enough food hanim Mahmud is joining us live now from Rafa in southern Gaza uh hany more air strikes more deaths can you bring us up to l Date with what the latest is there yes har well within the past hour or so more air strikes in the northern part particularly on jabalia we're talking about jabalia town and jabalia Refugee count simultaneously targeting more residential blocks and more residential homes that their initial reports are from aljur area that's in jabalia town where 10 people reported killed with multiple other were critically injured and the the other attack that took place in jabali Refuge Camp again we're talking about more residential homes being destroyed and uh there are reports about many people killed they still waiting on the confirmed number of people who have been killed and just due to disabled communication we just find it very difficult to uh uh to get uh uh the the the up the the updates that we we we need uh but this is part of of ongoing systematic aial bombardment of the area just overnight the same area jabalia town was targeted a residential home was completely destroyed uh and 16 people we just go a confirmed report of alour family 16 people from alour family were killed in that air strike there is a fear of more people is still under the rebels Monir alush the director of hospitals at the Ministry of Health was a critically injured his family member his daughter was was killed and uh the 15 mother from his sister's side uh of the family were also killed as people were able to pull them from under the rubbles within the past hour so so far we're talking about more death more destruction and more evacuation orders in the central part of the Gaza trip Al B refugee camp in the central part and all the surrounding neighborhoods from the anat refugee camp were ordered to evacuate to the Eastern to uh the southern part of Dar balah leaving the Eastern side of Al magazi Al as well as the Eastern side of der balah for what it seems to be part of the already declared Israeli plan of creating uh a buffer zone by uh displacing more people from those areas uh that are at the Eastern side of Wadi Gaza along with similar to what happened in in in eastern Gaza City and the City of B hanon more of this Destruction for the purpose of creating a buffer zone at the Eastern side uh of of the Gaza Strip and honey throughout the war so far you've been hearing from people about the the very desperate conditions that the displaced are living in uh and now the world food programming is warning of a devastating famine in the offing just how worried are people as as winter starts to take a grip on the situation MH yes very worried and and very also concerned about the coming days if if if we see more of these bombardment continues uh to take place in the gos there are a lot uh more people than we ever seen in the past are becoming hungry and they are on a verge of of famine as a new uh reports by the world food bank and save the children in fact picked up that report and added to this there are more children and families now they are on a verge of famine as the analysis of the data collected show that there one in every four households are only are are going hungry and and in fact there is starvation signs started to be visible across uh the Gaza Strip as the Israeli uh government actions and policies along with the constant bombings of the Gaza Strip that has effectively destroyed all means of of life including sanitation and and causing the hospitals across the GP to be overwhelmed on on top of that the the the the crowded numbers of of people inside evacuation centers in against the the uh the little amount of humanitarian Aid that been allowed into Gaza Strip people are now not only displaced and traumatized but also hungry and thirsty giv the current uh situations okay honey in Rafa thank you very much for that Let's cross straight now to Sarah hyat who's joining us live from occupied East Jerusalem and Sarah can you fill us in a bit more on what the Israeli Army is saying about its activities in hunus it's saying it's intensified The Troop numbers there and is engaged in in heavy fighting what what more do we know about that yeah and a statement was released by the Israeli military detailing a bit more not just in Khan yunes but also other areas about how they've managed to find more weapons they keep finding it every few days they're saying and they found this in Khan Unice they've talked about destruction of tunnels they've talked about uh specifically uh attacks or attempted attacks by Hamas Fighters and they said they've managed to quash that before they were able to carry out those attacks they mentioned an engineering operative also launchers that they said were used against their forces about a week ago but newness as we have seen is densely populated even more so because all of those that were in the north were told to head towards the South they ended up mainly in Kanan yunas that was thought to be the safest place to go to well of course it no longer is and also what makes this war different to any of the other Wars is that this involves a lot more urban fighting Hamas Fighters know the terrain very well they know the networks underneath the tunnels and they know how to operate there and that clearly there is a lot of resistance because already today the Israeli military has confirmed that two of its soldiers have been killed three yesterday and that death toll keeps on Rising as well as the death of a number of captives and sorry you're there in occupied East Jerusalem with the alaxa compound behind you uh gearing up for Friday prayers presumably in an hour or so's time what kind of restrictions are being imposed at the moment yeah what you uh may be able to hear behind me is what's called theba that's the speech or the sermon that's held before the Friday prayer um Al aaos compound is just behind me it's called a compound cuz it has the mosque as well as that area that empty area which would normally be filled with worshippers on a Friday 60,000 to be precise is the average number every single Friday well the last few weeks since the October 7 attack and since the war started uh that number has dramatically decreased we're talking about 4 4,000 worshippers and on some weeks it was even less than that uh one of the reasons is is that the Israeli forces have been limiting who can attend the prayers uh they're not allowing people under a certain age uh some of those from specific addresses uh in occupied East Jerusalem are also prevented from entering and often in fact every Friday um not only have Palestinians been targeted but media as well including ourselves and uh other cameraman a Palestinian cameraman last Friday uh was uh hit and beaten by one of the soldiers with a heavy boots on um in the head and that gives you a sense of the clamping down that is existing in this occupied territory the Israeli forces are carrying out uh heavy surveillance heavy checks uh and preventing not just people from entering Al AOS compound but also from entering the old city but just also to give you a sense that akos compound isn't just about Friday prayers for Palestinians it's a hub it's where when you go you'll see mothers they take their children they meet they sit in that square that you see behind me it's a community as well and a lot of Palestinians in today it seems are saying that some of the uh mosques in the area and occupied East Jerusalem are closing and they're calling on people to head to al- aamos because potentially this might be the only way they can protest to the restrictions because it's clearly a lot more heavy-handed and really that's all the Palestinians here are talking about is the inability to be able to move around with ease and certainly feeling like they are under a watchful eye constantly and every single day all right Sarah har there in occupied Jerusalem thank you very much
