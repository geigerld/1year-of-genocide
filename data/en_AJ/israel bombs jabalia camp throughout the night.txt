let's bring in thk Abu aoom he is in canun in the southern part of the Gaza Strip we have seen pictures thic of those Israeli strikes bringing down multi-story residential buildings in jabalia what's the latest you're hearing about the situation there yes Elizabeth the attack on jabalia refugee camp had been renewed during the last couple of hours targeting multiple residential houses in one the same uh neighborhood in the north uh of the Gaza Strip as 11 Palestinians have been killed due to this air strike While others are still under the Ruffles waiting for the civil defense team to be evacuated from the uh from the location of the targeting as Israeli forces had intensified the rates and the domains of its attacks in the north of the Gaza Strip including jabalia refugee camp it's also uh important to mention that jabalia refugee camp has been multiply attacked by the Israeli occupation forces in multiple occasions as hundreds of civilians have been killed in this uh small refugee Camp which considered to be the most densely populated uh refugee camp inside the Gaza Strip it's it's also essential to know that people are still inside this refugee camp Sheltering in United Nations shelters and even in the vicinity of the the Indonesian hospital where they are running extremely low in food and water and they cannot really have any safe passage out of the uh north of their territory as Israel keeps pounding everyone is moving in inside the uh territory as also the attacks continue even in the southern areas of Gaza Strip which considered to be safe for evacuees yeah we have a situation where residential areas across Gaza are being bombed but people are not able to get the care they need after being injured in those bombings if they've survived those bombings at hospitals what is the situation in hospitals now tar we heard from the head of the Indonesian Hospital saying they can't take in any more patients they're already unable to care for those who are there that's true simply because the hospitals have been absolutely uh running out of service during due to the Israeli Relentless attacks and the massive shortage of medical supplies also the capacity of the beds inside the hospitals are completely reach slits as they are no longer able to have more patients and injured people it's also worth mentioning that these hospitals were witnessing massive and even clear deterioration in the medical conditions as they were running low in terms of a fuel uh since the early beginning of this war as the ongoing blackout of electricity started after the attack of Hamas movement on the 7th of uh uh generally October what is also essential to know about the hospitals is that patients are on the ground taking uh taking even uh receiving medical treatment by doctors who are trying to provide manual primitive ways of medical care for those patients and the ongoing lack of medical supplies and needs and there are also patients the don't have even enough food and water to survive so despite even the difficulty and the the severe uh wounds that they had they also face hunger as the as there is no any humanitarian Aid had been delivered to the hospitals in the Northern areas of Gaza State the situation is similar even in a shifa hospital where Israel is taking full control preventing anyone moving in the yards of the hospitals and even did not afford any safe passage for medical workers even patients and displaced people inside this medical complex yeah just an incredibly dire situation isn't it Tark that is Tark Abu aoom live for us in carun in the south of the Gaza Strip thank you
