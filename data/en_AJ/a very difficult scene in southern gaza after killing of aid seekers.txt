well there's Global condemnation after Israeli soldiers shot and killed Palestinians scrambling for desperately needed food in Gaza City Foreign ministers Aid groups and rights organizations have all denounced the attack at least 112 people were killed and around 700 injured many of them in critical condition these are some of the scenes uh as F filmed as Palestinians gathered the bodies of the Dead the UN which has repeatedly failed to secure a ceasefire is calling for an independent investigation in Gaza City an Israeli air strike targeted a gathering of Palestinians in the neighborhood of Al zun at least five Palestinians were killed there and in the South the Israeli military has attacked a school housing displaced Palestinians in hunus at least three people killed there more than 30,000 Palestinians have now been killed in Israel's war on Gaza Mahmud joins us now on the phone from Rafa in southern Gaza honey uh good to have you with us I hope you can hear me uh a day now on from those tragic events in the early hours of Thursday morning north of where you are in Gaza City uh and I'm wondering what you're hearing about the people amongst the hundreds injured who presumably are still struggling to access medical care uh even 24 hours after this event happened yes well this is the the time where uh we can safely say that you don't have to look for tragedy in in Goda tragedies will find you and the reason I'm I'm starting with this is because there are so many family members who managed to play the northern part and G they are here but they had remaining family members in the northern part and among them were those who gathered at the nauli roundabout to get uh aid from the trucks coming in and they they just heard about uh their relatives family members who stayed there among the one who were killed so it's just a very difficult thing right now they've been trying to get hold of of their family members and and relatives within the past few we to make sure they're still alive they're not going to be affected by the the spread of famine and today happened they they heard about them being killed very difficult situations right now tragic indeed and those who have been shot and and critically injured are in the hospital right right now at at the at risk of losing their lives we're talking about an entire health facility asika uh complex and the other hospitals in the northern par completely an not operational don't have the medical supplies necessarily needed for immediate and proper medical intervention there is insufficient medical staff right now we heard from one person inside the hospital and nurse who describe that the injuries that reported to the hospital are either shot in the back or the abdominal area or the neck just poses a threat to their life and they they don't have the ability to intervene and to save them they are left on the floor of the hospital for hours waiting for someone to take care of them and unfortunately just the insufficient medical staff and almost no medical supplies made make it very difficult to intervene close to 112 people so far being killed the number is likely to increase and already there are reports emerging from Gaza that we're getting close to 130 because of those who are on the floor of the hospital either in a coma right now or they have they have to be rush into the life saving tools that are non operational right now as well because the entire hospital is not working just very very difficult situations right now for people have been uh displaced internally more than one time time and largely been struggling with famine and extreme shortage of school just this morning about six0 children died of dehydration and starvation and this because of the ongoing intense bombing campaign and also the the restrictions on the ground to deliver a well uh you touch on it there it is worth remembering and worth reminding our viewers isn't it that at the root of those events on Thursday was a lack of the most basic of basic needs food and as you say water in the Gaza stripped people hungry so hungry that they were willing to clamber over trucks at risk of their uh lives to get their hands on whatever they could and of course 24 hours later no sign that these events have changed the AIDS situation in any way whatsoever people just as hungry just as thirsty as they were yes indeed and it's only worsening by the hour and in fact when you when when we talk to people and the kind of responses that we get it is not difficult to secure humanitarian trucks into the uh the northern part and Gaza and even here in the southern part if only the Israeli military has the will to do so but the fact that we're see uh the ongoing intense bombing campaign the zero safety guarantee for Aid workers on the ground the supply chain mechanism that is largely broken and the ongoing restrictions on the ground it just gives the feeling that it's all done it's all done on a purpose in what looks like for a lot of people it's a lionizing food it's a way of using starvation against largely trti population and according to uh one R Group just put it very unequivocally that it all seas in one narrative not only people are getting killed because of the bombs but now starvation it all feeds into one narrative which is eventually exposion by making life very unbearable on the ground for those who decided to stay in Gaza and the northern park well for that update as of hanim Mahmud in Rafa many thanks to you
