in with some breaking news out of Gaza there have been more Israeli airstrikes this time killing two Palestinians in a car it comes just hours after funerals were held for three senior Islamic Jihad commanders who were killed in overnight Israeli attacks ten others were also killed including children let's go live to Gaza we're going to speak to yumna al-side what more do we know about these latest airstrikes yes Rob so the latest airstrike was carried just about half an hour ago even less in on a car that had two people the car was directly targeted with a drone missile uh where it was completely burned and uh this brings the death toll to 15 people including the assassination of the three Islamic Jihad commanders and 20 others who are who have been heavily and critically injured according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza more airstrikes meanwhile have been taking place in artillery shells have been taking place in high news that's in the southern part of the strip in the same part of in the same part where the last direct assassination of that car or targeting of that car took place tell us a little bit about the three leaders of Islamic jihads that were killed in the earlier strikes yes so the three leaders are senior commanders in Islamic Jihad uh these also it's very uh note uh to to say that worth noting to say that these leaders were supposed to be uh traveling uh as uh with another delegation from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad to Cairo this morning to uh to participate in security meeting the three leaders where uh commanders High Senior commanders in Islamic Jihad uh they're they're a specific uh information and names are Khalil al-bahtani who is a member of the military Council of alcott's Brigade that's the military wing of Islamic Jihad and also uh he is one of the leaders of the military action of the brigades in the West Bank uh zidin was also one of those prisoners who was freed in the Shalit deal and he was brought here to Gaza where he is originally from nablis while the third one is Jihad al-qanim he is the secretary of the military Council in alcott's brigades it's also worth noting that Khalil al-bhatani was assigned after the assassination of the previous leader in August 2022 in the Israeli attack on Islamic Jihad commanders as well here in the Gaza Strip and see I'm outside talking to us from Gaza all of that is Raising tensions at the Gaza Israel border and William Marx is in Ashkelon in Israel for us um Islamic Jihad has been promising our response to what has been happening people there waiting to see what that reaction is going to be William yeah that's right and of course Israeli authorities since the early hours of this morning have been telling residents in this region here we're about four miles from the northern part of Gaza here to make sure they stay close to Rocket shelters and indeed some local authorities here have said that over the course of the last few hours they've been encouraging residents to leave dozens of families have already made the journey further north and east from here further away from the potential rocket fire that Israeli authorities clearly are expecting we've heard from jov Gallant the defense minister speaking to local politicians and leaders here over the course of today warning that there could be Conflict for several days he's concerned he said that there could be a prolonged campaign with an extended range of fire that would mean of course Rockets traveling much further into Israel than even where we're standing here Israeli media also quoting one senior Israeli official is saying that everything depends now on how Hamas will act its engagement or lack of Engagement in firing Rockets as a response will determine the level of escalation and Tall winners and very important to note here the special representative for the United Nations here when it comes to the Middle East peace process asking for quote maximum restraint and really hoping they said for an avoidance of that further escalation well then thanks very much indeed desert and Marx talking to us from Ashkelon in Israel on the border with Gaza where Muhammad jams in West Jerusalem for us what is Israel saying about all of this Muhammad so Rob let me first bring you up to date on what we've just heard from the Israeli Army concerning that latest air strike that just happened in the last 15 minutes or so there was a statement from the Israeli Army in which they said a short while ago an IDF aircraft struck a terrorist Squad carrying anti-tank guided missiles in the city of Khan Eunice in the southern Gaza Strip details to follow so not a lot right now but we are expecting to hear more in the hours to come and one of the reasons we're expecting to hear more is because you've had a situational assessment that prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been in attendance at for the last seven or eight hours now you have a meeting going on that includes the Prime Minister as well as his security and defense cabinet and we are expecting also that there will be a press conference given jointly by the Israeli Prime Minister as well as the Israeli defense minister joov gallant and that that should happen around 8 PM local time we expect that in that presser we will be hearing the the Prime Minister congratulating the Army on carrying out this Mission but also we expect that he will most likely be addressing Hamas directly because right now there's a lot of concern about if this will lead to wider escal relation obviously as you heard Willem speak about just a few moments ago right now there's concern that there will be rocket launches towards Southern Israel there are preparations being made one of the questions being asked is how much of an escalation might there be and the Israeli government is contending with the question of is this going to be an escalation that's only going to be seen by Islamic Jihad which would mean that perhaps the government here would only contend with perhaps hundreds of missiles being launched from Gaza or will it include Hamas and if that were to be the case that's a much wider escalation that could mean that there would be thousands of rockets being launched from Gaza toward Israel in the hours or days to come so it's a very tenuous situation here right now we're waiting to hear directly from the Prime Minister from the defense minister and then we'll get more details about what precisely Israel is expecting and what my transpire in the days to come that's Muhammad in West Jerusalem thank you very much indeed we're going to bring in Osan Hamden he's senior spokesman for Hamas is joining us on the from Beirut on the phone good to have you with us on Al Jazeera if there is a response to this from Gaza or indeed anywhere else what role would Hamas play in that well it's clear that eternity I was taking the situation to a great escalation he started the attack on gazelle assassinating senior members in uh Jihad everyone knows that Netanyahu is facing a serious internal troubles with the opposition and he's using the model of Hitler and the Nazism he wants to create problems with the Palestinians in order to overcome his internal problems so initially we believe that the one who will be responsible for what may happen is government our response as Palestinians is as usual we have to defend our people we have to defend ourselves we have to protect the civilians when under the Israeli strikes last night and today everyone knows that there were women children among the people who were killed by the the Israeli strikes yesterday so the position of Hamas that we are part of our people and you are in charge and responsible to protect our people and our community and the Israelis have to understand they they have to look for the consequences for what may they do against the Palestinians especially against the undercuts for those of us outside who are perhaps not clear about the power Dynamic that exists within Gaza between Hamas and Islamic Jihad is it likely that if there is to be a response given that there were three Islamic Jihad leaders killed in these airstrikes is Hamas likely to leave the response to Islamic Jihad or will Hamas have a role to play in that response or do what the main idea that the Palestinians were not watching their people being killed their women and children being killed the Palestinians will not accept I mean the presidents in Gaza if they are Hamas or Islamic as Jihad will not accept what the thing now is doing and they will say Let It Go will happen how it will be arranged it will be done among the Palestinians themselves and I think it's good to wait and see what will happen at all the ACT there have been increasing calls in the last few hours for restraint and the Israelis themselves have said that whether or not this situation escalates is dependent entirely on how Islamic Jihad and perhaps Hamas respond to this How likely is it that Hamas will listen to those calls for restraint one uh it's an island exact day attack they kill they destroyed and then they will say well we will wait for the response and the consequences will depend on what will happen next they have to understand their actions will be received by a reaction what they will do has its own consequences and the one who is supposed to take the responsibility for that is the Israeli government and they will take the responsibility and I believe they have to understand this lesson the time of being attacked without any response available now there will be a reaction for their attack and everyone will knows shown that the Palestinian resistance will not keep watching just by counting the rockets and Counting the bombs of the Israelis falling on the Palestinians women children and get the spirit Asana Hamden a senior spokesman for Hamas thank you very much indeed for being with us
