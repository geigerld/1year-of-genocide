well joining us now from Philadelphia is CLA finlin she is a professor of Law and of philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania Law School cla a late March trial date feels like quite the statement from the judge what did you make of how things unfolded in court today well it's really rather extraordinary because this was the case that we thought might come last uh Alvin Bragg the Manhattan da had indicated a willingness to allow other cases to come first most notably the January 6 case uh brought by special counsel um but that case has been delayed due to issues surrounding immunity and Donald Trump's hope that he will be declared immune now by the Supreme Court um and so this case is now zoomed ahead and I think the Judge has just fed up and has had enough with delaying tactics which clearly were involved here uh with uh Trump and his lawyers looking for any reason to delay the trials uh after of course complaining that he himself had been biased by uh pre-trial delays so it's really throw everything at the wall and see what will stick and I think this judge just decided uh time to move on and and call an end to these tactics CLA given that there were tactics involved how much of ESP spanner does this now throw in the works of Trump's campaign calendar well I think it's a very good idea to get this trial going because the later we get uh towards the actual election in November the harder it will be to proceed with these trials and and other trials will uh come in as well so by moving ahead with the end of March um and a starting jury selection on March 25th as uh has now been set on the docket uh it looks like this case will actually find a clear spot in the calendar relative to other cases uh the Georgia case uh may be delayed quite a long time there are deep complications there the January 6th case is indefinitely delayed and we have no idea what will happen with the uh classified documents case in Florida so uh which is also federal court um and also hangs by the way on the immunity question because it is a federal case um so it is a good idea to get this going and of course this was the first indictment so uh it makes sense it should be the first trial CLA I see Trump chose to appear in court today I understand he's previously said he was forced to appear when he wasn't is that all getting him political points uh I don't know it's very hard to tell because there are so many different claims he makes I doubt even his followers can keep up with all of them uh they sort of blend in together there was no of course that that is incorrect it's important to remind your viewers uh that he was not forced to appear he doesn't have to appear uh in any of these uh interlocutory appeals uh that are going on or any of these uh interlocutory claims that are being run down uh his lawyers can appear for him but the effort to try to claim that this is interfering with his rights as a candidate is just one of the many things that Donald Trump is claiming here uh in order to try to gain sympathy and also to try to claim delay uh and uh to ask for further delays because of his campaign schedule mhm CLA you mentioned some of the host of charges that that Trump faces when you consider the cases this one on on hush money sounds a little more trivial perhaps but I understand it's also the only one where he can't actually pardon himself if he does actually get back into the White House that's right so the two cases in which a self- pardon will not work are this case and the Georgia case because they are indictments based on violations of state law being considered by state courts and Presidents Federal presidents of course do not have the right to Pardon themselves under state law now they can make life very difficult uh for State prosecutors and I very much expect that if Donald Trump is elected in November then if this case is somehow still going on after January he would make it very very difficult for Alvin Bragg in all sorts of ways uh putting pressure on uh uh governor of New York Kathy huxel and so forth um but they actually don't have any real power here and so it's very important that the state prosecutions be allowed to go ahead and go ahead in a timely way because if he does become president again you can bet that he'll use the weight of his office to interfere any federal process uh that he possibly can well it certainly sounds like timing is indeed everything CLA finlin a professor of Law and philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania Law School great to have you back on aler and sharing your thoughts thanks CLA thanks for having me now the families of Israeli captives held by Hamas since October 7th are protesting as you can see outside Israel's defense Ministry compound in Tel Aviv right now let's go back to hamda salut she joins us again from occupied East Jerusalem hamda what else can you tell us about this protest obviously there's been a huge amount of of pressure on Netanyahu and his government this is an incredibly large demonstration happening in telev outside of the Kya known as the defense Ministry and it's actually where that meeting with the CIA director the isra Prime Minister and other members of the security apparatus are currently they're inside of that building and some of the family members of captives who have simply been saying that time has run out they released a statement tonight saying that they were going to restart intensified protests calling for re-elections calling for Netanyahu to step down simply because he has not prioritized releasing the captives you'll remember Before the War Began there were weekly demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of Israelis against the government's judicial reforms now that same group of demonstrators known as the Kaplan Force said they were coming back this Thursday starting up these demonstrations once again to make their voices heard in the thousands and what these families are trying to relay is that it was a mistake on behalf of the Prime Minister to not send that delegation back to Cairo for a second day of mediations and negotiations were more than four months into this war in entering the fifth month actually and they're saying that the Israeli government is not recognizing their plight and that their family members are not being prioritized the Israeli Prime Minister has said repeatedly that he has red lines when it comes to getting a deal to release the captives and that military pressure is the only way that can get done but these family members have been saying for months to give whatever concessions the other side wants even if it means ending the war if it means the captives can come back from Gaza but the Israeli government has refused that they've said they are going to do things their way and that they have other goals of the war they need to accomplish as well so the families of the captives are incredibly angry and this meeting that's going on inside the defense Ministry where the prime minister is this protest is happening right outside of it family members are incredibly angry tonight Nastasia they're certainly very angry HDA I've been wondering how United they are in terms of what they actually want to see the government do we've obviously seen protests also take place at some of the border crossings stopping Aid trucks are is there a kind of united front amongst captives families about a kind of government policy moving forward the issue of the captives is of the utmost importance and sensitive within the Israeli Society there are different forms of these protests that happen almost every single day some of them are a little more subdued than others the one we're seeing tonight is essentially the Resurgence of a larger protest movement within the Israeli Society but when it comes to the issue of the captives it is seemingly that everyone is on the same page though there are different levels and variations of what should be happening for example the protests and demonstrations that are going on at the border crossings are people who are more right-wing people who are from settlements wanting to block aid from going into Gaza to a population that is already starving and the people who are demonstrating in Tel Aviv are trying to get a message across to the government saying that there should be whatever is in their power that can be done in order to bring back the captive so while the overarching message between all protest movements is the same is that the captives should be brought back there are different levels of what these groups are thinking the ones protesting at the border say there should be no humanitarian Aid there should be no anything really until the captives are brought back and the families are saying just give the other side whatever it is they want if it means that we can have our loved ones back and these families have been saying that these demonstrations are going to be bigger they're going to be louder they're going to be perhaps even more than once a week they're going to block roads in order to send that message to the Israeli government that they are not happy with the current policy Hamas salut there with a latest for us from occupied East Jerusalem thank you so much h
