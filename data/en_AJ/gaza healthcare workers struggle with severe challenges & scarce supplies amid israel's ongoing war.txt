when I came into the Gaza Strip I was prevented everything except for one suitcase and I've been here for a month and so uh as much as I tried to stuff within that suitcase uh there's only so much you could put in one suitcase and and we have 10 patients here that would uh use all those all those medications probably in a day or two while the healthcare workers here save lives and do their best to keep people living they are thinking about their own family members at home and when they hear the explosion of the distance which we hear every hour or two while we're heing the buzzing above us of the drones those healthcare workers are constantly in Two Worlds one where they're here with their patient where they know they have a duty by by by the career that they've chosen uh and the second is to their own family and their own neighborhoods at home where they don't know when the next patient that rolls in will be their family member the medications we use for controlling uh severe bleeding uh especially in patient with liver disease in an environment where everybody is bleeding we we are out of these really vital medications um and and so what the what the community's had to do is work off of suitcases bought in by prior Medical Teams greater 3 months ago uh because currently all inflow of medical supplies has been stopped at the border we have several cases in the last 24 hours where they survived their surgery they survived the initial blast they survived the initial resuscitation uh but then subsequently passed from infection related to the lack of wound care supplies and and typical supplies we'd see in any Hospital in the world this is a uh a 20-year old woman who suffered significant traumatic Rin injury she may be able to be pulled off the ventilator she may breathe for herself whether or not she'll ever talk again or wake up again meaningfully or walk again is is truly an unknown thing for us she's a 5-year-old uh little girl who came in overnight the blast uh and this injury is not the end of her journey to recovery right she has the physical recovery ahead of her of recovering from low oxygen levels and lung injury and and and superficial Burns and these type of things uh but in the long term uh the thing that I I feel most concerned about for for the population as a whole and from a public Heth perspective is uh these kidss have seen and experienced things that kids are not supposed to experience make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaaz
