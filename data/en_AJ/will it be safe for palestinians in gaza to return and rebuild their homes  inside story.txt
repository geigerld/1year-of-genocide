A Wasteland of rubble the UN says clearing the debris from Israel's war on Gaza will be a huge challenge that could take 14 years an exploded ammunition will also make this a dangerous task so what will this mean for the millions of Palestinians who hope to return to their homes this is Inside Story hello and welcome to the program I'm fully batibo unprecedented levels of Destruction that's how the UN describes the state of Gaza since Israel's War began in October no buildings have been spared from the Israeli strikes homes schools mosques hospitals damaged or destroyed the un's mine Action Agency says that after more than 6 months of devastating War 37 million tons of debris now L to the strip clearing it will take more than a decade and will likely be slowed down by the unexploded bombs and ammunitions cared throughout Gaza for Palestinians living among the rubble in the densely populated territory that makes for an even more dangerous environment and once the war is over will it be safe for people to return and rebuild their homes we'll put that to our guest shortly but first this report from imagin Kimber in 6 months Israel's war on Gaza has killed more than 34,000 people and caused unprecedented destruction nearly 300,000 homes have been flattened Heritage sites are in Ruins all universities have been destroyed or damaged and hospitals and government buildings have been reduced to Rubble along with the devastation to people's lives there's enormous amounts of debris which includes unexploded Munitions and will require a huge amount of cleanup we estimate 30 37 million tons of of debris which is approximately 300 kilos of debris per square meter the UN says at least 10% of ammunition that is fired fails to function considering the sheer level of bombardment Israel has rained down on Gaza there may be thousands of unexploded bombs in the rubble making the work long and dangerous we're talking about 14 years of work with 100 trucks so that's based on that figure 14 years to remove uh with approximately 750,000 work days uh person work days to remove the debris the cost of removal will likely be in the tens of millions of dollars according to the mines Advisory Group clearing urban areas is harder than rural areas and some of the weapons used like aircraft drop bombs and precision guided missiles can be difficult to remove and during the cleanup Gaza will remain a danger zone nearly 2 million people are internally displaced in Gaza desperate to return to their homes we struggled a lot going from one place to another this is the third time we are relocating from RAF to kanun and now to Der balah there is no safety anywhere we are civilians and have not done anything wrong we are tired find us a solution but rebuilding homes and resuming daily life will likely be delayed by the many risks facing Palestinians Gaza has been here before but not on this scale and after every war sweeping for Munitions has been necessary but this time it may leave great SES of the small densely populated strip uninhabitable long after the war is over imagin Kimber Al jazer for Inside Story let's now bring in our guests for today's show in Geneva we have have Jonathan Guthrie director of operations at the Norwegian people's Aid in Aman Federico Desi mle East director at the NGO humanity and inclusion and in ramala in the occupied West Bank Raja khidi director general of the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute gentlemen a warm welcome to you all thank you for joining us on Inside Story Federico inam man let me start with you because you were in Gaza just last month in March prior to October 7th how many how many unexploded Munitions would you expect to find in Gaza and how much uh has a danger posed by these weapons increased since the start of the war on October 7th I think well before the before 7 the number of ammunition was relatively low I think the of course there have been several Wars and offensive in Gaza before before this one but they were on a smaller scale the the second largest one was in 14 and that caused the extensive destruction but still we estimated the number of unlo orance that will be present at the end of this current war will probably be between five and 10 times higher than what we could see in 2014 and then the after month yeah will it be possible you think to know the full extent of the contamination caused by the current conflict it's very difficult to have perfect estimates I mean we are working on a we have a working assumption that there there's been something between 50,000 100,000 bombs dropped on on Gaza and shells dropped on Gaza over the past six seven months and the number is growing by the day unfortunately until assess fire will be place and then between 9% and 14% those are the technical estimates of these bombs um didn't go off so potentially we're talking about several thousands potentially up to 10,000 or a bit more um of unexploded bombs and shells and M rounds in Gaza briefly F Federico before I bring in Jonathan you were in Gaza last month as I as I mentioned what what did you witness while you were there what was the situation because of course we describe it we see the pictures on television on a daily basis but how did you did you imagine that it would be as bad as we see it on our screens it's the worst situation I've seen in 18 years of humanitarian career um there are two kinds of areas in in Gaza there are areas that are flattened where like most buildings have been damaged or destroyed and there is an exploding orance under rubble and also lying in the streets and empty terrains and then you have those areas that have been targeted less intensively where most of the population is now uh regrouping you know Rafa and and the coast of Rafa in the middle area where there are hundreds of thousand people crammed into um tented settlements or camps on along the beach and then schools that have been turned into shelters and still you see many buildings flattened or damaged by her strikes because air strikes are happening everywhere even in those areas where the population has fled indeed the air strikes are happening even in areas which the Israelis had said were were safe for the people uh Jonathan let me bring you into the conversation uh you've worked extensively in Syria and Iraq and know you know that these weapons these uh unexploded uh ammunitions are a huge concern of course for civilian population but for a place like Gaza with one of the highest concentration of of uh civilians living in an area a densely populated area just how dangerous is it what what's the impact of these unexploded ammunitions on people who live in Gaza yeah thank you very much for having me today um yeah I think you you've hit the nail on the head when you were talking about Gaza because of the sheer density of the bombing and uh in such a small area uh that we have in Gaza we've seen you know up to 50,000 uh explosive ordinance especially large aircraft bombs being dropped and 90% of the Munitions that have been used in Gaza have been large aircraft bombs 1,000 or 2,000 lb uh aircraft bombs and uh and this can cause quite a significant threat to the to the local community um you know taking some of the lessons learned that we've seen from uh from from from the Iraq and and Syria conflicts is that you know we we really need to have a kind of a two-pronged approach to to the response there's a response that is required to support uh the rubble removal debris removal and reconstruction but there's also the response to supporting uh local civilians um and and we really need to be able to educate the local uh civilians and communities especially those out of camps um and provide them with the education and uh on on the risks that these Munitions pose because because they educate how do you educate uh Jonathan those civilians when they are experiencing War when they're in the middle of a war I mean we've seen people even during this conflict trying to return to their homes because you know they want to find food and so on are people being being warned currently as the war is ongoing on about the dangers they face yes they are actually MPA is uh is is quite heavily involved in this providing education both through the camps but also the the outof camp uh population um and and teaching them what explosive ordinance look like and how to respond when when we find them I think the situation that we have at the moment is there is no kind of coordinated response mechanism to uh to to respond when the local population does find these Munitions and that probably won't come into effect until until the end of the conflict okay I and I'll come back to you in a minute federo to ask you about what you think the response should be Raja khin ramala let me bring you into the conversation now we've seen buildings and civilian infrastructure completely destroyed in Gaza systems of water and sanitation housing schools hospitals and so on do you think Gaza will still be habitable when this war ends well from the first days of the war our own research was more or less all grouped under the understanding that this War's aim was to make Gaza uninhabitable uh and as an econom uh monitoring the economic and social impacts everything has just confirmed in different at different stages from the domicide that we've seen uh uh to what is it now 2third of the residential stock of the north I believe uh to the you know weaponizing of of food uh and starvation and epid epidem asde and scolastici side we cannot you know keep up really so that's the first point certainly we now have a much and I think that's I want to just you know picking up from your previous speakers you know I we started looking at 2014 as a comparator uh in assessing economic impact and assessing destruction but we've since concluded and started thinking in terms of 1945 is the comparator uh this is a total Destruction this is total devastation the World Bank report on the different sectors housing health education cultural heritage the billions that they have suffered uh and the billions in some cases or half you know half a million half a billion dollars Health uh facil facilities alone and that's like like 70% of Health Facilities so that sort of scale is UN unheard of and I just want to also say that this question of rubble and Dearing it's extremely important and and and thinking about these details is something that we need to start doing more of because you know in fact the the unexploded ordinance from the last Wars was a major part of hamas's Arsenal so I'm sure that the Israelis going to need to you know and this is the problem you know uh we don't want to get into a situation where we create mechanisms which prolong Israeli occupation so the fact that there's an international concern about Dearing and and and and quickly getting this ordinance out of the way so that the rubble clearance can begin that's in itself questions of months so time and scale of rubble removal is a huge huge subject yeah and so then uh Federico how how does the clearing even begin when the war is still going on when you look at the destruction of the heavy infrastructure there's been is it possible to know first of all the types of ammunitions that have been used and what is going what it's going to take to clear them what the response should look like yeah so in terms of typ of ammunition what our teams are seeing on the ground is a um air drop weapons very large mk84 so 900 kilo bombs um and then there are there's a mix of Tong shells mortar rounds and then some air to surface missiles um most of them of American production used by the isra Army um what what do we what will it take to uh to clear all these and make the Gaza Strip safe again for civilians first of all we need a ceasefire uh because that's the only way to operate safely and reach all the areas of the Gaza Strip especially those that have been more heavily bound and were people have fled and would like to go back as soon as possible uh second we need unimpeded access we need authorizations from the Israeli authorities and from any other concerned authority to bring inside equipment and to do the work uh not only of identifying the kind of weapons used and marking those weapons which is something that our teams as Humanity inclusion are already doing but hopefully in the future also be able to diffuse these items uh detonate them and remove them for good um working under the r will require specialized equipment armored um caterpillars or excavators so very specialized equipment and a big eff that cannot be carried out during an active War within a CE fire indeed and that ceasefire is needed and even when there is a ceasefire when the wars stop the issue of access is key isn't it uh Jonathan as feder Rico mentioned there uh accessing these areas and also getting the equipment in uh Jonathan what do you think the process should be uh when it comes to you know uh uh clearing uh these uh ammunition and these weapons from the Gaza Strip and who should be involved yeah I think it should be a coordinated and uh collaborative typ effort where uh it's a un Le Mission it should be a un Le coordinated Mission but uh using the resources that um that Civil Society can can can bring uh in the past we've seen uh we've seen responses we've seen construction racing ahead of mine action uh we we really need to bring the mine action community and experts into uh the planning the assessment phases so there needs to be experts that are attached to assessment missions when going in and looking towards how we're going to plan the Reconstruction and the debris removal and bringing in those expertise at the earliest possible stage will prevent uh you know um um delays in in the future so I mean I think we we really need to to have that in place we really need to have a strong information management system in place uh again most likely to be un Le so that we can really map out the contamination map out exactly what type of ordinance we're finding and what response is is appropriate um but I would like to just Echo what the previous speaker spoke about and and access is really an issue at the moment and getting Access Equipment uh is is essential because there's not much that the M action Community can do do if they don't have the appropriate equipment to be able to render safe these Munitions yeah access is an issue indeed because I mean we we've seen that even Aid hasn't been able to get to to to G through to the Gaza Strip and especially in the Northern areas of the Gaza Strip um just on on the humanitarian impact Jonathan let me ask you a little bit more because we haven't touched on that the types of injuries that people are are sustaining as a result of these uh weapons that are being used what types are they and how just difficult is it going to treat them not just now but in the long term what impact is it going to have on on the civilian population of Gaza yeah it's going to have a massive impact on the civilian uh civilian Community within within Gaza um I mean we can talk about the you know the physical impact but but more concerning is probably the the mental health and and psychological support and impact that it's going to have on the and has already had on the people of Gaza um I mean we really we really need to be uh to be addressing this um and we really need to be thinking about how to support now because you know people that are suffering from this kind of mental health and Trauma more likely to take risk um we'll see greater levels of risk being taken when people do return and uh and then that's going to actually cause more and more physical you know injuries uh in the future as people do return so I think that really needs to be addressed now and uh and and then you know we're going to see very very typical uh type of explosive injuries which could be uh you know obviously fatal uh but loss of Limbs uh in general Burns Etc right uh Raja let me come back to you and uh hopefully get your economic expertise on all this even with the ga with the war still going on in Gaza some people are already talking and imagining reconstruction rebuilding Gaza there's already talk about of that how much is it going to take how complicated and how expensive will it be to C Gaza and how much Global funding is there at the moment for for Deming efforts that we've been talking about well the Deming efforts are a critical and early uh act action that needs to be dealt with and some of the points that we mentioned are extremely important uh uh however uh regrettably it's probably going the cost it's the least costly one uh and perhaps you know in the right circumstances something that can be dealt with relatively easily compared to uh uh the Reconstruction now I mean when we talk about reconstruction we've started talking about reconstruction all we've been able to do as Palestinians so far is really chart the extent of damage so the most recent World Bank uh report was only the first four months of the of the of the War uh since then we've had terrible terrible uh destruction in the center so that was an $8.5 billion estimate which so now we're talking closer to 2025 now that's the sort of uh uh numbers that only reparations and Marshall plan type Regional International uh funding can can handle so that's certainly one issue but the other issue I think is also the staging and the organizing of all of this and the fact that uh we need to be careful that not only the UN agencies are not replaced by uh non-un let's say uh players in the relief effort and in the maritime corner for example and other things but also that the Palestinians are the leading the Reconstruction vision you know you know where do you go with the rubble do we use it to expand to make a new Gaza it's extremely critical and pro you know sensitive subject to be honest a very sensitive subject on who will have the authority and on and who who will have the authority and resources to rebuild Gaza right absolutely well the authority pres in principle the P the PA still will have that Authority once it's it continues to reform it it's and and prepare for this it has a reconstruction agency that's where it should be housed but the World Bank will be involved Regional donors will have to step about you know is well if we you know the the principle of reparations you know something we have to talk about going back to 1948 if we can start with the 2023 war and and and and pin them down on that then the other ones might be you know but that's something we shouldn't forget this is not the first time Israel has caused un you know unold un un incalculable damage which it never has been held responsible for uh compensating all right feder Rico in a man your thoughts looking ahead to reconstruction how big of a gap do you think there'll be between what's needed right now given you know what Gaza has experienced and the funding the funds that will be available I it's hard to say as our colleague was saying the bill keeps increasing month after month as destruction piles up for us at Humanity inclusion already the priority is to address the immediate humanitarian needs now and you were talking about before we have seen thousands of people have suffered from amputations um there are tens of thousand people have suffer from injuries and require not just immediate surgery but also nursing care and physiotherapy Rehabilitation you know sometimes weeks and months after after their their blessure their um their injury and um and then looking at reconstruction I think it's it's important to start planning now but we are still far from from from that moment we we need and I think the International Community needs to address the root causes of this conflict we need to make sure this conflict is the last one if there is no real solution that creates stability and dignity for the Palestinians and security for the whole region including Israel uh then there cannot be true reconstruction because the amount of money required will be very high the number of years will be you know five 10 years at least and uh and no actor agency will invest in that unless they're sure that this is something stable we invest now for the next 10 years but then there's a future of peace and prosperity for for Gaza and for Palestine in the region after that Jonathan your thoughts the eventual reconstruction of Gaza will no doubt be a Monumental task you know how important will it be to have a a really solid process in place and what should be the priorities because rebuilding the infrastructure is important but as we heard treating the people also of Gaza who've experienced who who you know been victims of this conflict and who' have experienced really severe injuries will also be uh key yeah and it's going to be very difficult to prioritize I mean generally speaking the International Community will have allocated funding that will will go to both areas so there'll be there'll be that that supports uh clearance and and in uh in effect that support the Reconstruction but also there'll be uh other sources of funding that will be directed towards supporting uh uh civilians and and victims so I I think between between those two and between the different funding sources we can we can separate um quite easily and um yeah and I mean I think as I mentioned before assessments are essential and until we until we get access and understand uh the extent of the contamination then uh it's very very difficult to to understand exactly how the best or what is the best approach um in traditional mind clearance you know we can go and do surveys we can map out areas and then we can have a proactive approach to to clearance and that might be the case in in some parts of Gaza but in other parts it might be a more responsive approach as people return there's a response mechanism in place for what they find it could be having educate will we will need to educate all workers everybody that comes back into Gaza will need to be educated on the risks that these pose and and then we can have also mine action experts that are sitting on standby or supporting uh reconstruction teams or Rubble removal teams right um so it's going to be a combination of of of different approaches I think depending on which part of the the of Gaza that we're going to be operating in yeah Jonathan I wanted to ask you about you know some of the types of the weapons that have been used and apparently they include the controversial um incendiary white phosphorus which can seep into water supplies I understand so the consequences of all this will be long lasting I mean how do you address that yeah I mean the the use of incendiary weapons is isn't isn't new to uh to to conflict but um using it on this level in in populated areas is uh is quite unprecedented um and and the the environmental impact that it will have as it leaks as you mentioned leaks Into Water Systems Etc um will need a completely different response uh and and something that the M action sector hasn't really worked on uh in in great detail previously although there are initiatives in place at the moment that are already looking at it and tests and trials have been conducted on how we could potentially uh Clean Water Supplies from explosive residues and and things so that again this is just such a complex environment that we're that that we're walking into and uh and it's unprecedented it's it's something that we we've never really seen before on this scale an unprecedented situation no doubt Raja khidi in rala I'll give you the last word what should be the best approach what should be the the strategy for for reconstruction and what should decision makers you think consider when when they move forward well first things first I think and we've already heard about some of those first things so I mean there's a very logical sequence of what you need to be what needs to be done this year and what can be done and what needs to be done next year and what might be possible given resources and this year it's about it's about emergency relief which is costing around3 to3 and half billion dollars a year it's about temporary shelter which nobody has yet even started putting in place for up to a bill a million displaced people it's you know next year is about and it's about Rubble removal hopefully starting and these other immediate then you have a whole new stage next year which is when you can perhaps people can start building again but even then you need something to boost the private economy people cannot after this sort of trauma Mass trauma and the lack of services the slow return of services cannot be expected to S to go back to work you know and do their thing so we need a a scheme something like a universal emergency Universal basically income scheme so at least you know before we start to rebuild we need 10 billion in the next year or so and that's you know even that's daunting in the lack as everybody said in the lack of a ceasefire in the lack of a political process and in the lack of Palestinians taking charge of this Pro process and not it not being mortgage to Regional powers or even you know with all due respect the international agencies which have been doing a brilliant job our absence thank you gentlemen for a
