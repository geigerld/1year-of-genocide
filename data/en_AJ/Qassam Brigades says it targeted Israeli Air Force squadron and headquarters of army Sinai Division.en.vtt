00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
start an invasion when your enemy has
 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.189 align:start position:0%
start an invasion when your enemy has

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
you know over 200 uh of your hostages uh
 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:13.990 align:start position:0%
you know over 200 uh of your hostages uh
and<00:05:12.320><c> so</c><00:05:12.560><c> I</c><00:05:12.639><c> would</c><00:05:12.919><c> thought</c><00:05:13.199><c> that</c><00:05:13.320><c> the</c><00:05:13.479><c> raid</c><00:05:13.800><c> is</c>

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
and so I would thought that the raid is
 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.510 align:start position:0%
and so I would thought that the raid is
