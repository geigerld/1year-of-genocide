solidarity rallies have spread outside the US as well in the French Capital students there have blocked the entrance of the S po University Natasha Butler joins us now and so Natasha it seems as though the students have gathered to protest again after a prop Palestine protest was broken [Music] up yeah that's right and I mean you could probably hear those protesters uh behind me there are a few dozen students outside there are a few dozen inside as well they've been staging a sitting now uh we believe for nearly 24 hours we know that University authorities have asked them to leave but so far uh they haven't there are there's a very well pretty light police presence I have to say at either end of this street but for now the protesters are being left alone and if I step away you can maybe see some of them hanging out of the window they've got a number of banners saying no to war that this is a genocide they're also here Pro protesting not only for uh the Palestinian people and asking for an end of the war they're also protesting to say that they want universities in France including this University sep which is one of the most prestigious in France they're asking on all universities to cut ties uh with Israeli universities and they're also calling on the French government to do more to protect uh the Palestinian people and protect what they say has been an erosion of uh freedom of speech in uh recent days and weeks because they say that when a pro Palestinian protest is organized and often the police move in and they say that that's just simply not fair and of course the police broke up a a similar demonstration that happened the day before natas we've seen some very uh violent and heavy-handed tactics being used in the US tell us more about the way that the response that we've seen to the student protesters there in France well I think we have to put this into context this isn't at this stage the sort of movement that we're seeing in the US uh we've seen a protest like this in this particular University CPR uh in Paris there have been uh two or three of these sorts of protest and sittings but it's not something that we've seen in other universities in France at this stage certainly some of the students here are hoping uh that we might see a wave of protests across universities and educational establish ments as we've been seeing in the United States but for the time being that is not the case but there were uh protests here at this University before the police have moved in and moved uh away those protesters they've had to break them up because the protesters uh didn't respond to the request by the university uh to leave the premises but so far that that's that's all we've seen there's no doubt there as I said that the protesters here would very much like to see a wave of protests like this across France that they're encouraging other students to join in and simply to get that message out that they want an end to uh the war Israel's war in Gaza and they want universities across France to cut ties with Israeli universities thank you Natasha Butler in uh in Paris for us
