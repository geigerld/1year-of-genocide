central Gaza in a moment we'll be live with our correspondent in Gaza but first this update from Assad bag the bombs haven't stopped neither have the deaths Gaza Skyline is a constant stream of billowing smoke on the ground it's a desperate fight to save lives fuel is running low for generators at the Indonesian hospital now using a backup generator but the injured keep arriving it's not just about saving lives it's about caring for the many children who have had life-changing injuries because of the Israeli War on Gaza four-year-old Kenzie is burned and bruised her arm amputated too young to understand the war or watch has happened to her the house collapsed completely on them they were injured and they took the girls out from under the rubble they called me when I was on my way

bombardment the fighting continues with Israel saying its troops have moved deeper into the Gaza Strip Hamas though says it's resisting the incursions releasing this video which appears to show its Fighters targeting Israeli tanks one of the world's strongest militaries with nearly $4 billion addition additional funding from the United States Waging War on the people in a narrow strip of land Palestinians have no Air Force no air defense no Army and no major Western power calling for a ceasefire Assad bag Al jazer oh the number of Palestinians killed in Gaza in the past 25 days has now risen to more than 9,000 that includes more than 3,700 children which means a child is being killed every 10 minutes in the occupied West Bank Israeli raids have killed 134 Palestinians in the past 3 weeks and more than 1900 have been detained on the Israeli side more than 1,400 Israelis were killed in hamas's attack on October the 7th the Israeli military says 18 soldiers have been killed since the ground offensive began last week a spokesman of the health Ministry in Gaza gave this update on those killed injured and under the rubble we received 2600 reports for missing including 1,150 children missing or buried under debris the Israeli occupation forces violations against medical facilities resulted in 135 death among the medical personnel 12 ambulance Vehicles destroyed 100 medical facilities were partially damaged and 16 hospitals and 32 medical cares are now totally out of operation either by direct targeting or as a result of absence of fuel of the more than 2 million people living in Gaza 1.7 million of them are refugees they live in and around eight camps operated by the UN Rory chall has more on that they are the children grandchildren and great grandchildren of a war three quarters of a century past but each new generation frequently meets its own violent aftershocks or Echoes of that war all are descendants of the nabar or catastrophy what Palestinians call the 1948 conflict that led to the creation of Israel as Palestinians fled or were expelled by Israeli forces to neighboring countries thousands found themselves in the Gaza Strip then controlled by the Egyptian Army first refugees stayed in mosques homes barracks and Tents but with time and population increases gaza's eight un run camps developed into dense urban areas 1948 created the Gaza Strip and its refugee camps 1967 turned them into what many have called open air prison prisons Israel's victory in the sixday Arab Israeli War left it in a dominant position and Gaza East Jerusalem and the West Bank became occupied territories it's often Palestinian civilians who suffer the most in Israel's attacks Israel blames armed Palestinian groups such as Hamas for the violence life for gaza's refugees is an onslaught of formidable challenges blockades overcrowding insufficient water power and health care poverty psychological trauma the failures of a fractured Palestinian Authority and of course the terrible toll of Israel's bombs and missiles all in a tiny strip of land now facing its most sustained attack in decades Rory chalins Al jazer let's go to Al jaz's hanni Mahmud he
