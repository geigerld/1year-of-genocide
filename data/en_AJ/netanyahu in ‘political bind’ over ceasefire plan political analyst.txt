the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has held phone calls with Israel's war cabinet ministers Benny gance and yav Galant to discuss that ceasefire proposal according to Israeli media Galant told blinken that any deal in Gaza must include the dismantling of Hamas as a government and Military Authority Daria shinin is a political analyst and joins us now from Tel Aviv great to have you with us the Americans have have always framed this Biden ceasefire proposal as something that the Israelis would accept but doesn't seem to be quite the case does it what do you think I think the Israeli government is stuck in the exact same political Paradigm that Netanyahu has been in since the very beginning and even though the plan seems to be the most elaborate and developed plan coming from the well announced through the American Administration supposedly reflecting Israel's values Al or Israel's proposals ultimately Netanyahu is in the same position his right-wing flank his Ultra nationalist rather extremist parties in his Coalition have roundly rejected it they are really uh you know kind of slandering the deal in the worst terms calling it a complete capitulation uh victory for Hamas Etc and he has the members of his expanded War cabinet uh who are not exactly embracing it either but they are at least not rejecting it in quite the same level and so typically Netanyahu is in the political bind they of course the right-wing parties have threatened to leave the government if the deal goes through um and it's really a very unpredictable situation because the prime ministers uh you know has not I mean he has essentially given out his own statements rejecting what seem to be the terms of the deal we're not seeing you know even even those of us who know how to read between the lines of what the government is saying they're they're being very very tight lipped about any opening for embracing this deal if those right-wing um members the ultra nationalist members of netanyahu's government do withdraw does that bring down the government not necessarily there are opposition parties that have numerous times offered to provide the whatever remains of netanyahu's Coalition with cover for the sake of supporting such a deal uh and you know as far as we understand that you know such a deal would only have to be approved by the government and not by the entire CET but nevertheless he would have the cover he needs from opposition parties and so uh you know the opposition party yet of La the which is currently not in the expanded War Coalition and I imagine there could be other parties that would follow so there could be a situation in which the government the original government Falls but there are enough parties that come in and give cover that it would be able to pass this deal but that's not a long-term plan for Netanyahu because of course those governments could then or those sorry those other parties could then you know decide to topple the government if it loses its majority if the original parties exit I know it gets into a little bit you know a little bit in the weeds but Netanyahu could also it's not impossible that he would try to negotiate with those opposition parties and say fine come in give us cover for doing this deal because you're prioritizing life of Israeli hostages but on the on the agreement that you have to continue supporting my government after that deal is over which you know just means that the country is mired in political negotiations when other members of of society the families the public um is are are primarily focused on hostage release absolutely because they are very opposed to netanyahu's strategy we've seen the protests out on the streets every week even before the GS War there massive opposition to Netanyahu but he's also an extraordinary political Survivor isn't he will he survive this war yes he is well that's a very good question I mean I think that in the very beginning the first uh surveys for months indicated that he was completely done he was trailing in head-to-head questions about who's more uh more suitable to be prime minister behind Benny Gans by you know double digits often over 20 points and his party had lost up to half of its strength his Coalition had lost up to a third of its strength in Serv for months October November December January by February March and and most recently his party and his Coalition have been recovering somewhat in surveys and for the first time just a few days ago surveys showed that in a head-to-head contest he actually was ahead of Benny Gans by a few points it's still an outlier in the surveys but I always thought it was premature to write him off for the reasons that you said and you know including from the very beginning because ultimately I think what happened is that this war you know the devast of hamas's October 7th attacks and the war in many ways you know shook Israelis to their core and have generated enormous generational trauma that will never go away but it also has reinforced many people's pre-existing positions both with relation to the conflict and the occupation and with relation to Israeli politics and so I'm not entirely surprised to see some of the original Dynamics on the Electoral level going back to where they were before the war it's too early to say mostly because we don't know when elections will be held and it very much depends on the timing if elections had been held anytime in the first six months I think Netanyahu would have lost but it always seemed to me uh you know a a a reasonable assumption that if elections are held only a year after the October 7th attacks that Netanyahu had a better chance of surviving this somehow remember he has many political pressures he does have those corruption cases and parties that will never sit in government with him as a result so he has limited options Daria shinon great speak to you thanks very much indeed for
