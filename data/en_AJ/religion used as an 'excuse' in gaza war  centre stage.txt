Jews have lived in the Muslim world for as long as Islam has existed in the Muslim World anti-Semitism is the crime of the West you have historic Jewish communities in the Muslim world show me that counterpart in the west it doesn't exist taking Center Stage today is Dr Omar suan an American Muslim scholar civil rights leader writer and public speaker he's the founder and president of yakin Institute for Islamic Research in today's episode he discusses the oppression of pro Palestinian voices in the west and the growing islamophobia and how it lends itself to racism so the world is witnessing the dehum dehumanizing double standards when it comes to Palestine and Palestinians this is something that you speak about tell us why it's so important for you and why you feel like you need to speak out about this on a personal level it touches every single fiber of my existence as a human being you know they say you don't need to be a Muslim to care about Palestine or a Palestinian or an Arab you just need to be human and I would hope to be a decent human being and so any human being I think seeing the atrocious nature of the occupation over years and years unresolved the expansion of aggression against an innocent defenseless people would evoke a certain type of outrage and empathy at the same time as a Muslim I'm driven by my faith the same faith that drives me to speak out against the oppression of any group of people the starvation the uh murder the oppression the robbing of just basic Notions of dignity you know when when Allah says in the Quran we start from the place that the child of Adam is meant to be honored is meant to be dignified and so as a Muslim I am brought to the table because of the sanctity of my brothers and sisters in Palestine and of course the particular sanctity of M AA in Jerusalem and then as a Palestinian every single SLE Palestinian in the world has been touched by the initial neba in some way we have generational trauma either our parents were forcibly displaced or we ourselves were forcibly displaced either we still live in some cutout isolated piece of land that we can't call Palestine legally in the international Arena and are reminded daily of our status as an occupied people without a Palestinian passport and without the freedom of movement or we live in other parts of the world and do not have access to our parents' homes to property that may still be registered in our names or we are told in our classrooms in our universities in our workplaces that we don't exist apparently so this touches every single fiber of my exist istence as a human being as a Muslim as a Palestinian and of course as an American whose government is complicit directly complicit in murdering people like myself and so it touches every fiber of my existence at no point is Palestine ever really distant from me and it wasn't distant um through your mother's poetry was it no it was so I I've spoken about this multiple times you know my earliest memories are growing up watching my mother in agony well she used to write poetry about Palestine she used to write poetry about Bosnia she used to write poetry about Kashmir and there was something very profound about my mother's poetry and I think about the symbolism of the in Father about the collective call for Liberation as a whole you know we have all of these symbols and all these images that are not entirely unlike the stream of images that we're getting right now out of Gazza but people and items become Frozen in time in the capacity of Palestine my mother wrote a poem about the stone The Rock which symbolizes our struggle and uh she called it the silent this idea of the Revolutionary stone that how dare you say that I am a silent Stone I speak to the volumes of Decades of my people's oppression and it really hits home for me when I when I think of the images you know we talk about Muhammad being held by his father and what that provoked in the world at the time and I remember particularly uh many of you can recall the image of a young Fara in Gaza the child in front of the tank David and Goliath and our first computer that we ever got that was the wallpaper of the computer and then I came to realize that Faris was a distant relative of mine number one from the same family of number two I realized that some point in my adult life I said you know that kid had he lived would have been my my age now he's speaking through that picture on a on a regular basis through his struggle but if he was alive he would be speaking on panels and protesting as an adult for the same struggle that claimed his life back then and so you have these Timeless pictures these Timeless symbols that remind us that until Palestine is free no Palestinian will rest until Palestine is free no muslim will feel comfortable with their faith until Palestine is free no human being will be content in the realization of their Humanity until Palestine is free we have to continue to make sure that that stone speaks loudly and that those children that have faced the most brutal army in the world do not stand up against that Tyrant alone what do you think is at the core of this dehumanization by some towards the Palestinians you know the Palestinians represent the culmination of various bigotries against the Muslim World against Islam against the Arab um against the other especially in a western context uh we're not just the villain uh we're the most dangerous villain in the movie We're not just the object of fear in orientalist Play We Are the last boss we're unfortunately framed in islamophobia in the image of the Arab Savage and we threaten by our very existence a well-funded dominant racist ideology that has lobbies and packs that can unfortunately co-opt politicians that otherwise might have been decent human beings and suppress the voices or seek to suppress the voices of thousands and thousands and thousands of people and so in our existence as Palestinians we unfortunately just by our existence can be other to where we're a threat when we live amongst other people and we're a threat when we seek to live in our own land at the core of it is the last breath of the colonialism that has ravaged the side of the world Israel is the last Colonial project that exists in this part of the world and in America's imperialism Israel must exist to extend its interests and expand in order to expand its interests and that is what multiple Scholars have said over time and so by our existence we continue to stand in the way of that and serve as a viable obstacle on the way to realizing that full Colonial project that permanent base through which America can can continue and Western interests can continue to spread through the region unhindered and unopposed we know and these are the facts that the story of Palestine is a story of occupation it is a story of an occupied people fighting against as you call it a colonialist power but there's an attempt by some to drive a wedge to turn it into a religious War it's the Jews against the Muslims is that divide deepening these days do you think and you yourself has been have been accused of anti-Semitism despite you saying you've gone out and stood in solidarity with Jewish people in the United States tell us about that and how it makes you feel to be accused of anti-Semitism well look you know first they try to redefine our own terms and tell us how we can use them as Muslims so the word Jihad needs to be scrapped now because of your misunderstanding of it the word Allah the words allahar are threatening because of your misunderstanding of it and then they tell us that our words of Liberation are in fact calls to genocide so don't say intial anymore because the word intial to you represents violence and terrorism and then they try to redefine their own framings of anti-semitism so that they can silence us when we challenge the oppression against our people and so you neither allow me to speak in my own terms nor do you allow me to defend myself against your oppression and so at some point I think we have come to the conclusion that we are just not willing to operate in your warped Twisted World we're not willing to operate in your malicious framings we we will defend the sanctity of our people and we will stand with the oppressed and the targeted and the unfairly maligned wherever they are and that means that you know what if if there's genuine anti-Semitism in front of me every single time an innocent Jewish person or a synagogue is targeted in the United States I will be the first one to go and stand on the basis of principle and Justice and the sanctity of human life to protect that life and in that same breath of course I am going to stand for the sanctity and the protection of my own people a cause that has yielded my being born in the United States in the first place and so you don't get to rob me of my own resistance by your misapplied framings nor do you get to mistranslate our movement nor do you get to take away our terminology it's not something that we accept accept anymore as Palestinians wherever we live and so we are choosing to insist upon our maps to insist upon our uh culture to insist upon our existence and we will always be free Palestinians that are longing for a free Palestine no matter who stands in the way and no matter what unfair accusations are thrown towards us and I'll say here because it's very important because I am a Palestinian American I feel for my people in Palestine and I also genuinely want good from my neighbors and there are many confused uninformed or misinformed Americans in regards to Palestine in regards to the war on Iraq in regards to many of America's ugly Unholy Wars on the Muslim world and in the Middle East and I often challenge them by saying that you know hundreds of thousands of people people were killed in on the basis of a lie the lie that there were weapons of mass destruction can you tell me the story of a single person that was killed in your name and the answer is almost always I don't know who they are I can't name a single Iraqi I can't tell you a single story when it comes to the Palestinians when it comes to the inability of the average American to see through all of the years of misinformation not only do they not know the story of the Palestinian people but they have unfortunately assigned a propensity to violence to every single Muslim in the world right so that brings me to my next question religion is being used as an excuse to justify the suffering of peoples including now as we see in Gaza how do you as a faith leader uh not let Islam or Christianity or Judaism become scapegoats in this way by insisting on facts uh Jews have lived in the Muslim world for as long as Islam has existed in the Muslim world uh anti-Semitism is the crime of the West you have historic Jewish communities in the Muslim world show me that counterpart in the west it doesn't exist Zionism is an inherently racist project and in and of itself has a layer of anti-em ISM to it because the idea was to dispose in many ways of the Jewish people from Europe and from the West Palestinians did not just wake up one day and start hating Jews Islam was not the problem occupation is the problem if Muslims came and kicked Palestinians out of their land and established an illegal State on their territory and mistreated them the way that Israel is mistreating them then we we would resist that Muslim state so this has nothing to do with religion that is based in not just a lack of facts but based entirely in fear and so religion cannot be scapegoated nor should religion be used to continue the war on the Palestinians mentioned uh Senator Lindsey Graham who said that Israel is in a religious war and I stand with Israel unapologetically so it's clearly not us who have the the problem of religious fanaticism in fact it is the speaker of the house it is multiple members of Congress it's the president of the United States who stands unapologetically as a Zionist and who speaks with such disregard for Palestinian Humanity that people in his own country children are being slaughtered in his own CH in his own country and abroad because of his inability to recognize when this dehumanizing language starts from the top does it then give free reign for others to continue with this hateful rhetoric absolutely uh look is that what you're seeing in the United States yes we have a president whose Legacy will be genocide we call him genocide Joe for a reason so um you can't you can't fight that evil if you can't name it properly and it is important for us to no longer allow the Democratic party or a Democratic president to say well I am the lesser of the two evils how much more evil can you get than an average of 10,000 civilians being killed a month you don't get much more evil than that and so we're not going to fall for it anymore we will hold him accountable and we look forward to holding every single politician that has stood for this genocide accountable com November 24 through the election through the election in the US yes okay through the elections I'm not being a violent Muslim why do you think this anti-palestinian rhetoric and this bigotry is not being dealt with perhaps in the same way as other forms of discrimination well we've been saying for years that islamophobia is the only uh acceptable form of bigotry in the mainstream arena in the United States politically socially culturally you don't see people lose their jobs for anti-palestinian bigotry that's before this incredible assault on Humanity that we're witnessing right now again I think that it's the culmination of multiple bigotries there has been an enormous amount of funding that has been put into the dehumanization of the Palestinians and the suppression of any voice that speaks to our humanity and so you have kids that are getting booted from their law firms that have their faces being put on trucks that are getting kicked out of their schools and out of their companies because of something that they tweeted or posted or shared on social media 5 10 years ago but you have people that spew the most repugnant form of anti-palestinian bigotry and they just get promoted in their jobs and in their careers and so this is why we say that anti- Palestinian bigotry is indeed an extension of islamophobia even if not all Palestinians are Muslims and in fact the existence of Palestinian Christians is a major obstacle to the framing of this issue by these extremists why because most Americans have no idea that there are Palestinian Christians that are living under this assault as well there are Palestinian churches being bombed so this confuses the average American mind but with all of that being said I think it's important for us as well as Muslims to not fall for the insincere disingenuous voice that is supposed to be against islamophobia yet extends anti-palestinian bigotry whether that comes from the president or for those who have claimed to be our innerfaith allies in the space of multifaith work or on the ground I have said this to multiple people when w was murdered six-year-old boy in Chicago I heard from people that I had not heard from before uh his murder that extended their condolences while at the same time their social media and their voices and their institutions were justifying the genocide in Gaza and I made it a point to say to each and every single one of those voices and I say it here today that if you have justified in your mind the Eraser of this many any innocent Palestinian civilians in Palestine then you are an islamophobe whether you like it or not and by your definition of an islamophobe what's the difference between a child in Gazza and a child in Chicago and in fact what's the difference between I a Palestinian child and that child in Gazza had I been born there and unable to escape that same person that extended their sympathy to me would have been justifying my [Applause] murder Dr AR SL man thank you we appreciate your time much appreciate thank
