ali albanima is the director of electronic intifada good to have you with us on al jazeera how fragile do you think this truce is well how many times have i sat in this chair having this same discussion with you uh or one of your colleagues this keeps happening uh palestinians in gaza obviously relieved that the bombs have stopped but 44 people are dead including 15 children hundreds injured and people in gaza don't get to go back to anything like normal because they're still living under israel's siege that is a form of silent violence uh against every man woman and child in gaza 24 hours a day 365 days a year for 15 years so unfortunately it is fragile this is going to happen again i can't tell you if it's going to be in a day a week a month or a year but it's going to keep because israel enjoys total impunity for its crimes against the palestinian people and not just impunity but full and active support remember it was bombing gaza with weapons provided by the united states by the european union by canada who all stood by israel and these are the same countries that are sending billions of dollars of weapons to ukraine supposedly to resist occupation and invasion but here they are helping israel perpetrate occupation invasion and terror against the civilian population so sadly it is fragile and it is going to happen again until that changes one of the things that uh perhaps was was different to to some of the cases that we've seen in the past was that this time around the israeli authorities were saying that they perceived there was a potential threat as opposed to actually giving evidence of an actual threat before it carried out to the the bombing attacks which this time round were aimed at targets within civilian areas we saw the civilian casualties is there a suggestion that israel given the fact you were talking about immunity or impunity there do you think that israel is changing the goalposts very slightly and this could lead to attacks which are knocked back out backed up by any evidence of any perceived threat but can be just done by israel at any given moment when has israel ever provided evidence for these so-called threats when israel in may 2021 bombed the al jazeera offices bombed the associated press offices was there any legitimate threat did israel provide any evidence of a threat it never does and it never has to because it enjoys the full support of the so-called international community the same people who lecture us day and night about human rights and the rules-based international order so there's nothing new here israel kills it murders it bombs it destroys uh with uh on the on the flimsiest of pretexts and with no pretext remember that israeli leaders routinely call these regular massacres of palestinians uh mowing the lawn the idea being that the natives and remember that palestinians and gaza the vast majority are refugees ethnically cleansed from their lands in what is now so-called israel that in order to give the message to the idea to the natives that you know there's no point resisting you have to mow the lawn periodically you have to massacre them uh kill a bunch of them so they get the message that they should just surrender and accept their fate this is the logic of israel this is the logic of zionism frankly and it's fully supported by the united states the european union canada and sadly now you know it pains me to say a number of arab regimes that have fully normalized their ties with this frankly murderous regime i want to ask you about the influence and the role of hamas in this there was a lot of speculation about what at what point hamas could or would choose to get involved in this conflict which may have taken it to yet another level but hamas of course which runs gaza has been trying to rebuild gaza since the attacks you were talking about last year if it appears to remain reluctant to get involved do you think that that will send a message to israel with regard to the nature of the attacks and the number of attacks that it can carry out i think that's the israeli spin the israeli spin is that oh you know hamas didn't get involved because they were you know too scared or they didn't want to suffer what israel would do to gaza nobody in gaza wants to be bombed by israel nobody wants a war israel launched this war not palestinians and that's always the case i think the calculation by hamas and by islamic jihad was uh to respond to israel's attack to its uh unprovoked attack on gaza uh and to to escalate if necessary i think uh you know it would have been untenable for hamas to stay out of the war if islamic jihad had not succeeded in in getting israel into a position where it would agree to a ceasefire so i think hamas would have joined the the battle if it had to but nobody you know palestinians are not itching for with israel it is israel who imposes on palestinians the uh the the need to resist and i think hamas would have had to i think the popular demand for hamas to defend palestinians would have been irresistible had this continued even for another day as always really interesting to get your views on this ali abhinav and thank you very much indeed for your time sir thank you so much
