let's get the latest on the situation inside Gaza safwat alut joins us on the phone safat as we've been reporting a very heavy night of bombardment in Gaza talk us through exactly what's happened well add think another heavy night to the to the previous heavy night actually and today is uh now 10 days same uh uh strength of the fire uh but last night it has intensified in three different areas in the in the north of kav in Gaza City and even in the South where where they ask people to evacuate or to move so uh one of the most sensitive places that they hit was the civil defense uh base and our station in Gaza City which is based next to one of the biggest hospitals in Gaza City uh the the governmental press office in Gaza said that s civil defense um have been killed in this attack and in the two neighborhood also they uh they hit one of the houses four people K were killed including three children and one adult uh the South the same so the we have been receiving lots of uh information about new and more casualties arriving to the local hospitals who are already suffering from uh you know from difficult situation um we could hear from where I'm staying now in D balah City it's the central area of Gaza between Gaza and canun I could hear from time to time that the the explosions we don't know where they are exactly but we can't hear them it could be or should be from the artillery the isi artillery bombing uh different areas in east of the where we are staying or uh we are not sure if this if these explosions could hear could be he in the South and in the north but at least where from where I am staying we could hear this explosions Safa tell us a bit more about what's happening in the South it's been about 48 hours since Israel started demanding that uh people in the north move to the South how many have actually gone to the South and how what is the situation there look let's start with uh the new deadline that Israel is provided a few minutes they have give they give a new deadline for the people in the north and in G City who who could not or or who has not left the the Gaza City and the north of Gaza so they give them more another deadline from uh 5 GMT to 9 GMT to leave the Gaza the Gaza City and the north of G otherwise they will Implement their plans still unclear what kind what other more plans they have but uh it's not really lovely threat from what we understand that they will uh start bombarding more different areas in in Gaza City and in the RO so at least half of the population of Gaza City and the north of Gaza managed to leave to move out of the of to the South and to the central area uh in in the Gaza St these the people or this the huge am a big amount of people who left from Gaza to the unknown places in the in the in the South uh they they are staying everywhere and some of them I we we met like they're staying under some trees that the now the priority for every G now is to find uh some water to drink and a place to stay overnight with his children the the schools everywhere are are full kindergartens are are full full wedding halls are are full universities everywhere you can you can imagine is full of refugees who were displaced who manag to get displaced from from the Gaza City and from the north towards the South many cannot find means of transportation to move uh and to uh to to secure themselves from the north and from Gaza City toward the South because there is lack of fuel the means of transportation have almost stopped here when I'm staying by the way I can see people carrying uh bottles and they start their journey and I I'm one of them also that I have to secure some water for my children as well and on the other side also I can see uh hundreds of people are lining up at the bakery um waiting for uh to get or hopefully they can get uh uh some bread or some food for the families the supermarket everywhere is running out of everything literally everyone is is is emptied because of the emergency and because of the lack of supplies uh due to the Israeli closure for Gaza bord yeah as you say uh the the biggest situ the biggest problem is is The Siege nothing new is able to come in but we are now hearing uh the possibility of the Rafa Crossing being opened at 9:00 a.m. what more do you know about that and how desperately needed is it that Aid comes through now look the the time L for Gins to stay alive is very limited I'm seeing I'm telling that from my own personal experience uh so we are counting um our lives minute by minute hour by hour so uh they need they should have this this procedure should have been done immediately on the at the beginning of the war because here as we mentioned uh the people are buying or consuming everything that have been saved already before the war or before the before the recent War so um if the these borders are not all open or these humanitarian AIDS are not arriving uh into the Gaza Strip then there will be much more even catastrophes but these catastrophes will be collected because the suffering from South to the north is the same there's no safe place or there's no place that full of food and why the others are not so uh regarding the nine uh uh at nine that the crossing will open there are still negotiations and Egypt is linking or preconditioning the the allowing the foreigners to leave the G strip with allowing the the food Aid uh into the Gaza Strip we know that uh um Jordan Turkey Arab Emirates and even Egypt they have been Gathering lots of Aid at Alish which is the other side of the Palestinian Egyptian borders so and they are waiting for uh political decision or Israeli approval to uh to allow uh quantities H big quantities of of Aid to intera so uh the I talked to to one of the foreigners here and who said uh who who confirmed to me uh this news but and they have been receiving day byday update but he said nothing nothing still confirmed okay thank you so much for that update safat Al kalut there for us on the phone from Gaza
