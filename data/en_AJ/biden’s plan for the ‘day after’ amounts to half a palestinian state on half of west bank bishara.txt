alzer's senior political analyst Maran Bashar is here in the studio with us uh we heard there from the Arab councils talking just a little bit earlier at the United Nations is there much chance of this new UN resolution passing given what we've seen in the past when it comes to uh the US votes well this is it I mean given what we've seen in the past and depending of course on the text of the new resolution but if the draft resolution speaks of a permanent ceasefire it will be rejected vetoed by the United States one American official after another American official have made it clear over the past several days weeks and months that they reject the idea the principle of a permanent ceasefire to translate that into English they want the war to continue there will be no stop of the war except a temporary one what the United States supports if at all would be uh pauses long pauses sustained pauses they can have all kinds of words and adjectives being used being thrown about all to underline the fact that Israel can continue the war after those whatever you want to call them sustained short whatever they are humanitarian pauses end they could be for a few days they could be for few weeks but the United States supports the nanaho government's goal of finishing Gaza and taking full control of it at least for the intermediate run this links very nicely to my next question because we heard today from the Palestinian president Mahmud abas uh saying urging Hamas to reach a truce the word he used was truce what why is that notable that he used the word truce rather than a permanent ceasefire just few minutes ago I think or an hour ago uh un National Security adviser Jake Sullivan praised the Palestinian leader for his generosity in support of the American position so you can imagine that abbas's appeal to Hamas not to Israel not to the United States but to Hamas means that also the authorities giving up on the permanent ceasefire while its Ambassador at the United Nation is asking for a permanent ceasefire but in reality speeding up asking Hamas to speed up the process it basically telling it to drop the idea of a permanent ceas fire that's been demanding all along which the United States and Israel has have rejected all along now just to be clear and this is by the way very clever it's very complicated but we're going to try to simplify it in less than a minute it's hugely important what the United States wants to do and apparently what president Abbas is on board with is that there will be no ceasefire there will be pauses and more pauses during those pauses and fighting there will be negotiations over not just a permanent ceasefire but a permanent ceasefire that leads to a permanent solution which means moving forward you can imagine a scenario whereby Israel occupies Gaza and for Israel to stop the fighting and withdraw from Gaza Saudi Arabia for example would have to normalize relations with Israel the Palestinian Authority or the PLO will have to accept half a state on half of the West Bank in return for a permanent ceasefire so the Biden Administration in a clever genius dangerous way is basically saying we're going to continue with this fight we're going to have few pauses to negotiate under pressure with the Palestinians and the Arabs so for all of them to guarantee Israel's security once again and to accept Israel's political conditions once again whereby the Palestinians would happily live in a half a state on half of the West Bank recognized by Saudi Arabia which normalizes relations with Israel and guarantees along with other Arab countries Israel security it's a disaster unfolding in Far of our eyes stay with us Maran because Al jazer did interview uh a member of fata a little earlier today just on this issue Jamal nazal is a spokesperson for the fata movement he defended those comments by Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas that Hamas must reach a captives for prisoner swap agreement with Israel he wants a ceas fire to be reached he wants a prisoner swap to take place also because the families of the prisoners are waiting the Palestinian people are suffering facing starvation diseases and lethal attacks by Israel if you are the elected president of a people you have every right to speak out uh to speak out and call on everyone who is delaying and we think that Israel is using delaying tactics the honest is on Israel the burden of proof is on Israel Israel has to deliver and it should not should stop using all these excuses which we do not believe in it's an Israel's hand and also all the parties concerned uh who are negotiating have to reach an agreement so that our people can get into the month of Ramadan in peace your reaction to What Jamal nazal had to say well I mean certainly everyone wants peace and security and love and Valentine every day of the year we would love a valentine every day of the year but that's not what's happening unfortunately and pressing Hamas to reach a deal now means that it's not going to be a permanent ceasefire which means after Ramadan Israel will go back and kill more and more and more Palestinian children and occupy more and more parts of Gaza and bomb more hospitals and so on so forth there seems to be uh and I'm going to go on a limb to say that that there are different Palestinian spokesperson now around the palan authority it's ambassadors at thean here and there and and spokesperson of fat the men uh faction saying different things a lot of them are you know positive and and uh you know wonderful and loving and so on so forth but the palan Authority Under the presidency of Abbas and his Deputy today are basically working with the Americans in order to reach a deal in order for them to be taken control Ro on part of the West Bank a bit of Gaza on the long term but basically under Israel's control okay alera senior political analyst Marwan Bashar good to get your thoughts again
