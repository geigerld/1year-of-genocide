well the Prime Minister Netanyahu has described the latest Hamas proposal to end the war as ridiculous and the group wants a three stage ceasefire each stage would last 42 days in the first Israeli troops would withdraw Beyond salahadin Road that's the main road linking the north and south of the strip the group says that would allow displaced Palestinians to return home and hamans wants a permanent ceasefire to be announced before it releases any captured soldiers after that the group says it will release female Israeli reservists held captive in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners 50 inmates for each captive and then in the final stage Hamas proposes the end of Israel's Siege and the beginning of reconstruction efforts in Gaza let's bring in V marks he's joining us now from occupied East Jerusalem so um villum Israel we understand is sending a delegation to Qatar to continue with the ceasefire talk talks does that suggest that talks are ongoing despite this latest CR criticism of hamas's proposal well darina if we make a comparison to the last round of talks in Cairo where Israel very publicly said they would not be sending a delegation then this clearly seems to be an improvement on their willingness to engage in a conversation despite the claims as he mentioned there that the Hamas proposals are both ridiculous and another word they used was delusional what what we don't yet know though is who will be attending those talks on behalf of the Israeli delegation their seniority as well as quite crucially the extent of their mandate how much flexibility will the Israeli government give them to negotiate the finer points of any agreement and at the same time the war cabinet has approved plans for a ground assault in ra where of course more than a 1 and a half million Palestinians are Sheltering How likely is that to happen or or is that announcement sort of for more domestic uh reasons yeah you have to think about the audience that Netanyahu and his team are speaking to here it's not just the world who are watching the situation it's also his potential voters where there to be another election here in Israel as well as his Coalition Partners we've heard more than once over the last couple of months about this plan ground assault on Rafa we've heard it being approved more than once and yet we haven't seen it happen there's been a huge amount of international pressure pushing back against that possibility because of all those civilians you mentioned so what this may be is a maximalist position a threat essentially as you would expect during any kind of public negotiations like this that they are prepared to take that step the Israeli military and yet we have heard again and again and again from Hamas that any deal needs to include what they've called a permanent ceasefire and clearly military operations ongoing in Rafa would not constitute that durin okay thank you vill marks reporting for us from occupied East Jerusalem
