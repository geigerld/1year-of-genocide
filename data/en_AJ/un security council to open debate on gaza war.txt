well attempts to get competing resolutions on the conflict through the UN Security Council have exposed some deep diplomatic fault lines now the US has finalized its version with some key changes well for more on this we can go to New York and our correspondent Gabriel aland who's live for us so what's interesting about this us resolution Gabe yeah this is the final draft it could be voted upon as soon as Tuesday afternoon we're hearing and it's four pages long 18 different points but there are two that I want to point out that are new in this final draft there's one point that says H any movement of people must be voluntary safe and consistent with international law and urges all parties to take appropriate steps to promote the safety and well-being of civilians and their safe movement this is key because uh this is essentially the US saying that they would want uh any move movement of people to be voluntary and not forced that goes to the issue of Israel uh demanding that people in the north of Gaza relocate to the South the US saying it needs to be voluntary and not forced aside from that another key point in this draft it calls for all measures necessary such as humanitarian pauses to allow for humanitarian Aid keyword humanitarian PA is there the US had not agreed to that previously it's something that many Security Council Members had wanted put in and the US clearly relenting on that noticeably not demanding a humanitarian pause but at least in this final uh version here at least suggesting that the US would be open to it in this resolution yeah Gabriel it was about 7even days ago that the UN Security Council had rejected a Russian resolution it was condemning violence and terrorism against civilians but it made no mention of Hamas is there any what chance that this one is going to pass will this pass it's anyone's guess at this point I mean this version the final version here is certainly closer to what uh Security Council Members have voted for previously in a Brazil resolution that uh 12 members voted for uh the US vetoed it uh it'll be key to watch Russia and how Russia votes on this if they abstain or if they choose to wield the VTO power that they have or not but the bottom line is it's anyone's guess right now Anthony blinkin the secretary of state is planning to be at the United Nations there was supposed to be a vote on this Tuesday morning that has been postponed now and the thinking is is perhaps blinkin wants to try to drum up support for the US resol resolution before it eventually does go to a vote Gabriel alandro bringing us up to date from New York thank you very much indeed
