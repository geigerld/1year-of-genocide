on average more than one journalist has been killed every day during Israel's war on Gaza the committee to protect journalists reports that nearly 40 have now lost their lives at the hands of the Israeli forces since the War Began they've been killed by air strikes by artillery shelling or by being shot according to the cpj Israel's war on Gaza has become the worst for those covering conflict since it began documenting deaths in the early 1990s the International Federation of journalists condemns the killings in continued attacks on journalists and is calling for an immediate investigation reporters Without Borders recently concluded Israeli forces deliberately targeted and killed a reuter videographer in southern Lebanon as non-combatants journalists are protected under article 79 of the Geneva Convention and all parties to a conflict have a duty to protect them well earlier this month a video went viral of a Palestinian journalist ripping off his bullet proof proof vest and helmet during a live broadcast after his colleague was killed while reporting outside a hospital these shields and hats do not protect us they do not protect any journalist at all this is just equipment and in this situation we are victims losing lives one after another at no cost we're waiting for our turn one after another all right let's talked to Tim Dawson who's Deputy Secretary General of the International Federation of journalists it represents 180 journalist unions and associations right around the world and has around 600,000 members Tim joins us on Skype from London welcome Tim from that clip you get a very real impression of the the sense of hopelessness really in a conflict where the numbers of journalists keeps on Rising and indeed as we've just heard the worse since figures started being kept what are your thoughts well I I certainly agree with you that the the death toll is absolutely shocking um you know more than one journalist today dead I mean just to put that in a little bit of context uh if you look at the Vietnam War which lasted for 20 years involved 2.2 million combatants uh it's widely thought about 63 journalists died in that conflict um the wars in Yugoslavia which went on for 10 years in the 1990s 140 journalists dead so the scale of of of loss of life among journalists in Gaza is extraordinary and I I mean you are absolutely right that they are they are experiencing real hardship and difficulties there's very little food there's very little water uh there's about a thousand journalists working in Gaza at the moment and they mostly walk to their assignments so they carry their heavy cameras and and tripods on their shoulders to go and get the stories but there's also among them an absolute determination to get the stories an absolute determination to try and unearth absolutely everything that's happening in Gaza which I think is extraordinary they are they're very brave courageous and determined individuals who I think deserve all of our support and unusual because these journalists actually live there they have no means of Escape there is no respite absolutely not there are so far as I'm aware no foreign uh registered journalists in Gaza so I think that some of their determination comes from the fact this is their home that this is happening to uh an extraordinary and terrible thing is happening to where they live uh one of them said to me the other day there isn't an inch of Gaza that doesn't have a story to tell and we're determined to get all of those stories out uh and I think you know if if you look at journalists and journalism doing the very best work and the very best people doing that work you'll find it in Gaza today yeah and as as we at aler know all too well members of journalist families have been targeted too uh you've been calling for an investig ation how would you like to see the remit of that and how would it be conducted who would do it well as you mentioned at the top of this package um the international law is fairly clear that civilians should be protected by military forces uh and that journalists are counted as civilians so I would I mean I I would like to see right now the Israel is taking proactive steps to safeguard journalists I don't think it's it's certainly not enough to send out a press release saying um you know there's nothing we can do to guarantee your safety I think it's perfectly normal and responsible for a military force to have guidelines for its operatives about how journalists are protected in terms of it being investigated I think that probably will be something for the future but perhaps it'll be something for the international criminal court um I you know the dust and the smoke of war is is very thick over Gaza at the moment and it's quite hard to judge any evidence in the in the way that you would hope that a court would um but I would very much hope that if there have been breaches of international law that they will be addressed in an international court right and Tim the Israeli military said it cannot guarantee the safety of journalists it said that directly to AFP and Reuters tell us how calls for Israel to be more responsible in their assault as far as journalists are concerned have been responded to by Israel well I've not had any response from Israel to the to the that I've made I'm afraid to say um the the mindset among uh Israeli military commanders is is deeply depressing My Hope Is that the more people who speak up um the more chance that there is that they will take notice I mean you mentioned the many members of the International Federation of journalists who have added their voice to a call for international law to be respected and it's worth remembering I mean of those organizations all over the world who've signed up to that most of them will have had meetings of their executive boards who will in turn have consulted their members journalists all over the world giving thought to this people from an enormous variety of perspectives and political beliefs and religious background so this isn't some you know monolithic group who support you know a particular side or another it's people who fundamentally have journalism at their heart fundamentally have the desire to tell stories to expose what's going on who can see the damage that's been done to journalists in Gaza yeah as you say extraordinary reporting going on uh at great personal risk Tim Dawson we appreciate that Tim Dawson from the International Federation of journalists thanks thank you Nick
