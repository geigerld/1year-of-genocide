the mix and what are the important issues this is Inside Story [Music] hello and welcome to the program I'm Dar abuga November the 5th 2024 is the day Americans will vote for their next president most predict a contest between President Joe Biden and Donald Trump who's seeking a return to the White House but with Trump facing criminal charges and Biden an impeachment inquiry if a week is a long time in politics 11 months feels like an eternity who'll actually be on the ballot paper isn't certain yet in a campaign swirling with volatility world leaders are preoccupied with an uncertain global economic and political Outlook a widening East West divide and international involvement in major Wars in Ukraine and Gaza but what do American voters worry about who will they pick in an election that has Global implications we'll be discussing this and more with our guests in a moment but first Carl leg takes a look at how things are playing out so far in the battle for the White House with less than a year to go the race is on for America's top job and the 2024 US presidential election promises to be like no other before leading the field of Republican candidates is former president Donald Trump who's facing federal and state criminal charges relating to his 2020 election lost Mr President what's the latest on a gun deal the incumbent Joe Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee already the oldest president in American history seeking another term the gloves are already off with Trump taking aim at Biden at a rally in Colorado shortly after a court barred him from appearing on the state's ballot Joe Biden is a threat to democracy it's a threat Biden has hit back telling voters his pred is all bark and no bite Trump just talks to talk we walk the walk the latest polls suggest it's neck and neck if the election were a head-to-head contest with Trump ahead of Biden by 2% in a New York Times Sienna College opinion poll another survey by The Wall Street Journal suggests Trump is ahead by 4% let despite Trump dominating the Republican field he currently faces six Rivals the most prominent of Florida Governor Ronda Santos former US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie former Arkansas governor Isa Hutchinson a Longshot candidate and political newcomer businessman Vic ramaswami with little opposition in the Democratic party Biden and his vice president Cala Harris have the biggest backing but face challenges from Dean Phillips a little known congressman from Minnesota and self-help author and speaker Maran Williamson but other contenders have thrown their hats into the ring Robert F Kennedy Jr from the famed American political family has launched an independent bid Progressive activist Cornell West says he'll do the same while former presidential candidate Jill Stein has said she will seek the green party's nomination the challenge will be to get enough support to get their name on the ballot paper in all 50 states next year it all kicks off in January when Republican voters in Iowa hold their nominating contest known as the caucuses then it'll be a long wait until November to see who come out on top regardless of who wins the issues remain the same domestic concerns such as rising inflation and the cost of living crime gun control and illegal drugs Health Care welfare and Social Security as well as migration with record numbers of people crossing the southern border with Mexico this year further a field the relationship with China continues to dominate foreign policy Israel's war on Gaza and Russia's invasion of Ukraine both of which receive us backing and funding but for now it'll be the hopeful candidates who need backing as they seek to win the hearts and minds of us voters car Al jazer for Inside Story all right let's bring in our guest joining us from uh St August Augustine in Florida is Tim Constantine who's a senior vice president of diplomacy and external Affairs at the Washington Times he's also the host of the Capitol Hill show and from Harrisburg Pennsylvania we have with us Thomas gift who's the director of the center on us politics University College London and from Burlington Vermont we're joined by Arad Hassan who's a Democratic political strategist welcome to you all thanks for your time Arad I'll begin with you because uh look according to one poll by uh polling firm 538 Biden's approval rating is sitting at around 34% and that is the worst of any president at the same point since polling uh data be became available how much does this worry the Democrats I I know that there are some people who are a little bit worried about this but when we contextualize it in terms of whether you would vote for Joe Biden when that poll question is asked he's sitting about the same place he was this time about four years ago and remember four years ago um he ended up becoming the uh the nominee and the president so I think people are more focused a year out people shouldn't really be that focused on the polls themselves more about what the candidates each are doing right but is he putting his party at risk by running I don't think so right now he's running one of the strongest economies recoveries we've seen in this country and as as it gets closer and closer to the election as more and more people see that they're more secure in their livelihoods they're more secure in their household budgets um they'll see that this economy is much better than it was this point four years ago and that's what people will be looking for when they start making those decisions at The Ballot Box I think this will be good okay just one more for you before I bring in my other guests because you know in the context of the Gaza war that we've been seeing AR shads we hear from a lot of Arab American voters who say that President Biden won't be getting their vote because of his stance um and and his stance that he's taken uh to support Israel no matter what is that going to make a big difference I actually do think and I'll differ from some of my colleagues here I do think that that is something that Joe Biden needs to get a handle on arab-american voters make up an enormous amount a significant amount of the electorate in one of one of the biggest swing states in the country Michigan and so Joe Biden needs to be doing Outreach and communicating to this community um if he wants to shore up an important constituency within an important state and that's politics he does need to do the work here all right Thomas let's bring you in because um I want to stick with Biden uh for just a moment before we talk about the other candidates as well as Trump does Biden have the energy to actually fuel a campaign at this time because much is made uh about his age he's 81 and he would be the oldest American to win a presidential election should he win uh that nomination of course well I mean I think that that's certainly a legitimate question and it's one that Republicans are trying to put front and center and especially given kamla Harris's very poor polling numbers ones that are even lower than Joe Biden they're essentially trying to uh depict a vote for Biden as being a vote for Harris and I still think that voters by and large um you know vote for the top of the ticket um but it has to be a consideration given his age and I do think that this is a drag on Joe Biden's poll numbers it's very difficult to look at the numbers right now even with the caveat that we are about a year out and be uh in any way encouraged by them not only uh nationally does it look like Joe Biden is maybe losing by a few percentage points uh to Donald Trump at the moment but he's losing in almost all the key swing states there was a recent poll that came out showing that Donald Trump had an edge in uh seven key Battleground States um so for lots of reasons both uh related to Joe Biden's uh performance potentially his age he's just not polling well I mean the the one so how do you think that the White House is dealing with this Thomas I mean does the White House have a convincing message to Democrats about why they shouldn't be nervous well I think that to a large extent the White House has tried to frame this as a public relations problem and that they're just not getting the message out but I think that a lot of Voters are just dissatisfied with the state of the US economy and the state that the country is going at the moment now I do think that it's it's interesting that uh polls so show such disfavor ability um on the economy because if you looked at some objective measures uh inflation has decreased considerably uh jobs numbers are still relatively robust it looks like the economy is going to achieve this soft Landing that many feared that it would not be able to so there does seem to be a disconnect between what's happening um on the ground and and how Americans are reacting but you know ultimately I I think Joe Biden um has to figure out some uh way to to circumvent that challenge because it's really been dragging down his numbers okay let's bring in Tim I mean do you agree with that and um is it just going to be Joe Biden Tim or How likely is a a democratic shakeup at this point I see an entirely different scenario and and I've been saying this for months and when I first said it people kind of laughed and thought I was crazy but as time has gone on they think hm maybe maybe there's something to this I believe Joe Biden will will continue to run through the primary process in the United States you mentioned in the opening Iowa there's Iowa New Hampshire South Carolina they go state by state there are a few days where there are multiple States and by May or so hopefully someone in either party has racked up enough delegates to officially be the candidate for their party I think Jo Biden will go through that process and then enter the convention this summer the Democrat Convention as the assumed nominee however I think at that convention Joe Biden and the people around him will announce H I have had I've seen the light I've I've had a a thought here that perhaps I am too old perhaps I am not ready to go for another four years however his people will control all of those delegates which means essentially they can choose they get to they have unusually large sway over who their nominee will be I think you you'll see Michelle Obama Joe Biden's Administration is essentially Biden 2.0 uh Biden is Obama 2.0 meaning a whole lot of the people that work in that Administration are Obama people Obama presidency people they would ask you I got to ask you what you're basing this on I mean you you say that this is just is this the the feeling you have you think this is what's going to happen or or or is there do you have some Insider info you can share with us no I think it's based on political reality you know your earlier guest said the economy is good I just disagree it's good compared to where it was 18 months ago but it's not good having three and a half% inflation isn't great it's better than the 9% inflation but when they say there's a disconnect between the voter between the resident of the United States the citizen and the actual economy I don't think there is when on Election Day in 2020 I literally went out and took a photograph of how much gas was on that day it was a buck 89 for a gallon of gas and over the last couple of years it's gone as high as $4 doll every single of American puts gasoline in their car so when gas is twice as expensive they feel it in their wallet if you buy things like eggs they are twice as expensive so there's no disconnect that's real life when people go out this it's winter time here now and you can buy a bag of wood at the grocery store to put in your fireplace a year and a half ago or a winter of a year ago it was $5 a bag it is now $9 a bag so those are real numbers those are real hits on people and the reality is you've got an 81y old president who looks and acts every one of those 81 years he falls down on stage he looks lost on stage he does not look like he is in charge at a time when there is war raging in the Middle East there's war raging in Ukraine and Russia and NOP all issues that we're going to get on to all issues we're going to get on to but just allow me to let our point being I don't think Biden point being I don't think Biden is a viable candidate I think the Democrats know that your Democrat guest is gonna say stand by stand by for a moment because I do want to get back to arshad because I saw you shaking your head when Tim was suggesting that Michelle Obama might be put forward I'm sorry but this is absurd it's completely un serious that's not how any of this works I've actually been a delegate uh a number of times at the convention it just doesn't work like this Michelle Obama herself who's a vastly highly popular figure among Americans and particularly in the Democratic party has absolutely no interest in running for any office of any sort moreover you need to put together an entire campaign an entire infrastructure for any of this kind of stuff to work it doesn't happen in secret people would know so I'm sorry but this is uh be lovely I think Michelle Obama is lovely but that's a honey this point all right I mean at this point at this point you know we'll we'll have to wait to see what happen just very briefly Tim very briefly because I'd like to move on to another issue go on sure here's why it will work for Michelle Obama to run a campaign for nine months would not work she has a tendency to put her foot in her mouth even when she has the best of intentions however in this scenario the Democrat convention is late in August which leaves her only September and October before election day the first 30 days the American Media who loves Michelle Obama will Fawn all over her she will not have to do anything and then the last 30 days first of all she'll decline to debate Trump or whomever the nominee is because Trump for example this year refused to participate in the Republican debates so there's no problem there's no he has no uh legitimate argument when she says thank you but no thank you I'm not going to debate well I'm glad you're bring up last note last note instead she'll do a television special with Oprah and that will get huge ratings and American women and American minorities both key constituencies will absolutely love her this is all right we'll we'll have to wait to see what happens and we'll check in with both of you gentlemen at the time uh to see whether these predictions have come true but Thomas let me bring you in on the Republican side the expectation is that Trump is going to be victorious that's the expectation according to the polls as well but what we we see now is that his legal troubles are back at the Forefront and we also saw that recently the Colorado High Court ruled that Trump is ineligible to run again for president um first talk to us about what happened in Colorado and what does this disqualification mean for Trump going forward if anything at all well it was a 4-3 decision in Colorado essentially banning Donald Trump uh from being on the ballot Trump is going to appeal this to the Supreme Court and I think in all likelihood the Supreme Court is going to overrule that decision and that he will ultimately be on the ballot but I think uh from Trump's standpoint in terms of the campaign this was an early Christmas gift for him uh it was a present just like all the other indictments that uh have helped him and will continue to help him and Donald Trump is basically able to to frame this as yet another example of where uh the judicial system is being weaponized against him that he's the the victim that this is a hope folks um that this is a Witch Hunt uh Etc and we've seen his poll numbers of course uh increase every single time uh he has faced legal difficulties I don't think that this instance will be any different and I really do think that Donald Trump is going to be the runaway um nominee for the the Republican side he has a big lead in Iowa almost 30 percentage points we are seeing Nikki haey to an extent um reduce that margin in New Hampshire but I still think that she's just too far away uh from Donald Trump and especially given what we saw um over this last week it's only going to uh Shepherd him to the nomination Arad do you agree with this that this helps Trump uh when it comes to his run for presidency and also um what impact does uh all of this have on Independent voters I that's where the question really is first I'll say this I can agree that Donald Trump is a consumate grifter no matter what happens he's gonna find a way to raise money off of it that's exactly what he's been doing that's exactly what he'll continue to do regardless of the outcome of any of these sort of verdicts but to your second question what does this do for independent voters I agree the Supreme Court May well strike this down and Trump will appear on the ballots but the message this is reinforcing for independent voters people are potentially persuadable is this reinforces the fact that Donald Trump constantly gets himself into legal TR trouble and I don't mean small little legal trouble I mean defrauding denying and conspiring conspiring to overthrow the will of the people Americans these these prosecutions people forget that in order to get these prosecutions in order to get these indictments grand juries of everyday Americans people from all over and all different kinds of backgrounds in multiple jurisdictions have indicted Donald Trump on now over 90 different charges every time the Donald Trump goes to court sure he'll send out an email to raise money off of it but also it will remind voters that this man is unreliable unstable and does not respect the will of the people okay Tim um react to that and also tell us who's likely to challenge Trump in the primaries at least I mean there are a number of candidates but who's the most likely threat do you think sure the and just to to the last comment there the indictment doesn't mean anything that's not a charge of guilt that means there's there's a charge in the indictment process before a grand jury only one side is presented the prosecutor presents his side there is no defense whatsoever and the only question of the grand jury is do you have enough information that this should go to trial but they only hear one side of the story so an indictment means absolutely nothing and in the United States you are presumed innocent until you were found guilty in trial and trial so okay what about the other candidates on the other candidates I think what we'll keep an eye on is in Iowa even though he polls way ahead I don't know how much uh of a structure he has Iowa is a caucus instead of a primary meaning at a primary you go you vote you go back to work or you go home or at a caucus you stay there for hours and it's all about being organized but Iowa also has a long history of picking losers Ted Cruz won Iowa in 2016 Rick Santorum won in in 2012 you go all the way back to Reagan and George Bush beat Ronald Reagan in Iowa so Iowa it may create some momentum for someone but it is not the end all Beall what it will do if Trump wins that big if he wins by 40 points it continues the the uh feeling of inevitability uh Tom mentioned there there was a recent poll in New Hampshire that showed Nikki Haley within Striking Distance that that most recent poll and I think it was a Tipp poll I might be mistaken but a credible poll was had Trump at 33 Nikki Haley at 29 so I think the only place you're going to see a possibility is if she does well in New Hampshire South Carolina which is her home state is the third state in the process so then maybe you set up a little race but I think it's going to be awful tough for any of the other candidates to overcome the numbers we're seeing Tom what about the issues uh that are important for Americans I mean obviously the economies one we've already spoken about that but what other issues will will voters be taking into consideration when it comes to domestic uh us issues we'll get on to foreign policy in just a moment right well I think that the economy is front and center uh that's always going to be uh the case and if the economy is trending up of course that's going to help uh Joe Biden if it stays sort of at the the current level I think that this is good for the Republican nominee if that's Trump or or someone else immigration uh certainly is an issue I think that uh Republicans can make significant uh progress on in terms of uh challenging uh the administration also the abortion issue is one that um is kind of the gift that keeps on giving for Democrats we saw that particularly in uh 2022 midterms we saw that in the 2023 uh offe elections as well that's something that uh Republicans by and large have had difficulty grappling with but I ultimately think that if is it is Trump versus Biden and 2024 this election is going to be less about specific policy issues and more about just the personalities of these two individuals I think it will largely just be a referendum on uh Donald Trump typically we see referendums on the idual who's in the white house but Donald Trump just because of his outsized personality his polarized um status it's all going to be about you know do we want uh four more years of this individual or do we want kind of more of the same do we want the status quo okay Arad what about foreign policy issues I mean we know uh you know judging by uh past elections in history Americans don't vote on foreign policy issues when it comes to uh picking their presidents right but now with the Gaza war going on with the Ukraine War uh going on um with the you know competition for for China taking place with the US uh what's the is there a conversation on these issues happening right now amongst American voters I'll be honest I have to say that the conversation happening amongst American voters and the conversation that most politicians are happening do not line up particularly well including when it comes to the when it comes to the Middle East in Gaza in particular you have both the Democratic party and the Republican Party refusing to support a ceasefire in Gaza although most Americans almost two to one support a ceasefire so there are certainly conversations happening but this is one where both parties have really disconnected from the American people it's kind of a way of saying you know it's a it's really not a big alternative between the between the two parties there which is another way of saying that it's not really going to affect the election a great deal this is choice here's the thing Tim China China is a big one because China what happens with China affects the American economy um so we know that Republicans are arguing that China is a growing threat to the National Security of the US a threat to Us corporate interests as well as to taiwan's Independence and President Biden is saying that his administration wants to drisk and not decouple its relationship with China and to work to keep the competition between the world's number one and number two economic powers from escalating into a conflict is that going to resonate with voters Tim yeah you know it's one of those things where again I think it's a fuzz it's a blur it's uh somehow white noise when you talk to voters about that they know they go to the store or they go online and they purchase a product and there's a pretty good chance it might be made in China short of that the rest of it is white noise to them so Biden may have a message Trump may have a message but I don't think either one of them will spend a great deal of time talking about China and I I I I just I don't think that's something that's going to resonate with voters at all I do think the one bit of foreign policy that will resonate is particularly with Arab Americans and with Jewish Americans is the Gaza Strip and I I think Biden is being treated I'll say unfairly here because the Jewish community in the United States doesn't think he's being strong enough and the Arab Community feels totally abandoned so he could lose both sides because of the way that situation has been handled thus far by his administration right okay and just one final thought from all three gentlemen Thomas I'll start with you um are Americans excited by Trump versus Biden election I think it's the exact opposite of excitement uh and in fact I think it's dejection and just really just total uh just fatigue I I don't think that they want to see a rematch of 2020 and that's the big irony here which is that you have two of the primary uh candidates both of whom have poll numbers that are underwater um most people don't want Joe Biden most people want Donald Trump they want an alternative um but because of how our primary system works and how deference to the incumbent uh works in the White House this is the uh option that they're going to get but yeah I think it's you're hard pressed to find someone who thinks that this is the exact Arad do you think that voter apathy will play A Part if Americans are not excited about this election if it's if it is a Trump versus Biden one in 30 seconds please I know and I will say this I know for a fact that the Democratic party must work on voter apathy it can be a problem for us the one thing that I do know is that many voters are motivated to vote against Trump uh very clearly same as last time it is also important that the Democratic Party Works uh on its base to make sure that there is enthusiasm for Biden both these things need to be true all right Tim final word to you uh rasmon put out a poll that showed 61% of Americans 61% said they don't want to see that rematch so if you talk about apathy or frustration you have hit it on the nose I think this is an odd case where a third party candidate can't win the way the system is set up but could have an impact on the outcome if a third party get in there may be enough people that are so frustrated on both sides of the issue that they they go down that Center and that has an impact on who ultimately wins all right we'll have to see what happens for the time being thank you so much gentlemen for joining us Tim Constantine Thomas gift and Arad Hassan thanks for your time thanks for
