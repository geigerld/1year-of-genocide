as the war was still raging the Israeli bombardment intensified our home was flattened we were displaced to the UN run Alora school but even this was not spared it was constantly targeted and on the last occasion many people including my in-laws were killed we were forced to go to another school but there the sewage system flooded so it was impossible for us to stay it was also shelled several times with many civilians getting killed no place is safe in Gaza and we have nowhere to go we came to this deserted School building because there is nowhere else to go life must go on destruction is everywhere in Gaza every piece of Gaza is destroyed but we must find a way to live we hope this nightmare comes to an end my husband my little daughter and I have come here to try and find a way to survive my daughter's childhood like many others has been destroyed children are living in fear they've even lost the will to play I'm going through these ruins hoping I would find something a pan or a spoon or even a toy for my child not this destroyed school or any other place in Gaza is fit for living anymore look at us here it is true that this place is destroyed the cold weather will kill us outside but we must endure all these ruins and filth we're trying to take refuge from the Israeli bombardment we are tired and I fear for my child
