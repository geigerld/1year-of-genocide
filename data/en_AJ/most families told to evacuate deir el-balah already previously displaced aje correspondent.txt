hinda Al HRI joins us on the line now from Dar Al Bala in central Gaza where as he was saying 100,000 people have been displaced in the past 48 Hours tell us the situation that those families are facing now hind well medam the situation is devastating those families who were forced to evacuate their houses and the places they were in the eastern part of did not even have the time or the space to find another area to live in we're seeing people scattered on the streets on the sidewalks trying to protect their families and their children now most of those families were families who were already displaced from different parts of the CLE strip uh like the Northern parts or ra orun due to the continuous evacuation orders now these people do not have any shelter some people are also still trapped in the eastern part of D because they were unable to evacuate because the Israeli forces artillery shelling and air strike started shooting at those Palestinians now we're talking about at least 100,000 citizens are displaced and not only displaced they're homeless without any shelters everywhere is crowded is a very small City it's a couple of neighborhoods only and we're talking about more than a million according to unaa of this size Palestinians now makeshift camps are completely packed with people even the beach people were setting up their tents there un schools are packed un facilities are packed and also hospitals are packed with those Palestinians some people unfortunately did not even have a space to set up their tents and there's an obvious state of panic in fear of and frustration among those families because they believe that even if they evacuate to the humanitarian Zone which is shrinking with every evacuation order there's no guarantee that they won't be targeted and also let me add that there has been new evacuations earlier today from Al maazi uh from Al area and more parts of and and this is adding more misery to the Palestinians the most um people who are struggling are families with children uh and and kids because they could not protect uh their children even not even able to find a tent or space for a tent and not only that we're talking about an area with Z resources and they do not even have the bare minimum of their needs and requirements Gaza was already struggling with starvation hunger malnutrition and now the UN is saying that more than a million people might not receive any humanitarian food Aid this month what could that mean for everyone but particularly the vulnerable and Children Well it obviously means that people will not have food because people completely rely on food distance from humanitarian organizations and most of these humanitarian organizations have their warehouses in the danger zone and they're unable to go and take that food from those warehouses and also there has been no safe access to those humanitarian to go to such areas not only that today earlier today a worker humanitarian worker from the world Central Kitchen was injured and this is not the first time a humanitarian has been injured or killed by the Israeli forces during this this war now this would complet completely affect families and it's not only malnutrition and starvation it's also the polio that the World Health Organization is trying to uh make a campaign to vaccinate all of these children the situation is very very devastating every single hour and obviously Palestinians are very eager and waiting for any life of a Seas fire deal to end all of this Devastation okay thank you very much hind alri reporting to us from Dar Al Bala in central Gaza Maran we've spoken numerous times about the the obstacles to reaching a Seas fire but is the real sticking point who gets to control Gaza at the end of this well I think the main obstacle yes in so many words it is uh netanyahu's uh recent or latest insistence of maintaining Israeli military in Gaza after the ceasefire if we could just kind of reduce all the points that we've been mentioning that would be it in the end of May through July 2nd the understanding was that there is this three-phase ceasefire and there's this exchange and and those guarantees and so on so forth but essentially that Israel would be leaving Gaza right but since the invasion of Rafa in the southern part of Gaza and the destruction of the Rafa Crossing and the deployment of Israeli troops in the Philadelphia Corridor in the southern part of Gaza and making some sort of a corridor in the middle part of Gaza soal Narin now Netanyahu says no I'm not going to give up all these points I'm going to maintain them which is inconsistent with Biden's uh original proposal it's consistent with the understandings with the mediator and so on so forth some in the United States of the likes of blinkin are sneakily trying to make this a kind of a bridging proposal inserting netanyahu's uh most recent demands that's not going to work Hamas the Palestinians and even the mediators are not going to accept Israel to directly reoccupy Gaz by having troops deployed in various parts of it but of course as we have seen through the course of this war and before actually I suppose since the the The Siege imposed on Gaza since 2007 now the Israeli Army has deepened its control of Gaza and that's what is going on today in terms of the bargaining chip right the infamous uh term using uh civilians as human shield that's exactly what Israel is doing today I mean everything that it accuses Hamas of it's doing today and worse it's actually killing dozens upon dozens of people every day causing harm tormenting torturing terrorizing the population each and every day in order to extract concessions from Hamas this is by definition terrorism right by definition using civilians harming them threatening to harm them for political ends this is Terrorism Israel is practicing State terrorism against the Palestinians in order to get some get some concessions from Hamas and from the mediators it's not working it has not worked but it maintains that because it thinks time is on its side unfortunately for all of us including for Israelis most of whom do support the original deal this could actually now turn into a wider War we are at a faithful Crossroad either we turn to a ceasefire in the next few days that opens the way for a number of scenarios including the implementation of three phases and eventually if the Americans get their way some kind of a normalization some sort of a stability like it or hate it but there is some kind of a program otherwise we can have a wide Regional War right we will have a more escalation of violence in Gaza on the on Lebanon and potentially throughout the region because Israel does not have an alternative strategy there is no exit plan for Israel for naano in Gaza everything has been said is humbur there is no exit plan because imagine past next week that there is no ceasefire then what it could only be escalation of war and regionalization of war and implicating at the United States of War which absolutely is by definition a threat to International Peace and security this is the crossroad we're at and there's this is a this is the choice time do the Israelis choose and the Americans choose ceasefire and Paving way for some kind of RIS fight and eventually perhaps stability or arag and Maran just briefly is uh is Washington harming The Diplomatic process well Washington certainly by providing Israel $20 billion of arms in advance it's exactly like uh a drug dealer uh providing drugs to a drug addict hoping things will get better Israel is addicted to violence it's addicted to occupation it's addicted to colonialization it's addicted to killing and destuction in Gaza and the rest of Palestine providing them with 20 billions of dollars as we having negotiation under way is the worst way to approach the state but the United States does not exactly very smart about this right the special relationship is very weird it's almost you know masochistic from on the the American side instead of making it conditional that we will provide you arms if you do 1 2 3 4 they provide the arms in advance and then there start pleading with the Israelis they start being humiliated by the Israelis this is of course a subject for another day this very misunderstood so-called special relationship between the United States and Israel but be that as it may Biden has acted foolishly he has acted shortsightedly and secretary blinkin in a sneaky kind of way has been selling the Israeli plan uh as if it was the solution we are stuck with that unfortunately there is no other sponsor of a diplomatic process but the Americans okay well thank you for now aler senior
