in the search for one of the rarest and most valuable Commodities in Gaza clean drinking water it's children who are carrying most of the burden it's backbreaking work but with much of the infrastructure here destroyed by Israel's bombing this is one of the only ways to get water from A to B we desperately need water to drink and to maintain basic hygiene as you can see we don't have enough water to wash our dishes properly we are using sand to try to sanitize them but it's not enough cooking utensils are also contaminated with sand residue making it difficult to prepare food safely the United Nations estimates the average Palestinian in Gaza is surviving on 3 lers of water per day for all their needs that's well below its emergency standard of 15 L that water is also salty and contaminated with as much as 70% of the population drinking straight from polluted Wells we're treating salty water for drinking purposes we actually pay cash for it and store it in large containers and then distribute it to the people we appeal to donors to help us buy water even if it's salty just provide us with water not enough water means unsafe hygiene practices which help the spread of diseases and across Gaza attempts to repair the water supply network are held up because Israel isn't letting in new pipes it says they could be used as Weapons 92% of water and sanitation infrastructure has been completely obliterated here in canun the lack of electricity has worsened the crisis with generators completely destroyed untreated sewage overflows into streets and the Sea leeching into groundwater and Wells contaminating the water system potentially for generations to come Bernard Smith Al jazer make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
