Israeli president Isaac herzo says his country is ready for a second humanitarian pause in Gaza in order to secure the release of more Israeli captives I can reiterate the fact that Israel is ready for another humanitarian pores and additional humanitarian Aid in order to enable the release of hostages and the the responsibility lies fully with sinir and the leadership of Hamas Hamas has issued a statement saying it affirms its position of categorically rejecting any forms of negotiations about prisoner exchange under the continuing Israeli genocidal War however it says we are open to any initiative that contributes to ending the aggression and opening The Crossings to bring in Aid and provide relief to the Palestinian people let's bring in our correspondent Bernard Smith he's joining us live from Tel Aviv and Bernard Hero's indicated Israel's ready to negotiate as prime minister Netanyahu set to meet families of captives yeah it's a significant statement from herzo the first really sort of public indication that momentum is moving towards uh the idea of some sort of pause or ceasefire the question will be whether it is just that a pause a humanitarian pause as the Israelis would call it or a full ceasefire and Netanyahu is meeting about between 15 and 19 19 families later this evening here in Tel Aviv families of captives they say they asked for this meeting a week ago and they've only just got it now and they asked for it a week ago that was before those three captives were shot dead accidentally by two Israeli soldiers so momentum does seem to be moving um that way we've also we also know there's been meetings between the ceries the Israelis and the Americans in a couple of meetings in Europe uh since Friday and on Monday and we understand that there's going to be a meeting in Cairo in the coming days with Hamas representatives and that'll be the first time there's been that sort of a meeting since uh the collapse of the first Seas fire more than a couple of weeks ago yes so the families have kep of certainly keeping up the pressure on the Israeli government meanwhile the Israeli economy is taking a beating burnard because of the war 600 workers from the Israeli Airport Authority have been put on unpaid what impact is this having on people's lives there yeah and there's a thousand airport workers are on 75% of their reduced have their pay reduced I'm Sorry by 75% and a thousand jobs that had been held by reservists who are now fighting in Gaza those jobs are not going to be filled uh because people are not traveling to Israel and the airport is struggling uh because there's no Capac because there's no people people are not not coming to the country I think there's about 100 flights a day instead of 500 left hands Austrian Airlines and swiss I say they'll resume flights on the 8th of January but only at 30% capacity because there isn't the traffic and the airports are hoping other people other airlines excuse me will res will resume but there's a significant impact on the economy about 5% of the of of Israel's GDP comes from Aviation and tourists coming into the country all right Bernard thank you very much for that that's Bernard Smith live in Tel Aviv
