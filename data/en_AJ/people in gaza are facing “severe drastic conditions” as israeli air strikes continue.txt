meanwhile Pope Francis has called for an end to the attacks and violence in Israel in an address to the crowd at St Peters Square he expressed his solidarity with the victims the head of the Catholic Church said fighting will not solve any problems let the attacks and weapons cease please because it must be understood that terrorism and War bring no Solutions but only the death and suffering of many innocent lives war is a defeat every war is a defeat let us pray for peace in Israel and Palestine and this was the scene in Istanbul where thousands of people marched to show their support for Palestinian Fighters many also waved Palestinian Flags en chanted slogans in support of Hamas Turkish president Reb typ erdogan is urging both sides to deescalate tensions on behalf of Tura and in light of this morning's event in Israel we invite all parties to act reasonably and to stay away from impulsive steps that raise tensions rallies were also held in Yemen's Capital sa people celebrated what's been called by Hamas as the al- AXA flood military operation for more analysis now let's bring in reat Aller he's a writer and educator who's in Gaza reat thanks so much for being on this newsour what's the situation where you are it's heading into the evening in Gaza and so how are you preparing for another night of strikes thank you thank you for having me the night is usually the most horrific part of the day uh it's when Israel intensifies and terrorizes and bombs with uh missiles unprecedented unexperienced before in the Gaza STP because the whole building shakes the little kids wake up shrieking the even the the Young people wake up uh crying and and screaming Israel has targeted uh so many Palestinian businesses so many Palestinian residential buildings Israel has destroyed uh homes on the heads of the Dwellers as they slept we talk about so many Palestinian families beded uh the the Shabbat family the Shaban family the abaga family most of them are kids in Gaza there are uh almost 1 million Palestinian children uh almost 50% of the population of Gaza is uh children so in the Shabbat family nine out of 18 family members were children Israel annihilated uh uh three generations in just one American made bomb we have we barely have any electricity we are working on batteries now the internet is getting weaker and weaker uh uh many families lost their uh their source of water uh there is more than 50% po poverty and unemployment in in Gaza meaning most Palestinians in Gaza depend on day today uh kind of of work to put food on the table those people are going to be to be to be starving it's complete and ATT Terror unprecedented and Palestinians in Gaza are bracing for the worst because Israeli genocidal Maniacs are calling all over the Internet and sadly even on Al jazer and other uh mainam media is calling uh uh for genocide against Palestinian and Gaza justifying I I'm sorry to interrupt you sir I just have many questions to ask and we're running short of time uh the knesset has officially declared war what's your reaction to that does that change anything for you living in Gaza it does not because more than 100 years ago the British helped the zionists uh uh uh on Palestine they disposessed and displaced Palestinians until the establishment of Israel more than 75 years ago so from 1917 Palestine Palestinians have been uh uh brutalized attacked uh disp displaced massacred annihilated ethnically cleansed by uh European uh colonialists whether in the form of British soldiers or Zionist Jewish Jewish so soldiers but what is coming what Israel is preparing is going to be a lot worse unprecedented we speak we are expecting so far and again this is a number you didn't get although you got the Israeli number uh figure uh almost accurately uh Palestinian sources talk 370 Palestinians massacred murdered many of of of of whom are are children some of whom were killed in their in their homes and the number is increasing yes and there are a number of Civilian casualties on both sides rat I do have to mention that and there is a historical context that must be considered my question to you is why are you staying why have you not left Gaza given the situation where where should we go to to to drown to commit suicide mass suicide so the zionists are happy and cheer that they sped themselves our blood there's no way out pal gazans in Palestinians in Gaza live in an open air prison the borders are closed the air is closed Israel destroyed the only airport we had the sea is also closed there are more than two 2 million Palestinians in Gaza Israel asks Palestinians to move to the city centers and then Israel bombs the city centers Israel asks Palestinians to move to to to schools to you unun schools and then Israel bombs these schools it did this in 2014 and did this in 2021 and last night Israel bombed a un school that was a potential shelter for Palestinians Israel itself forcibly moved by bom bombing banon and shij and other areas in Gaza so there is no way out there is no way for Palestinians to to go and we are bracing for the the the worst horrible massacres and genocide that is going to be taking place in the area and it's going to be uh if we have electricity it's going to be live on to on TV and the world the West Germany America England France everybody is support even Ukraine supporting Israel and saying we we ready to send Israel money and and weapons America is sending 8 billion dollar and and Palestinians just have to to wait only because Palestinians are darker in in skin color because we not we have to we have to leave it there sir I'm sorry we do have to move on but we appreciate your insights and stay safe which you'll know about no doubt be another tense night ahead thank you so much thank you thank you for having me
