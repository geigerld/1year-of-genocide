William du is the director of un's Washington office he joins us from Washington DC thanks very much for joining us in Al jazer six members of unra have been killed in the strike it's the highest death toll in in one single incident of un staff how does unra continue to operate when it appears its own staff are not safe uh thanks for the opportunity to join you and uh yet again uh we see a conflict where there seems to be absolutely no bottom to it uh six Co six colleagues lost today that brings the death toll just among UNR staff uh in this conflict to 220 which is uh the highest ever in United Nations history uh our staff is as you while you noted that no place is safe in Gaza our staff are on the front lines and they're not going to back down they're not going to stop doing their job but you are absolutely correct that nowhere in Gaza is safe right now the UN says it it shared information with Israel that the school was being used as a shelter more than 12,000 people there why then does Israel still Target the location is that Intelligence being used against the UN and against people seeking shelter there well this is certainly and sadly not a unique situation uh a total of 109 90 of unres installations have been damaged that includes 128 of our school Sheltering uh internally displaced people uh many of them hit more than once uh you are correct the United Nations provides the Israelis with GPS data on where every location uh all of our locations and in fact uh to dispel another rumor the UN just doesn't get up one in the morning and decide to drive somewhere in Gaza every one of those movements is coordinated with the Israeli Defense Force and as you saw on Monday uh a un Convoy that was going to vaccinate children in the north of Gaza against polio was stopped for eight hours and included a very significant damage from bulldozers to our uh Convoy you're also appealing for schools not to be used as military targets yet it still happens you've also mentioned more than 200 staff being killed over uh throughout this period the war on Gaza this once again is a flagrant disregard of international law but it seems very little can be done to stop it uh at the moment uh I I would have to agree with you uh in fact the commissioner General uh phelip lazarini just noted that frankly the longer the seeming impunity prevails over these uh incidents at uh displac shelters uh the more International humanitarian law and the more the Geneva conventions will become irrelevant and and this is not just this is not going to be uh a situation that is just going to be restricted to Gaza the world is watching to see what they can get away with to explain why the convention for example becomes irrelevant to explain why law is is not being adhere to this is the fifth time the school's been targeted and we've heard many a time and you've said it again tonight there is no safe space or place for people in Gaza what are people there continuing to face well again 128 of our schools have been hit at least once most of them more than once that's 70% of the schools that we uh in the UNR school system in Gaza uh you know International humanitarian law is quite clear that you have to protect these people uh but it just it is being completely ignored in this instance and again the fear is not just about what's going on in Gaza but that bad actors throughout the world are watching and and waiting to see the reaction to this right William D the director of J Washington office thank you very much for joining us this evening and explaining us explaining to us the situation in Gaza of after the news that six of your colleagues were killed in that strike make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
