negotiations towards a ceasefire in Gaza are expected to resume in Egypt later on Sunday Israel has confirmed its security and intelligence Chiefs are part of the discussions but Hamas says it isn't sending a delegation to Cairo demonstrators are gathering in the coming hours in front of the Israeli parliament in West Jerusalem they're launching a three-day protest calling for prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign they follow similar protests in Tel Aviv on Saturday the families of captives being held in Gaza are among the thousands who gathered there accusing him of abandoning their loved ones let's bring in our senior political analyst Maran bishara we'll start with the with the ceasefire negotiations that are to resume in Cairo on Sunday why do you think Hamas isn't sending a delegation Marwan of course it remains to be seen exactly we'll wait to hear from them but I think uh they have found so far the negotiations to be fruitless because whenever they come back with suggestions or some form of compromises the Israelis have been rejected in them as um absurd or unrealistic or some other words uh just to show um you know sort of a despise for whatever Hamas is coming up with in the end of the day I think the main differences have been for quite some time now since I would say since Christmas and now we're in Easter is that Hamas once this wherever the negotiations are and wherever the temporary is that it leads to a permanent ceasefire just like the United Nations security Council has suggested or demanded two they want the people in Gaza who are displaced today to go back to their homes in the north which again you know it's the most humanitarian and and normal thing to do and third they want the Israelis to stop pulling out right eventually right now they the Hamas has given in on the timeline on on on the calendar when exactly these things will happen but eventually they're going to have to happen I mean that the Israelis needs to give some sort of guarantees or assurances otherwise what is being proposed is that they will be opposing in ceasefire for about few days or few weeks to be resumed with major attack on Rafa and the rest of Southern Gaza and that's not acceptable yeah there was a time you know you were saying that Hamas knows that they have been fruitless recently the negotiations there was a time last year when ceasefire negotiations were successful what's changed since then well d has passed and time continues to pass and apparently more captives are dying and I think uh the mere appearances that there are some serious negotiations going on buys Israel time right and and provides this image that Israel is serious about a ceasefire when fact it's not serious about ceasefire the war cabinet uh the security cabinet continuously talks about the need to defeat Hamas continue with the War uh hit Gaza and so on so forth while the negotiations going on and being reported on as if they are the real story they are not they are the Side Story they are the deflection from the rear from the reality on the ground you and I have been talking for six months I have been skeptical now for five months of them about the idea of ceasefire because it's clear that Israel might want to pose for a few days maybe a couple of weeks but not more than that yeah they've been saying so but the United States and the mediators are interested really interested in apparently in getting some kind of a pause leading to another pause leading eventually to a permanent ceasefire but Israel is but how do you overcome the differences when one party wants the destruction of the other the complete destruction of the other absolutely and that's what Hamas has concluded apparently but you might still see them go back to the negotiations because there's a lot of pressure on them I mean there aren't that many places now for for them to go and to start talking about uh making life a bit easier a bit less intolerable for the people in Gaza they need to do that because they have responsibility you know with the people in Gaza now the Americans have been serious about trying to wind down the war not end it wind it down change the tactics and reach some kind of a temporary settlement so that captives are released yeah and so that the humanitarian assistance reaches some people so that they are playing some sort of a productive role so the Americans are trying to bridge the idea of a temporary pose or temporary ceasefire or truce into a more permanent one and how they are doing it this is the most important of all of we're watching that's why what happens in Washington is just as important of what happens in K because they want to find some kind of formulation where Arabs get involved where the Palestinian Authority gets involved where Hamas is sidelined completely so that they start talking about the day after yeah but at what point do you think that the Americans I'm not going to ask at what point are they going to put any real pressure but how does Israel's plans for Rafa how do they factor in into the kind of pressure the Americans put on Israel at the moment I think the negotiations offer ra between the Americans and the Israelis and if you pay attention all the real negotiations in this region happened between Israelis and Americans not Americans and Arabs or Israelis and Arabs and but there doesn't seem to be much of a negotiation between the Americans and the Israelis over how to do ra yes there is over how over how to bomb RAF there is like you bomb it this way or that way you kill that many people or that many people you kill that many people over that much time so this is the negotiations right how do you make genocide Humane how do you make war crimes a bit less criminal in the eyes of the world how do you execute a war war with killing a bit few civilians making Israel a bit more acceptable to its future Partners whether it's Saudi Arabia and others so the Americans are trying to weigh in and say the way you meaning the Israelis are conducting this war it is shortsighted you might win militarily against rafah but you will lose strategically in Palestine and in the Middle East they will be far more recruits available for Hamas Hamas will not be defeated because you invaded Rafa or killed tens of thousands or more people you need to find another way of doing it and we meaning the Americans are proposing bringing the Arabs in bringing the Palestinian Authority in bringing itself in to weigh in heavily on this but the Israelis are not listening thus far yeah I mean that's a completely separate conversation that the rest of the world is trying to have with Israel the conversation between the Americans and the Israelis mwan thank you as always for your analysis that is our senior political analyst Maran bashara
