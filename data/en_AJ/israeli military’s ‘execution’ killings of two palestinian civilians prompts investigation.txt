now the Israeli military police unit says it's investigating the deaths of two Palestinians in the occupied West Bank after an Israeli Rights group accused the army of conducting illegal executions the bed selum group posted this video said to show Israeli military vehicles following a group of Palestinians during a raid in the Farah Camp last Friday for more on this let's speak to Charles Stratford he's in Janine in the occupied West Bank so first of all let's start with this video what do we know about what happened to those two well certainly the video evidence is is quite strong Samy um this has been released by yes the Israeli Rights group b Sim they say the incident happened on December the eth and what you're looking at here is um Israeli military Jeep pursuing a a group of men in what seems to be a courtyard um B selum say that uh the first victim you see there a 25-year-old Ramy junab now he apparently was holding something that it's believed the Israeli Army suspected could well have been an explosive device he's shot he falls to the ground um he's then seen lifting his arm um and then there are the Jeep approaches closer to him and more shots ring out it's believed he was shot by possibly two soldiers in that jeep and he was left for dead um and he died yesterday of those injuries now the second part of this video shows um another member of that group a man called th Shaheen 36y old who apparently was unarmed who you see hiding under a parked vehicle a white parked vehicle there now Israeli soldiers approach and he is shot dead too as we've seen in previous incidents as well where something like this has been caught on video what's interesting is we've see the Israeli military or a soldier get out of the vehicle and take photographs of um at least one of the men that were shot so yes as you rightly say on the basis of this investig of this this incident and this evidence that is being put forward by B selin the Israeli military police are saying they have launched an investigation um into it uh and the evidence uh the the results of this investigation will be given to a military prosecutor but it's really important to recognize here that in terms of the level of convictions in terms of soldiers being called to account and actually being punished for incidents like this they are very very rare indeed it's it's usually incidents like this that are caught on camera and then are given to as I say respected human rights organizations like bet selim that put these forward to the Israeli military they say that this investigation is going to be launched and potentially somebody will held to account but convictions are exceptionally rare I mean you only have to look for example at say the the sheer amount of of miners um and children that have been killed since the beginning of the war here in the occupied West Bank in these daily nightly raids um in various cities towns and villages in the occupied territories I mean I I think back for example to the case of 8-year-old Ahmed El Gul who was shot from around 50 M away in the back of the head died immediately his friend belal who was 15 this was in Janine I suppose about 2 and a half weeks ago um was was shot and killed as well again you see an Israeli soldier get out of the vehicle and actually take a photograph of one of these kids it was actually 15-year-old Bal who was who was photographed now this is all on on camera this is all on CCTV it's very strong evidence indeed of a assassinations in in this case miners the most recent case the B selim obviously this is a 25 and and a 36 year old man but the 36-year old man is unequivocally unarmed so yes despite this investigation being launched according to Israeli military police on the basis of this very strong evidence it is safe to say that the chances of a conviction remain very very rare indeed all right we'll leave it there thanks so much Bernard Smith
