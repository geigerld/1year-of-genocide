well gaza's health Ministry spokesman provided this update on the situation at the Indonesian Hospital electromechanical Systems have stopped working in all Hospital departments including ventilation and air conditioning systems in operating rooms and intensive care units the only oxygen station in the hospital has stopped and we are now relying on the available oxygen cylinders as an alternative Source the electric power supply has been cut out replacing it with manual lighting mechanisms and other available mechanisms refrigerators for storing dead bodies have stopped working well I'm joined on the phone now by safwat Al calut he's in Gaza safwat said just how bad is the situation now at these hospitals I mean healthc care services are collapsing right across Gaza look the Ministry of Health they said earlier that uh the the main generator in uh the Indonesian Hospital stopped and now they are working on uh a small one just for lighting and small uh or light uses including lighting and ventilation uh they also added that tens of medical centers uh and hospitals are out of services all over the Gaza since they are unreachable or even destroyed during the Israeli War and bombardment all over the G again so mostly because of the intensified air strike in the north and in Gaza City the main two Hospital remaining there shifa hospital and Indonesia are the most affected hospitals in in the G strip the uh the most significant appeal that they launched yesterday it was besides uh asking or looking for fuel to keep the generators operating is the opening of Rafa High Crossing the health system is unable completely to deal with the casualties the wounded people who have been arriving arriving to the hospital they are facing new and serious injuries including Burns and cuts uh in different parts of the body so we saw pictures of uh of wounded people arriving to the hospital with Burns and with cuts and the this this medical the medical uh uh system in Gaza is not prepared for such a large number and different uh wounds that they have been seeing since the beginning of of the the war so yesterday they sent 70 to Egypt uh but still this this number is very limited in comparison with the big number that needs urgent evacuation to the to Egypt safat and what's the latest then at the jabalia refugee camp I mean many people are still bu carried under the rubble there yes again the minister of Health says that after the two uh massacr in jabalia which and one day separated between the the first and the second one they speak about 1,000 Palestinian between killed wounded and missing under the under the reubel uh many families I I am from jabalia my family is still in jabalia and they told me that many people are still digging manually using simple machines uh they hope to find uh the bodies it's not even now there's they lost the hope to find them alive but at least the bodies of theirs under the rubble still this is the case in in many places all over the G strip the people are still especially those who couldn't find their the bodies of there still digging and go from every every now and then to find and look for parts of the bodies of theirs to recognize uh to recognize them or to bury them if they are lucky as they they say all right safat alut they're live for us in Gaza safwat thank you well the Israeli Army is indiscriminate bombing of Gaza has killed thousands of children according to the Palestinian health authority 3,650 have been killed over the last 25 days that means six children lose their lives every hour that's one every 10 minutes among them are toddlers And newborns well earlier I spoke to Dr Sanaya senanayaka from the Australian National University I asked him what the impact will be for hospitals potentially losing power it's a very serious problem so as you say it's good that they have a backup generator but if you don't have fuel to run that backup generator that backup generator will stop working and there are a number of consequences of this first of all the most obvious ones are people who are on life support life saving machines such as artificial ventilators those ventilators could stop working now if this happens uh in a situation where it may take an hour or two hours to fix the problem then artificial ventilation can be performed on those patients but if it has to be for 24 48 hours that becomes unrealistic and those patients can't be ventilated so and even if the generators come back it may not start these ventil may not start working immediately so all those few minutes can be the difference between life and death also just simple things so patients in a bed on a ward will often have a little buzzer where they can call the nurse now it might be for something very simple like they need a paracetamol tablet for a bit of a headache but they could be uh feeling uh very sick having a gastrointestinal bleed or about to collapse or faint and those can be missed yeah and many of these hospitals San in Gaza serve a dual function don't they I mean not only do they provide levels of critical care as you've just described but they also provide shelter for thousands of displace Palestinians from the Israeli bombardment no no exactly and uh once those places places can't be used where do these people go so it's terrible and of course the the other thing as well uh going back to what we first talked about with generators not working fridges where medications and vaccines are stored may stop working and in a war zone where people are getting serious cuts and lacerations if the tetanus vaccines aren't up to date they don't get a tetanus shot they could get tetanus and in this day and age Daren you don't want to see anyone getting tetanus
