the Qatar economic forum is getting underway here in Doha Global business and government leaders are discussing economic challenges and opportunities aljaz Osama bin Javed is at the Forum in Doha Osama one of the points of focus here one of the areas of emphasis has so far been the war in Gaza well as the elephant in the room that as soon as you start talking about economy uh about investment about this General state of being for various in this region you have to talk about Gaz you have to talk about the situation that is happening and here especially in this country has been playing a crucial role in trying to bring the science together to find some sort of a solution where there can be a ceasefire there can be Aid that can be allowed in and obviously the release of captives and here in the opening session of the economic Forum the Prime Minister abani talked about not just the efforts that is putting itself in the middle of but also how important it is for countries to come to some sort of solution but there seems to be a stal it especially on the Israeli side of things as they keep going back and forth and trying to put proposals on the table and they keep being rejected by Israel when there are two parties want to agree on something you need to agree on on the Baseline first of all and I believe that what we are seeing there is a fundamental difference between the two parties there is one party who wants to end the war and then talk about the hostages there is another party who wants the hostages and who wants and wants to continue the war and as long as there is no any commonality between those two things it won't get us to a result Osama beyond the issue of Gaza what else are participants talking about well it is going to be a general taking stock of the economy not just here in this country but across the region You' got hundreds of delegates and uh world leaders here who are talking about not just uh conflict but also investments into energy into technology into how the transformation of blockchain technology is taking shape and the kis have said that they're trying to invest about A9 billion fund into digital transformation so there's a lot of money involved there's a lot of uh in investment and future of economies involved here that it is going to be discussed deliberated world leaders Business Leaders they're all going to be talking about a solution or a multiple range of solutions going forward uh making sure that young people are employed there is enough capital in the markets and their economies continue to go towards the green rather than faltering on all of the geopolitical issues that we've been seeing in the last few months okay Osama bade reporting from Doha thank you very much make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
