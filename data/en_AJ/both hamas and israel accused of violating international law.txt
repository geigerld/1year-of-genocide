both Israel and Hamas have been accused of violating International humanitarian law with their attacks on civilians Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on crowded residential areas of Gaza flattening entire neighborhoods these indiscriminate attacks on civilians are in violation of article 25 of the ha conventions a series of international treaties legal experts say that the intentional targeting of civilians by both Hamas and Israel also constitutes a war crime as since Hamas launched its military operation last Saturday killing 1300 Israelis the Israel military has imposed a total Siege on Gaza which had already been under a Land Air and sea blockade for the past 16 years Palestinians and Aid workers say that the lack of food medicine Fuel and basic supplies has made the situation in the Gaza Strip quote catastrophic at least 28 healthcare workers in Gaza have been directly targeted by Israeli strikes and then there's the evacuation order for hospitals in Northern Gaza the World Health Organization says that it's a quote death sentence for more than 2,000 vulnerable people including newborn babies and patients in intensive care Palestinians in Gaza describe the forced evacuation order in the North and the Relentless bombardment as quote Collective punishment and under the Fourth Geneva Convention Israel as the occupying power here is prohibited from deporting or transferring parts of the population from the land that it occupies all right let's bring in uh franches albanesi you are the United Nations special reporter on occupied Palestinian territory you're joining us from lisia tur in Italy you have said quote that Israel has already carried out Mass ethnic cleansing of Palestinians and is again quote again in the name of self-defense seeking to justify what would amount to ethnic cleansing do you feel that that message your message is being heard within the United Nations uh hi seral thanks for having me I I don't know I don't have uh the any sign that this is being considered at the UN level at the UN at the level of the security Council and the Secretary General I've been calling desperately for an immediate CIS fire because this is this is what is needed right now um no one questions that Israel has been severely hit by crimes that are my amount to atrocity crimes by what is being conducted by Hamas on the 7th of October and since the 7th of October there is an investigation ongoing by the commission of inquiry uh appointed in 2021 by the Human Rights Council and there is also an investigation being carried out by the uh international criminal court of which we we know nothing but at the same time what's happening what I see happening and I want to recall that before being the special reporter I've been known as a scholar uh studying the the M Force displacement of Palestinians since 1947 what I see is that there are there is once again an instance where Israel is ordering large this is the largest number of Palestinians in Gaza ever being ordered to uh to vacate an area and under the fog of War have already seen forceable transfer happening in 1947 49 in 1967 and this has been and this is happening I mean this risk to happen now even others like NRC the Norwegian Refugee Council has talked of it has warned against the risk of a humanitarian ethnic cleansing so you called for an immediate ceasefire to avoid exactly that now I looked and I can't find a similar call an identical call by the UN Secretary General does that trouble you it does do you want to elaborate on that because of course of course it does because it there is a what we have right now it's on the one hand Israeli officials saying that they what they want is to uh eliminate uh Hamas Hamas uh um militants destroy Hamas which might I mean which might be a a legitimate military Target but what we see on the ground so far is that um two 2,400 people have been killed among whom 500 children 10,000 people have been injured there have been there has been a severe bombing and targeted strikes with a huge number of missiles resulting into widespread indiscriminate destruction of Civilian homes roads shops clinics and other essential infrastructure there is a a Siege over over a Siege because there is no water no electricity and no food entering Gaza while the existing depleted infrastructure because as you rightly call recalled at the beginning Gaza has already been under uh 16 year of full Siege and let's not forget it has already s suffered five of these massive Wars and now Israel is also targeting entire civilian neighborhoods damaging hospitals schools and including targeting ambulances clinics and medical personnel so how can these on Earth being considered proportional without any respect for precaution and the principle of distinctions so this must stop you know this is interesting because you are the person at the United Nations who is tasked with looking at and assessing uh the human rights of Palestinians in occupied Palestinian territories you're saying that we're in danger of mass ethnic cleansing you're saying that mass ethnic cleansing has already occurred in the past and you're calling for a ceasefire and you feel that your calls are not being heard within your own organization so the question is how would you assess the un's response so far now you know it's interesting because the reason why I refer to uh ethnic cleansing repeating its history repeating itself is precisely after I saw NRC talking of um humanitarian uh ethnic cleansing because indeed what is some Israeli officials are saying is that the the the Palestinians have to move South South where the the the the Gaza Strip is sealed off they want them to move to to the Sinai where they will be provided assistance um and this is what has happened since 1947 1949 so you know I mean I've been the one ping for humanitarian Ian corridors together with other 33 or 34 special repur it's a huge number and I've been told look this is the from Palestinians in Gaza till they had electricity to communicate with me uh human rights organization saying look this is the last bit of Palestine that remains to us this has nothing to do with AAS we don't want to enter a new page of refugee Hood why can't humanitarian corridors being open to the West Bank for example or to the South siai because this these people are civilians so this is what we have to uh think of and yes I'm very concerned that I don't see I can't hear anyone in the United Nations calling for an immediate ceasefire and also Israel should provide a an idea not to the public but at least to the United Nations on how the dismantlement of Hamas uh is to happen or it's happening because what we see now it's a massive operation which has killed already too many civilians Franchesca albanesi United Nations special raor on the occupied Palestinian territories thank you for joining us on the program today
