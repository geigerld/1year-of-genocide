for that for now that is saharat live in Tel Aviv and we can now speak to Madan bishara he is alaz senior political analyst Madan what do you make of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu the other men that we were hearing from the defense minister Minister Benny Gans all saying that the ceasefire could continue they would like the ceasefire to continue but so must the war yeah absolutely because you know as we been saying earlier you you put a pose to a video game you don't put a pose to a genocide and clearly they are genocidal in their War so they have kept on saying again and again and again especially Minister of Defense Galant that uh don't ever get the impression that we're going to stop we're just going to continue with the war as soon as this is over we will continue we know our objectives and so on so forth so this was a continuous justification of why this should not be misunderstood as weakness MH that in fact uh they are strong and they are doing great in the war they are achieving their objective and they will continue to do so after uh the pause is ended now you know to my mind because uh I'm not sure how many times we broadcasted any such press conferences but I've been watching this over many weeks now in on Israeli television and uh I can't tell you how much this is a repetition of more of the same it was incredibly repetitive wasn't it and I was was wondering why did they bring up all three men to say the same thing over and over again not only did they repeat what they themselves said but then another one would come on and repeat what the man before him had said and imagine that this has been happening day after day or every other day the past month and a half except the only difference today is that gun decided to show up in blue in Black otherwise this has been the same picture of all three men pretending to be all in agreement pretending to have Harmony among amongst each other although they hate each other guts and they are in disagreements on a number of things and the two generals cannot wait to get rid of Netanyahu who of course as we all know is unpopular and so on so forth but back to the what they were saying and I thought the spin was considerable this time I mean there was so much spin I could go and dissect every sentence said the past 45 minutes to tell you where the spin is and a lot of it was not just you know sort of playing with the truth a lot of it was just not factual and I think the most important part was not factual they've been trying to make the argument throughout this press conference that they had to go through a month and a half of War risking risking risking risking the lives of their own captives right but it was all Justified because they couldn't have reached this deal before yeah not true this is not true we know all of us because we've heard it repeated again and again by Hamas leaders that they were ready from day one from day one yeah to release the old women and the children and so on so forth that they have held because I think they also regretted probably holding them anyway and because it's tough to hold children and old people captives in Gaza in a condition of war for a month and a half so from the beginning Hamas leaders were insisting that they are happy to release the captives if return for reciprocity meaning Israel releas the same so their entire discourse that they had to do it they had to do the war and risk the lives of the captives so they can reach to this deal this is just not true they said that the deal they have now is a much better deal than was on the table 10 days ago apparently this is also not true because I don't want to say from my own sources let's say from my own reading I know this is not to be true they've been stubborn now for 10 days insisting a number of things such as the fly fight over Gaza such as the number of days but they made concessions on all of them because they needed to show some results and because they were American pressures again there was American pressure on the Israelis to come up with a deal but Netanyahu you know prefers to play the bombastic smug saying oh oh I called my friend Joe exactly and I told my friend Joe to get involved and to talk to them yeah as if the the leader of the Free World works for a prime minister and he also said I call my friend Joe and I said look Joe this war will continue well this this is again right because natany has been insistent from the very beginning and he boxed in the leader of the Free World behind him in a genocidal war that we see its result now this genocidal war and pay attention to the words again you know I mean spin so ethical yeah moral values Noble objectives yeah we we are talking about the genocidal war that led to the death of more than 12,000 civilians more than 5,000 children to the destruction of half more than half of the residential buildings in Gaza yeah a war on hospitals a war on schools a war on children again ethical moral values Noble objective and they were talking about a baby I I'm not sure what which baby but there were a baby apparently held by Hamas imagine the audacity after all the images of all the babies that we've seen over the past weeks yeah especially the last few days in asifa in the Indonesian hospitals in alut hospital and other hospit Al Hospital the babies of the Palestinians yeah that's ethical moral Noble objective Maran thank you as always that is our senior political analyst mwan bashara
