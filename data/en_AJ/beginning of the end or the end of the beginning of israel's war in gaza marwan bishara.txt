we begin in Gaza where the Israeli military says it has withdrawn most of its troops from the canun area in the South however one Brigade is to stay and this is the devastation that has been left behind it's not clear what is behind this pullout now it comes 6 months after Israel launched its war on the strip and what the international court of justice says is a plausible case of genocide now the assault began after Hamas attacked Southern Israel on October the 7th killing more than 1100 people and taking over 200 captive well since then Israel's bombardment of Gaza has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians nearly half of them are children now most of the population around 1.7 million people has been displaced now another round of ceasefire negotiations is set to resume in Cairo Israeli and Hamas delegations are expected to attend well in a moment we will speak with TK abum who was standing by in Rafer and Southern Gaza but first let's bring in Rory Chalin who is an occupied East Jerusalem for us and first of all Rory can we talk about this troop withdrawal from KH unun has Israel actually explained what is behind this decision well on the day that this war reaches the halfe mark on the day that the Israeli military announces the deaths of four more Israeli soldiers uh killed fighting in KH Yunis the military also announces the withdrawal of basically all ground troops in Gaza apart from one Brigade now an explanation for anyone who doesn't know about military divisions and brigades and battalions Etc a brigade in the Israeli Army is about 2 to 5,000 people now this brigade is being left in the center of Gaza basically splitting uh the strip in two between North and South the Israeli Army hasn't said exactly why it's done this but of course this is being discussed extensively in Israeli media and they're using uh military sources and what they're saying is that the military basically believes that the fighting in KH Unice that operation has been satisfactorily uh concluded the uh division that was doing that fighting is now being withdrawn for rest and recuperation and the model that is going to be used for the ground forces in Gaza for the foreseeable future is smaller raids basically that are based on intelligence that the Israeli military gets and the uh Brigade that's left is going to be able to go north it's going to be able to go south and do those more targeted raids and it's also going to be able to prevent the displaced people from the north who are now Sheltering the south from going home home again that's something the Israeli military at the moment is saying that it wants to do it wants to maintain that and at the same time Rory Israel's finally confirmed they will be sending a delegation to Cairo for another round of negotiations what more can you tell us about that yeah this came out fairly late in the day uh after an Israel war cabinet meeting what we heard is that this delegation which had been speculated about for a while is going to be going to Cairo it's it's it's either leaving now or has already left and they will be partaking in those discussions tonight in Cairo it's a highlevel delegation it includes the head of Mossad it includes the head of shinb the internal security uh Force agency and it includes some some military uh people as well what's different about this delegation is that it has what's been called an expanded mandate now what we understand that to mean is that delegation is going to be going with actual negotiating Powers previous delegations that have gone from Israel to Cairo for talks have basically gone with very set parameters parameters that were dictated to them by the Netanyahu government they couldn't do any discussions while they were there they were essentially there to monitor to listen and then come back this delegation has something different about it and that perhaps suggests that momentum is moving towards some sort of ceasefire deal whatever that might look like and we can hear Netanyahu spoke about his feelings on these talks earlier on we can listen to him now Hamas hopes that the pressure from outside and inside will make Israel surrender to these extreme demands it will not happen Israel is ready for a deal Israel is not ready to surrender instead of international pressure being directed at Israel which only causes Hamas to harden its positions the pressure of the International Community should be direct against Hamas Rory there's also more pressure coming on Netanyahu because we are expecting another night of anti-government protest how big an effect are they actually having though yeah just after I finished speaking to you I'm going to be heading down to where those protests are going to be taking place it's going to be outside the Israeli Parliament the the knesset in Jerusalem now this protest this evening is going to be uh captives uh families and their supporters there are kind of two strands of demonstrations that are going on in Israel at the moment there is the protest being taken by the captives families and their supporters and there are bigger uh anti-government protests going on as well we saw some at the beginning of the week uh three nights of successive protests in t Aviv uh they ended in in some violence not big violence but certainly arrest and and heavy-handed policing what we're starting to see happening in Israel at the moment is these two groups of protesters sometimes linking up uh to share their goals and share their aims it's happening of course tonight while these uh Cairo talks are going to be going on the general mood amongst the capus families of course as it has been for ages is that the government has not done enough to bring the captives who have still been kept in Gaza home the anti-government demonstrations well they want something a bit different they want to essentially unseat Benjamin Netanyahu they want him to leave office they hold him responsible for October the 7th and they want a new start and a new government okay thanks so much Rory we'll let you go to those uh protests and we will talk to you a little later on Rory chin for us there in occupied East Jerusalem okay well let's go uh to TK abum who is in ruer and Southern Gaza and ter can you just give us a bit of an idea of what it is like there since the pull out of Israeli troops from canun can you explain what has been left in their wake yes Tom in fact the Israeli military today has with drone from the city of kanun and they have bulled their troops to the eastern part of the city there as they are right now stationed but as people started to gradually and partially return to check the houses and what remained there they have been describing the situation to be completely uh undescribable and chaotic as there was a great deal of Destruction has been left to the entire area as a result of the battles between Hamas Fighters and the Israeli soldiers and the unprecedented bombing campaign that had been completely carried out by the Israeli military there the entire the city of kanu had been destroyed complete destruction of civil infrastructure their mosque residential houses as people are saying that they have nothing left there in the city of Khan hunis but the withdrawal that has been taken and carried out by the Israeli military today could be seen as uh bringing different strategical dimensions for the Israeli military in fact on the ground one is that it will allow for the Israeli military to uh strategically carry out uh pinpoints and also precise deceptive military operations similarly to what happened in a shifat hospital after the Israeli withdrwal there and also it will help people to return back to the houses in khuna city after the withdrawal and also which in turn will facilitate the process of evacuation for residents here in Rafa if there's going to be any potential military incursion for the city there and it also will help the military to precisely carry out uh pointed strikes to eliminate Hamas operatives on the ground there so similarly right now what has been left in kanun is completely sheer destruction and no sign of living there for people and with complete change of the Milestone of living for the majority of the people in the city of kanun yeah t we've just been uh watching pictures of uh Kan Yunis uh in the hour since the Israeli troops have left and it really does seem as you say like nothing has been left to survive there now as we know it is 6 months since the War Began can you just give us a sense of what it is like in Gaza today have people used it to take stock of what has happened and and everything that has been lost in that time well um exhausted Palestinians who are completely right now being under unrelenting bombardment for at least 6 months of the war are right now tired and exhausted they are no longer uh able to cope with the situation on the ground specifically that the Israeli military had destroyed the majority of areas that they have been operating and we are talking about more than 2third of gaza's population being displaced and with more than 23 of gona's residential houses civil infrastructure and also uh talking about educational facilities being destroyed we have been talking to people in the north showing uh and describing the situation for us they are saying that nothing of the Milestone of living have been existing anymore they have destroyed uh the majority of electric infrastructure civil infrastructure alongside that they have been also destroying the water wells that were feeding and providing people with water services so generally the Milestone of living in Gaza have completely changed as people only right now looking forward for a ceased fire that will help them to return back again to the houses in the north and that can guarantee a full sensation of military acts on the ground just to live peacefully without any further bombardment or casualties among civilians specifically that more than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed since October the 7th with more than 75,000 others being warned till now okay thanks so much TK ter abum for us there in ruer and Southern Gaza El jazer senior political analyst Maan Bashar joins us again um as TK was explaining there and as we saw in the pictures the Israeli troops have basically left nothing uh left in KH Unis what do you think is behind the withdrawal it could be any number of uh reasons uh I don't think we need to read too much into it I don't think we need to project too much uh into it uh it could be as the Americans and some of the Israelis are saying a question of reshuffling uh one Brigade has to go out and rest and another one is replaced that's been happening over the past six months but it could also be um redeployment in to the north part of Gaza or to the east of Gaza in preparation as the Israelis say to a an an eventual ra offensive is that part of a psychological warfare to put pressure on Hamas in the negotiations or are the Israelis in fact preparing for such a thing let me tell you why this is really important the terminology regardless whether we know or we don't know why the brigades are moving I've been arguing for a while that for Biden this is the beginning of the end of this war 6 months later too long it needs to wind down it's the beginning of the end for the Netanyahu it's still the end of the beginning this is the stage where the destruction has taken place the analiation of much of Gaza and a lot of its population and so on so forth but now need there needs to be a pacification of Gaza neutralization and total Destruction of hamas's presence in the fabric of the Gaza Society needs to be an occupation and then there is the attack which now Israel talks about turning the defensive into an offensive in Lebanon right so for for Netanyahu and his government this is just the end of the beginning and hence we're going to see a lot of movements back and forth for the time being it's clear that for Netanyahu the Gathering of the storm even the perfect storm over his government in terms of the attack on the international Aid in terms of the Iranian vowing uh revenge in terms of domestic pressure in terms of huge American uh momentum towards pressure in terms of world fatigue with Israel in terms of resistance in Gaza there's a gathering storm so I think netan would like to wither the Storm at least for a number of weeks and a deal will help him do that redeploying out of the hot areas in Gaza would also help him do that so does that put more pressure on him and the Israeli delegation that is going to Cairo to try and negotiate something does does that put more pressure on the Israelis to actually come away with something solid here some anything no matter how small uh if like a first step um towards something further so the thing is that the gap between Israel and Hamas until 48 hours ago was quite huge and Hamas probably didn't want to go to Gaz to Cairo unless there's a change in America in Israeli position and apparently there is some change in the Israeli position but if you notice from hamas's statements at least maybe I'm maybe I'm reading too much into it I think there is a bit of a change in hamas's declaration the past 24 hours for example they used to say on the condition that Israel withdraws from all of Gaza now they say on the basis of on the basis of Israel on the basis of the Gaza displac in the South moving back to their homes in the north so there's there's a bit of change of accents a bit of change of emphasis but clearly there is an intention to get to something even if it's intermediate whereby they can show results the successful or or the success of any such Endeavor in Cairo will depend in part on the cutas and the Egyptian but mostly on the Americans that have to put and use leverage with Israel and try to arrive at bridging Solutions we heard from Rory chellin uh our correspondent in Israel Bally saying that this Israeli delegation is actually going to Cairo with a lot more power than previous iterations have been in terms of being actually able to negotiate what what did you make of that that was one of Biden's main demands in his conversation on the phone with natany it's amazing how much we can hang on that damn phone call but it is or apparently was one of the things that Biden demanded Netanyahu because he knew Netanyahu was going to play this game again and again and again so the idea was you couldn't get any results unless the negotiating team has leverage has a space to maneuver right has the capacity the authority to to reach a deal now the delegation is quite high ranking when you have the the head of the internal security and the head of the Mad the exterior security right I mean that's it there's nothing else you can have in terms of reaching a deal they don't need Netanyahu and his lackes back in Tel Aviv to reach a deal the idea that this is an expanded uh Authority now for the delegation means that there is a better chance but let's always remember that the situation is dire in Gaza the gap between Israel and Hamas is huge but there is interest and there is momentum of Bridging the gaps reaching a deal even if it's an interim one okay thank you so much moan as always we really do appreciate it
