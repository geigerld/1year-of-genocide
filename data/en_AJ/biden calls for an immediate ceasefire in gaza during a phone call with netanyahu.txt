so we begin this newsour with the US president's call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza during a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Biden told his Israeli counterpart that a ceasefire is essential and urged him to reach a deal without delay he also said that US policy depends on immediate action by Israel to protect civilians this is the first time the two leaders have spoken since Israeli air strikes killed seven World Central Kitchen Aid workers in Gaza on Monday alzer's White House correspond Kimberly hit joins us now Kimberly we're going to first run through the language here what Biden is reported to have told Netanyahu and after that you'll tell us how new it is and put some context around it first what did he say exactly yeah a very strongly worded readout much stronger than we typically see from the White House it was uh very clear and by that that word specifically the president made clear was used at least three times uh we knew this was going to be a tense phone call and it's clear that the president as promised dressed down prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu uh the president emphasized that the strikes on humanitarian workers and the overall humanitarian situation was unacceptable he made clear the need for Israel to announce a series of specific concrete and measurable steps to address civilian harm humanitarian suffering and the safety of Aid workers he made clear the need for Israel to announce a series of specific and concrete and measurable steps to address civilian harm and he made clear that the US policy with respect to Gaza will be determined by the assessment of Israel's immediate action on these steps in other words despite all the steps that Israel has taken to allow uh Aid into Gaza what the United States feels is that the results on the ground are unacceptable in other words the feeling is by the United States that 100% of the population is in need of assistance and the feeling of the United States is that even as Aid workers are trying to help and get that assistance in their lives are in Peril Kimberly this all just crossed so we're just learning this at very first look it looks to me like this is by a significant margin the strongest language Biden has used against Netanyahu in six months is that fair it's the strongest language we've seen publicly that is fair uh we've never had uh a window into some of these private conversations uh we know that there has been a lot of frustration on the part of the US president and we have heard leaks that the president has had some very uh Frank discussions if you will we knew this was going to be a colorful conversation and while we didn't get any of that color in the readout this is one of the strongest most strongly worded readout that we have ever seen from the White House in terms of how this has been communicated in the message to the Israeli Prime Minister okay that is that's an interesting distinction because you're telling us there's been strong language in private but this time they are deliberately making it public Kimberly hit reporting from the White House thank you very much we will talk to you again let's go to hamda salut in occupied East Jerusalem hamda what are you hearing on the Israeli side about this call well we do know that US President Joe Biden is expressing that it's unacceptable to the United States and it comes on the heels of a lot of pressure that the Americans and the rest of the International Community has been putting on the Israelis when it comes to the number of millions that have been killed inside of Gaza the strikes on the aid workers that a lot of the world have simply said is unacceptable and additionally that the amount of humanitarian Aid going in is simply not enough but the Israeli Prime Minister speaking at a security cabinet meeting did say that Israel is quote going to defend itself against Iran in the readout with the White House memo with the call with the US president it did end by saying that Joe Biden did Express that the Americans would support the Israelis with that but when it comes to these strikes on the workers we are hearing from the Israelis that there is going to be an investigation into the matter they were not so quick really to say that it was them who attacked and targeted these seven Aid workers initially we heard from the Army in the morning who called it an incident and then we heard hours later from the Israeli Prime Minister who said it was unintentional the Army says that their investigation will be wrapping up soon but it's not really known what that timeline looks like but they did say the public the findings would be public hamda the US has criticized Israel and more specifically the Israeli Prime Minister Mr Netanyahu um in the in the past right but this is this criticism is a lot stronger at least the criticism that they're making public is a lot stronger this time around how has Netanyahu responded to Biden's criticism in the past look there's been a lot of back and forth between American and Israeli officials specifically the president and the Israeli Prime Minister there's been a lot of back and forth not just about this issue particularly but also about Israel's ground Invasion into Rafa there's been a lot of disagreements with how Israel has been conducting itself throughout this war and remember there was supposed to be some sort of Israeli delegation that was heading to Washington in the last week to go brief American counterparts but that didn't happen so the Americans are growing increasingly frustrated with Israeli policy and that hasn't necessarily been a secret in fact according to reports within Israeli media there was a teleconference video type of meeting with American and Israeli officials to kind of brief them on the raah operation and reports indicated that it did not go well and there was a lot of Anger from both parties so the Americans have been frustrated with how Israel has been carrying itself how it's been Prosecuting this war specifically in Gaza but the policies of the Americans as we've seen have not yet changed and Netanyahu himself has said that he's going to do whatever he sees Fit until there's an absolute victory over Hamas with or without American Support okay that's really interesting thanks for that reminder there Hamas salh
