to Turkey now where president reab T erdogan says his country could intervene in Israel's war on Gaza he was speaking to members of his party on Sunday erdogan made references to the 2020 conflict in Libya when turkey sent troops to support the government He also mentioned last year's operation when turkey's Ally aeran took control of the nagoro kabak region erdogan says turkey could do something similar in Israel but didn't elaborate we need to be very strong so that Israel cannot do these ridiculous things to Palestine just as we entered kabak just as we entered Libya we can do something similar to them there is no reason for us not to we only have to be strong so that we can take these steps well let's bring in our correspondent Sim coolu she's joining us live from Istanbul s what are turkey's options here Elizabeth first let me underline that we're a bit Lost in Translation in this topic because many International media Outlets have translated aon's uh uh Speech as if he said we can do the same in Israel so I have to underline that he he he gave the uh Turkish Military Support in the kabah and Libya Wars as the reference which were no boots on the ground strategy for turkey this is very important because uh turkey has many military involvements like military operations that uh it has conducted since 19 uh 2019 uh in Northern Syria like the operation in afine and other places and those those were on the ground operations Turkish military were involved along with the Syrian opposition H fighter groups but here he's talking about uh another example where a Turkish Army was involved in technology terms with its armed drones but no boots on the ground but Turkish military supported the paramilitary groups on the ground in Libya and the azaran military in nagoro caraba so that's first what we have to underline uh we understand that he's trying to mean he can he has the strength H power to do the same thing for Gaza uh supporting the uh groups on the ground uh in Gaza this is at least what we understand but of course this speech by uan uh I don't think that it was made by a coincidence I don't think that he was uh trying to he he was trying to mean something else but he was trying to show that turkey wants to be involved also politically uh uh in the solution for Gaza because we have seen uh Beijing uh mediated between the Palestinian Union groups and there was an agreement that uh the mahammed abas would be recognized his group would be recognized as the sole leader of the Palestinians but now we are seeing that erogan is saying Mahmud abas hasn't responded to his request uh to his invitation to come and speak in the Turkish Parliament we understand that erog wants to turn a new page uh on this debate and wants to be involved in the political solution process uh for the uh post war in Gaza back to you all right s thank you for that that's s kolu live in Istanbul make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
