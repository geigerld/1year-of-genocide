the war on Gaza has taken away almost everything that people once had the lives the homes and even their clothes I've fled in these clothes and I've had them since the beginning of the war I took this jacket from someone and I fled in my remaining clothes we were happy in Gaza we were living living in a tent in Raa Dee and his children are struggling to keep warm all their clothes are torn I can't buy anything for them look at these clothes the price of new winter clothes is Sky High so some are turning to secondhand clothes shops like this one the displacement occurred during the summer and people came with summer clothes now it's winter and it's cold so there are no new clothes coming from abroad there's no refuge except for secondhand clothing stores but even secondhand clothes can prove expensive what can I buy I have 200 shekels and I'm entering the store to buy just a few items of clothes this means I'll clothe four or five people at most these are things we desperately need clothes to provide warmth nearly 2 million Palestinians in Gaza have been forced from their homes that are facing starvation and disease as many of them right now are living the open so struggling to keep warm without winter clothes only adds to their misery tkom Al jazer Rafa in southern Gaza make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
