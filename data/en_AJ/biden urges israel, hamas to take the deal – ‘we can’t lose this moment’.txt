for the details of this latest ceasefire proposal kimbery we heard a very solemn President Biden there announcing this latest ceasefire proposal that he said was announced by Israel proposed by Israel talk us through the details of it yeah the proposal uh that he says I know some in Israel will not agree with this plan he's urged the Israeli leaders to stand behind this deal I asked them to step back and think about what happens if we lose this moment suggesting that Israel will be isolated if it does not go ahead with this proposal the deal seems to be broken down into three different phases uh and that it would be phased in over six weeks the first phase of it uh would be to end the hostilities would be a full withdrawal of the Israeli military the second phase would be critical in that it would be a release of the captives the Israeli captives that are being held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners that are in Israeli jails hundreds of them that we know are being held in captivity then the third phase would involve the rebuilding of Gaza this would be significant given the widespread damage that has occurred as well as 600 trucks of Aid now uh obviously there's going to be need for more Aid than that so I think this was a daily number cuz we know the goal right now has been less than half that so the this is the United States saying that this needs to be increased significantly now what you're hearing from the US president is that uh in trying to do this this would be if this is achieved over 6 weeks that this could be turned into something lasting and enduring in other words this would be the complete and end and finality to hosti ities in other words this would bring a cessation to all of the fighting that has been going on in other words this is something that would be lasting and enduring something that the United States has been trying to achieve yeah and in listening to the president there kimbery it's clear that he wants to bring this war to an end doesn't want it to drag on uh in in the leadup to the elections in November yeah and what you heard there is the president kind of dangling the carrot if you will for uh for Israel by saying that look it if you don't you're going to be isolated saying that this will allow you to integrate talking about what this means uh the opportunity with working with the Arab neighbors and how this could lead to uh broader stabilization in the broader Middle East uh and so what you've got there is the president looking Beyond even uh Beyond his his term if you will already laying the groundwork for what he hopes he can do if he is reelected and also laying down that one message that Hamas needs to take this deal as well okay kimbery thank you very much for the moment kimbery hit live for us there at the White House let's now get the view uh the perspective the Israeli perspective and speak to Sarah hyat who's joining us from Aman in Jordan because Israel has banned Al jazer in Israel uh Sarah President Biden saying there that it is Israel which has offered this new ceasefire deal but also said as Kimberly pointed out there that there are those in Israel in the Israeli cabinet who will not agree to this proposal yeah his speech was really interesting because when there was a ceasefire deal that did go through back in November it lasted uh 10 days and at the time they talked about potentially three uh phases to get to a point where the war would end but since then uh these negotiation deals have haven't happened there's been a toing and throwing between the Israelis and then the Hamas and each one accusing the other of not abiding by the details or not agreeing to them and certainly the difference with this speech this time is clearly the message was directed to the leadership of uh Israel in fact uh Joe Biden even mentioned some of those ministers within the government he said uh that want the Israelis to remain in Gaza for many years to come some of those ministers he didn't mention their names but it's public knowledge that ministers like itamar benav the National Security uh Minister and bezau smotrich the Finance Minister who are very open in what they say about wanting uh Palestinians to choose uh uh to leave voluntarily from Gaza and those are people that want to resettle Gaza reoccupy Gaza and it's because of those ministers in uh the Israeli government that has led Israel to being condemned internationally with many countries turning against Israel when it comes uh to calling on them to end uh this war another thing he said is people in Israel will not agree with this plan so he's referring to those politicians and those divisions that are in uh the government he also says in the coalition government he then says I urge leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal despite those objections a message to toward Wass prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who has almost had his arm Twisted by those farri uh ministers because without those uh ministers without those parties uh that coalition government could potentially fall and new elections would need to happen and of course there are calls against prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign as soon as possible not just for the failures of October 7 happening in the first place but also by families angry protesting in the knesset against him saying you must accept a deal no matter what that deal is folly if you remember all for all was the word that has been used for many months now uh where the families of those held captive were calling on any deal if it means ending uh the war to allow those held captive to return back home Sarah thank you very much for that Sarah hyat live there in Aman georan because again the Israeli government has banned Al jazer from reporting from inside Israel so we have to do it from Aman let's now head over to Gaza
