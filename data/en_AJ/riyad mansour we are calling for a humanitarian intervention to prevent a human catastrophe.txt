catastrophic situation of uh the civilians in the Gaza Strip and to provide them over the needed materials in terms of electricity fuel uh food medicine water and so on and so forth and president Abbas impressed on him the need of uh ending this Onslaught and aggression against our people on the Gaza Strip we appreciate the efforts of the SG and he continued with this effort with the a number of countries and agencies the world U the wh is active and it it's raising the alarm that there has to be access to the Gaza Strip to provide medical and humanitarian assistance Ona uh is it has in its facilities I believe now it is 92 facilities as the SG said they are housing about 220,000 displaced Palestinians there might be an additional 100,000s who are looking for places uh to uh to protect their families the situation is extremely uh uh uh horrific against our civilian population the destruction is beyond imaginations as you see and you cover uh the the situation and the story uh with your own uh you know cameras so the whole world is seeing that that catastrophe that is befalling on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip of course you know we appreciate the efforts also of Ona who's trying to send assistance but they cannot Egypt and others Jordan and the Palestinian Authority in ramala all are uh trying you know to send assistance but they are not succeeding so far in addition to that I met with the president of the security Council about an hour ago in his chamber and I raised with him you know that this catastrophic situation the efforts of the SG the efforts of all these agencies who are active in the humanitarian field including Anor wh and the Readiness of many countries including Egypt and Jordan of stepping up to the plate and helping we appreciate all these efforts and we will continue the uh contacts with everyone including the security Council so that the International Community to shoulder its responsibility in stepping to the to the picture and in putting uh an end to this Onslaught against our people but more importantly that would require of course sending humanitarian assistance to the uh 2 million3 uh of Palestinians who live in the Gaza Strip uh there has to be a humanitarian intervention in order to uh to avoid uh a looming catastrophe and humanitarian massive crisis in the Gaza Strip we will continue with these efforts with everyone uh I understand that the Arab uh emergency ministerial meeting just concluded few minutes ago in Cairo we will study what the outcome and see how we can fit all these things with our activities and our contacts with all concerned parties here at the United Nations we hope very soon that the International Community led by the SG led by the security Council will rise up to the to their responsibilities and begin with the process of sending humanitarian help and assistance to uh the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip This of course would require to have a ceasefire or stopping the bombardment of the Gaza Strip so that the convoys and the Caravans would be able you know to reach the Gaza Strip and to provide the assistance uh to the people there and if we succeed in this Collective effort soon it is needed it should take place then that would open the stage for other possibilities to deal with all other pressing issues this is what I wanted to brief you with and I want to thank you again for being with us thank you can we ask some questions uh I I I I gave you everything that you know well well we'd like to hear from you oh I've been asked by un correspondent Association to thank you for the briefing on behalf of Valaria couldn't be here um my question is um first of all have you called and have okay you've been listening to Riyad Mansour the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations alir shihab bransi is live at the UN shihab I assume like myself you were furiously taking notes the headline for me is that uh the Palestinian Ambassador is require is calling for a humanitarian intervention and for the Secretary General and the security Council he said to step up to their responsibilities to prevent a catastrophe beginning with calling for a ceasefire to stop the bombardment of Gaza to allow humanitarian Aid and just any normal supplies into Gaza given the Israeli Siege and notably that's one thing that the UN Secretary General when he made his comments just about an hour ago 45 minutes ago or so did not call for he did not call for a ceasefire uh he called for the immediate for supplies of food and water to be allowed into Gaza but he notably did not ask for a ceasefire and in fact the secretary General's spokesperson was asked afterwards why did the Secretary General not call for an immediate ceasefire why did he not use the moral authority of the UN Secretary General to call for an end to the bombardment of Gaza and the Secretary General spokesperson said well that's the way I read it so I'm they're suggesting that the Secretary General is suggesting a ceasefire by constantly saying that parties in the conflict should abide by humanitarian law and that's enough there's no need for an explicit statement calling for a ceasefire that appears to be the position of the UN Secretary General currently I'm going back to what Riyad manour was saying into my notes he said that he he thanked Egypt and Jordan among other countries for their efforts in uh in trying to send Aid into the Gaza Strip but he said for the moment those efforts are not succeeding and I think that goes back to exactly what you were saying that for Aid to go in there would need to be a ceasefire I mean of course Aid can't go in while the Gaza Strip is uh being bombarded and that's the green light the ceasefire that's what they can't get and the he also said that the Palestinian the president of the Palestinian Authority Mahmud Abbas spoke to the Secretary General two days ago calling for humanitarian corridors to allow in food Fuel and so on so that's that was that was the nature of the conversation two days ago between Mahmud Abbas and the UN Secretary General so yeah that is the key the key issue he also confirmed what we'd already heard from the United Nations that uh 92 un facilities these are usually anra United Nations relief and works agency schools are now Sheltering some 220,000 people with 100,000 others in Gaza looking for shelter he said but it we can we can add to that information by talking about what the UN has also confirmed that of those uh 200 uh those 92 schools 20 have already been hit by Israeli fire since Saturday 11 un staff have been killed the cross Gaza we understand that 30 students from these schools these United Nations schools have been killed as well now just to remind this is something this is a feature of these Israeli bombardments of Gaza we saw it in 2014 when scores of Palestinians and and indeed 10 un staff were killed during that bombardment the coordinates of these schools are well known the is Israel knows where these schools are they know they being used to shelter the internally displaced but Israel hits them anyway yeah AB absolutely shabo yesterday I was speaking to uh the head or Deputy head of unasa the the uh uh UN Agency for Palestinian refugees about those schools and she was telling me those schools are as you say deconflict that means Israel knows those coordinates very accurately and they know not to hit those schools and yet as you said 20 schools have been uh have sustained damage during the course of these bombardments shihab bransi reporting from the United Nations thank you very much
