well joining us here on set Tam hamud he's professor of public policy at Doha Institute for Graduate Studies is also a Palestinian from Gaza thank you very much indeed for being with us the who is making it very clear that even a three-day pose of any sort isn't going to give them enough time to be able to vaccinate everybody and that would suggest that obviously the risk of polio and other diseases is still going to be there why do you think that Israel has agreed at this point to have these temporary pauses um Rob uh it seems to me like Israel is doing a favor to the International Community by even allowing this to happen or agreeing to give these three days post for uh for related entities to provide vaccine to to to children in Gaza I I mean that's so pathetic I mean to get to this stage where the International Community is begging Israel to vaccine children and and this tells you to what extent this war has become immoral and genocidal under the watch of the International Community um I mean this is unprecedented in in modern history to see this happening uh and yes I mean the speaker from wh she she's right what about other vaccines and what about if they all get vaccinated and then the killing continues I mean I mean kids and children in particular have been uh the highest casualties and victims of this war of this genocidal War so yes this war needs to end this genocidal War needs to end I mean the health sector in Gaza has been systematically destroyed and targeted 3 days for sure will never be enough to vaccinate uh 30 or 40% of gaza's populations which are young and children and for sure it's it's it's a joke it's a sick joke by the Israelis to say we offer you three days to to vaccine uh children knowing that the enal the entire Health sector has been destroyed there are no clinics there no no basic conditions whatsoever to provide this vaccine but again this is Israel it acts as a as a par state above international law and sadly we are at this point now we've obviously heard the allegations from the international court of justice several months ago saying that there were grounds for um the belief that genocide was being committed in in Gaza does this kind of action in any way give Israel any leverage against that are they able to say no well we we're doing humanitarian activities but by allowing these vaccines to be in of course not at all because I mean I give you I mean I pretend to allow some conditions to provide some vaccine like you know these are like you know impossible conditions first of all logistically 3 days and then continue the killing of the same targeted group I mean you provide them vaccine from on one hand and then you kill them from another hand so this is devilish this is Devious I mean no one can accept this human beings should not accept this International Community should not accept this an immediate stop of this war should be the only condition to move on and then to allow vaccin in kids and most importantly Stop The Killing and massacring of kids that's the top priority Tim we appreciate you being with us thank you very much indeed my pleasure make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
