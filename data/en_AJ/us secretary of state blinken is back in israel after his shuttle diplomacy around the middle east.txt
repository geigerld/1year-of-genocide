well as we've been saying Anthony blinkin is in Israel right now for more talks after he has been discussing the Gaza war with regional leaders in the Middle East Alan Fischer has more on that now for us from West Jerusalem for the moment it's an Escape Route with no Escape From First Light they gathered at the Rafa crossing the only way out of Gaza the way remains blocked no agreement to open the route no ceasefire in the area despite pressure from the Americans and with no way out there's no way in for food water and other humanitarian supplies on our way to the crossing they shelled Rafa Street and we started screaming we came to the crossing and thought it was safe nowhere is safe in Gaza wherever we go they're shelling crying screaming blood seriously we don't know what we should do we're coming to the crossing knowing that they won't open it in Gaza the scars of War are obvious open and raw another night of heavy bombardment has increased the number of dead there officials estimate a thousand more may be trapped under the rubble many already dead some unable to be saved who will be dead soon in the North of Israel there's an evacuation underway there too after days of Tit for Tat exchanges between Hezbollah and the Israeli Army the country's War cabinet approving the movement of everyone in 28 communities within 2 km of the border with Lebanon the exchanges have been Limited in scope but still lethal Israel says Iran is pushing the confrontations a charge denied in tan and the Israeli Army warned Hezbollah about exploiting the situation Hezbollah has executed a number of attacks in order to divert our operational efforts from the south under Iranian instruction and support US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is back in Israel after touring several Arab capitals taking the temperature there but there's little to show for his diplomacy efforts no humanitarian Corridor no ceasefire and no sign of an immediate end to the fighting Alan Fischer AL jazer West Jerusalem well let's bring in Maran bashara he's Al jaz's senior political analyst he joins us now via Skype from London Maan let me start by asking you for your assessment of the success of Lincoln's trip it it does feel like there's been a shift if only a marginal one in US rhetoric as as well as us media coverage well of course the first question is uh in that sense success for whom if it's success for American diplomacy I think on the face of it it wasn't easy uh his mission was quite difficult because uh according to the sort of American guidelines his president's guidelines he was supposed to do a number of things that are almost impossible one he supposed to support unconditionally Israel's basically genocidal war against Gaza two he was supposed to block anyone in the region from even daring to interfere or provoke Israel as it's waging its war three he's going to Shield Israel basically from all criticism and bring about condemnation by Israel's partners and not so much Partners in the Middle East four or five he wants to make sure that Arabs are going to help him uh with Hamas to release as many captives as possible without offering anything in return that's also not easy and then he wanted also the Arabs help in order to create socalled humanitarian Corridor which is sort of an orwellian way of saying ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians that certainly wasn't didn't work well for him so it was really a difficult Mission it within the guidelines of the president or the White House's policy but he tried and as much as possible to get some sort of an agreement you know uh for the Arabs to tone down their criticism to talk about the humanitarian crisis without necessarily going all the way in you know condemning Israel their their foreign relation their foreign ministers statement was basically watered down to sort of condemning the attacks of both sides which is new but otherwise no it wasn't that much of a you know great success Maran we've heard lots of speculation now about Biden potentially following do you expect that to happen and could that potentially delay an Israeli ground invasion you know I don't know I have this feeling right that since we've heard about the emminent uh land Invasion it didn't exactly happen this whole 24-hour notice to the Palestinians or 1 million of them to sort of move South and you'd expect something to happen afterwards so analytically speaking I am not sure if it's which is the two scenarios there is scenario number one is that the Israelis weren't ready and all their rhetoric was just you know hot hot talk about imminent invasion they were still preparing themselves because what's coming is going to be incredibly difficult militarily speaking this Urban Warfare you know amongst a population of 2 million people so they're still preparing they're still kind of going through all the POS scenarios and so on the second possibility is that things are really getting complicated they just didn't realize how complicated it is or perhaps after some intelligence that Hamas is pretty much prepared and that probably Iran Hezbollah might actually be serious if there is a land Invasion and there's a tragedy in in Gaza that maybe it's going to get really worse and Biden is kind of sending mix signal about occupation or not occupying moving in but not all the way so I think there is possibility of that or the other I more in tune with the possibility that they are still working on their military scenarios and in the meantime it's possible that Biden might show up in order to once again Express uh his support for Israel's right to defend itself probably without mentioning much about the Palestinians right to protect themselves Maran given all the the shifting Dynamics and some of the shifting rhetoric here what's your sense then of the information sharing that's actually going on between Israel and the White House at the moment does Washington actually have oversight of what's being planned I tell you just judging from uh Biden's pre-recorded interview that uh was aired on Sunday but was in fact uh done on Thursday is that the white house does not have a clue what Israel is up to or what is the end game for its war in Gaza and that's why he seems to advise even warn publically on the most watched program on American television 60 minutes that the occupation or reoccupation of Gaza would be in his words a big mistake what in other words he doesn't know exactly what Israelis are up to and he's just preempting the possibility that they might actually be contemplating the fantasy that he could just reoccupy Gaza you know forever that this would be a big mistake so my sense is America is giving an unconditional support to Israel but on the other hand it is not getting sort of a seat on the table if you will in Israel's war cabinet to actually you know advise and guide being you know the superpower with already having you know two uh Regional wars in Afghanistan Iraq and having so much at stake having sent two Naval Strike forces to the east Mediterranean but it seems it doesn't have that much Maan Bashar there alzer's senior political analyst always great to talk to you Maan thanks for joining us
