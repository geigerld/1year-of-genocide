a news just coming in the number of dead uh Palestinian dead has risen to 330 we understand Let's cross to Gaza to yumna elide who's live for us there and yumna so we've been hearing about the number the large number of Israeli fatalities tell us what's happened there yes well nick uh the violent raids or Israeli raids and bombardments over civil uh several civilian homes across the Gaza Strip in different areas is intensifying the violent way uh uh Air Raids are shaking the Gaza Strip in different areas here in Gaza City many neighborhoods have been targeted many civilian homes the last targeting was for abua family home in B hanon that's in the northern part of the Gaza Strip 17 people have died only from that or have been killed from that bombardment on their homes now we did uh see uh messages being sent to the uh uh mobile phones or cell phones of the civilians by the Israeli military telling them to evacuate their homes especially the homes that uh are uh AC on on the borders of Gaza from north to south and to go to the uh central part of Gaza City but now we're seeing more messages being sent to people who are in Gaza City to still go to the center of Gaza City like in in the eastern part of Gaza City and in the western part of Gaza City the the the bombardments that we're seeing every now and then uh the uh the the killing of civilians the bombarding of their homes over their heads this is really extraordinary in just 24 hours of the beginning of the launching of the iron swords operation towards Gaza over 330 people have been killed and over 2,000 others have been injured Yar as we're chatting we can see images of boats I think in the harbor there just a blaze one particular one is a blaze anyway with smoke spiraling into the sky and not not sure if you know anything particularly about that but it's all part of the ongoing assault I guess yes well some parts now the bombardments in Gaza Nick are literally going uh in in different directions at the same time so some people or uh some civilians at their homes would get calls to evacuate their homes While others won't and the air strikes would happen at the same time which is making it very difficult for the civil defense teams the Medical Teams to act rapid ridly to get to the targeted places uh since their their resources and capabilities are very limited and that's why uh even though there there are people who could be under the rebels of their homes uh it's just civilians from that neighborhood who are risking their lives to go and to help them out of the rubble this is what we have been seeing in the past uh 24 hours and until now he you know we need to talk about cause and effect in all of this and how G's living under stifling land there and sea blockade which is Led no small part to what's been happening and then I can see behind you I think there's uh garans collecting food is that from a a refugee Outpost what's happening [Music] there well here Nick I'm in one of the unest schools uh this is a shelter now for displaced pal Palestinian families in this school alone there are over 2,000 people crammed alog together in just 40 uh classrooms of this school now these families here they have fled their homes because their homes were either by the borders and they were told and asked to evacuate or their homes were uh targeted and destroyed in the past hours so BAS basically ARA has opened 44 shelters and schools all together in different areas of the Gaza Strip we have over uh 20,000 people in these shelters now of course when you're going to talk about humanitarian conditions in these schools these people have fled with almost nothing some of them brought uh in very little belongings very little amounts of clothes for their children and others have to flee quickly uh running for their lives most of the people here came in last night but the other uh uh number of the people came in this morning and of course we're still witnessing more people as these messages are uh being received and they're being sent by the Israeli Army to the civilians to tell them to evacuate their home yeah it's it's incredible isn't it you know you're talking about people who fled their homes what is it like with this sense of the impending action Israeli action that is doubtless coming at some point how are Garin how are you feeling about what's looking to be about to happen well there's a very high sense of fear and and worry among the people here I mean just right here here in this school where I'm standing there is a police station now this is just a governmental police station but the people here are afraid that this police station which is just opposite to their uh to the school to this othera school could be targeted without prior notice like what we have been uh witnessing the past few hours so yes they are here because they they were forced to evacuate their homes but at the safe time there is no sense of uh there's no sense that they are safe there is no sense that they are protected in this uh shelter that they were forced to come into all right thanks yumna children in the middle of it right there behind you yumna thanks a lot let's uh head over to West Jerusalem sah hirat is there for us and Sarah so numbers of Israeli dead gone up to 600 and more at least 600 have the Israeli government saying anything about this yet I mean they the number keeps increasing every few hours and as Rob was saying we're expecting that will continue to go up of course no one imagined that there would be that number of casualties however uh just uh news that's come in that the Israeli cabinet has uh approved uh what's considered a war Clause uh to go ahead what that means is that Israel can then take significant what they call military action I.E that would lead to war it does have to uh be confirmed by a Kessa committee tomorrow we do know that prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu made that very clear on multiple occasions on Saturday when all this happens saying that we are at War but what that means is is that it just makes it more legally binding it also means that the Prime Minister as well as the defense minister won't need to consult the cabinet every time they want to take military decisions so that's the latest in terms of high level approvals from the government also we've heard from uh the Israeli uh military that there seems to have been uh some uh initiative coming from neighboring country Egypt with Hamas to allow the release of uh those Israeli citizens as U specifically they were talking about citizens that will that were taken over the border on Saturday into Gaza they're talking of those are specific ages babies children and the elderly Israel says it's not part of that initiative but it's no surprise that Egypt being a neighboring country that always uh is the first one of the first countries when these things happen here or there is tension or fighting or a flare in violence or as we see a war they will always try and come in and negotiate or try and bring parties together there's also been a phone call from uh the Jordanian uh president to his Egyptian counterpart where they've agreed that tensions need to to uh uh the situation needs to deescalate and that would mean uh uh a request almost to Israel to uh not uh go as far as um it seems to be heading in that direction to reconsider the amount of force uh that it will use against Gaza considering that it's uh such a densely populated area now in terms of looking forward uh what the Yeah I was going to say in terms of moving forward specifically when it comes to its military plan nothing is clear just yet um obviously there's been a lot of uh conversations amongst people whether Israel will send uh foot soldiers in for example however that remains quite tricky simply because of those uh people that have been held captive whether it's soldiers or whether it's civilians in Gaza so Israel is going to want to make sure that their safety is Paramount they can't come back with dead bodies if you like um there's also been we've been hearing of incidences uh just in the last hour as well of two Palestinians that they caught Palestinian fighters in one of the areas in the South along that border they've made arrests several of several arrests throughout the day and that's significant and interesting because in the past uh the Israeli and and not just in the past I mean we see this every day when it comes to Palestinians or anyone that they deem as a Palestinian fighter or armed an armed Palestinian they tend to uh shoot them on the spot but this hasn't been happening they have um been making arrests some of those are dead they've said 300 to 400 Hamas Fighters have been killed but they are also making arrests and that leads to a question of what do they plan to do with those that have been arrested obviously it has happened where Israelis have been kidnapped Gad shal was a huge uh uh big deal a few years ago and could that be used as a bargaining chip where there will be a change of uh prisoners or those that are held captive all of this remains to be seen right now Israel is working on making sure they get rid of the uh Palestinian fights they say that's their priority evacuating people along that southern border and then figuring out what the next step is of course in terms of Hezbollah and Lebanon they will not want this to escalate uh of to be to which is what exactly what the Egyptian president and Jordanian president saying that they don't want it to destabilize the region and that's why they are Keen to deescalate tensions right now indeed Sarah going to leave it there for now thanks very much Sarah har there thank you
