United Nations Secretary General Antonio gueras is speaking in New York let's listen in I have condemned unequivocally the orfy and unprecedented 7 October acts of Terror by amas in Israel nothing can justify the deliberate killing injuring and kidnapping of civilians or the launching of rockets against civilian targets end quote indeed I spoke of the GRE es of the Palestinian people and in doing so I also clearly stated and I quote that the Grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by amas it was necessary to set the record straight especially out of respect to the victims and to their families thank you thank you you have just watched a 90 second speech by the Secretary General of the United Nations Antonio gueras now we admittedly missed the first line I think missed the first line or two but and and I say this as I bring in M zi who just watched this with us on set here in Doha um it's I don't know how to describe this as anything other than the UN Secretary General justifying himself and I assume it was justifying the speech that he made yesterday we were just talking about this weren't we diplomacy at the UN and yesterday you explained to us that he made waves when he said what is happening right now what um I beg your pardon the uh Hamas attack did not happen in a vacuum that was his quote the Hamas attack did not happen in a vacuum end quote uh you were explaining to us that the Israelis were furious at this and we just saw the UN Secretary General essentially say this is what I said this is why I said said it I think he was he was reminding um U the world and the Israelis that he condemned what happened in 7th of October actually pre to his speech yesterday because and the first hold on MAR I have the exact quote yes because we tuned in 20 seconds late and well not late but this was a two-minute speech Yes the quote is gueras says that it is false to say he was justifying acts of Terror by Hamas it is false to say he was justifying acts of Terror by Hamas that is what he was accused of doing by Israel yes because the the the the political bullying that he was facing in the last 24 hours was outraged he was bullied actually in the last 24 hours by the Israelis putting him in the corner saying that actually look what you said is not acceptable because you know you are not talking about what happened in the 7th of October I think his n 60 seconds is trying to fix the record as he said correctly by saying he condemned what Hamas did he he's shocked by the Mis interpretations of his statement to the security Council on Tuesday um I think he was also reacting to the call for his resignation and to uh his statement I think it was very clear message that you know this is what I said and this is also uh what I believe in uh it was it was very you know strong statement from him this is really interesting I don't I don't recall frankly uh un Secretary General having having done anything quite like this in this format under these circumstances to come in to make a statement to the world which is a prepared statement that he had time to you know he had time to calibrate his language to yesterday I mean sorry I'm using bued in buling he was buing actually in the last 24 hours a lot in the media especially from Israeli media it was you know okay uh I think we'll talk about this again M thanks for your snap analysis on this
