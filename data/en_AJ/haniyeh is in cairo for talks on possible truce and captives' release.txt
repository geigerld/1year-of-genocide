Gideon Levy he's a columnist at haret he joins us now from Tel Aviv Gideon where is public opinion on a potential second ceasefire or or some kind of captive deal Israel is public opinion is almost totally recruited in support for continuing the war no matter what but in the same time there is this public desire to see the hostages coming back and therefore or a pause will be accepted by everyone but only a pause I don't see Israelis being ready to stop this war unfortunately so Gideon we heard strong words from Netanyahu today on how this war will be continuing how does that compared to what president Herzog has been saying it's not the first time that the two are different in their views but finally I think also president Herzog is not in favor of stopping the war for now as long as the Americans are giving Israel a green light and they are giving Israel a green light to continue Israel will continue no matter how many victims are in Gaza no matter how many children are killed in Gaza and even no matter how many Israeli soldiers are killed you mentioned the us giving a green light so let me ask you then would a un Security Council resolution if one does get passed would that make any difference first of all I want to see the United States not putting a vetto again and most probably they will put another vetto and then it's irrelevant Israel will ignore any any resolution of the International Community as long as Israel will be able to do so in order to achieve the goals that Israel wants to achieve which are very vague goals I must say and I think that at least part of them are unachievable Gideon just in terms of what's happening at the security Council if they do manage to through all of these delays and all the diplomacy that's going on right now behind closed doors if they do manage to find some language to agree on and the US doesn't veto a resolution and there is a vote and and a resolution is passed what are the chances that Israel actually abides by that resolution and implements what it requires if the resolution will not be accompanied with sanctions then I think Israel will continue with the war as long there that the Americans will not put some concrete measures actions on Israel which will which might change Israel's mind but as long as it will be only declarations condemnations Israel ignored many resolutions of the International Community in the in the past including resolutions by by the security Council Gideon we've been hearing a lot about about the pressure that's been mounting in Israel particularly on Benjamin Netanyahu I've been wondering how profound the pressure is right now from the families of captives he's been meeting with them this week yeah it's a growing pressure but I must tell you that I'm surprised to see less public protest I was expect ing after the killing of the three hostages by Israeli soldiers I was expecting to see tents of thousands of Israelis streaming to the streets with some kind of a protest on Saturday evening for example this did not happen I mean there was a protest but in much smaller scale and I'm afraid that except of the families obviously the families are totally recruited to fight to to get their beloved ones back that's goes without saying but I'm very afraid that Israeli public opinion becomes a little bit apathetic not totally obviously still everyone wants to see them home but I don't see a major protest for really putting an end to the war because this might be the only way to bring all of them back home Gideon perhaps not a protest to bring an end to the war but but I wonder if if there's been any kind of shift in understanding how Israel is Prosecuting this war we've spoken about it on on air before about how Israeli media reporting can be markedly different from from perhaps what you seeing on our screens and I'm wondering if knowing that that people who are waving White Flags Israelis who are holding White flags that they were shot has that changed any kind of views about how this war has been conducted I wish but totally not Israeli see it as an accident as a very serious accident but they don't see the meaning of it and the meaning of it is that Israel Israel is killing systematically innocent people deliberately including those who have white flags in their hands unfortunately very unfortunately three of them were Israelis but but this just shows the way that the Army is operating in Gaza and many times also in the West Bank by the way so the killing of innocent people continues and will continue and unfortunately Israelis don't draw the conclusions out of all those incidents there's always an explanation and justification and and and disbelief that those are exceptional cases and it will never happen again and it's again the the rules of the army the the directions of the army it's not so but Israel is many times living Deni kidan Levy there a columnist at haret speaking to us from Tel Aviv
