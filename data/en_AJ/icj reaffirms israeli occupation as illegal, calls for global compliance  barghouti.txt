okay we can go now to get reaction from Mustafa bouti is the Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative and former former information Minister he joins us from rala Mustafa bouti good to have you on the program so your reaction firstly to this historic ruling by the icj is this the outcome you were hoping for absolutely I think this is exactly what we were hoping for and it represents not only a historical decision it is a big blow to the Israeli side to Israel as a state as an establishment as a government as settlers and it is a big victory to the Palestinian cause uh from legal perspective Israel is already indicted and condemned for its policies for its occupation for its settlements for the illegal aparti wall for practicing aparti but the legal value of what happened is that this conclusion by the international court of justice which is the highest legal structure in the world has condemned all Israeli measures to try to claim that there is no occupation it is it has confirmed there is occupation and this occupation is illegal it has affirmed one more time that Geneva Convention is applicable to the occupied territories and it has said that the continuation of Israeli occupation is illegal and it has to end and that also settlements are illegal and they have to to to vanish and they all settlements have to be removed but also it obliged all countries of the world to respect this resolution and not to provide any support to Israel to continue this occupation and it it hello yes I'm still here I'm still here Mr vuti it's it's worth me pointing out this is an advisory opinion not a binding one previous icj rulings as you well know have been ignored by Israel and its allies as our uh political analyst Maran bashara put it a little earlier uh do you feel that the Palestinian leadership is overly relying on international law uh for change for the Palestinian people because in reality nobody seems to be listening or applying to anything no no no this is a very gloomy picture I think because uh international law has to be used and it doesn't deny Palestinians other forms of resistance and it would be a mistake to substitute all other forms of resistance with just international law we have to use everything but in my opinion the value of this resolution is very big because it provides a very strong fundamental basis for demanding sanctions and and boycott of Israel sanctions and boycott boycott divestment sanctions is now the go and I think it is the obligation now of the Palestinian Authority and anybody who supports the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people to demand immediate sanctions on Israel for violating international law yes of course it is an advisory opinion we know that but why did the court give the advisory opinion because the United Nations General Assembly that includes all the countries of the world has demanded this advisory opinion and now it is the obligation of the general assembly and the security Council to respond to this ruling this has confirmed a very important basis which is exactly what international law says about disputed issues nobody no more Israel can claim that occupied territories are disputed territories no more it can claim that Geneva Convention doesn't apply to occupied territories no more it can claim that there is no system of aparti and racial discrimination against Palestinian people people but now it is our duty and the duty of everybody that respects international law to apply this resolution by demanding boycott divestment sanctions I will not have hopes that the United Nations security Council will do that because we know that the United Nations Security Council is controlled by the American veto and maybe the British veto I don't know but the most important thing is that this provides the basis for what we have been working on which is the creation of a global anti- aarte movement against the Israeli aparte system against occupation against discrimination against this violation Frank violation of international law and just to get your reaction uh to something we heard a little earlier prior to this ruling by the Israeli Finance Minister he called for an annexation of the occupied West Bank if the icj does indeed rule against Israel on this issue which it has are you worried at all now that things may actually end up getting worse for Palestinians in the West Bank as Israelis double down on them no it was getting worse anyhow because Israel has a fascist government now Israel is officially having a fascist government led by fascists like SM Richard Bing beir and of course Netanyahu and when Netanyahu declares this is the land of Israel and claims that the icj is anti-Semitic icj is anti itic ICC is anti-Semitic international law is anti-Semitic this shows you how isolated Israel is and how marginalized Israeli leaders are and in my opinion this is a very optimistic situation because it shows that the road is wide open now to isolate this fascism in Israel and the more Israeli crimes happen as they are happening now in the case of genocide and Collective punishment in Gaza the more it is clear that Israel is becoming a paraya structure I cannot even say a paraya state because it violates every aspect of states by international law it's a paraya structure that has to be isolated that has to be sanctioned and that has to be boycott and whatever Israelis say doesn't mean anything as long as international law says something else as as as long as the highest court of the world is saying something else isra Israel cannot State on the world whatever it wants and in in my opinion now Israel will be more isolated than any time before and this provides a very good basis for our struggle for our freedom for our self-determination for ending this illegal occupation and ending and removing all these illegal Israeli settlements whatever Israel does will continue to lead to the more isolation of the Israeli government and not only that it will expose the double standard of the American policy and the double standard of any Western governments that continue to support Israel and refuses to apply sanctions on this violation of international law okay Mustafa bouti Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative former information Minister thank you so much for your
