after 7 Days of air strikes Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip has killed at least 2,200 Palestinians and wounded more than 8,000 it's been a week since Hamas launched its unprecedented military operation by land air and sea against Israel 1300 Israelis have been killed including foreign Nationals well graphic images have emerged showing the moment an strike hit one vehicle where a young girl was being treated the warning viewers may find the following footage [Music] distressing yes the Palestinian Health Ministry says ambulances have come under direct and systematic attacks in violation of international law it says 23 ambulances and 15 medical facilities have been hit 15 health workers have been killed this is Northern Gaza which is home to the jabala refugee camp it is the largest in the strip and 116,000 people live there the shatti refugee camp is one of gaza's most crowded it's also in the north along with a large number of un facilities and hospitals that include the enclave's largest the AL shifer Hospital Israel wants all those in hospitals treating injured patients and Sheltering displaced families to be evacuated to the south of body Gaza but with so many displaced Palestinians fleeing to Southern Gaza the conditions there of course are pretty dire car Unice in southern gazra is one of the places where people in the north have been told to head for but Israeli air strikes have been pounding residential buildings there too at least one Palestinian was killed and several injured in an attack just hours ago well joining us on the phone now from Gaza from K yunas in fact is our correspondent yide uh she's in that's in car unit say in South Gaza so yum just give us an impression of of first of all the journey that you made to the South and now you're there what are the scenes what's happening well Nick the journey wasn't easy at all I mean um we knew that we have to get out of our homes under bombardment with our kids we we knew that it wasn't even uh safe to get to unit as we were ordered because the B hadn't stopped at all the bombardment was ongoing in Gaza City it was ongoing in the north it was ongoing in the South so we were basically driving under bombardment yesterday when I evacuated a couple hours later two cars civilian cars were also bombarded while they were evacuating uh evacuating South while now uh the the couple of hours that the Israeli military G gave to the people of the north andaza city over a million people to evacuate were of course not easy especially that people had to check which routs uh to take and which roads to drive in and which streets to go into streets that were not bombarded yet and streets that were uh relatively safe from uh safe from bombardment so it did take us a lot of time to get to drive all the way from Gaza City uh till uh Kan yunes we made this here safely but uh there's thousands more who are still trying to take the STP to come to hunis uh these hours also the morning hours have witnessed a lot of people trying to evacuate from the North End of the city because of the heavy bombardment in these areas but also the bombardment hasn't stopped in central Gaza and in the South as well Nick just like you said uh hours ago uh a home was still bombarded here in in in the South but let me just give you the latest update about the bombardment casualties in the past half an hour in the past half an hour we have a home that was bombarded for a ran family in the North End of Gaza City and then we have also uh in in in another home that was bombarded in the central Gaza City in there balah and dozens of injuries have uh uh resulted from that bombardment while the Ministry of Health is saying that uh there are dozens of casualties between killed and injured in another massacre in the central part of Gaza City in a residential uh uh residential neighborhood so the bombardment is still ongoing while the threat and the warning of the evacuation is also still ongoing Nick of course it is you've had to flee south of course while doing your job as a journalist and yet your experience s like everybody else there the depth of the of this challenge of going evacuating South looking after your family while you're doing it and it's tough enough for adults what about the children right what do you even tell them it's very tough for the children make I mean having to take the children like that very early in the morning and and barely taking anything like we we just took Necessities with us um little food that we could spare uh some bread some little food that we could take from our fridges because we don't want anything to spoil some clothes that we were able to take but them leaving here leaving their home like that in such te horror under the bombardment and and coming even here we're talking about now the Gaza Strip a place without without electricity without uh water without internet how how like how difficult can it be for adults how how how how terrible is it for the the the young ones and the and the kids to to live in such a a place now and and there's an acate shortage of food and supplies everywhere so it's not like we can buy them everything they want or whatever they want there's a shortage of everything living under really really difficult humanitarian conditions now is the entire population of the god strip Nick yna thanks for that update there from KH Yunis in the south of Gaza yumna Els our reporter let's speak to another one of our reporters also in Gaza safwat Al kalut safat I understand you have an update for us yes uh I uh I was just talking to one Palestinians are holding a foreign nationality in Gaza uh they he told me that uh last night they received emails from their uh he he he confirmed to me that uh uh all the foreign nationalities in Gaza including Europeans Canadians Americans and even Chinese they were informed about a new Arrangement that their embassies or the ministry their foreign Ministries uh arrange with the Israeli foreign Ministry to allow the foreigners in Gaza I'm talking about Palestinians also who carry who carry hold foreign nationalities uh that they can leave the G between uh midday today g g time which is uh 8 GMT timing until uh 11 GMT so they have like three or four hours to leave the crossing uh they the the guy or the the friend he told me that when they arrive to the crossing they informed that the arrangement has been uh has been cancelled and they are waiting for new uh instructions uh from their government or from their foreign Ministries uh he told me that the way to reach ra Crossing was not easy and that they have received special coordinates that were provided by uh Israeli army or that they have to follow special coordinates a special path to avoid uh direct targeting by the Israeli Army and sa as you report that news uh you you also have made the journey down to kanun what is your experience experience being there look as uh as you know I I managed to uh to reach the south of the Gaza Strip or specifically Central area which is very attached to the South uh more or one 1 Hour 1 hour and a half ago there was a heavy shooting or heavy bombardment and then we realized that the target was a house uh the the ministry ambulances rush we I could hear them from where I'm staying uh then we realized that the the the target was a family and they're Waring the the the the residence of the family there so that there are casualties at least three dead and seven other injured some of them are in critical condition the ambulances are still there trying to pick up or to grab some of the barriers of the of the casualties all right we'll leave that for the time being thanks very much a reporting from KH unit in Gaza well Hamas has fired more Rockets from Gaza into Southern Israel this was the scene in the city of ashalon after Rockets struck some areas uh there are no reports of casualties let's bring in Stephanie Decker who's in ashalon and Southern Israel close to the Border uh with Gaza so Steph where you are tell us what the situation is and what's happening around three heavy barrages of rockets since we arrived here about two hours ago one as we we were driving into the city another one and then just in the last 45 minutes or so a very heavy barrage we went into the bomb shelter which is uh something that is all across the cities uh along the border that Israelis have access to and there were multiple interceptions right over our heads the bomb shelter shook six or seven uh interceptions this is a city that has been heavily targeted by um by rocket fire you can see some of the uh the impact that it's had here over the last uh five or six days or so um Marina can show you across the way and then here as well at the top of this Residential Building um there was a hit uh and more particularly in this area more impacts now a lot of people remain here they tell us that they don't want to leave they want to remain in their homes one man we spoke to said you know if I could guarantee that my family was safe I would take up a gun uh and join the fight but I I can't do that uh the people on on this side of the Border Nick are are in Shock H at what happened at the attack by Hamas the fact that their military uh couldn't uh protect them for so long so it's the people are completely in shock and they're very much behind this military offensive they are very much behind uh eliminating Hamas completely we've heard from the Israeli Army saying this is their target of course we have seen multiple Wars on Gaza over the years this time it is everything is different um the Army saying that what is its goal its goal is to fully eliminate Hamas and its leadership uh so this is something that uh they say is the end game of course when it comes to Gaza it it really does need a political solution um to change anything but that's what everyone will tell you here both Israelis and Palestinians that everything has changed here things are unpredictable things are very dangerous um and nobody really knows what's going to happen next we are expecting a ground offensive at some point now reading between the lines you heard what safwat said that said there we've also been hearing this from some sources that they're very close to reaching a deal to allow jeel Nationals and foreign Nationals who hold us other European nationalities to exit through the Rafa border crossing with Egypt now perhaps you could assess that a ground offensive maybe wouldn't happen before that gets achieved but certainly the military buildup around here extensive the biggest buildup uh the biggest coolup of Reserve service in Israel's history um and just to update you there's been also um two infiltrations two Palestinian shot dead in Hal o which is close to the Gaza border which still gives you a sense that there is still um the Army still hasn't been able to fully secure the Border areas when it comes to infiltrations Steph we seem to be playing something of a waiting game now what do you see in terms of Israeli military preparations yes well along the border certainly extremely heavy uh buildup tanks apcs artillery yesterday we were at an artillery position constant bombardment of outgoing um and you can hear it all along the border a lot of air strikes lot of our but it's it's not managing at the moment certainly to uh to eliminate the rocket fire that is still consistently coming out of Gaza to these areas even Tel Aviv earlier today which is of course more long range Rockets being used all right Steph thanks for that Steph deer reporting that thank
