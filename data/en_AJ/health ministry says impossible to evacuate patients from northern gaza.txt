well it's just past 0900 GMT that's midday in Gaza amid the destruction fear and the Bloodshed caused by Israel's bombardment its Army tells 1.1 million Palestinians in Northern Gaza to evacuate to the South within 24 hours that includes un staff hundreds of thousands of people Sheltering in un schools and Clinics and Palestinian refugees in some of the largest camps in Gaza un Aid workers say the relocation of so many people is possible the Israeli military says it will quote operate significantly against Hamas positions in the coming days but the arm group has responded by calling on Palestinians to stay in their homes Israel has killed more than 1500 Palestinians since Saturday when Hamas launched a military offensive Hamas says those bombardments have killed 13 people including foreigners who they had captured in Israel during Saturday's operation the Israeli Army says it's dropped 6,000 bombs on Gaza since the war with Hamas began and more keep falling every hour more than 423,000 Palestinians that's nearly 20% of gaza's population have now been forced from their homes joining us on the phone from KH UN in Gaza is our correspondent yumna eled yumna you are where the Israelis say that 1.1 million Palestinians in Gaza should head to to get out of Gaza City ahead of a possible military in of some sort talk us through the Journey that you've had to make yes Rob well me and my family uh with other neighbors in our building uh we almost all the the square of where we lived um moved to hanun now the problem is that uh the cars were really afraid to go all the way from Gaza City to Han unit it's It's a Long Way Drive and the streets are not safe most of the streets are bombarded so we have to take different grots we have to look for the base for the best uh uh streets to to drive into until we got here to kanun now the problem is Rob as much as that uh Journey was was scary we did take it because at the same time we don't want to risk that we stay in Gaza City under uh heavy and intensive bombardment more than what we have already been going through the past days uh so we we did what we could uh but at the same time there's thousands thousands hundreds of thousands now that are trapped in Goda C they want to come to hunit but there is no place for them now considering that hunit has already been under heavy bombardment uh uh Rafa has been under heavy bombardment all these people uh from around around the the two governments have also come to kanun and there's no places the people who are also in the in these two governments themselves who have lost their homes who have their homes and neighborhoods bombarded already had moved into un and un fa facilities and schools and and and shelters whatever they could so now there is an enormous number of people who are in these places over the capacity much more over the capacity than what these uh places can take and at the same time there are thousands more who are calling to find places to come into now I'm talking literally Rob that every single home in of the residential homes that are still available in 10 units are hosting families about two or three families from Gaza so the numbers are like in full capacity in the homes of the people the UN shelters the UN schools in the in in kanun govern and people are still yet calling to find places and they can't find places the problem is we're talking about a million1 uh uh 100,000 people who are supposed to evacuate that is extremely impossible what are the 300,000 people over 300,000 people that are already in Gaza in unor what schools going to do that number alone where is it going to go the people that are shipa hospital or in gazda uh City hospitals where are they going how are they going to leave those injured those people who are in in in in in in really in really uh difficult situations and they can't move and we're talking about a place that doesn't have ambulances doesn't have uh uh transportation for evacuation for families or people this is how the situation is yumna thank you very much indeed uh that's yumna ask to talking to us from K Unice I want to go to Dr Med abas he's director general of gaza's Ministry of Health he's joining us on the phone from Gaza thank you very much indeed for being with us can you give us an indication of the situation at the hospital where you are at the moment well they have collapsing the hospitals now are not able to operate anymore we have no electricity we have no enough medications and the angel people are lying on the ground in the emergency rooms and waiting before the operation rooms in fact we have mentioned that those civilians have being suffering from the beginning of this crisis until now the situation is worsening every moment there are new every moment there are new injured and new killed Palestinians in fact if this situation continues like this without any humanitarian Corridor it means that we hundreds of people will be lost every day this is a humanitarian disaster pure humanitarian disaster and I think the only solution is stop this war at once and immediately bring in Gaza health professionals to assess us and to bring Hospital fields and field hospitals and to bring medication medical supply and immediately there should be some electricity by any means to support these hospitals beside of course having the portable water for the patients for the hospitals and for the the community in Gaza thre now when we talk about those who left their houses and became become displaced in schools they are now more than 400,000 I don't know how much and we are hearing now about about the displacement of 1. 1 million Palestinians I mean what happens now is a disaster uring in front of the International Community and there is no no one intervening to solve so let me ask you about Israel's demand that 1.1 million Palestinians leave Gaza City and move South clearly you have hospitals and medical centers which are full of people needing treatment from a logistical point of view is that something that is possible can you actually move these people serve to get them to some degree of safety no there's no way to move them because because first of all they left their their country on the 1948 and then they left it in the 197 and now and and now what the hell should the Palestinian Go I mean there is no room left for the Palestinian to live in it seems that this genocide occurring now is aiming to eradicate all cians in Palestine this is the only goal which which we can see now because the the victims of this conflict are just civilians among my people in Palestine they are just dying they're killing children women elderly people and people and being are in their house while they are unated so let me ask you this in the event that it becomes necessary for U people in Gaza to leave the city and move South possibly because of military action uh from the Israelis we don't know what that what form that might take what are you and your staff going to do we would remain our hospitals no no way I mean no way we not leave our patients we not leave our ministry we not leave those those victims we will never ever leave them of course we are staying with them no way with regard to the kind of conditions that you're operating in you mentioned earlier that you had no power you have no portable water if I understand it correctly what help are you able to provide to those that you're treating at the moment we're offering life saving Services now and we are cooperating with ngos all the pales ngos which are still remaining in the health sector and guys a STP to referring them to those cases as much as we can waiting and hoping that there will be humanitarian C immediately to evacuate those seriously injured to any other country like Egypt or Jordan Dr medad abas we appreciate that you are very busy at the moment as of course are your staff director general of gaza's Ministry of Health thank you very much indeed
