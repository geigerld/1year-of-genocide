at least one Palestinian has been killed during overnight raids in the occupied West Bank City of Janine there were incursions in cilia and near occupied East Jerusalem armored vehicles were accompanied by bulldozers which destroyed infrastructure in Janine nearly 400 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank since Israel increased raids in October and a group of Israeli settlers has attacked Palestinians south of the city of nais in the occupied West Bank at least two Palestinians were injured when set has opened fire in the village of AA Witnesses say the attackers also set at least one home on fire let's go to our correspondent Rory Chalin who has been monitoring uh all of this activity for us from occupied East Jerusalem and a night of Violence by both Israeli Army and settlers in the occupied territories Rory yeah the West Bank continues to to simmer with unrest and violence and we've seen more of that overnight the most significant of these incidents was taking place in Janine where the Israeli Army went into the city uh and operated there for between uh five and six hours now there were clashes uh between the Israeli Army and armed groups in the area there are many armed groups in in Janine uh which is one of the reasons why the Israeli Army focuses often on that place there representatives of the Armed factions of Hamas and and fata and Islamic Jihad as well so often the Israeli army goes in uh with the intention of making arrests or destroying infrastructure uh or sometimes it goes in with the explicit intention uh to kill as well we understand there have been clashes elsewhere uh in cilia too uh and Nablus and the one Palestinian young man a 19-year-old uh has been orted to have died after he was injured uh I think he was shot and then the Israeli Army blocked access to the medical Crews and and he bled to death so that's what's been going on in in that part of the West Bank but then we yeah yes Rory I was going to ask you we're also hearing reports that the heads of Israeli intelligence and Security will be traveling to Egypt soon for talks on the release of captives in Gaza in exch for Palestinians in Israeli jails what are you hearing about that yeah so the US Administration Joe Biden's White House really really really wants a deal uh and it is been pushing Israel to come back to the negotiating table that is after the uh Israeli rejection of a Hamas proposal that was based on an agreement or frame work that was drawn up between the intelligence Chiefs of the United States and Israel and Egypt with input from the ceries as well in Paris that deal fell apart uh fairly quickly as soon as it hit the reality of Hamas and Israeli uh politics but the United States are trying to get everyone back around the table again to work over this uh for another time so there had been a lot of doubt about whether Israel was even going to send a delegation to Cairo but we have heard from both haret newspaper and uh Jerusalem Post not officially announced but they have been speaking to unnamed Israeli officials who say that the head of Mossad that's the external uh intelligence and Security Agency and the head of shinette that's the internal security and intelligence agency along with army officials are going to be going to Cairo and they will there be talking with Bill Burns the head of the CIA and the C prime minister the head of the Israeli intelligence as well so of course the the main issue there the big Gulf that they have to try and Bridge again is this impa between the Hamas position and the Israeli position Hamas wants to exchange prisoners and captives for an end to the war and Israel says that the war has to go on until Hamas is destroyed yeah interesting that these talks are very much still taking place behind the scenes Roy thank you very much for that Roy challeng with the latest live and occupied East Jerusalem
