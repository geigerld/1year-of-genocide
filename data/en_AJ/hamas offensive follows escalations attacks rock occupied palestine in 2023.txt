in December 2022 the most far-right government in Israel's history came to power notable inclusions are national security minister Ben gavier previously convicted of supporting a terrorist organization and Finance Minister bzel smartd a settler well known for racist comments and extreme policies they quickly approved plans to build thousands of homes for Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank construction that's illegal under international law the new policy led to an increase in Israeli raids and attacks by both Israeli settlers and Palestinian Fighters these are scenes from haara in February hundreds of Israelis from a nearby settlement went on a rampage through the town of 8,000 Palestinians after two settlers were gunned downridge called for haara to be erased hu was targeted again on Friday Israeli settlers shot a resident in the heart after a Palestinian gunman opened fire at an Israeli vehicle Palestinian armed resistance has increased since March last year after Israel's incursion at alaxa mosque and renewed raids on the occupied West Bank and Gaza Israel has repeatedly said it will root out these fighters in early July it launched a two-day assault in Janine refugee camp in the occupied West Bank more than 3,000 Palestinians fled the air strikes bulldozers armored tanks and drones and this was the result Janine's Deputy Governor said 80% of the homes of the camp were destroyed damaged or burned attacks and raids take place in occupied territories nearly every day in April isra forces attacked Muslim worshippers in alaka mosque during Ramadan prayers an action the UN condemned as excessive and in recent days thousands of ultra nationalist Jews have been entering the mosque compound escorted by Israeli police a move condemned by the Jordanian wak the custodians of the mosque Hamas officials have long said they will respond to Israel at a time and place of very choosing but Saturday's attack seemed to take many by surprise Laura Khan Al jazer so there's been a global concern over the spike in violence between Israelis and Palestinians got two correspondents monitoring that uh Ros Jordan's in Washington DC Harry forcet in London we're going to start with Washington DC and Rosland uh so Ros what's tell us more about the US response and how that shaping you up well essentially US government support is for Israel Hamas has been a terrorist organization according to the US government since 1997 so you would be hardpressed to find anyone whether in the Biden Harris Administration or in Congress for that matter anyone who would support Hamas just as an organization never mind the attack that was launched overnight Friday into Saturday into Southern Israel uh the Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has made the rounds of the Sunday public affairs shows here in Washington and he not only repeated the US government's support for Israel and its right to defend itself its territory and its citizens but blinkin has also indicated that the us is going to announce some new steps some new support for Israel as it tries to respond to this attack later on Sunday we don't know yet the shape of what this support is but supposedly it is in response to additional Aid that the Israeli government has made to Washington in the last 24 hours it is also worth uh pointing out that uh blinkin during his rounds of phone calls on Saturday did have occasion to speak with Mahmud abas the uh Palestinian Authority uh leader as well as speaking with other Regional leaders including his counterparts in Egypt in Jordan in Turkey uh really to try to figure out how they all can try to deescalate tensions even though at this point it's now about how to end this two-day long War Ros thanks for that that's a picture in Washington DC what's the story in Europe Harry foret standing by there in London for us and Harry Benin Netanyahu the Israeli Prim Minister has been speaking to some European leaders that's right yes he says he spoken to the leaders of Germany Ukraine Italy and Britain uh saying that each of those leaders expressed their unqualified support for Israel's right to defend itself uh also another line just coming through from Germany in the last few minutes that the uh government is reviewing its policy of Aid to Palestinians worth hundreds of millions of Euros or or US dollars per year the minister in charge of that program saying these attacks Mark a terrible fracture and some debates between right and left uh in German politics uh some on the right the conservatives saying that a new start is needed and that terrorists should never be funded again um there has also been a much wider scale of condemnation from other European powers as well I think a lot of the concentration a lot of the reporting certainly is about the sheer scale of the targeting killing kidnapping of civilians on such a huge scale inside Israeli territory and taking so many of those captives back into Gaza uh some of those are being found to be foreign Nationals one missing Britain uh one woman whose body was apparently displayed uh now said to be a German citizen so concerns on that front as well and concerns being expressed about Jewish communities inside Europe as well the Italian government the French and German governments talking about the needs to ensure security at Jewish sites and we've had a tweet from the Home Secretary here in the UK the interior Minister on Sunday talking about rejecting and uh stopping any attempts to stir up hatred against British Jews doing everything necessary to protect Jewish communities and showing zero tolerance for what she called the glorification of terrorism she's calling for the police to use the full force of the law against anyone exhibiting displays of support for Hamas and other such groups Harry thanks for that that's a picture in Europe Harry for reporting from London London Let's cross now to Yan neeland who's Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council joins us now from Oslo good to see you there Mr egeland first of all your reaction to this escalating crisis well a a terrible situation has uh overnight gotten much much worse my organization has been on the ground now for decades uh in gasa in the West Bank will become much worse now because of this attack against the Israeli civilians I followed myself now the Israeli Palestinian Conflict for nearly 50 years every time leaders military and other leaders choose to exert violence on civilians they inflict hor Horrors not only on the other side but also on their on their um own side this will become much much worse in the next days apart from the the tragedy of what's happened it's the fact that this it was a seemingly indiscriminate attack by her mass fighters on just so many Israelis yeah indeed completely indiscriminate the Rockets are the missiles are but also go they go around shooting random civilians they took hostages among random civilians of course this is now the the images spread around the world it's a disaster for for for the Palestinian cause because now the retaliation will be enormous it will again be civilians paying the price uh there is one way out and that is a very strong United International pressure on all the political and Military Elites uh that they have to deal escalate and have now to look at the root causes for these conflicts yeah but will they we've been saying that for for decades haven't we and and the Israeli perspective is that this was an entirely unprovoked attack and certainly uh it's time to consider as a matter of urgency the the cause and effect here of all those people living under blockade in Gaza 56 years of military occupation and so on and so forth but we've talked about that as I say for many many years and it's got nowhere and now we are in this terrible situation yes we are and and then one is talking about teaching the other side a lesson so they will not repeat any violence of course this leads to more cycles of of violence and that's my point the sites are incapable of putting an end to the endless cycles of violence that's why we need the US the Arab countries there has been talks of late there can be again talks but then there has been much more pressure the retaliation I mean the Hamas says this is Revenge Israel will now rightfully say well we were attack now we will exert Revenge it will be with children paying the price you hear all around condemnation from the liks of the US the UK and France but there's no mention no reference to the causes behind this and and so why is that and why is there such a failure of the international effort well I mean the international effort I mean to to today any politicians in the west will look at the uh Hamas attack and will say we're with Israel and it right to defend ourselves but of course part of the problems that we humanitarians we are neutral impartial independent and on the ground and in this Crossfire what we see is to completely polarized images of what is happening in in in large parts of the Arab world the large part of the nonwestern world they will now watch mosques and apartment blocks and so on being attacked of course in the western America and in Israel they see children being kidnapped humiliated killed by by by armed grown men those are the two images and that they lead to the two sides dehumanizing it right from the point of view of people on the ground and in the as you say in the coming Crossfire that that seems to be inevitably coming uh and the children and the elderly and everybody who's there within Gaza about to to face this from a humanitarian perspective what do you do to prepare for it and and how can you make things easier when it does come well I mean we in ref count we have hundreds of colleagues on the ground in West Bank and in Gaza where there we have tried to rebuild now time and again in Gaza each time you are able to rebuild fewer of the of the total uh amount of of of Civilian housing that has has been destroyed before there was a new attack same thing this time H the Border closures will make it very difficult for us to come with with relief to people uh there will be power shortages so the health colleagues will not even have power for for hospitals except generat that will be soon be lacking fuel it will be a nightmare even to help uh the innocent civilians Yan egland good to speak to you and get your perspective on this important perspective thank you so much Yan Egan Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council speaking to us from Oslo thank you
