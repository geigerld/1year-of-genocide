well Hamas has fired more Rockets from Gaza into Southern Israel this was the scene in the city of ashalon after Rockets struck some areas there are no reports of casualties and we'll go now to Al's Charles Stratford who's in in southern Israel and so Charles just give us an update on the situation there and the movements by Israeli military overnight well we just had another attempted or another attack Miss or Rockets fired from the Gaza Strip in the last 15 or 20 minutes ago they were intercepted by the so-called Iron Dome defense system just over our heads actually and it's been like that on and off all day here in stot um was a similar attack this morning whereby four missiles actually got through managing to penetrate or avoid the uh the defense system One landing on a railway line another on a religious school um no casualties involved in any of these attacks um we've seen a lot more tank movement a lot more military movement in the last day or so the large what sounded like an impact there actually that did actually sound possibly like incoming but we can't confirm that so just going back to troop movement and and military hardware we've seen yeah hundreds hundreds of Tanks apcs various various other um military hardware that have moved into this area over the last few days interestingly today and yesterday we're beginning to see those pieces of equipment being moved away into areas that we cannot get to because that is a military uh closed military zone now whether this indeed is an indication of preparations uh for an eventual ground Invasion into Gaza we can't confirm but it wouldn't be inconceivable that they were being moved if that was the case into some more forward operating position um meanwhile the Israeli Army has said that uh Palestinian Fighters targeted a tank in the northern Gaza Strip and Israeli tank um at least five soldiers Israeli soldiers injured in that attack two critically in terms of civilians in this areas you can see the streets behind me pretty much empty very very few people still remaining in these areas these towns very close to the Border we're around 3 kilm from the G [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it here in stot but yeah all eyes are on what could happen as many people are speculating in the next few hours just with respect to that Corridor that I reported or we were reporting on earlier today that has now expired it was a duration between 10 between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. that the Israeli military said that they were going to give gazans wanting to flee that Northern section of the Gaza Strip they promised they said that they would not shell those two highways um we've also heard the reports that we can't verify though that shelling of the Southern regions of the Gaza Strip is ongoing but as I say that window that was that was offered by the Israeli Army this morning has now expired so yeah it's going to be very interesting as to what happens in the next few hours and and very terrifying of course for hundreds of thousands if not more Palestinians who still remain in that nor section of the Gaz and strep Charles talking about the buildup of military hardware we're seeing pictures of that of tanks and so forth uh in the area what about infantry units are you seeing any evidence of that because it's going to need people on foot to go to go into uh Gaza well we have seen we have seen vast amounts of soldiers in in the area as well we know that the Israeli Army has said that at least 300,000 reservists are going to be called in potentially for any fight and of course that's in addition to the regular army we've seen various units some of which we understand could well be you know special operatives um it's interesting to see the different vehicles that are being driven around this Zone as well um a lot of if you like civilian or seemingly on the surface at least civilian vehicles with a lot of antennas a lot of radio antennas um sort of low trying to keep a low footprint but in the same time as I say there are thousands of of troops that we've seen we spoke to a few yesterday in the Kuts of biri one of those Kuts that was attacked infiltrated by hammmer Fighters at least 108 Israeli civilians killed in that kabut and the soldiers we spoke to were very boyed very determined um and morale was high they said look we're ready to go in and we will win um we've also seen yes truckloads of of of soldiers being brought into various areas um or passing areas where we are allowed to be and as I say going into these this this Zone this military exclusion Zone that we understand or we know is even closer to the Gaza Strip but uh yeah as to whether this is we this is this is before that expected land Invasion that remains to be seen but all evidence would suggest that that could well be the case and Charles what about residents there what are you hearing from them I've been reading about how the mayor strot was calling on the prime minister to evacuate residents to areas outside the immediate range of rockets well today we've been coming here pretty much every day for the last NE on week um and it is safe to say that today is the emptiest that we've seen it now that could be as a result of it being Shabbat obviously the Jewish weekend the Jewish Jewish holy day so just normally there's very there's much fewer people on the streets anyway but you know you know it would be it wouldn't be inconceivable to think that there are far less people here than there were even two three days ago um the few people that we have spoken to in recent days have said look I've got nowhere else to go um where am I supposed to go one man actually said to us that um he said no on the contrary now is the time to stay I'm determined to stay I will not be moved from here I mean of course this town stot has almost got mythical status in Israel and anybody that follows the the developments um of this of this conflict of the problems that uh that exist here in Israel Palestine everybody knows where this town is because it is hit um so regularly um by by missiles by Rockets fired out of Gaza but seemingly despite obviously the intensity of this attack that happened last week October the 7th despite the fact that this place suffered an infiltration I mean the the police station just down the road here is now completely destroyed that was taken over by we understand at least 10 Hamas Fighters at least 10 bodies were found when we understand an air strike destroyed it by um by the Israeli Air Force um as I say still very very very very few people here at all um and I think it's fair to say that that's a similar scenario right the way um down the strip in Israeli Villages and kotes close to Gaza all right Charles leave it there for the moment speak to you a bit later as as the day goes on the afternoon wears on uh char traford there for thank you
