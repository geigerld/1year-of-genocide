now the international court of justice says that it'll deliver its ruling on Friday on the provisional measures requested by South Africa in its genocide case against Israel in December its government brought the case against Israel accusing it of genocidal acts and its assaults on Gaza it requested emergency measures including for Israel to suspend its military operations in Gaza now the icj's ruling on Friday does not address the fundamental issue of whether Israel is committing genocide that's expected to Take Years instead it'll consider South Africa's request for nine provisional measures now if granted that could include an order for Israel to stop its military campaign and ensure Palestinians have access to humanitarian assistance the court could also declin to order the interim measures Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already hinted that he would not feel Bound By any such order that's despite orders from the icj being legally binding and not able to be appealed however the court has little power to enforce its verdicts earlier we spoke to Michael Becker a former associate lawyer at the icj the international criminal court of justice International court of justice I should say icj will deliver a ruling on Friday on South Africa's requests for action on Israel's violations in Gaza in its applications you'll recall South Africa accuses Israel of carrying out genocide in Gaza and it asks the court to indicate provisional measures to act against further severe irreparable harm to the rights of Palestinian people to prevent and punish genocide let's speak to Michael Becker about this he's an assistant professor at Trinity College Dublin School of Law and was formerly working at the international court of justice Michael good to have you with us so just for our International audience to recap what's happened here about two weeks ago the icj heard South Africa's arguments uh at at the hag then it heard Israel's defense and now it's deciding on the provisional measures what exactly are these provisional measures and which where do you think the court will go on Friday when it decides this it's really important to understand that what the court is going to be deciding on Friday is not whether Israel is in breach of any of its obligations under the genocide convention those are as you've said South Africa's main claims in the in the case this is about provisional measures that's a kind of emergency relief or interim relief uh that South Africa is seeking while the case is pending and so South Africa has asked for a number of things but the two maybe most prominent requests are first for an order that would direct Israel to suspend all military operations in Gaza and secondly for an order that would direct Israel to not impede and indeed facilitate the effective delivery of humanitarian assistance into Gaza and so how the Court addresses those two requests if it decides to indicate provisional measures at all is what to really look out for on Friday okay so two requests is the court likely to Grant one request and deny another one because I understand this has happened in the past like in the case of uh uh the um in the Bosnia case a few years ago right so first we we'll see if the court says that South Africa met the basic test for provisional measures to be to be ordered in the first Place many icj experts and I would agree with with this view think that South Africa did do enough to show that its claims under the genocide convention are at least plausible and very importantly that the Palestinian population of Gaza faces a real and imminent risk of irreparable harm and nothing that's happened in the last two weeks I think has changed that assessment so the court can the court isn't limited to what South Africa has asked for the South the court doesn't have to say yes or no to South Africa's specific requests if it decides to issue provisional measures it can formulate whatever set of measures it thinks is most appropriate okay and so while I think the court will want to say something about uh Israel's military operations I'm not convinced that they will be willing to go quite as far as South Africa has asked them to go ordering a complete suspension military activities okay so you don't think it it's likely to order the suspension of military activities even though we know that the icg of course is part of the UN system and we've heard time in time from the UN Secretary General in the last few weeks he's called for a ceasefire in Gaza you think that that is not likely to influence uh the decision well I think it's more likely that the court will say something that's quite similar to what we saw in the UN security resolution back on the 22nd of December so that would be uh instructing Israel to ensure that any military operations taking place are in accordance with international law and abide by Israel's other obligations under international law right uh I think the court also will address the request relating to humanitarian assistance and direct Israel to ensure that it's not doing anything that impedes the effective delivery of humanitarian assistance in accordance with international law all right Michael speaking here hypothetically of course if the court grants and rules in favor of these provisional measures that South Africa has requested and perhaps other measures like you've said what happens after that I mean is there an enforcement mechanism here so the court can't enforce its own decisions that rests with other actors within the International System uh in this scenario it's difficult to imagine Security Council playing a role so really what this will do is Place additional political pressure on Israel to work towards uh a ceasefire we know that that's already taken place anyway but this will be an additional pressure point on Israel and also it will place additional pressure I think on some of Israel's strongest allies to do what they can behind the scenes to try to push this towards some kind of resolution and address the humanitarian situation on the ground okay one last question Michael before we let you go in we really appreciate your your expertise on this um they are deciding on the provisional measures on Friday the court as you mentioned early on is not ruling on the genocide allegations the genocide case against uh Israel at this time how long will it take to make that ruling and what do you think will be the likely outcome having heard South Africa's arguments and Israel's defense well icj cases take a long time we wouldn't expect to see a decision on the merits of this case for years this is something that will take multiple years to be sorted out and I think it's premature in some ways to offer any prediction here because yes we heard each side's preliminary set of arguments but both sides will have the opportunity to put forward much more uh developed legal arguments and importantly support those arguments with evidence going forward but that said the standard to demonstrate genocidal intent under international law is very high that shouldn't take away from the fact that other unlawful acts might be taking place but to demonstrate genocidal intent is still going to be a very high threshold for South Africa to meet on the merits Michael Becker thank you very much for your expertise and and just breaking that down for us Michael Becka joining us there from uh Dublin thank you for your time
