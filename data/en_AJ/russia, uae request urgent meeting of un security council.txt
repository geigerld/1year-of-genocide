Kristen salumi now who joins us live from United Nations Headquarters in New York Kristen certainly a fluid situation at the moment has there been any immediate reaction from the UN to this air strike on the hospital Russia and the United Arab Emirates have called for an emergency security council meeting on Wednesday 10: a.m. tomorrow uh in response to this latest strike but we're still waiting for a reaction from the Secretary General uh we have asked for a response uh and have not received it yet but I can say that earlier today the sg's spokesperson said that no place in Gaza is safe anymore and civilians are paying the price that was before the hospital was struck and after a un school was hit killing six people uh in response to that the uh commissioner general for unra which runs the school which was serving as a shelter for hundreds if not thousands of people uh said that it was outrageous he said it was a flagrant disregard for the lives of civilians uh the UN has also pointed out that under humanitarian law civilians and particularly the wounded at hospitals are supposed to be protected that is part of the rules of War um but of course in Gaza right now it's not just bombs that people are worried about it's the fact that they're running out of water fuel and food and medicine and so the UN has been uh very concerned about this latest escalation uh and has been very focused on trying to get Aid in Kristen Russia proposed a ceasefire resolution but the last we heard discussions were continuing what's the update there right well the Russian resolution was was voted down it didn't get enough support uh it was a very generic call for a ceasefire it also condemned terrorism and condemned uh attacks on civilians uh the United States said it was outrageous that it didn't mention Hamas and that any resolution from the security Council would have to uh include a condemnation of Hamas and The Taking of Civilian hostages so Brazil has been working on another resol ution that does just that it condemns Hamas and it calls for a humanitarian pause to allow the UN and other Aid agencies to get the needed supplies into Gaza and we are waiting for that to play out we know there's been a lot of negotiations a lot of back and forth we were expecting a meeting on that in the coming hour however we have learned from two diplomatic sources that the United States is asked to delay that meeting and to delay that vote given that President Joe Biden is on his way to Israel for consultations but we've also heard that the 10 elected non-permanent members of the security Council uh have been pushing for that vote to take place especially now that the hospital uh has been bombed that the school has been bombed and so forth there's clearly a a growing sense of urgency among many member states as well as the UN uh relief agencies about the situation okay we appreciate that update so much uh that was Christen salumi outside the United Nations Headquarters
