hello again you're watching Al ja's continued coverage of Israel's war on Gaza and in 24 days of that war the number of Palestinians killed has now risen to 8,36 that includes at least 3,000 children that's one child killed every 10 minutes in the occupied West Bank 121 people have been killed the Israeli government says more than 1,400 Israelis were killed in hamas's attack on October the 7th and the Israeli military says there are 200 39 captives being held in Gaza Hamas has released video of three of those captives it's holding in Gaza they are heard criticizing the Israeli Prime Minister Benin Netanyahu and they call on the government to release Palestinians held in Israeli prisons in exchange for captives let's hear now from AKA Elder who's a contributor to heret newspaper joins us live now from Tel Aviv uh for this perspective from Israel and AA this video it's it's highly emotive and uh played by Hamas for full political gain described by Netanyahu as cruel psychological propaganda how is it being received in Israel it comes Nick in the middle of uh a huge campaign uh right now it is started starting next to my house there is an objective Israeli soldier who by the way has uh an American passport his uh father met with uh President Biden when he was here and uh visited also New York and uh I think that what you see now in the streets in Tel Aviv and elsewhere uh is just the tip of uh the iceberg uh just to remind you Nick in 20 2006 an Israeli soldier was abducted gilad sh shal and until 2011 for five years there was a huge campaign and uh we're talking about a single Israeli soldier now just compare it to what's happening now with women 30 little children abducted uh the Israeli public opinion is divided between those who believe that Israel should pay any price and you mentioned releasing the uh Palestinian prisoner for Gil Shalit Israel released 1,000 Hamas prisoners including isma hania uh on the other hand there are people like for instance uh in his press conference nany said that when he was asked about the Gil shal deal that actually he admitted that uh this was a mistake he should uh review this policy again well so do you think there's a sense that the captives that are held in Gaza and their safety or not perhaps how is it being factored in by the military planners of the ongoing assault the uh uh message which is coming out of the Israeli government is uh if you would uh to put it in a slogan is that we are going to destroy the Hamas as if we don't have to care about the captives and we'll do everything to get out the capus as if we uh don't have to destroy Kamas and uh actually Nick it's it's a paradox because the Israeli Army and even Netanyahu knows that uh every day that passes with uh those children and women in jail and while Israel is striking both from the air and from the ground the chances to get them out are getting uh little and little uh and uh the pressure from the public opinion is greater now as netan said in reaction to the release of this video he said it's a kind of uh a psychological propaganda yes and uh promise those women that Israel will do its best but what they also said they asked for a ceasefire and this is something that Netanyahu with his popularity uh is not able to do right now because he promised not to stop until he will put an end to the Hamas and this may take months if not more than a year right so he's already under a lot of pressure as you've been alluding to uh so really this just Stacks it up even more yeah uh and uh there are mothers who uh are writing articles for instance there was an article today in the AR that they cry for their children and uh in in the Israeli public opinion rescuing captives let alone children and women is sacred it's more important than everything so these generals who on television are trying to explain the public opinion that uh well uh this is a sacrifice that we have to do in order to make sure that uh the Hamas will not do this again and the Hamas knows that the Israeli public opinion is very fragile and they are doing what I expected them to do they are using this merchandise human merchandise in a way uh and uh they will put more and more pressure both on the Israeli public opinion the United States because there are more than 20 American citizens there are French there are th in order to get what they want and what they want at the beginning was to get their prisoners back home but now they're looking for something else they are looking for their own Survival and the survival of the Hamas and this is something that Nan politically cannot afford and AA one more thing what what's the general sense of public opinion the mood in Israel of course the anger about October the 7th runs very very very deep but what is the overall sense do you think I imagine it's polarized but sense about the scale of Israeli bombardment and and the mass deaths that we've been seeing within Gaza yeah Nick I'm afraid that uh the public opinion in Israel is moving more and more to the right and you can see it even in uh what's happening between Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs the an attack on dormitories in natania where there are Israeli Arabs who are living there the police is arresting Israeli Palestinians for ins ments on social media U it's now becoming a kind of a zero some game it's us or there and there is no mercy because uh if uh you pity the Palestinians at the end you will pay the price so it's actually a battle on the narrative and right now the narrative in Israel is that we are the victims and all Hamas people all sorry all the people of God they supported Hamas they deserve it unfortunately this is the mood right now n all right we'll leave it there for the moment do you appreciate your analysis AA that's AA Elder a contributor to heret newspaper joining us from Tel Aviv thank you
