go back now to Texas uh and join Heidi Joe Castro because uh it's the situation seems to have developed a little bit more uh since we last spoke a few moments ago at the University of Texas Heidi what's going [Music] on that's right so Hal so we have this uh circle of chanters they're protecting an encampment that was built here in the last hour then we have this this is the new development we have uh rows of Texas Troopers also univers Texas police who have just arrived on the scene here in about the last 10 minutes I just heard the police announcement saying that it is time to disperse for all of these protesters to leave immediately or risk arrest and the reason of course that they're taking this seriously and that we're watching this situation is it's really a Tinder Box given what happened here last Wednesday when a very similar scene occurred uh when police officers uh called by the state governor of Texas Greg Abbott along with state troopers similarly dressed came and very uh people have said in a in a in a overwhelming show of force arrested some 57 people so I was here uh after that day happened and up until I have to say so the last hour or so I was almost going to report to you that it seems that that really had a chilling effect because we didn't see their here on UT Austin campus like elsewhere and in fact just this morning speaking to those who had organized the original protest they said yeah students were scared and they were now actually staying off campus to host events and no one really saw coming but suddenly things would shift so quickly and so dramatically in just the last hour so again you're seeing a group of students some are graduates of UT Austin others are community members in Austin who have come on campus here they've linked their arms to protect a few tents that were erected in the middle of that Circle this is the exact same area where we saw those arrests with police on Horseback and riot gear uh injuring some protesters last week and again behind me an ominous sign According to some of the protesters because they are expecting a renewed show of force in the moments to come and talking to them they said that they are not going to run if they are charged that they plan on remaining there calling for the divestment in any weapons manufacturers from the UT endowment and any companies linked to Israel and in support of Palestinian lives in Gaza and they're committed to staying there they said they are worried they are scared about what may happen but that they will remain so of course we'll continue to follow events with you Heidi Joe Castro there for us in the University of Texas obviously we're also monitoring what's going on at Colombia over in New York the same sort of scenario is happening there with uh police surrounding the area expecting uh Theo we'll stay with you I yeah we'll stay with you so I'm seeing the arrest Happening Now shame DJ shame fash head back to Blue SC water for child Mur will be all are they still taking us [Applause] you are watching Al jazer and these are live pictures coming from the University of Texas we wanted you to actually get a sense of the atmosphere there that Heidi Joe Castro has introduced us to over the past hour or so understanding exactly what the chants are from the students and how the police and armed officials there are dealing or will be dealing it seems with the assembled crowds there Heidi Joe Castro I'm sure you can hear us it's very noisy Heidi and we appreciate you might not be able to hear everything that I'm saying but just describe the images uh and the mood uh now it's changed dramatically in the last few minutes our our I don't think Heidi Joe can uh Castro can hear me quite now but of course we can see those pictures the uh State Police uh state troopers have of course uh encircled it seems uh the student protesters in the grounds of the University of Texas uh verbal confrontations there certainly I think that gentleman in the blue shirt was saying he's actually a lecturer uh and he was there to protect his students or certainly record what they are experiencing right now there's another circle of what I would describe would be local police uh who are also uh behind the state troopers but nothing is being done at the moment except a standoff uh the demonstrators incredibly loud and vocal uh expressing their views about freeing Palestine uh and their ins solidarity uh with uh the people of Gaza the strategy is unsure about what the state troopers and the local police are going to do next they moved at least about 100 yards from where they were closer to the students and we I think are just really watching a standoff at the moment this is Heidi I'm so sorry I cannot hear what you're saying but I'm going to tell you what I'm seeing what I'm seeing is what appears to be an impending clash between Texas State Police who as you see are now arriving more and more now they're surrounding this small encampment that is being guarded by student protesters alumni and community members who linked their arms and you're seeing more and more of the police response arriving there has no there has been very little conflict between the two sides and we've been here since the started about an hour ago there was one Professor he said that he was a UT professor was pushed by police uh there was a verbal argument but that seems to have ended but talking to the protesters who are now behind the police lines now they told me in the last few minutes before police arrived that they were very fearful because of what happened last Wednesday when there were arrests there were several students who said they were injured when there was a very strong police response that was called by UT Austin's president Jay Hartzel as well as the Texas governor Greg Abbott and since in the in those ensuing days there had actually been a relatively quiet protest that was not as numerous and talking to protesters they told me that they actually were fearful that something like this would happen again they were fearful of being expelled they were fearful of being arrested or physically harmed and so they have really been taking it easy in these very tightly controlled smaller protests until about an hour and a half ago when this suddenly happened and by this I mean there were people who set up tents for the first time in UT Austin kind of following the model of what we've seen elsewhere Colombia and other university campuses and then immediately after setting up those tents they formed this protective of protesters who linked arms surrounding this encampment over the last few days I've seen nothing but peaceful protest there were people here singing songs having meetings professors teaching about Middle East studies Etc and then suddenly a switch this happened in the last hour and a half again so I'm I cannot hear you I believe we're having some Communications issue but that is what I'm seeing here to keep an eye on if there's any sort of action actually I do see I do see the police now going in they are using Force to remove the physical barricade that looks like either a mattress or a table that protesters had erected to help them establish the circular perimeter around the en let them go let go let them go let you can hear the crowd around me so hell they're chanting let them go let let protesters with their arms linked using umbrellas as protection right now you're seeing our cameraman Ralph o birie he's standing behind a police officer who's using his bike to block media from getting any further in towards the protesters as the police themselves have formed a perimeter around the circle protesters and the people surrounding me surrounding our camera right now are actually community members they're not with the protest themselves per se but you can hear their palese palese free pales everyone watching everyone saying they're here to Bear wi prot earlier telling me and telling the people here please do not leave that they wanted anything that may happen between them and police to be captured on c for those of you watching Al jaer here welcome you're watching uh live pictures now from the University of Texas where within the last half hour state troopers have encircled it seems a group of student protesters on the grounds of the University um and beyond that encircling our local police as well it seems that they are about to or indeed have a strategy to break up this protest in the grounds of the university the state troopers have as yet made no particular arrests they have tried to remove some of the barriers the city police if we can call that in the dark uniforms uh who do not and I'm not dressed in full riot gear have been in a few verbal confrontations with some of the people looking on you can see the backs of their heads now there between them and the students are two rings of security one of the local police in dark uniform one of the state troopers in uh in full riot gear facing the students now the state troopers moved closer to the students within the last 10 minutes or so and as our correspond Heidi Joe Castro who's in there um told us that it was relatively peaceful and uh not too uh serious in terms of the confrontation when the state troopers arrived it got a lot more vocal a lot more noisy obviously uh various cameras trying to give us images of what's going on and obviously much more closer look at the type of armaments that these stap Troopers have local police on bikes uh but they are kitted out uh defensively uh while are Civ Society if we can call them that uh members of the public onlookers don't have anything except voices uh and their cameras out to see what is going on as you can see this is what the state troopers are carrying they seem to be well armed uh there's guns there uh batons perhaps some pepper spray and some those Ruck sacks I think on the side if I see my Munitions correctly with the Civil Society members on the outside of those security uh cordons chanting let them go I let the students go not quite sure what the strategy will be we'll come back to that uh as that develops from the University of Texas why are you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
