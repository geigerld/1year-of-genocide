Israel's Chief military spokesman says its Army surrounded Gaza City and will continue its bombing campaign we have started this war with great pain and we are determined to win to have Victory and to bring back our beloved ones our forces through gulan were able to surround Gaza and arrived by sea also and today we have Northern Gaza and Southern Gaza they arrived by sea and were able to control these areas we're trying to provide a corridor a safe Corridor so that people can leave and move safely but we will continue our air strikes in an intensive way and we will continue to attack and bomb Northern Gaza we're going to go live to Saka who in occupied East Jerusalem SRA obviously you've been reporting on a series of raids and increasing number of raids in that area over the last few days or so but I understand there's been an incident in occupied East Jerusalem what else can you tell us yeah and I'm not sure if you can hear those Sirens that are going off behind me there's a lot of activity uh just down the road there because that's where the old city is and that's where in the last hour two Israeli uh Border Police they're known as uh were stabbed a female and a male officer both in their 20s at one of the gates that allows you into uh the old city known in Arabic as Al Zahra and some call it herat uh uh gate so um this is one of the entrances to uh places uh that are holy uh to many people around the world including Al AA mosque uh compound um now this is just one incident a few days ago we'd also seen a stabbing just down the road uh from here the Palestinian that stabbed these two officers who are in critical condition has been killed um in the Israeli terms they call it neutralized which is something they often do they um don't do arrests they just shoot tap them instantly but this also comes off the back of several raids last night also in occupied East Jerusalem where 23 Palestinians were arrested and it's reported that those arrests are related uh to them posting on social media for example or taking Parts in protests uh against what's happening in Gaza and like what we're seeing in occup occupied West Bank rather we're also seeing these raids increasing here as well where anyone who uh even likes sometimes a post that is against what's happening in Gaza is arrested s let's talk about um Israeli internal politics for a moment apparently there are more signs of Divisions between Benjamin Netanyahu and his government what can you tell us yeah absolutely we've been seeing this since the beginning of the war a lot of toing and frowing between people within this war cabinet so the latest on this is that Prime prime minister uh Benjamin Netanyahu has been uh it's been reported and he's been accused of uh once again uh kind of blaming uh some of the Israeli reservists that took part in anti-government protests throughout the year before this war um who had said that they were going to stop uh taking part in any of these refresher trainings that they usually go through um and he's previously to this war blamed them um for weakening uh the Israeli uh forces and giving Hamas an opportunity to attack Israel well of course that attack happened on October 7 uh prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has now countered those claims saying that Hamas started a war against us because they want to kill us not because of any arguments within us now Benny Gant who's the a former uh uh leader for one of the opposition parties but also one of the main people as part of this war cabinet had actually before that overnight um called on him to retract any statement that implies that the weakness that happened within the military was due to these reservists that wouldn't take part during these anti-government protests he said uh evading responsibility and mudslinging during war is a uh it creates harm to the country now this is also off the back of what is a so-called Unity government an emergency government that is currently uh taking place where there seems to be divisions this has happened before when we were talking about a ground Invasion where the military clearly wanted to go in they had felt that prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was pulling them back perhaps at the time because of trying to ensure the release of these uh captives in Gaza and those divisions were happening but again prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu tried to uh uh portray a sense of unity this won't go down very well with the public because this is a time where Israel should be United in the government with the military and intelligence but clearly there seems to be a crack within and this is showing more and more as the days go by during this war s thank you very much Sak talking to us from occupied East Jerusalem
