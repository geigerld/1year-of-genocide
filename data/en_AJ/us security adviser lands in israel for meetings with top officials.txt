Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to continue with the Gaza offensive he was speaking to soldiers during a visit to a military base in southern Israel the US is warning Israel indiscriminate attacks on civilians are costing the government international support this is going to be a difficult War but there are signs of a breakdown I can see that and surely you can see that too I see your determination to continue until the end and eliminate Hamas an overwhelming victory over Hamas will give us many many advantages both from the power of deterrence and also from the power of persuasion towards the whole world sitting in the stands well Bernard Smith joins us now from Tel Aviv and Bernard we understand the National Security US National Security adviser Jake Sullivan is there how are his meetings going with Israeli officials well he's bringing a message he's carrying a message from Joe Biden from the US President Biden has weathered intense International criticism for his pretty much unwavering support of Israel's prosecution of its war against Hamas and he's re he's reiterated his support very recently he says he will Israel will us will continue to support Israel until Hamas is routed but Biden has warned that public opinion could shift in grave ways for Israel's security and that's the message Jake Sullivan's bringing here he's meeting very shortly with Israel's war cabinet that's Benjamin Netanyahu along with yav Galant the defense minister and Benny Gans and he says he'll be discussing there a timetable to end the war and he says he'll be urging Israel's leaders to move to a different phase from the kind of high intensity operations we've seen today we know already America's begun expressing concern about the High number of Civ civilian casualties that that is being that are being killed by Israel's attacks on Gaza uh the US also wants to see more Aid getting in and there are indications that one of the crossings into Gaza that's been closed since October 7th The Crossing that allows in goods and um piped oil piped fuel that sort of thing that Israel has indicated it might be willing uh to reopen that the problem is Jake Sullivan bringing this message from the US we know already that benjam Netanyahu says and Israel's defense foreign minister said we don't need International support and both say we will carry on Prosecuting this war and Bernard what are we hearing about a split within the war cabinet over the issue of sending mediators or negotiators back to Qatar well more information has been coming out again uh coming out today about why uh the head of mosad has been prevented from traveling to Qatar to look at new ways of opening further channels of communication uh with Hamas and we understand that the war cabinet is in agreement unanimous agreement that they believe that hamas's leadership in Gaza has lost contact with the Hamas leadership in katar so they don't believe that by being in katar there's no way of finding out what Hamas in Gaza is prepared to do in terms of negotiations the differences in the war cabinet come on how to move forward both uh Galant uh both sorry uh both the defense minister and Benjamin Netanyahu they want to take a passive approach they want to wait until Hamas appears with some sort of offer whereas Benny Gant he's more in favor of sending somebody out to katar or the katar is at least being proactive in trying to find out what Hamas wants to offer what Hamas wants to do in terms of any future negotiations but there's pressure from hostage fam of course to bring those captives back and they've written to the prime minister to ask him why he hasn't sent the head of mosad out katar for further negotiations all right we'll leave it there thanks so much Bernard Smith
