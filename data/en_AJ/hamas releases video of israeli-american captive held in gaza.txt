Hamas has released a video of a captive held in Gaza criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu H goldber poin is an American Israeli who was taken captive at the Music Festival on October the 7th going to get more with a correspondent in occupied East Jerusalem Bernard Smith so what's the message in this V video burnard there's an almost thre minute long video of 23-year-old hirsh Goldberg Poland he was taken captive from that super over Rave Festival that was happening in the early hours of October 7th not far from the Gaza fence in fact there's video around of of the time when he was taken captive he was Sheltering in a bomb shelter a grenade was thrown in and he was shown badly injured in fact his left hand was blown off and in the video today we see that he's missing uh that left hand in the video uh he openly criticizes Benjamin Netanyahu who says he not doing enough blames him for not getting the captives out remember of course that when these videos are released these people are not speaking freely they will be told what they can and cannot say by their captors but obviously he we he's clearly being held captive and says he's been underground for about nearly 200 days so there's no spe days so there's no fixed time on the video but we are just now overmarking the 200 days since October the 7th it's re so it's reasonably current and it's the first video we've had actually since in about 3 months Israel calls the use of these videos deplorable psychological warfare Bernard I understand also we're seeing some some reports that the the chief of staff of the Israeli Army is also been in Kyo this is another Dynamic of course to this conflict he's been talking the proposed Israeli military operation in Gaza in Rafa specifically what more do we know about that well this is just coming from a specific uh Egyptian News Agency News website it's saying that the head of the Israeli Army and the head of the shim bets have been in Cairo speaking to their Egyptian counterparts to try and sort of put them at ease or allay their fears about what's going to happen in Rafa Egypt is very worried that a large ground operation in Rafa could send T tens of thousands of Palestinians over the Border potentially into EG Egypt so what this website is reporting is that the Israelis have been saying that any operation is going to be slow and gradual instead of a comprehensive Invasion and at the moment the Israelis are set telling their Egyptian counterparts they have no deadline for this uh the start of this invasion they say they'll do it when the humanitarian conditions allow it's interesting that this is being reported because there's been this enormous pressure on Israel not to launch a full scale ground operation because of the potential for many tens of thousands of casualties but Israel has been insisting it's going to go ahead with an operation but this suggestion is that it's going to be much more specific and much less uh much more targeted if you like looking for specific Hamas targets than a large scale ground Invasion might have been talking to us from occupied East Jerusalem that's Bon and Smith boner thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
