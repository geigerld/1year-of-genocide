now to New York where multiple protests have been held in recent weeks calling for a ceasefire in Gaza despite many being organized by Jewish peace activists protesters have faced accusations of anti-Semitism on Sunday human rights activist Cornell West addressed a crowd in front of the UN he stressed that support for Palestinians does not mean hating anyone else and don't let anybody tell you that because you love Palestinians and Palestinians babies that you hate somebody else it just doesn't follow what our brother we don't hate Jewish Brothers we don't hate Jewish sisters we don't hate Jewish siblings we love we hate a vicious Israeli occupation well Cornell West is a philosopher and political activist also an independent presidential candidate for 2024 and he joins us now here on Al jazer live from New York York good to have you with us I find it interesting Cornell that when you say you support the Palestinians there you felt that you also had to highlight that it doesn't mean you hate Jews is the debate so polarized there that you need to make that clarification oh absolutely you see I myself I come from a great black people been terrorized traumatized and hated for 400 years Jews themselves have been hated terrorized and traumatized for 2,000 years Palestinians have been hated terrorized and traumatized by Israelis for 75 years and more so you're dealing with two groups that have been hated terrorized and traumatized and you have to be clear that it's not it has nothing to do with anti-jewish hatred when you talk about love of precious Palestinian brothers and sisters who are undergoing a b a barbaric genocidal attack and assault on their bodies on their dignity on their Humanity and it's so easy for the Israeli government it's so easy for right-wing conservative folk in the American society and Empire to accuse me and others of being anti-jewish simply because we love Palestinians I make that very clear but it won't stop our commitment it won't in any way dampen our fire we want our Palestinian brothers and sisters to know we care for you we're concerned about you we're raising our voices we hit in the streets we go into jail and if the United States government that is shot through with its moral bankruptcy it spiritually OB spiritual obscenity andal criminality doesn't hear us then we are going to oppose our own government what what good actually at the end of the day does that do coming out and saying that you support Palestinians how actually can you make any changes to the situation that the G people in Gaza are facing right now well one is put pressure so that we have both a Siege fire we have an exchange of hostages and Palestinian political prisoners and those who are detained in Israeli jails and then an end of The Siege and the end of the occupation it gets at the very source and and core of this whole situation and in addition to that my dear s it's also a matter of one's own personal Integrity how do we live in such a barbaric world and have some sense of morality and spirituality how do we remain committed to Justice and love not hatred and Revenge but Justice and love given the overwhelming grimness of this situation that we see with our precious Palestinians having to undergo this kind of barbarity how are you using your platform now as an independent presidential candidate to boost your message well one is we have to shatter the lies there's been attempts to rationalize and justify Israeli occupation Israeli subjugation Israeli degradation and we have have to be critical of our Palestinian brothers and sisters if they're engaging in killing innocent people those are war crimes I'm critical of that if they're degrading Jews if they're anti-jewish I'm critical of that but I'm keeping track right now of the structures and the institutions and as a candidate I want to rise above the hatred rise above the revenge and part of the legacy of Martin King and Fanny L Heyman Rabbi helel and Edward Zed is what the accent Justice the accent Justice what does Justice look like equal dignity equal rights equal access to resources of Palestinians and Jews in that region of the world when you look at the Democratic party right now what do you see do you see a party that has these values or do you see the divisions I'm thinking particularly of the silencing of Rashida T she's the only palestinian-american in Congress and she was silenced recently when she was trying to speak up on these issues y i stand with my dear sister Rashida very much so but no when I look at the Democratic party I see bankruptcy it's it's it's ethically bankrupt that it's willing to enable genocide Israeli government willing to enact it US Government willing to enable it we have to be very very clear we have to be very very honest we have to be candid and we have to speak very very fearlessly and unfortunately we even have a whole wave of black leaders who are so scared and intimidated and afraid of ape they're afraid of the Anti-Defamation League they're afraid of any kind of pressures brought to bear on them so that they don't have their own status where's their commitment to truth where's their commitment to Justice what kind of Integrity do they have can they put a smile on the face of Martin King and Malcolm X can they put a smile on the face of Ella Baker those are the moral and spiritual standards and I want to be true to the standards of moral and spiritual greatness would have to do with our common Humanity would have to do with our precious humanity and that's the challenge right now and this moment of overwhelming grimness one that you are rising well to Cornell West many thanks indeed for taking the time to join us here on our much
