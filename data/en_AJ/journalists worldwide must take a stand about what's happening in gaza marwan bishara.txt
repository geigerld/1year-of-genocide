a senior political analyst M bashara joins us on the set I think tck really just summed up in such an emotional way that no place no area is safe there is no such thing as a a safe Zone and today two families that we know as part of the aljazera family are mourning their dead nowhere sa and Gaza and no journalist is safe in Gaza I think that should tell us something I mean it's understood that they are War journalists but still the fact that more than 100 journalists were killed within 3 months Israel breaking yet another record in terms of killing of children and destruction of hospitals of destruction of schools and the killing of United Nations staff and now with more than 109 journalists killed this definitely requires a certain stand on the part of our our colleagues around the world not just you know higher up institutions I'm talking about journalists around the world those who came and covered the World Cup in Doha for violations of Labor rights or whatever those who are shedding tears in Ukraine those who are trying to cover chyang in China those who claim there are genocides happening right left and center from China to Ukraine to elsewhere those same journalists who see in plain sight what is happening in Gaza should regardless if we disagree on Israel's motives or Israel's objectives in this war regardless we might disagree but we must agree that the protection of journalists and their families is indispensable for our profession for their profession journalist needs to journalist associations and syndicates around the world especially in those countries where with influence over Israel like as in Europe as in the United States and elsewhere journalist needs to take a stand about what's going on in Gaza this cannot continue to go on unanswered I mean what about them they're going to be from various media Outlets deploying journalists in war in in in in Wartime and war war uh uh stricken areas we will all have to call for the defense of journalists and their lives and their and their protection and their well-being this cannot just go on like this unabated in Gaza and we say it just can't go on for any particular group or one group Maran and yet the only way it's going to stop is that pressure as many people and government see on Israel by America to stop this but that isn't happening despite the fact that the secretary of state is in the region and that as you said before his visit here is perhaps just a complete waste of time until he can put pressure on Israel to stop it's a complete waste of time but in order to buy Israel more time to finish his genocide which is the worst of all worlds not only wasting everyone's time in the region but really to buy Israel more time to finish genocide but how do you get to governments look at the end of the day governments work according to interests right and according to election agenda as in the United States or as in Great Britain or what have you but in the end of the day since we are talking about the media the media has a role to play I Remember during the opening of the World Cup back to the World Cup and during the opening of the World Cup certain channels influential channels decided not to cover the opening of the World Cup contrary to the wishes of all their viewers but decided to conduct debates over human rights labor violations in qar what happened during Christmas when the Holy Land was getting decimated or parts of it when Palestinians were dying in Bethlehem and in Gaza and in ramala and in Janine and in KH what were they doing celebrating Christmas why weren they cutting their celebration of Christmas in order to show the massacre that's happening in the holy land so media has a role to play it's starting timidly timidly to clear all now we see more and more coverage in Western television channels in Western uh uh press in other places around the world we are seeing more and more but that's not enough because we are in a race with time people are dying journalists are dying children are dying hospitals continue to be destroyed schools are now just shelters for destroyed families so in the end of the day media has to take a role if the networks in important Western capitals and other capitals start to take a stand as they did on other important questions around the world I think we might get somewhere in terms of ending the war in Gaza we'll see what does happen because we have been getting some reaction from uh media institutions as such Marin and we'll unpick it more as the day progresses Marin bashara our senior political analyst thank you
