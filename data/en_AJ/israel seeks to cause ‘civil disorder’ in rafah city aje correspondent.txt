Al Han was in Rafa and Southern Gaza I want to ask you about the reaction to this proposal by Israel that it might carry out an attack on Rafa in a moment but just first of all talk us through the latest attacks that have been happening there yes we're looking just a little over 24 hours at at least 40 Palestinians the vast majority of them happen to be displaced families have been uh in inside residential homes or tents or evacuation centers across ra City in central ra City the northern part and the eastern part of the city overcrowded densely populated areas full of Palestinians who've been displaced from the northern part and Gaza City more attacks on residential homes but the latest of what seems to be for a lot of people here is an attack on civil order is the systematic intentional targeting of police departments and police personnels here so far we're looking at three separate attacks on police personnels including the director of the investigative departments here in addition to the director of the police department at later hours uh yesterday in the morning three people were killed in a car the western part of rafah City that's the director of the investigative Department along with his two of his assistants at at earlier later hours at about late afternoon hours another three uh police Personnel were inside their car in one of the uh in the central area of rafah city were targeted and killed a lot of people reacting this this is the beginning of this uh operations in Rafa City and they look at it as a way the Israeli military is following just to cause some sort of civil disorder civil collapse in the city it's important to point out this the police department here ra C have been working uh very hard to secure the delivery of of trucks humanitarian trucks been trying to uh cause some sort of stability inside Healthcare facilities and in front of food distribution points and such an attack is only an indication that we aree of some sort of of civil collapse within the coming days if it continues uh to happen in earlier hours today ongoing artillery Shilling of the eastern part of the city and it's just important to point out that ra hasn't been largely safe for Palestinians not for the local residents who live in ra but also for half of the population of the G who became displaced and forced as ordered by the Israeli military to come to RAF City a lot of people who got to the city and the initial weeks of the war were killed within just a short period of time of their arrivals or or Sheltering inside the residential homes or in the evacuation zones at the western part of the C um hany let's just move to the uh the backdrop to all of this which is the announcement that uh Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has instructed the military to put together a plan for an offensive on Rafa and also to put together a plan to evacuate Rafa how are people reacting to that very frustrated and in fact there isn't a lot of trust going on here because they have this terrible experience with Israeli evacuation orders since the beginning of the war people who were told to evacuate the northern part and Gaza City were giving these sharp orders to the central area to Han unisan here in Rafa City because they were specifically told in order to avoid being bombed they had to go to certain designated zones by the military but within a short period of time of their arrival they were bombed and they were killed so it just for the most part these evacuation orders have been very confusing contradictory and misleading and there isn't much to trust going on with the Israeli narrative so far it's all based on allegations that not that not supported by substantial evidence whatsoever almost everything the military has said what we see on the ground is quite the contrary and that's why people here are not only frustrated but also do not have any other opt options at all the the options available are either equivalent to none or very very limited we're talking about a southern part of the border of the city it's the Egyptian Gaza border which people hoping are not going to be forced to cross to the Egyptian side because this will only feed into a permanent displacement there is no way whatsoever they will be able to get back and to going back to the northern part through this Corridor passage not only they are not safe and it hasn't been guaranteed that they're going to be safe but they also talking about going back to a wasteland entire northern part and Central area that have been turned into a pile of ruins and a largely A Wasteland with no services with no Civic institutions whatsoever to the point it is it is becoming uninhabitable by creating difficult conditions on the ground to make it unlivable h thank you very much indeed Han Mahmud talking to us from Rafa in Sou gin
