we want to take you now live to Geneva where Philip lazarini the commissioner general of the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees unra is speaking and updating uh the Press there about the latest developments on the ground sh with the m States and also to comment on the review the Kine Kon report and maybe also a little update on the o us report um when when it comes to the situation on the ground um I mean basically our colleagues are telling us that uh there is a extraordinary deep anxiety prevailing right now in Gaza because the question uh everybody ask is whether yes or not there will be a military offensive and the likelihood of a military offensive will all depend uh whether or not a cire deal will be reached uh this week um just to let you know that people have not yet been asked to evacuate from Rafa but there is a sense that if there is no deal this week that this can happen at any time my colleague on the ground are also uh describing uh basically a a constant I would say a constant state of trauma among the people and basically they came with a new acronym we are not talking anymore about uh PTSD but we are more talking about the ctsd which would mean constant traumatic stress disorder prevailing in the Gaza Strip and obviously this is not uh too surprising uh this morning I commented also on the latest development in the north where we are engage in race against the clock to reverse in fact the spreading hung and the looming famine especially in the northern part the good news is that my colleagues have reported that there is more food available in the market so increased Ava availability but it is still does not mean that the food is accessible just because there is absolutely no cash circulating in the northern part of the Gaza Strip we believe that much more needs to be done it is true that there have been more Supply entering during the month of April but this is still far from enough to reserve or to to reverse the negative Trend we have seen I have also mentioned this morning when I met the uh member states um the uh issue about the blame game you might have heard between the Israeli uh uh Authority many the Kat and the United Nation on one hand isra saying what we are providing all the necessary food the problem is is on the side of the United Nation let me just give you few facts regarding this first this is not true and this is not our reading uh look at um starting with unoa whenever we ask for a convoy going from the South to to the north our convoys are systematically denied so we still have no access whenever a permission is given to deliver anywhere else in the strep the process is always complicated and very uh cumbersome uh when it comes to enter into Gaza we have this system of offloading downloading offloading downloading the trucks which makes things extraordinary uh difficult also um we have operating hours of the crossing which vary from one day to another one with limited number of hours where we can operate and uh most of the time uh the many times a week we have also the crossing being closed because they just dumping uh DET release the theis or or dumping sometimes bodies who have been take who have been taken to Israel and back to the Gaza street now talking about um the um the detes I have also briefed the member State about the report we have issued about a week ago um it was the first time that in fact un has released such a report in my meeting this morning I have reminded that uh of course hostages are still in captivity with the Hamas and that both the Secretary General myself but other un officer keep asking for the unconditional and immediate release of the hostages but I have also shared this morning our deep concern regarding the gazin detained by the Israeli Security Forces um the report you have seen uh recently has been based on number of testimonies collected by the agency Why by the agency because we are at the Crossing we are at K Shalom because we are mining the main logistical H at the entry of Gaza and these people basically have been released at this place and according to the test testimonies that we have collected um people have told us that they are routinely R when they were arrested they were routinely rounded up stripped to the underwear and loaded into trucks blindfolded and borned most of the time once arrested these detes remain Inc communic and they are subjected to shocking inum treatment among the IM inum treatment they have described to us water boing water boarding severe victims attacked by dogs being forced to hold stress position for hours sometimes 12 hours 24 hours and being forced to wear diaper instead of accessing uh the toilet and among the detainers who have been relieved we had also a number of un staff and they have also reported to us that while under interrogation they were asked a lot of question about the work with un and B basically also being pressured to that the agency is politically Affiliated in the Gaza Strip this morning I have also highlighted the fact that U as you know the agency is under a lot of strain they are called for the agency to be uh dismantled uh but the agency also has been uh targeted over the last six uh seven months um in in in in Gaza uh uh where both uh our staff but also our premises as well as our operation I just reminded that since the beginning of the war we have 182 staff member now who have been killed more than 160 premises which have been uh damaged uh or totally destroyed and most of these premises were Sheltering a displaced people and more than 400 people have been killed in these premises uh we have also seen that whenever we vacated premises mainly in the north of the Gaza Street uh they have been then used for military uh purposes uh we have uh also heard about the allegation regarding tunel uh underneath some of our premises and basically I was calling the member state to make sure that at the end of the war once we have a ceas fire that we have also the ne that we put in place an investig independent investigation uh to look into this blatant disregard of the United Nation in order to avoid that this becomes also in the future uh the new uh standard I also briefed uh this morning about where we stand on the oios report but in fact we have been briefed by Stefan durich I think on on on Friday just to reiterate what he has said we started with 12 allegations if you're just joining us on Al jazer we're just listening there to Philip lazarini the commissioner general of the UN
