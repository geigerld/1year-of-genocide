well Qatar says it's focusing on further extending a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel Beyond Wednesday in its role as a mediator in the conflict let's bring in Muhammad shawi he's a professor of conflict resolution and diplomacy at George Mason University Muhammad welcome back so the heads of the CIA mosad and Egypt spy agency are all now here in Qatar uh for talks what exactly are the mediators pushing for now is it just another another extension to the ceasefire or are they looking beyond that in terms of maybe a political solution I think they are in in a more promising framework of where they can push the mediation and negotiation forward that means we have completed one phase of releasing or swapping number of Civilian hostages for number of Palestinian prisoners now I think they are considering also other phases which is now let's talk serious about how those military hostages on the is Israeli side Visa who could or who should be released in in terms of the big names members of Hamas Jihad and other and that's more complicated exactly so this is the real meat negotiation if you like in other words that Netanyahu needs to address both civilian and Military hostages and some of his generals now we are talking also at the symbolic level of who should be released from Gaza from Hamas therefore I think the katar mediation is getting more prominence more significance John uh Burns stays foot in duha the head of mad is doing the same thing therefore I think the Horizon expand is expanding dramatically and I think this gives us another good indicator that the Netanyahu government has to remain committed because of this Arrangement so far okay um also we know that Netanyahu um is under growing pressure from the Americans to change the conduct of the war how do you see the military operations of both Israel and Hamas evolving against the backdrop of this diplomatic pressure that's happening I think this is a dialectic that can go either way in other words we have diplomacy competing with militarism and the Netanyahu group still insists that no matter how we succeed this first swap over five days we are going to resume fighting I think this is not going to hold much longer because there is this combination three factors are working against the choice of militarism and Military you know flight number one the bidens and the the blink of the world are for this open-ended negotiation toward more diplomatic outcomes number two the karies the Egyptians are also for both reconc from the Israelis as well from Ham number three Israel has now witnessed a bright day so the families the public opinion has higher expectations therefore the nanaho of the world cannot go back and close this know window of light therefore I think the momentum I mean the locomotive of diplomacy has started and it should continue forward okay let me get a final thought from you I mean what will it take then for the mediators and the Americans to change Israel's tactical thinking because even President Biden tweeted last night that war alone is not going to resolve this conflict I think we need two things to be combined at once one is the mediation itself and I think it remains impartial it remains promising and it has fulfilled a certain level of of productivity more than 50 hostages are being released a bigger number of isra of Palestinian uh prisoners have been overas this is where we can build up some confidence number two Washington has to push for more concessions from uh the Netanyahu therefore it's a matter of combination internal and external forces coming together okay Muhammad shakar we have to leave it there thank you very much indeed for your time and your analysis
