welcome to the program it's 1200 GMT that's 3 p.m. in Gaza and Israel has now imposed what it calls a total blockade on The Enclave cutting off food fuel water and electricity it is part of the most serious escalation in decades more than 500 Palestinians and 800 Israelis have been killed since hamas's infiltration south of Israel on Saturday these are the latest pictures from the jabalia ref refug camp in Gaza there are reports of mass casualties in all hundreds of sites have been targeted throughout the besieged Enclave Hamas says four Israeli prisoners have been killed in the bombardment and a warning to our viewers some of you may find these images disturbing our cameras captured the Frantic scenes as rescue workers began to pull people from the rubble in the jabalia neighborhood yumna aled is at a hospital in Gaza and filed this report two uh massive uh raids happened in in the northern part of Gaza one in jabalia refugee camp that's the latest one it was a targeting or a bombing to a home and all the neighboring homes and even an unise school has been have been severely destroyed uh dozens of uh C casualties were brought to hospital mostly injuries and mostly children unfortunately we've seen them we've seen the ambulances Dro them as as well as a number of those who have been killed in that uh bombardment just before that bombardment 5 minutes before it the other bombardment was for uh a Susi mosque which is in uh the ashati refugee camp also in West Gaza City and uh that's one of the most densely or it's it's considered to be the first most densely populated uh refugee camp in Gaza and then jabalia follows after it uh the the bque was also targeted without prior notice uh many civilians of those who were injured from the targeting were brought to hospital including those who were killed from that targeting we've seen the pictures of how much the destruction Coast from every raid and every mile every bombardment made and that all affects the infrastructure so uh basically uh these areas like for example B hanon neighborhood another very densely populated area has they like local Witnesses and sources say that over 70% of that neighborhood has been completely wrecked it has been completely wiped out the infrastructure uh no electricity there water pipes uh pipelines everything has been completely destroyed of course uh in addition to civilian homes and every other building in that area that was under heavy bombardment all night so we're talking about the destruction of not just homes and and and air but but even infrastructure in every area that is uh subjected to a mile or a bombard bombardment okay Jamila Abu Zuna is in the north of Gaza where a market in jabalia refugee camp was targeted earlier this is the north of Gaza we have just heard a huge explosion uh we have no until until now but uh uh for the last couple of hours they have targeted the last trade was on jabalia that trans area in jabalia it's um jabalia Camp is one of the most crowded uh camps in Gaza uh they have targeted a market there and there's about more than 50 people dead uh and as the Prime Minister um the spokesman of the Ministry of Health ashra has said uh the death toll until now is 500 Dead uh this uh situation he has explained that cause disability of disability of trying to contain uh the am ount of casualties coming to the hospitals of Gaza uh which uh which shows us how complicated that the coming days are going to be uh in addition or especially that uh by Wednesday There's going to be no electricity in Gaza the power stations are running out of electricity so there is no electricity no food or water uh no one is anticipating what's what is going to be uh in the coming days uh we're just waitting meting to know what's going to happen let's turn to Southern Israel now and Charles Stratford is live for us outside cot Charles what's the latest lines coming out from the Israeli Army well I suppose it was a couple of hours ago now that the Israeli military said that they had taken back full control regained control of a number of towns and communities inside is close to the Border including the town behind me stot well certainly we can't verify that um and there are still reports of ongoing skirmishes in another in a number of settlements one especially place called kafar um AAR when I say settlement I mean Village or town because of course it's inside Israel um we understand possibly that there may be a hostage situation ongoing there I'll tell you that certainly cly in the last half an hour or so there has been an intense bombardment of areas of the northern Gaza Strip which is behind me and to my left they' got saly after saly of Israeli fighter jets flying overhead dropping their payloads um and returning there've also been helicopter gunships that we've seen here that area of Northern Gaza is place is a place called bit hanon which we've heard our reporters uh inside Gaza saying that is taking a catastrophic beating um so yeah there is an intensification of of fighting that we've seen we've also seen a lot of troops uh sorry troop uh movement increasingly um we've seen um a lot of U tanks uh military hardware including apcs we've seen a lot of Humes in the last half an hour or so carrying soldiers um along the road in front of me uh military um uh military bulldozers um and more tanks on flatbeds so all indications are that there are gearing up the Israelis are gearing up for some sort of military Invasion inside into Gaza so yeah as we've been reporting inside of Gaza our reporters there absolutely horrific scenes and terrified hundreds of thousands of people stay with me Charles I just want to explain what we're seeing on our screen there were air strikes that were raining down on Gaza which they have been now over the past several hours and also we know more than 500 uh occurred overnight in terms of evacuation of residents near the border what have you seen are people leaving are they staying talk us through it it's a really strange situation we were as I say in stot earlier and although the situation was very tensive indeed there was barrage after barrage of rockets being fired from inside Gaza some of which were hiding stot there had been an announcement that they were ongoing at the time um Search and Destroy operations being uh conducted by Israeli paratroopers and we saw some of well Israeli soldiers going into the town walking into the streets um we understand looking for Hamas and Palestinian gunmen but at the same time as there being a few people leaving there are also a lot of people staying um a lot of people refusing seemingly to go and that's despite the warnings from the Israelis that this evacuation is important we spoke to one Israeli civilian inside stot and he said no I'm not going now is the time to stay in stot to hold our ground so you know no matter the pummeling that some of these towns have taken and reminding viewers that stot was one of the initial towns that had Palestinian government come into it of course there was a Siege there of that police station that eventually was regained control of was actually destroyed we understand potentially by an Israeli air strike 10 Hammer Fighters were pulled out from that so despite that kind of situation many Israelis in these towns are refusing to leave one thing the Israeli military did say though this morning was that um it was now gearing up for its next stage in this military operation now is that going to be some form of ground Invasion or is that reference to an evacuation um it seems a pretty risky military strategy to push into Gaza um when there is so much seemingly so much of a response still coming from Gaza in terms of the rockets that are being fired when there are literally tens of thousands of Israeli civilians living in towns and settlements so close to the border so it's very difficult to gauge exactly what Israel next move is but all indications were suggest just because of the kind of military movement that we've seen in this area that they are gearing up for some sort of invasion into Gaza okay appreciate the update as always Charles Stratford in southern Israel
