Ambassador ninga thank you so much for joining me on upfront thank you thank you uh since October 7th countries all around the world have been critical of Israel's campaign in Gaza but it was South Africa that brought the case to the icj the international court of justice why I think you must remember that uh we come from a a similar situation as the as the Palestinians we come from a party to where we were oppressed we deny our basic rights and all of that so the plight of of Palestinians we we we we we can relate to um and that we are not able to be indifferent to such plight because it's just like ours it's identical to to to our plight and their Agony we we can relate to to we are came to a conclusion that our struggles were similar and we also came to conclusions that the people who oppressed us were quite friendly to one another I mean uh apart South Africa to a very large extent militarily and and so on was maintained by Israel so so so so so we had all those commonalities and uh we thought that we can't just sit and do nothing and watch them getting from bad to worse and that let us do something something just to stop their uh their everyday uh sufferings last Friday the icj uh issued a provisional ruling uh on your case South Africa's case against Israel and the court said that it was quote plausible that Israel uh had committed genocidal acts in Palestine the court called on Israel to take quote all measures to prevent genocide uh and also uh to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide however despite those rulings or decisions the world Court stopped short of calling for a ceasefire uh and that's what the South African government was actually asking for oh was that uh surprising to you it was surprising because we had hoped that we were going to get that this is fire because we still believe that that is the best under this circumstance you know uh to get a c fire as a way of stopping the the the carage you know that that's this fire will be very but having said that if you look at these provisional measures they will actually be amounting to a ceasefire because it will be very difficult to carry out these provisional measures and be able to reporting in a month's time without doing things differently you see um so to let me push you on that a little bit because is Israel's position is we're happy to take all measures to prevent civilian deaths to prevent you know violence or death Etc because that's what we've always been doing so they're going to make the case that whatever the court is asking them to do they're going to carry out because they've always been carrying it out and that the deaths that we're seeing uh the 26,000 deaths in three months um are not because they want to kill people but because Hamas has left them no Choice by hiding in hospitals and refugee camps and all this stuff what do you say to that you see that those provisional measures as I'm saying if you if you're talking about uh people access to to to medical and Healthcare facilities all right yeah then it it means that they must be secured they must be able to go there they must not be afraid that they'll be bombed if we are talking about people having access to medic to um to water electricity and all of that it must be available if we are talking about U humanitarian Aid to be able to reach where it is most needed then there must not be any firing that is going on it must be able to go so it will be very difficult for Israel to tell why they should I mean why they should a school why they they bomb a school and the carpet bombings that that we have been we have been seeing our we can't see you use carpet bombing because Hamas is hiding behind civilians and all that doesn't work that way what it says is that you're indiscriminate in your in in your killing and I don't think we are saying they should not chase their enemies and all of that we're not saying that but what we are saying leave the civilians out of this and what worries us most is the number of young people children included that are dying that they seem to be in the majority women and children are the majority collectively and of the 20 more than 26,000 people who have died 10,000 of them are are children it's uh somewhere around 1% of the overall child population of Gaza has been killed that that's a that's a stunning number that's a lot do do you do you have confidence that Israel will do anything different in the aftermath of the ruling and if so what we don't know we don't know really we don't know we don't know but I think that will really depend on the resolve of International Community because I think the judges have done their best and I think they've given us the best decisions that that they could under the the circumstances now it's up to International Community because it's going to the UN now so it's up to International Community to make up its mind whether it wants to protect the Palestinians you talk about the will of the of the International Community what can the International Community do if Israel says we're not going to change oh they've got a lot of things they can do I mean as International Community can do a lot of things like like for instance the complete isolation of Israel right complete 100% isolation of Israel forcing Israel uh to do to behave in a certain mind now and that will that will mean um things like uh uh denying them uh Market you know um uh in them to the extreme embargoing them so to say and all of that they that those measures have been used before they can still be used so hence I'm saying it's not as if International Community doesn't have ways of dealing with International Community we do as International Community have means and leverages and all of that it is up to us to decide that we are going to uh follow what the judges have said and the judges have told us what we've always been suspecting there are people who say there are lots of places that did something wrong but only the Jewish state is getting isolated itamar Bing gav Israel's national security minister uh in addition to just dismissing the ruling in and of itself he said heg schm on his uh ex account uh he also said that it was anti-semitic uh do you have a concern uh or how do you respond to the concern that the specific choice to bring Israel to the internet court is an anti-semitic one you see that that I find also very very sad you know that you do horrible things and then you hide behind such things as anti-em in order to morally bmail people and to Blackmail us into submission and keeping quiet that has been used as as a sck and I I will tell you how hollow that is that to say that this is anti-i some of the most prominent um Palestinian supporters in South Africa are Jews who are in the Forefront of pushing that something has to be done there are South African Jews who were involved in the anti-ar struggle and are still alive and they are pushing for this because they say they can't say apartate was um um was was wrong but be quiet about the occupation of of Palestines so now are we then going to say what these people the type of people you're talking about they then call them they say they are self-hating are they self-hating because they've got a gut to stand up that what we are doing is wrong that's why I'm saying it BEC so sad that for so long they have managed to do a moral blackmail on Nations on people and saying that once you criticize what they're doing in in Palestine their oppression of Palestinians and the slaughter of Palestinians they call that anti-semitic so I don't know what is anti-Semitism anymore Germany uh had previously said that it would intervene on behalf of Israel at the world Court saying there was quote no basis whatsoever for the accusation of genocide they argued that uh the interpretation of genocidal intent has to be more restrictive yeah um however an announcement uh came after the icj's decision where a German foreign minister analina barbach said that Israel still must adhere to the icj ruling uh based on what we see now do you believe that Germany will be intervening on Israel's behalf in the next stage of this we really don't know and of course if that's what they want to do is their right let let them do it but we still are insisting on what we think is happening in Palestine but why why I think about Germany and I just think about the why of it you know you talked about moral blackmail I mean is there is there a heightened guilt from European nations given their own role in the Nazi Holocaust I don't know well if they feel guilty they should show it even towards us that guilt because Africans suffered under under the British colonialism under the French colonialism and the Portuguese colonialism they must feel guilty when they see us they must do things that will be will be will be correcting that history and all what they stole from from the continent you see so it needs to be corrected the lives that we lost and all we are talking about genocide now have you heard anyone referring to the congol Le genocide of 10 million people 10 million people people killed by king lold of Belgium have you ever heard of it nobody talks about that nobody talks about that so where how is this sense of guilt not balanced why is it like that side and not this side so if there was any they would show it to us too Ambassador thank you so much for joining me on FR I appreciate thank you thank you thank
