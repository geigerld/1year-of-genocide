now the White House National Security advisor has told American Media the US does not want to see fighting in hospitals in Gaza Jake Sullivan also says Washington is involved in negotiations with Israel and Qatar on securing the release of captives held by Hamas let's bring in shab banzi in Washington DC for more on this so what more has Jake Sullivan been saying shab this was an interview to one US Network that hasn't actually aired yet but we managed to to listen in while it was while it was taking place and it was more of the same gentle tidding that we've come to expect from the Biden Administration as if we can't see the catastrophe that's that unfold that's unfolding or as if the Biden Administration didn't actually really in some ways hold the key to what's happening on the ground there but but Sullivan was asked several questions firstly on the issue of Israeli attacks on hospitals he was asked so does the US confirm then that these are legitimate Hamas targets command and control centers he wouldn't confirm that he simply said that using open source information in the past Hamas has used hospitals as covers and human Shields but then he did say the US doesn't want to see firefights in hospitals so couched in all that language there was apparently a warning the US doesn't want to see firefights in hospitals that's as strong as it gets then asked whether about the the release of the captives whether there was a deal on the table which which at least one US member of Congress has been telling the media might be on the table that is some kind of exchange between for the captives and Palestinian women and children who are held in Israeli jails he wouldn't confirm that but simply confirm that uh Israel Qatar and Hamas are in these negotiations and the US is involved thirdly on the 400 US citizens in Gaza he said the gates are open currently and he does expect more US citizens to leave Gaza and then finally the main point in the interview was when asked about Netanyahu talking about having total security control over Gaza for their foreseeable future uh he said that as far as he was concerned there has to be um no forcible displacement of Palestinian uh and ultimately the Palestinians need to be in charge of Gaza and the West Bank there has to be some kind of linkage in the power in in the Palestinian leadership to control to control Gaza but however we can't get back to October the 6th ultimately it's up to the Palestinian people to decide so it's that usual kind of mishmash of of of of differences between the Israeli position but not terribly not terribly forceful in expressing those those differences beyond that actually we're expecting Benjamin Netanyahu to also do the rounds of the Sunday talk shows as well in the coming hours so we'll keep an eye on that too thank you very much for the moment chanzi live there in Washington
