follows what's been by far the deadliest day of the Israeli Palestinian conflict in 50 years it's more than 24 hours now since Hamas launched its military operation on Israel by land air and sea and these are live pictures now as the sun rises on the besieged territory Palestinians taking stop then of what's been lost overnight in Israeli air strikes well this was a scene just a few hours ago when Israel launched another air strike on Gaza prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned people in Gaza who are under Israel's Land Air and sea blockade to leave the territory Israeli media say some of the strikes targeted the homes of senior Hamas members including yah Al sinoa hamas's leader in Gaza but so far at least 256 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli air strikes Al jaaz yumna elad is live now from Gaza at yumna we know as we were saying there there' have been a number of Israeli air strikes on Gaza overnight tell us what's been happening and the latest casualty figures that you've been hearing there yes well the violent Israeli raids have not stopped bombarding across the Gaza Strip in different areas uh dozens of residential homes and buildings have been completely destroyed uh some of these homes were actually targeted while the residents were in them without any prior notice causing great amount of casualties in this home uh uh in including the entire families of those uh residents of that home uh also as you mentioned uh the uh targeting of senior Hamas uh leaders homes across the Gaza Strip in different areas including a senoir uh the uh the chief of the political Bureau of Hamas and his also his office in Gaza City as well as three mosques have been completely destroyed and two Banks uh this is all in addition to three residential or three towers aluk Tower was the latest Tower it's a residential Tower uh Palestine Tower uh yesterday that was uh targeted right there live while we were uh uh live and uh also uh watan Tower uh that was also destroyed and leveled to the ground in the early hours of this day aluk Tower just to say is the tower opposite to the uh residential uh home of our uh producer safat alah he had to run as soon as we knew that the tower was uh being targeted it's an a very densely populated area in a neighborhood in Gaza City and uh when the uh first mile warning mile which they call a knock on the roof was hit uh he he quickly rashed to his home they're lucky luckily they're uh they're all safe but the glasses uh the windows of his home has all been uh shattered so this is basically how the scene is in in the Gaza Strip in these past few hours as the raids and bombardments still continue in different areas the latest number by the uh Ministry of Health is uh as you mentioned 2 uh uh 56 uh people killed and over 1,700 injured including 20 children killed and 121 children injured so uh also we have been witnessing a lot of power Cuts since last night um like for example here in our Bureau we're on the 13th floor and because there of of the power supply we have to use the stairs to get uh up to the bureau or get uh down from the bureau because there is no power supply for uh the elevators so since last night and the Min the energy Minister's decision to stop feeding the Gaza Strip with a power that the Palestinian Authority pays for we're witnessing about 4 hours of electricity in the entire day um y let me just jump in here with an update we're just getting here uh on the AP the Associated Press uh wires the Israeli military is now saying at least 26 soldiers 26 Israeli soldiers have been killed in this unprecedented Hamas attack um on the country south let me just repeat that this wi is just dropping now from the Associated Press the Israeli military saying at least 26 soldiers killed in unprecedented Hamas attack on the country south let me ask you yna I mean the Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu has been warning um gazans to get out now but people really have nowhere to go and many remain Trapped In The Enclave don't they of course and and and the irony about this is that Israel knows that it has been imposing a Land Air in and sea uh blocade on the Gaza Strip there is no uh uh movement there is no uh there is no uh there are no Crossings open for the free uh uh of movement of the residents but the Israeli uh uh Army yesterday sent messages to the residents living on the borders uh of the Gaza Strip from north to south to tell them to evacuate their homes and go to the city or uh to the center of the city in Gaza City uh now we're we're talking about 3.2 million people living in 365 kilometers Palestine uh tower that was uh leveled yesterday is a residential Tower with aund 100 uh apartment some of these apartments were offices media offices and medical offices but the rest of the apartments were uh for residents for families that are now displaced Al akuk tower on the other hand in Naser neighborhood which was just leveled uh a short while ago is also fully a residential Tower which means that hundreds of other families have also been instantly uh displaced dozens of residential homes that have been destroyed in the past few hours means another uh hundreds of families uh being displaced so where do these families go they join their other family members relatives Neighbors in the areas because this is the reality for the residents living in Gaza all right you alide giving us a live update there from Gaza uh as uh Gaza wakes up this morning to the aftermath uh of numerous Israeli air strikes uh on The Enclave yum thank you very much indeed meanwhile inside Israel gun battles have been continuing for hours between Hamas Fighters and Israeli forces the death toll there stands at more than 300 in the southern city of stot Palestinian Fighters seized a police station Israeli forces demolished part of the building with a bulldozer Israel said it was engaged in gun battles in at least eight locations near Gaza let's talk to Sarah kyat she joins us live now from West Jerusalem Sarah said the Israeli Army was saying earlier fighting is still taking place in the South bring us up to date with what you know about what's happening there and also in places like stero yeah that's right um yesterday the Israeli Army had confirmed that uh the fighters that came and crossed over that border were between 200 to 300 of them of course some of them ended up going back but the those that remained um are deep in those Southern towns and they've clearly managed to uh a lot of them to manage to evade uh the Israeli forces that have been going there we've seen videos of them uh of Israelis filming uh the Israeli Security Forces walking the streets trying to find uh those uh Palestinian Fighters that are still very much deeply in those Southern Towns now they the Israeli Army says that they uh are managing to take back some of the control of from some of those areas uh eliminating in there uh some of those uh Palestinian Fighters uh but there still seems to be a a hostage a captive situation rather that's been happening uh uh there were two of those happening then uh on Saturday and it seems to still be the case they haven't given too much information on whether that is still ongoing but the fighting is definitely still happening unofficially uh from what we're seeing from people posting on social media media Israeli family members uh uh looking for those that are missing it seems that missing number is going up as well it's still not been acknowledged by the Israeli authorities but we're seeing numbers as many as 750 of those missing there were uh there there was apparently a huge party that was being held by Israelis at that uh near close to that border and uh some of those uh youngsters that were attending uh had been uh uh kid kidnapped and taken over the Border as civilians so this is still very much an ongoing operation and just one more thing to add to that a cabinet meeting that was held yesterday night for several hours what came out of it was a very clear message they decided that they will uh they will destroy they said the military uh arm for Hamas they will ensure that it will be a difficult War a long War but they will do everything they can to eliminate that all right Sarah kyat live for us there uh in West Rus s we're going to have to leave
