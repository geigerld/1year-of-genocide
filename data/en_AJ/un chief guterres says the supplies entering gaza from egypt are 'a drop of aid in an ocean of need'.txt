meanwhile the UN Security Council has been holding an open debate on the Israel Gaza war in his opening speech the Secretary General reiterated calls for an immediate ceasefire Antonio gueras also highlighted the dire situation of Palestinians living in Gaza it is important to also recognize the attacks by amas did not happen in a vacuum the Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation they have seen their land steadily divor by settlements and plagued by violence their economy stiffled their people displaced and their homes demolished their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been Vanishing but the Grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by amas and those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people Christen salumi is it the United Nations in New York Kristen just just letting you know that the United Arab Emirates are probably going to speak soonish and when that happens we'll be carrying that live um Meanwhile we're hearing reports that the Israeli foreign minister who spoke at the UN a short while ago cancelled his meeting with the Secretary General of the UN what do you know about that yes he said as much on Twitter and the UN Ambassador for Israel is also tweeting that he wants the Secretary General to resign uh the feeling is that he was too dismissive of the uh attack that Hamas waged on Israeli CI citizens and civilians uh the quote from the ambassador's Tweet says there is no justification or point in talking to those who show compassion for the most terrible atrocities committed commed against the citizens of Israel and the Jewish people there are simply no words you just heard the this uh quote from the Secretary General you just heard what he said and that actually is precisely apparently what they are referring to the fact that the Secretary General who did let me reiterate in case you didn't hear it did condemn hamas's attack on civilians and said it was unjustified but he also said it didn't happen in a vacuum uh the went on to say the Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation um that was the context for their remarks and uh it looks as if they've left the security Council chamber at this time and Kristen earlier we also heard from the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin I want to hear a little bit of what he had to say and get reaction on the back it means Israel must take all possible possible precautions to avoid harm to civilians it means food water medicine and other essentially humanitarian assistance must be able to flow into Gaza and to the people who need them it means civilians must be able to get out of Harm's Way it means humanitarian pauses must be considered for these purposes Kristen what did you make of what blinkin had to say well he is expressing the United States support for respect of international law international humanitarian law and making the point that the United States doesn't equate Hamas with the civilian population uh of Gaza that said the bulk of the first part of his remarks dealt with hamas's attack on Israel uh and the need to uh fight terrorism in the region he also talked about the need to uh prevent Iran from further supporting Hamas and other groups in the region he issued a very strong warning uh to Iran and called on other nations to uh basically do the same to express their concern and not let this uh War expand as he said uh so more talk from the United States as we've heard but also in appeal to the other nations to work towards a resolution in the security Council he said that the United States had been working closely and listening to uh allies and other members of the council in order to do just that an appeal there for the uh International Community to come together on a resolution of course it was the United States that vetoed the last resolution that was overwhelmingly supported by council members uh just less than a week ago uh but again they are working on a new version um that also calls for humanitarian relief uh although in a weaker form than the prior resolution did and has stronger language uh against Hamas and backing Israel's right to defend itself in the country Kristen salumi reporting there uh from the UN headquarters in New York thank you very much Kristen we'll talk to you again
