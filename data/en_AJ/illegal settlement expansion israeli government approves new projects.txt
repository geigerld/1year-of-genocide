since October the 7th Israel's government has accelerated the approval of several illegal settlement projects in occupied East Jerusalem the first approvals in more than a decade the housing Ministry published plans for the construction of thousands of housing units in the Palestinian neighborhoods of betaa and sured in the southern part of the city what Israel is trying to do with this neighborhood is to prevent is like to build on what we are seeing as the last empty land that this Village is having like think about a neighborhood like and others eventually they are trapped and they don't have any places to expand in the same times we must to remember Israel is not advancing Palestinians in this Jerusalem it's a bureaucratic process that could sometimes take up to 10 years for approval but multiple Ministries in the right-wing government have given the go-ahead during the war on Gaza activists say the time between the settlement's date of authorization and the Public Announcement was relatively short something rights groups are calling unprecedented two of the illegal settlement projects Advanced by the Israeli government will be right here in the Palestinian town of beta Fafa but Israeli human rights organizations say that building on these lands will harm potential territorial continuity between beem and occupied East Jerusalem making the realization of a two-state solution nearly impossible Palestinians here believe the land grabs are just one of many attempts to push them out they want to expel us they want to uproot every single Palestinian from the land of Palestine they want us to go out to leave the area to have no space for us to strangle to put it High a road around our necks our necks and then to oblige the young people to find another place where to live despite International criticism Israel's government continues to implement policies that violate international law and further deteriorate the livelihoods of Palestinians Hamas salut Al jaaz occupied East Jerusalem make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
