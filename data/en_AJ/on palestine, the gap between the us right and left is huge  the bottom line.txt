hi I'm Steve Clemens and I have a question how does Israel's war in Gaza fit into US National Security interests let's get to the bottom line despite a fragile pause in the fighting all signs point the long-term conflict in the Middle East and not only between Palestinians and Israelis there have been attacks all along the border between Lebanon and Israel for the past month and a half and recently the houis in Yemen a thousand miles away hijacked the cargo ship owned by an Israeli businessman for the US which has made huge commitments to Israel militarily financially and diplomatically since Israel's war on Gaza started last month the region is stuck between domestic policy currents and foreign policy interests President Joe Biden's Embrace of Israel is dividing his own party an increasing number of Americans from both parties say that Israel has gone too far in its response to the attacks by Hamas so where is US policy heading and where do us National Security interests really lie those interests are up for debate in today's America so we'll be getting two very different takes we'll start with a view from the right with Ambassador John Bolton who served as National Security adviser under former president Donald Trump Ambassador thank you so much for joining us today as we're speaking uh Israel and Hamas have reached a deal where Israeli hostages are going to be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners how do you feel about this deal and what are your expectations well I think everybody from a humanitarian point of view should welcome the people who were kidnapped on October the 7th being released I I have a general objection to making swap deals for hostages I think this case is a good example of why it's a bad idea number one the ratio is 3 to1 uh that's that's never a good sign number two the people that Israel is going to release are essentially criminals they're not people who were kidnapped while they were enjoying themselves at Rock festivals or something like that so I think this moral equivalen ism mistake and I think it gives an incentive to hostage takers uh because if they can bargain like this uh they know that taking hostages is well worth it and I also don't like many of the terms associated with the deal uh it may be that a pause of four days does give Israel some time to regroup and rethink its next steps but H but Hamas is far and a way the greater beneficiary terms of extricating some of its Fighters regrouping hiding the other hostages exfiltrating some of their people uh from Gaza and I don't like the plan the part that says if Hamas turns over another 10 people a day the pause can continue I would never give my enemy control over the extent of the ceasefire and I think although again I understand fully the compassionate humanitarian argument here I don't think we should look we should miss the Strategic implications I think Israel's right of self-defense includes eliminating the Hamas threat and to the extent we take take our eye off that strategic objective I think it increases the chances they will fail and we will be right back to where we were on October the 6th in Fairly short order but the global South is screaming you've got a lot of our European allies that are um uh really calling out Israel for overreaction and what they see as indiscriminate killing of many Palestinians I mean I guess my question to you is if you were in an office and and Advising any next president that came up should there not be some e effort to really diminish the the the footprint of horror for innocence yeah well you know in terms of the international pressure I can tell you when I've been in the government and I've heard about International pressure if I had a switch inside my ear I'd just turn it off if you don't pay any attention to it it's not pressure but here's where I think the most important point that many commentators and and and national leaders are missing I do not consider this a war of Hamas against Israel I considered this a war by some of America's worst enemies led by the mulles in tan using their terrorist surrogate groups like Hamas Hezbollah like the hoodies in Yemen like the militia groups in Iraq in what kasum sulamani the late kasum sulamani called the ring of fire strategy against Israel and that's why I think in the Arab world in particular if people understood this better and I think many of the leaders do understand it they would see this is not an attack on the Arab world this is Israel defending itself from the leadership in Teran uh and and doing to the Palestinian people what has happened to them in the past being used by Outsiders for their own uh purposes and I think if you understand that in that respect it would be easier not easy but easier for many people in the region to understand what Israel is doing uh and to see where the real perpetrator the real moral cause of this is and and it is the government of Iran what is your view of President Biden's take on Israel Palestine and you know what are your view I know you've got some provocative thoughts on this yeah I think the two-state solution is irretrievably wounded uh I think it was dead before October the 7th I think it's dead and buried now I don't think Israel is ever going to consent to the creation of a state on its borders that's run by terrorists uh I think uh my my view has been for a long time what I call the three-state solution and nobody likes that either but I would say congratulations to the Egyptian you now have sovereignty again over the Gaza Strip as you did pre 1967 and I think on the West Bank I think this is actually more doable I think Israel and Jordan have to figure out a relationship that returns some sovereignty over the West Gaza to Egypt and give West Bank part of the West Bank to Jordan now I happen to think this is actually the best measure for the for the welfare of the Palestinian people I think the notion of a Palestinian state that includes Gaza and an archipelago of dots on the West Bank cannot be economically viable and I think for Palestinians and their families these people need to be part of a of a strong economy their children need to have schools they need to be in a place where they can lead a normal life and in the Gaza Strip and many places of the West Bank it's simply not possible let's not kid our eles let's put the welfare of the Palestinians above ideological dreams I mean I I mean let me just wrestle with you a little bit on this why abandon the notion that somehow with security and autonomy and creating conditions where responsible um Palestinian Patriots that believe in um you know a sort of fair future for their people um and a balanced future recognizing Israel why is that dream gone because you know for 75 years Palestinians have been trying to cling to that land well they've been trying to cling to a part of the land they're never going to get back which is called Israel their their whole argument is they were forcibly displaced during the 1948 conflict uh and in subsequent conflicts uh and they decare themselves to be refugees 5 million I think that's the right number of Palestinians are registered as refugees with unra the the problem is we have allowed those who had uh aims to weaponize the Palestinians against Israel to use them in ways very unfair to the Palestinians and we have allowed the idea that Refugee status for Palestinians uh is hereditary which it is not humanitarian Doctrine on refugees across the world since 1945 with this one exception has been that life and Refugee circumstances is the worst outcome of all that for the refugee population they either need to return to their country of origin or they need to be resettled given the politics they're not going to go back to what they consider their country of origin it's not going to happen Israel is not going to disappear so that's why I think resettlement for the Palestinians themselves is the fairest most just way uh to resolve their status so how does that not fall into the definition of ethnic cleansing which triggers all these accusations of war crimes that ethnic cleansing you hear at con constantly is what the criticism of Israel has been uh for Palestinians who feel wrongly displaced from their land and right now we see even the Israeli government trying to withhold Israeli the the settler movement uh in the West Bank and prompting violence with the West Bank to further encroach on this right well that's that's not my argument my argument is that after conflicts there are often large flows of populations if you look at the world after World War II it was filled with refugees we see that with Ukraine Russia we see refugees all over the world now right and the the worst place for these people is in refugee camps it's especially the worst place when they live there generation after generation the fact is that resettlement in viable economies in the region would make a lot of sense but for the fact Arab governments don't want to take the Palestinians in this is another consequence of the terrible decision to weaponize the Palestinian refugees in Egypt they're concerned that Hamas which is a subsidiary of the Muslim Brotherhood would simply be a greater threat to Egypt the Jordanian government feels the same way so there's there's a lot of work that needs to be done here I don't deny it but I tell you resettling people in Gaza after this conflict is just going to mean the conflict is going to happen again the Palestinian Authority is not an alternative back in the 2007 elections I think it was in Gaza people were surprised that Hamas won and and and many said well you know it's actually not because they favor terrorism they simply will not tolerate the dysfunctional corrupt Palestinian Authority taking control and Hamas looked like an alternative let's face it not much of an alternative I think I think that Gaza is different from the West Bank I think the West Bank is amendable to different solutions but for Gaza which is a large refugee camp that is not a solution that uh is the best future for the Palestinian people let me ask you about what's going on inside America are you surprised by you know the the you know this growing ground swell of criticism of Israel's actions after the Hamas attacks and US complicity and support uh in in that response yes I I am very surprised at it I I think it's a potentially a mortal wound politically for Joe Biden you know in the last 50 years the two parties completely reversed themselves it used to be the Democrats very pro-israel Republicans not often because of anti-Semitism let's be honest about it within the Republican Party now because of the shifting views of the Evangelical Christians who are more strongly supportive of Israel than some in the Jewish Community Republican party is close to unanimous in supporting Israel the Democrats I think look split down anti-semites and all the Republican Party amazingly but the Democrats are split down the middle and I think this is a really serious problem for Joe Biden in 2024 um there are a lot of people who don't see this conflict the way you do and they they don't see uh the kind of pro-israel stance in the same way they make support Palestinians see um Decades of Injustice see it differently some of these people are being canceled or fired Etc I know you've always been a proponent of fair and open discourse and debate how do you feel about the criticism of those who do stand up for the Palestinian side in this and not Hamas but but Palestinian citizens who even from whether it's David Petraeus or Congressman Seth Molton or other saying hey there has to be a political Horizon for these people yeah well look I I think you can take that position and not be anti-semitic and I think uh perhaps it's because many people in America are so surprised at the extent of the support for Palestinians uh but I do I do think there's a deal of anti-Semitism in the United States and I think we're we're seeing it now well former US National Security adviser John Bolton I really appreciate you coming on this show and sharing your candid views thank you so much thanks for having me now we turn to Sarah Lee witson the former Executive Director of Human Rights Watch in the middle e in North Africa and currently the executive director of democracy for the Arab world now Sarah it's very nice of you to join us today this is a very sobering uh disturbing subject on many levels and let me just start out if you were advising the Biden Administration today what would be a few of the key steps you would put in place in response to this crisis so very basically uh we think it's important that the United States starts to enforce its own laws and rules with respect to weapons trans transfers to Israel and I think even a minimal application um would require a suspension of weapons uh uh if we are to be in compliance with us laws second the US needs to support a ceasefire uh we have seen in the over 40 days that the United States has solely permitted this war to continue by blocking uh basic even pause resolutions until uh very very late in in the game right uh that uh uh no no military advant has come of it really all we have is an unbelievable level of death and destruction uh by some calculations over 75% of the casualties are civilians and over the vast majority of those are women and children if we had pushed for a ceasefire from the very beginning if we had stopped blocking a ceasefire uh we might not see the Carnage that we're seeing today on more medium-term and long term just to conclude the thought um we need uh to support International peacekeeping forces uh in Gaza and we need to commit internationally to the Reconstruction of Gaza so that we do not permit Israel to achieve its goal of depopulating Gaza to ensure that the people of Gaza can return to their homes in what is now being called North Gaza um and uh uh uh to not allow the war crime of force displacement to be fulfilled what how do you get to some place where people feel they can live with dignity they can live with autonomy they can have rights and Justice um how do we get there well I mean those are two very different questions I think the first is about the force displacement of Palestinians uh including some uh Israeli plans to relocate the people of uh Gaza to Egypt for example um and some of the talking points that I'm seeing floated around there uh is that this is for their own protection this is for their own security no it's not for their protection and it's not for their security it is to fulfill uh Israel's LGH held uh desire to depopulate Gaza and the United States and the International Community should not facilitate that it should not facilitate creating a permanent buffer zone of of gaza's territory nor should it agree to cramming Palestinians in so-called South Gaza uh permanently uh and certainly should not agree to forcing Palestinians to go to Egypt uh and to try to resettle them there if the people of Gaza need urgent medical care Israel is responsible for providing them that military care why doesn't Israel open up its own borders and boundaries if it wants the people of Gaza uh to flee from Israeli bombs and bombardment Egypt should not have to shol that burden and find itself complici in these war crimes as for a longer term solution I think that for the last 30 years the oso Accords the International Community has been stuck in a stale and expired framework that demands some kind of a negotiated solution between two blocks one block being the Palestinian people and one block being the Israeli people um and only after uh that negotiated solution uh can Palestinians hope to enjoy basic human rights equality and freedom that's a failed approach and the right approach uh is to say that in fact the first thing that needs to happen is that Israel needs to respect the basic human rights of all of the people under its sovereignty and all of the people under its sovereignty do indeed extend from The River To The Sea uh it needs to ensure the end of occupation and the end of aparti uh from where from which position The People Under Israeli sovereignty can vote democratically maybe some Palestinians choose one answer maybe some Israelis choose a different answer however it is that should that answer of how that territory should be configured must be a democratic process and nobody can impose that on the people against their will that's a basic tenant of democracy Sarah let me ask you about the human beings in this in this um equation right now in the hostage swap for prisoners we're seeing a lot of the pictures at least I am of the hostages that have been released and come back into Israel uh in many cases very moving the families the people the stories behind them I'm interested to also know about the prisoners who've been held and to the degree that you know and that you can share your perspective because some Americans have said those are criminals in Israeli prisons I'd like to kind of have a deeper understanding of the Palestinians that are being released in this um swap um well as you know aside from their names there's very little information that is coming out about these prisoners I guess so far only women and children uh who have been released uh and it is forbidden in Israel for Palestinians to celebrate the release of their loved ones uh for these prisoners to talk about their imprisonment uh uh and to describe uh uh what what they've endured uh in detention I think it's very important for for viewers to understand uh that though these people are called prisoners many of them are not lawfully imprisoned they've never had a trial they've never had evidence presented against them they've never been able to challenge uh their detention and their imprisonment because they are subject to military rules that allow for what Israel calls administrative detention that means that I as the state can imprison you on the basis of secret evidence that I don't tell you what that secret evidence is without bringing you before a judge uh and uh renew that detention and that imprisonment indefinitely in perpetuity so many of the people who uh are now released uh from uh Israeli captivity have never been lawfully imprisoned uh they have never been found guilty of any crime so to call them criminals uh is really really jumping ahead of the evidence and we know that there are thousands of Palestinians including women including children who are imprisoned in this Kafkaesque unbelievable system of imprisoning people on secret evidence indefinitely but a lot of people look at the Israeli Gaza crisis as a function of proxy battles of other players and I and I guess the question I have is how much of this is that's a mistaken blind spot this is really about Palestinian Justice not Iran not a prun I mean I I want to know how you look at it um uh I I think it's an insult to Palestinians to say that they are merely proxy agents of Iran um Iran may be choosing to support uh some armed groups uh in the Middle East uh just as other parties in the region very unfortunately very sadly support other armed groups in the region just the way the United States was supporting armed groups in Syria uh just the way that uh other uh uh countries have unfortunately been supporting armed groups and terrorist acts inside Iran unfortunately I don't think anyone is innocent of that um but let's not confuse that with the grievances um that open up people to receiving weapons for example uh uh that that give them something to fight for let's just recognize um that Palestinians in Gaza in particular have been living under an unbelievable Siege uh since 2006 a near complete closure of the territory that has stifled and strangled the two million people there cutting them off from the rest of the world limiting even their caloric intake subjecting them to regular patterns of bombardment um I think the fact of the matter is that if it wasn't Iran somebody else uh would find a way to support these grievances uh that Palestinians have uh and exploit them of course maybe for nefarious ends or not but that doesn't take away from the fundamental grievance as for the larger geopolitical uh consequences of what's happened since October 7 I think it has exposed uh really the complete failure of the Biden Administration Str strategy and approach to the Middle East one that was predicated on uh pursuing so-called stability uh by aligning an apartheid state apartheid Israel with various Petro dollar dictatorships in the region and thinking that they could bypass the Palestinian entirely the as the Palestinian problem entirely uh by building these little dictatorial alliances in the region um I think that has been exploded uh as a strategy y for stability you will not have stability so long as you have this sort of extreme oppression and subjugation the natural human instinct is to resist and to fight back um and you will not be able to ignore the occupation of Palestinians uh and bypass resolving that conflict as a path uh to Middle East stability and security I hope that the Biden Administration has woken up to that reality uh and I hope that the Arab states that signed the Abraham Accords uh uh thinking that they too could profit and benefit from bypassing Palestinians by getting little payoffs from the United States I hope they too rethink that and rethink the dangers to their own stability for being seen so closely aligned uh to Israel in the face of this massive Slaughter of civilians there but that remains to be seen Sarah Lee witson executive director of Dawn and former Executive Director of Human Rights Watch in the Middle East and North Africa thanks so much for your cander and joining us today thank you for having me so what's the bottom line I feel Ambassador Bolton is wrong on ideas like resettling Palestinians elsewhere which amounts to a continuation of the ethnic removal of Palestinians from the occupied territories some would call this ethnic cleansing a war crime but he is correct when he says that any resolution of the Palestinian question is really hard to achieve whether it's a one-state system that's blind to religion and ethnicity or or two separate states or any plan that really offers dignity and autonomy for Palestinians that's why there's a war underway and the dereliction of responsibility of world powers on this problem has led to This Global horrible conflict in which so many are dying it's hard to listen to views that we disagree with but we do have to hear the spectrum of debate as it really is in Washington today not what we would wish it to be and that's the bottom
