before we head to our guests let's take a look at how the human cost of this latest War compares to others in the 2008 war on Gaza about 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis died before a ceasefire was reached in 2014 more than 2,000 Palestinians were killed in Gaza 73 Israelis died most of them members of the Armed Forces and two years ago another flare up resulted in 250 Palestinians killed in Gaza 13 people lost their lives inside Israel let's focus now on how this latest conflict between Hamas and Israel could pan out and whether it could be more prolonged and even more bitter than those that have come before we've got three guests joining us to discuss this we have Raphael jerusalmi he is a former Israeli intelligence officer and is in t Aviv we have Maran bashara who is alzer's senior political analyst in Paris and Par Patrick Buri is a defense and security analyst before we head to Our Guest though we're going to cross to the United Nations where the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations is speaking let's listen to what he has to say and began a barbaric progam a barbaric prgram of unparalleled magnitude ruthless terrorists gunned down innocent Israeli civilians in the streets murdering anything that moved anything I'll show you just one example just look at this photo of bodies of women strewn strewn in the street in a bus stop Innocents murdered in Cold Blood these animall likee terrorists broke into homes gathered entire families into rooms and shot them point blank as if they were stomping on on insects grandparents and the elderly among them Holocaust Survivors who endured the Nazis were violently dragged from their homes This Time by Hamas and taken into Gaza can you get me the photo of the Holocaust Survivor look at this grandmother being forced to hold a Hamas terrorist rifle as he takes a picture with her this is inhumane inhumane mothers and their babies as well as babies separated from their mothers were brutally taken hostage just look at this video now this mother is crying as she clutches her two precious babies before being put on a truck to Gaza these are war crimes blatant documented war crimes but tragically the Abominations don't end here Hamas terrorists happened upon an outdoor party of hundreds of young Israelis celebrating the holiday weekend these Savages gunned down Jewish Travelers just like na death squads in the 1940s hundreds hundreds were boed ured their bodies mutilated and defiled and those who survived were taken to Gaza listen to this young girl screaming as she is kidnapped separated from her friend not knowing what fate awaits try to comprehend the magnitude of this situation try to digest the ruthless inhumanity I have seen shocking footage graphic images that will forever be seared in my brain what we are witnessing are war crimes blatant barbaric war crimes slaughtering civilians abusing hostages taking babies from their Ruth from their mothers there are no words to describe such savagery I don't want to imagine what is happening right now to all of those innocent Israeli civilians being held captive in Gaza the horrors they are enduring okay that was the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations ahead of a security council meeting certainly some strong words of condemnation coming from him I want to bring in alzer's senior political analyst Maran bashara to give us his reaction to what was said by the Ambassador Maan uh well it's to be expected of course U there's been a tragedy of sort for Israel it was shocked uh to the core uh by the attack uh yesterday uh by Hamas Fighters and I think they're immediately getting engaged in uh public relations uh campaign in order to demonize uh Hamas and the Palestinians and but alas in this uh very particular region for every uh picture or image dramatic bloody and sad as it may be the Palestinian of course will produce thousand other images and pictures of Palestinians uh dead and injured and and kidnapped and so on and so forth by Israeli soldiers and Israeli settlers it is quite unfortunate that instead of the learning the lessons of history in this very particular case the Israelis are immediately resorting to more of the same hasbara to more of the same propaganda instead of really looking Inward and to see what are the root causes of this issue and what drives Hamas fighters to carry uh such an attack why would they terrorize uh the population of thousand Israel what is the nature of occupation what is the nature of Oppression that produces this kind of resistance because as we know from 300 years and more of history of such asymetrical conflicts when Guerilla Warfare takes place against uh occupi or imperialists or colonialists it's always a certain dialectic between repression and resistance and resistance as it were the Apple doesn't follow far from the tree the resistance is very much a a mirror image of the occupation except the resistance seems to be unfortunately I would put it that way retail violence while occupation is a whole sale violence against the people Maan I appreciate your insights I want to move away from the historical context now and look at what's currently happening militarily and let's return to our guests bring in Raphael jerusalmi who is a former Israeli intelligence officer in Tel Aviv and Patrick Buri who is a defense and security analyst and former British Army Captain I'm going to start with you though Raphael um we've heard tonight those the most recent developments coming out of Israel and from the knesset is an official declaration of war what if any impact will that have on the conflict on the ground it will give more power uh to the government and to the Army uh to take Extreme Measures to act fast uh to have quick decisions to strike uh very hard uh I must say that what happened and I'm happy to have an example of some body just before me uh on the screen to justify uh raping and killing women and children uh which is a very good thing because this killing of children this raping uh has led uh Israel to eventually understand who we are dealing with we are dealing with a a faction a terrorist faction that we hoped until a few days ago that we could uh have improve the way of life of the the people of Gaza I want to say very quickly and and very from the beginning I want to dissociate the Palestinian people from those people who are attacking Israel in such a way the Palestinian people we have no hatred for them and they have no hatred for us they are being as we spoke of Rel I'm just going to interrupt you there I'm sorry because you've just made quite a a strong allegation in terms of the raping of women I think we do need to clarify that as as far as I'm aware we haven't actually heard any confirmation that that is what's been happening on the ground and as we've been reporting there have been hundreds of Civilian deaths on either side perhaps before we go to our other guest marn I'll just get you to respond to Raphael if we can look uh uh just in a very you know sober way if one can be sober in such uh tragic uh uh times we know that Hamas held uh one very particular captive and that was gilad Shalit an Israeli soldier for a number of years and then he was released in a prisoner exchange and what we know from gilit himself after he was released from captivity by Hamas in Gaza is that basically nothing much happened to him I mean and as much as there is anger frustrated frustration and pent up violence in Gaza in the end of the day the Israeli soldiers was healed was released and in as far as I could tell from interviews with him he was remained as he was before he was uh uh uh uh you know uh uh gotting to be captive by habas okay I want to move on I want to move on now okay sorry rapael I'll let you explain I'll let you respond I will just ask a question I do not want to go into this sterile debate of who is the most noty the Jews or the Palestinians in this story and who has perpetuated the most atrocities this is a sterile debate yes my question again my question again is very simple in what way do you think that this operation of killing civilians yesterday will improve the quality of life of the people of Gaza in what way do you think this will advance the Palestinian cause do you really believe that by doing this you are going to liberate Palestine and make Palestinian people happy ra I'm the one that excuse me sir I'm I'm the one that's going to ask the questions here as much as I appreciate your uh opinions and I want to focus the whole point of this panel is to focus on the military situation at the moment I think that we can go back and forward about this historical Conflict for days and weeks but what I want to focus on is the military conflict and that's why I want to bring in Patrick uh we're hearing that the White House particularly Joe Biden has spoken to the Israeli Prime Minister and as well Netanyahu has spoken to um excuse me the White House has spoken to net Netanyahu and he has said that additional assistance for Israeli Defense Forces is now on its way to Israel what do you think that looks like good evening I think the first thing would be intelligence support that's the kind of assets you can move quickly um to get over the areas in question try to give um Israel some more plugin from the US intelligence side um that's usually the kind of thing uh potentially with some high-tech weapons the Israelis obviously have a very capable Arsenal themselves so it's probably less of a a um a requirement than just getting some extra Intel support in the first instance so they can understand the picture because they've been taken by surprise I think as Raphael said there's an intent thing here which has been a failure they've misunderstood hamas's int tensions and then at the operational level clearly they've been taken badly by surprise even though as history tells us you know this holiday season you should be more aware more cautious than usual um and there'll obviously be serious political repercussions of this what looks like also an intelligence potentially a policy failure as well yes just on that point and I'll just stick with you for just a moment from a military perspective how hard will it be for Hamas to maintain this level of conflict now that we're hearing some of these superpowers are going to get involved well I don't know the superpowers getting involved might be an overstatement this would be intelligence support you know it's no boots on the ground or anything like that it's kind of the thing you do with allies and partners of which Israel is to the United States so um no what listen the most interesting thing about this from a military perspective obviously is the way that Hamas were able to overcome uh in in a coordinated attack at multiple targets five or six in synchronized in time uh using it first drones against you've got to remember the wall is basically a bit of a network it's not just a wall that they've broken through um they've managed to disable the sensors using drones uh also knocked out tanks using drones we've seen that in the Ukraine war um they've used the barrages of it looks like Iranian supplied missiles to get around it through Iron Dome overwhelm it uh and then at the same time using either gliders or just attack squads essentially cut through the wire and get into some of the even army bases I think it raises questions as to Israel's military capability which which isn't a good look for Israel since it look likes to be uh seen as the strong man and Incredibly capable in in that region um and potentially there's you know speaking to some experts there's a question mark have they been too sort of raid and and counterterrorism focused and maybe not expecting this um so I think there's a there's a lot of repercussions to come out of this for sure Raphael what's your response to what Patrick said as a Former Intelligence officer how do you see the US support playing out will that come in the form of intelligence uh it will come in the form of intelligence uh as usual but it also comes into a logistic support we need more and more ammunition from the iron system uh we had between two and 3,000 uh rockets and missiles being shot from Gaza into Israel so we used a lot of our ammunition and usually the United States help us uh to have more Weaponry more Munitions uh I don't think we do need um the American Army I'm sure that Joe Biden doesn't want to have American troops boots on the ground uh and not even the fleet in in the Mediterranean it wouldn't help in any way because what gives a lot of superiority to the Hamas is that Gaza is a very densely populated area and it's very difficult to operate there it doesn't matter if you bring the whole American Army that's not going to change anything because we're talking about Urban Guerilla Warfare which is like from house to house from streets to Street in very narrow most of the time streets that of course the inhabitants of Gaza know very well and that a soldier coming in from abroad that doesn't know uh it gives a very a tremendous advantage and it always has been gerilla Warfare as against the regular army it's a very complicated intricate situation especially that in Gaza because of the density of the population and because the leaders of the Hamas are hiding behind schools and hospitals uh makes it extremely difficult to operate he has to be very s surgical uh and very fast and we have here a very big problem that's why uh the IDF will avoid as long as possible to enter with ground forces uh there will be as much as possible a pounding from the artillery and the Air Force and that's why today uh we have asked uh citizens of Gaza to leave their homes to go to a beach to go to a field but to evacuate their homes because we are now destroying everything that is a command center or commun Communication Center of the Kamas and these are usually in buildings inside the city okay I'll let I'll just let Maran respond because we're talking about the military might of Israel versus Hamas how has Hamas managed to acquire and amass this huge amount of Weaponry especially Rockets even as it's under sage and given the sanctions well I'm sure they're not going to give out give away their secrets right uh but let's uh let's put it this way Emily as it were uh need is the mother of all inventions and because of the dimetry of forces of power uh between Israel and the Palestinian factions the Palestinian factions had to resort to new creative way uh in order to uh confront Israel in order to defend themselves and these uh means tend to be uh the kind of things that we've seen uh the way they could uh bypass uh the Israeli wall of security through by air or by sea or digging these countless tunnels right as they did as they did in the past so clearly they have gone from strategy to strategy they have tried to devise new intelligent creative ways some of them are FR controversial uh but be that as it may they needed to do that because in a symmetrical Warfare the weaker party cannot face the stronger party uh face to face you know the 18th century Warfare is over in this kind of asymmetrical Warfare as Israel pounds Gaza by rockets and by planes and that's certainly random not exactly targeted because you could never Target anything by you know uh launching these sorts of rockets against a populated area but to say to people to go to the beaches and and to the and to the fields when just yesterday we've heard that the Israelis were in fact bombing the fields so in Gaza a prison of two three million people there is nowhere to go the only way they can do in fact is only swim for it and you can imagine how ridiculous that sounds okay I want to move on to another issue Patrick I'll address this question to you we know that there are an unknown number of Israeli prisoners that are being held by Hamas Hamas has used prisoners before like this in the past and managed to gain a lot in exchange so how do you see them using these prisoners going forward particularly within the negotiations so I just to actually pick up on one thing Maran said it's all all correct in terms of you know being creative Innovative adaptive they're also getting Hamas are getting a lot of help from the Iranian revolutionary guards score and that point needs to be made um it's very clear so um and that would be training and weapon support uh as to the hostages the um the hostages essentially there as an insurance policy to try to slow down or deter a uh a a ground incursion uh and also the air strikes to make it more complex in terms of the where they're going to hit they want to make sure the IDF will want to try to make sure that they're not going to bomb their own civilians who've been held hostage so it's essent essentially about a deterrence and about a um a slowing down of the ground offensive if it can work in that sense and finally then as you correctly identified as a as a chip a bargaining chip in negotiations but you know we're not in the negotiations phase here at all and the the priority of course will be for those if that's what they're to be used as ultimately as a bargaining ship well then the uh the Palestinians and the Hamas who's taken them essentially have to ensure their safety don't they so that they're not killed so we shall see we've already seen in the past hour or two uh heavy strikes heavy bombardment on Gaza City uh Raphael do you think that we will see this conflict turning to the ground do you think that the military will turn to offensive operations going forward and what form will that take will that be boots on the ground entering the Border yes it would be it has to be there's no choice to finish the job uh boots on on the ground because uh this time it is true we have uh this problem of the hostages uh that we want to spare on the other hand these hostages are the very last hostages the Hamas will ever put their hands on meaning uh the violence of this attack the surprise attack the cruelty of this surprise attack have achieved two things unity in Israel the Israelis were divided until that attack it was political chaos it was a social controversy everybody is now United from the top to the bottom and everybody's United in one thing to finish once and for all the Kamas the Hamas Yesterday by performing this attack has signed its own death warrant it shall be destroyed it is the last time they will have hostages they might be sacrificed or they might be saved but the priority is to finish once and for all and because of that uh there will be boots on the ground the advice that is given by most security person including myself is to send these boots on the ground as late as possible and to destroy from the air and from the artillery as much as possible because as was rightly pointed once the Israeli troops enter Gaza they will suffer a lot of casualties all right rapael Maan we only have a few minutes left of the program I just I guess I wanted to get your perspective as we talk about military and the politics we're ultimately talking about people and we've had hundreds of casualties on both the Israeli and on the Gaza side just a final thought from you uh look it's horrible right casualties civilians on either side on any side but I think this very particular conflict we need to go beyond the casualties because that's not what the leaders really think about believe it or not they're not as Humane as the rest of us I think here what we have is a major blow to Israel's strategy policy psychology and so on so forth and while the Israeli is now are united around Netanyahu because of the tragedy I think soon enough Netanyahu is going to be deposed because everything all these failures happened under his watch and why did this all happen and just very briefly let's summarize 4,000 years of History the ancient Greece understood it better than anyone else it's called it's called hubris arrogance arrogance breeds blindness and stupidity the Israelis were arrogant in 73 and they were dealt up blow they were arrogance in the 1980s and they were dealt up blow by the Lebanese resistance and they're again been arrogant towards the Palestinians and they were delt of Loos it's tragic but that's just what happened when hubus is the order of the day for Israel yeah there's certainly a lengthy historical context that we could spend a long time taking into account we really appreciate all of our guests thoughts unfortunately we do have to leave it there but we will continue our rolling coverage of the war between Israel and Gaza and I'll just recap there are more than 700 Israeli C casualties and almost 400 Palestinians stay with us we have more news in just a moment
