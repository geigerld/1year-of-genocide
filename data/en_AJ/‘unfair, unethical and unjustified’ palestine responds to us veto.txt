right to self-determination is inalienable it is not tied to a time or a time frame our right is eternal perminent and continuous it cannot be delayed it cannot be suspended and it has no statute of limitations it is important that this right not be subject to manipulation or domination or conditions especially not by Israel the occupying power the ethnic cleansing power the genocidal power the colonial power that is determined to evict our people from their Homeland to eliminate their identity and to replace their history and their culture and to appro their present and civilization and to besiege their future and their Horizons the people of Palestine will not disappear we will not disappear the people of Palestine will not be buried they are a historical fact they are a history that cannot be erased no matter the great power no matter the Tyranny this Palestinian people the Glorious people of Palestine remained on land not out of Charity or Mercy from Israel but out of patience and steadfastness and hope and sacrifice despite the occupation despite the oppression despite Exile enslavement besiege despite being persecuted and displaced and evicted and driven away as refugees we have repeatedly warned of Israel's Colonial policy in our land which it not simply declares openly but now boasts of it we have warned of the absence of a horizon for our resolution we have warned of the dangers of ignoring the Palestinian cause and its Central nature of ignoring the suffering of the Palestinian people which is only growing we have warned of the dangers of claiming that a just peace is possible in our region without a just comprehensive and Lasting resolution to the pales question Madam President we came to the security Council today at an important historic moment regionally and internationally so that we could Salvage what can be saved we place you before a historic responsibility to establish the foundations of a just and comprehensive peace in our region you are before the opportunity to revive the hope that has been lost amongst our peoples we put you before the responsibility of interpreting and translating your commitment toward the two-state solution along the 1967 lines into actual action firm action that cannot be maneuvered or retracted the majority of the security Council Members have risen to the level of this historic moment and they have stood on the side of justice and freedom and hope in line with the ethical and humanitarian and legal principles that must govern our world and in line with simple logic here we renew our sincere appreciation to Sister Lee Algeria and to the Arab and Islamic groups and the member states of of the non-aligned movement and the maltes presidency of the council a dedicated presidency that has managed our proceedings wisely we express our appreciation to all of those who supported the Palestinian membership request and all of those who voted in favor of the draft resolution by all of your statements those who voted in favor and even those who voted differently of the passion that it contained in your commitment and uh understanding the pain and the moment of the Palestinian people I salute you in the name of the Palestinian leadership say the r Madam president we accepted the two-state solution along the 1967 borders as an international vision of Peace Arab states put forth the Arab peace initiative to support this Vision we built our state with the efforts of our sons and daughters and with the support and Trust of the International Community despite the obstacles placed by Israel we have engaged in the peace process in a manner that would secure our Supreme national interests and we have abided by foundations of a peaceful and legal settlement to the conflict the leadership under the presidency of President Mahmud Abbas continues to be committed to this peaceful track and we renew our call for an International Peace conference to be held under multilateral International sponsorship a conference that aims to put an end to the Israeli occupation and achieve the independence of the State of Palestine but the question remains is there a true partner for peace in Israel is there a partner in peace with us in Israel Israel insists through its consecutive governments it insists on maintaining occupation on murder on Siege on the eviction of people on building settlements these are all policies and practices that run counter to the United Nations Charter and to the resolutions of the United Nations and all aim to achieve just one objective namely to stuff out any hope of a sovereign Palestinian state of a Palestinian state that exists as a viable State Israel believes that the state of Palestine is a permanent strategic threat to it and will do its best to block the sovereignty of a States and to make sure that the Palestinian people are exiled away from their Homeland or remain under its occupation forever it is up to you now to determine who loves peace and who is the enemy of Peace who loves peace and who is the enemy of Peace who wants to save the lives of Innocents and who seeks to perpetrate genocide Israel does not want a two-state solution Israel does not want a state of Palestine this is Israel's scheme this was approved by the knesset and it's publicly announced by the knesset members and it's very representative in this Council and anywhere in the United Nations and outside of the United Nations does so this is a plan that is claimed by Israeli government officials and politicians Netanyahu even boasted about this as a political achievement boasting that he succeeded in preventing the rise of a Palestinian State he declared this in his imaginary map the map that he brought with him to the general assembly last September a map of Israel from the river to the Sea a map that annihilates the existence of Palestine this is the plan of his extremist government to get rid of Palestine to get rid of the Palestinians this delusion unfortunately costs innocent lives and do you know what Israel needs implement this delusional plan the plan to evict the people and to anex a land all it needs is more time more immunity and more lives and blood what will the International Community do what will you do you the International Security Council that is charged with the maintenance of International Peace and security what are you going to do what will you do what are will will you give Israel the time it needs to Annex Palestinian land will you give it the immunity to evict the people and kill them will you give Israel the weapons to kill more people will you give her give Israel the right to veto to V to our right to exist on our land to veto the Palestinian State's right to full membership in the United Nations palestine's membership in the United Nations is not symbolic it is a matter of great importance to Palestinians and to the peoples of the region at this very sensitive time it is something that they have been awaiting since 1947 since 1949 until 92 we've been waiting since 1947 and we are in 2024 he this is an important step to rectify a historic Injustice that befell the Palestinian people since the partition resolution and through the and until this very day it is an important step to revive faith in international legitimacy in international law and in this very organization and its Charter and to revive hope in the peaceful settlement of the conflict giving palestin the membership is a manifestation of our right to self-determination it consolidates the legitimacy of the State of Palestine in a manner that is irreversible and cannot be denied by any party it protects and preserves the land of the State of Palestine so that it is not divied up as present as happened before palestine's membership in the security in the United Nations is an investment in peace admit us to membership it's an investment in peace our full membership in the United Nations does not detract from the rights of any other member State nor does this membership threaten or cancel out the membership of any other state we just want to be equal to all of you we don't want to replace anyone we want to enter your Club as equal supporting granting Palestine full membership has put us on the path of Hope to keep the hope alive the fact that this resolution did not pass will not break our will and it will not defeat our determination we will not stop in our effort the state of Palestine is inevitable it is real perhaps they see it as far away but we see it as near and we are the faithful Madame President we are the ones who experience oppression and Injustice we know more than anyone else the nature of this oppressive occupation because we live it we know
