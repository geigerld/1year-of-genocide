a senior political analyst one of the key elements of this of course is one of precedent and albeit that this is ultimately is going to be an advisory opinion as we've been hearing just from Bernard but also from our previous guest as well our legal expert um there is no question that this is going to have some sort of ramification for cases going forward absolutely especially on the parts uh that we will be discussed uh later and will have to be deliberated on by the court the aspects of such as the apartate is there an a regime of apartate going on on the occupied territories and what does that mean because when that was judged so in the case of South Africa it had huge ramifications right and that goes to the sort of to the to the nature of what we're witnessing today because I'm not sure if you notice I'm going to I'm going to sound maybe anticlimax a bit our viewers around the world who've been watching us the past almost two decades Must Be Wondering what is this I mean what are we watching how could Israel's six decades occupation be legal why are we discussing the illegality of Israel occupation can be can such a system of Violence by one people against another people that goes on for decades be legal can one country steal the land of another people and settle on it be legal so why are we discussing it why are the Palestinians appealing to the icj to get a ruling that is obvious to everyone around the world we're reporting on it for God's sakes every day it's because of what you just asked it's because when you set it up in legal terms when the illegitimate becomes by letter and spirit illegal then there will be ramifications and imp implications when other organization other countries such as take for example European Union if the European Union that has a favorite trade relations with Israel and now the icj came out with a ruling says the occupied 30s are illegal occupied Israel practices an aparted regime a crime against humanity against the Palestinians would you really want to continue with your preferred trade status with with Israel would you want to provide it with arms so this legal precedent as such is hugely important I want to ask you about that because a few days ago we saw a court in the Netherlands which upheld a ruling which said that the Dutch government could not supply parts for F-35 fighters to Israel now Paul rler himself the legal expert we heard just speaking before we we uh they broke for um the the intermission was calling out the US saying that the US has repeatedly supported Israel in its actions of course the US is a major supplier of arms to Israel if the the ruling goes against Israel isn't it incumbent legally is there not at least an obligation as you were saying on those countries who are ostensibly supporting Israel in its actions to stop doing it and what implications do you think that would have for the US it certainly would have ramifications on some more than others right because we you going to see someone like the United States uh you know go as we heard them before with the South African case at icj say this is meritless this is baseless we don't want to discuss it now it's counterproductive it's in fact interfering in our effort to help resolve the Israel Palestine issue and so on so forth but I think the idea that the icj would come out a ruling and it will be nuanced not simply that the six decades occupation is illegal but the fact that a parted regime which once again there's precedence on it on the question of South Africa crime against humanity is practiced every day in East Jerusalem as well as in the West Bank and Gaza and so so forth this will have ramifications across the board some countries will be able to withstand it more than others but some countries have already been taken uh precautions for example the United States has considered generally speaking settlements on the West Bank to be illegal at one point then as they said they start saying they are problematic and then uh you know they they're not helpful and and so on so forth but generally speaking the United States has taken the position that settlements are illegal and hence every time they give Aid to Israel they underline that this should not go to the West Bank settlements and so on so forth but de facto it does dour it does because now in the West Bank there are these illegal Jewish settlements that are directly supported by the Israeli government directly financed by the Israeli government there are educational institutions in the settlements that are directly supported by the Israeli government so this is not just a bunch of Israeli citizens radicals extremists or whatever taking off and settling in the West Bank the project of settlement in the West Bank the bypass roads that we just heard about the bypass roads the aparted roads that Jews can get on Palestinians cannot get on the apartheid wall that this court has made a judgment on back in 2004 that it is illegal in the occupied West Bank right all of that will have implications on the on the intermediate and long run I want to ask you about that because one of the the uh words that um Israel invariably comes back to when it defends itself in cases like this is that these lands are disputed and therefore there cannot be no annexation because these lands are under dispute and there needs to be a resolution of that dispute if we get if there is a result from this court that is in favor of the Palestinian case in in favor of Thea that has brought this action where does that leave Israel's defense of these are disputed lands well to be clear and this is actually an important point point you rais this court is not judging whether the occupied territories are occupied or disputed they are occupied here we're not hearing a debate on whether they are disputed or occupied Israel can make the claim it wants and it does it makes outrageous claims huge lies non-stop for 50 plus years because at the United Nations security Council on a number of occasions the nature of Israel's presence on the occupied territories how was deemed as occupation there is no dispute over over the fact that Israel occupies the West Bank Gaza and East Jerusalem except in the minds of certain Israelis and not all Israelis of certain Israelis so Israel makes claims but those claims are not in line with the International Community with international law as transpired at the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations security Council what the court is going to be deliberating on that this occupation this military occupation has not gone on for 5 years 10 years 15 years 20 25 30 35 it's G on for 56 years and guess what what we've just heard before in the latest argument by RoR is that Israel intends to make it permanent that everything about Israel's settlements project that justifies the presence of Israeli military on the occupied territories everything thing about that settlement project makes it an annexation de facto and dour by Israel and hence this occupation becomes annexation and hence it's illegal right so it's not it's not the question whether Israel occupies is whether this occupation is legal for a certain amount of time what they are showing is that Israel has had and has every intention to prolong this occupation as long as possible to make it def facto annexation and hence it is illegal that you cannot go on occupying another people for over than over than five decades and still say well you know it's just temporary it might go on for another 50 years another 100 years 200 years it's always temporary no this is not temporary because everything about it everything about it looks permanent especially when you move in de facto by Design communities Jewish communities on those occupied territories you conf confiscate land illegally from Palestinians living on those lands and you give it to the Jews that are legally illegally settling there and you have one generation after another Generation Now of illegal settlers and when they showed us the diagram there we saw how I remember for example when the so-called peace process started in 1991 in Madrid we had something like 75,000 settlers 75,000 settlers today today there are 700,000 settlers including East Jerusalem there's about 500,000 in the occupied West Bank Plus around 200,000 Plus in East Jerusalem so there are unoccupied territories after 1967 some 700,000 settlers illegal settlers which means it doubled 10 times since 1991 in terms of the Imp implications and the ramifications of the ripple effect if you like of of whatever ruling is eventually made if it is made in favor of of the unga case brought on behalf of the Palestinians what kind of impact do you think is that going to have on cases that are brought before the international criminal court or the um the Human Rights Council for example we should specify that the icj is there in order to facilitate issues between States but the international criminal court see here's cases which are directed towards individuals what's the knock on effect of this going to be if it is um if the ruling goes against Israel despite the fact I'm no legal scholar but um logically right and from the record from history that I that I've read as a student of this conflict of this issue of this apart a of this occupation is that there is a domino effect and that there is relationship there is synergy between one and another whenever one ruling comes out it becomes precedent and it's used on another ruling and clearly what we see now from the uh from the claims made by the lawyers is that if you notice their their their arguments are based on either the United Nations have come up with United Nations resolution Security Council General Assembly the 2004 non-binding Court opinion the icj back then and so on and so forth so there's you always build precedence and you always build arguments and those arguments accumulate and one argument then can help in another Court over another argument and yes we do move from the court like the icj that discusses issues of between states to the ICC to the international criminal court where you discuss more the responsibility for example of Israeli leaders of Israeli generals who have been responsible for war crimes where orders were were were given where people died were killed in war that we know that was in every possible aspect of its execution was illegal so I think Israelis Israeli leaders should worry moving forward not that they will end up in prison or in or in the haue because they are unfortunately contined to be shielded by the United States as we've heard in the arguments earlier but I think once again they will be exposed more and more to local legal processes like we've seen in Holland like we've seen in the UK and other places before whereby you will see more and more Israeli leaders war criminals being uh looked into investigated and perhaps arrested
