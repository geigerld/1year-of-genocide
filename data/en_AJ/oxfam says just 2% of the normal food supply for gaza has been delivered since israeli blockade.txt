the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees unwa says that it's overwhelmed by the number of people displaced by Israel's war on Gaza it says 600,000 displaced Palestinians have fled their homes and are taking Refuge at its shelters at least 40 of its facilities that include schools and Clinics have been impacted by Israeli strikes the agency says it shelters are hosting currently four times their capacity many families are sleeping in the streets meanwhile Oxfam is warning that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war the agency says just 2% of the normal food supply has been delivered after Israel imposed a total blockade Oxfam described the situation as horrific and says 2.3 million people are being collectively punished in contravention of international humanitarian law bush raal is policy lead in the occupied Palestinian territory in Israel at Oxfam you're joining us from rala Bushra so your uh group your organization studied this what have been your findings so before the hostilities escalated Israel um had imposed for 16 years an illegal blockade on Gaza um and 104 food trucks at the time uh were entering Gaza daily um that's a truck every 14 minutes uh now only 30 trucks uh have delivered food since the weekend only in the southern part of Gaza um through the raah crossing um averaging one truck every three hours and 12 minutes uh the significant drop in food deliveries is creating an immediate and life-threatening situation for 2.2 million people of which half are children um who are now in desperate desperate need so that's where you get the 2% of their usual food supply that they've been getting since this started what are people eating um my family is in Gaza uh yesterday they shared three cans of tuna between about 20 people with cucumber um they have to queue as your uh reporter said for hours for water or even to get some bread um prices have flown up the roof clean water is almost non-existent with only three liters available per person um the UN sets 15 lers as the bare minimum even in in humanitarian emergencies um can you say those numbers again can you say those numbers again for our viewers the water that they have versus the water that people need so so so far people have only three laders um a day per person um the UN sets 15 leaders um as the minimum bare minimum even in humanitarian emergencies uh as the bar uh so that's five times less than what the UN sets as the bare minimum for a people person to survive um um as your reporter also mentioned numerous bakeries and supermarkets have been destroyed and damaged uh those that are operational of course cannot meet the local demand for Essentials uh like fresh bread um gaza's only working wheat Mill is non-operational because there's no fuel because and it runs of course on electricity um essential items like food flour oil sugar um uh are present in under destroyed warehouses but delivering them is nearly impossible due to the damaged roads this is interesting I think a lot of people don't know this bush right you're saying that there are basic food stuffs even as people are hungry there are basic food stuffs that are currently undamaged in warehouses what is happening to those well they can't reach them because the roads are so destroyed and there's constant bombardment that people can't reach that food um and there's lack of fuel so you don't have have also the possibility to move those uh those stocks around um because there's nowhere safe in Gaza they're bombarding uh the North like the South um we're we're finding actually my family has gone back to Gaza City today because they could not sustain the living conditions they were in while taking refuge in the middle area um over 15,000 Farmers have lost their crops uh 10,000 livestock breeders are struggling and the Finish fishing industry is completely paralyzed Gaza has a huge fishing industry but they can't go to the Sea uh to fish um the current of course electricity um blackout is affecting the refrigeration of Food Supplies if there was any can I jump in there's an important part of your statement which I read that says there there there were um food stuffs obviously that came in on these trucks uh these 60 or so trucks that have been allowed into the Gaza Strip since the weekend uh uh I beg your pardon 30 trucks okay that's not the number that I had um but that lentils and Pasta in particular were allowed to enter into the Gaza Strip your statement mentions that and also mentions that actually that can't always be consumed because of a lack of uh electricity and a lack of uh drinking water yeah exactly I mean people can't cook there's no gas to cook there's no electricity to cook and there's no clean water to cook so you can't make lentil soup or rice uh without clean water and without gas um so maybe some families have some supplies uh but generally speaking it has been mostly canned food what people have been surviving on how long how much longer can this last I know it's very difficult to obviously put a date on it but you're telling me you're telling me that people are living right now off of tuna cans and cucumbers um presumably they don't have unlimited resources of tuna can and cucumber stays I beg your pardon it's impossible to it's impossible to we're unable to operate our operations have been halted we're only able to do very small distributions of hygiene kits soap toothpaste things like this um our partners are also trying to live the day so our assessment our ability to assess the situation with very precise data is extremely difficult to really and we can't reach people we can't reach affected communities to also do those assessments to understand really how much supplies do they have left I would expect that people from um with better incomes might have more supplies but people that are struggling knowing that more than half of Gaza is lives under the poverty line are already starving gaza's population is very young what does it do to children especially the youngest children to be malnourished I mean look Staying Alive because you're eating the bare minimum that's one thing but to actually be malnourished what are you are you looking at that in terms of what it does in the medium-term the long term to these young bodies um we we are developing this analysis further um but I would I mean from just common sense uh a child should be having at least three meals a day with two snacks in between uh a good portion of protein and vegetables uh including carbs um uh and all the vitamins that they need especially that they're growing um that's malnutrition and and malnutrition has severe long-term consequences on children uh not only actually physical uh consequences but mental health consequences um we I had worked for another international organization that had we commissioned a report three years ago after the 2021 war and it found that four out of five PE children uh felt abandoned by the world Bush khi your policy lead in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel at the international Aid organization Oxfam we thank you for taking the time to join us on the program today thank you
