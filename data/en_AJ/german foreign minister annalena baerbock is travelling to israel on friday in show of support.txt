the German foreign minister analina Bok will visit Israel on Friday the German Chancellor Olaf Schulz has been criticizing the Palestinian president Mohammed Abbas over his silence after the Hamas attacks on Israel as Schulz has been addressing parliament in Berlin and he urged abass to condemn the actions of the Armed group the German Chancellor also reiterating all development aid for the Palestinian territories under review I ask myself where is the clear condemnation of the terrorist violence from the Palestinian Authority and its president Mahmud Abbas [Applause] abas I will say your silence is shameful we will review our entire development Aid to the Palestinian territories our yard stick will be weather and how these project best serve peace in the region and the security of Israel well for more on this let's go to Berlin how Melissa CH is standing by for us so Melissa what more do we know about the German foreign minister and her visit to Israel we have no details right this moment this just got confirmed a few minutes earlier but as far as German foreign policy in regards to Israel is concerned uh there should be no surprises the message is going to be consistent uh German officials have come out to say repeatedly that they stand with Israel uh we heard Schultz speaking earlier today about uh the obligations um and also offering any assistance any help whatever it is that Israel wants Germany will do its best to provide um just mentioning earlier of course the the stoppage of development Aid I think it is worth pointing out however uh that it does not disclude the possibility of Berlin providing humanitarian Aid uh so that is something to look out for in terms of uh the decisions from the foreign minister and also the chancellor on that point what about the the German government what's their view on the stance on Hamas I mean of course they have uh condemned what Hamas has done uh very interesting though is the for lack of a better word the the lack of nuance here uh in Berlin in part because of uh Germany's history uh it's history of World War II and the Nazis and the Holocaust means that German officials and the official government position on Israel is to stand with Israel often quite uncritically so when reporters ask for example whether there was any concern about Israel uh violating international law as it uh continues with its offensive uh on Gaza German officials couldn't actually even bring themselves to confirm that uh they would just only repeat over and over again as questions the same question was asked over and over again that they stand with Israel so that is kind of the context and the position here uh we do know that the foreign minister has expressed an interest in um asking and hoping for mediation in terms of freeing the hostages from Qatar as well so that is something that she will probably be discussing and tell us more military if you would about the the uh position on development Aid and providing development aid for the Palestinians yeah absolutely I mean they say they're suspending the development Aid and they're going to uh review every single one of the projects um and that no no money will be given over to uh Palestine in the interim period uh no idea how long this process is going to last but uh just based on my uh personal observation in terms of how German bureaucracy works this could take a very long time uh so really the focus now in terms of decision making is what German officials choose to do when it comes to humanitarian Aid how much they can give uh what they can offer in terms of assistance uh to Gaza Melissa thanks for that Melissa Chan there in Berlin thanks very much indeed
