US President Joe Biden says he's outraged by Israel's killing of international Aid workers in Gaza the seven victims joined the nearly 200 Palestinian relief workers killed by Israeli forces he's attacking eight supplies one with the tactics in Israel's jici side the war this is Inside Story [Music] hello welcome to the program I am Hashim ahbar Israel made sure no one would survive an attack targeting a clearly marked Aid Convoy in Gaza on Monday an Al jazer investigation has revealed three missiles deliberately hit the three vehicles in three separate strikes by a drone killing a Palestinian and six foreign citizens an outrage says US President Joe Biden using words much stronger than he used before about Israel's actions in Gaza much stronger than even after the killing of nearly 200 Palestinian Aid workers by Israel not to mention people queuing for food so why are such attacks happening so often is it a deliberate strategy by Israel to block Aid and therefore kill more Palestinians and why such an attack ATT now with the need for supplies at its most critical and when people are dying of starvation we'll get to our guests in a moment first this report from omum Sharif mounting Global anger after Israel kills 78 workers in Gaza on Monday an aljazera investigation has found three consecutive strikes deliberately targeted the clearly identified Convoy of international Aid workers in deral Bala they worked for the us-based organization world's Central Kitchen it's prompted the strongest condemnation yet from Israel's closest Ally the United States in a statement issued by the White House President Joe Biden blamed Israel for not doing enough to protect Aid workers and civilians why is the US not condemning the strike I I think by out by saying we're outraged I think you can fairly characterize that as condemning the strike itself of course I mean nobody wants to see the this kind of violence happened to humanitarian Aid workers Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu admitted his forces launched the attack but says it was unintentional there was a tragic incident of an unintended strike of our forces on innocent people in the Gaza Strip this happens in war we are checking this thoroughly we are in touch with the governments and we will do everything for this not to happen again the Israeli military says it's investigating the strikes that killed a US Canadian dual Citizen and a Australian a Polish national three British citizens and a Palestinian but it's further straining ties between Israel and its allies this is completely unacceptable uh the Israeli government has accepted uh responsibility uh for this the United Nations says nearly 2008 workers have been killed in the nearly 6 months since Israel launched its war on Gaza most of them are staff killed while operating in areas considered safe the Israeli military has been accused of blocking Aid attacking eight convoys and even starving civilians trying to get food supplies this is unable but it is an inevitable result of the way the war is being conducted it demonstrates yet again the urgent need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire Monday's attack on the aid workers has forced several Charities to suspend their operations in Gaza in a major setback for the Recently open seot food Aid un agencies have been warning of famine in Northern Gaza where Israel has blocked aid from entering the rest of the Palestinian territory is facing catastrophic levels of hunger the world Central Kitchen was feeding many people providing them with support without it people don't know where to turn so there will definitely be a lot of hunger the killing of international charity workers has put humanitarian supplies to the strip in doubt while President Biden has condemned Israel for killing of the aid workers his administration continues to arm and fund Israel's Relentless war on Gaza um kulsum Sharif Al jazer for Story let's go to our panel now in ramala we have Bushra khalidi policy lead in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel for the a charity Oxfam in London Chris gunnis a human rights activist and former spokesman for hona the United Nations relief and works agency which supports Palestinian refugees also in the occupied West Bank s Bashi program director of Human Rights Watch welcome to the program busha this was the moment when people were hoping that fight finally we'll see more Aid workers delivering Aid into Gaza and suddenly the attack took place in clearly marked Vehicles run by the world Central Kitchen what was your reaction when you heard the news I mean of course you know Israel's deliv targeting of all aspects of life in Gaza is already utterly unacceptable um but now with uh this incident and the rise generally in attacks against Aid workers is also utterly un acceptable over you know the past six months we've uh witnessed Oxfam and other organizations that were you know working closely on the ground with an unprecedented assault on humanitarian efforts with Israeli authorities knowingly striking locations provided by humanitarian teams uh for Aid delivery and assistance and so it's clear no one's safe in Gaza nowhere is safe in Gaza and um Israel must stop its egregious and systematic and continuous violations of IHL Chris as you know eight convoys coordinate their movements with the Kat which is a civilian body affiliated with the Israeli uh Army now you've been in touch with the world Central Kitchen do we have to take the Israelis at face value when they say this was a misidentification we absolutely do not and an investigation an impartial investigation which Mr Netanyahu has promised both RI sunak and Joe Biden will Det determine whether that is the case but let us look as at the facts as we know them the Israelis were fully cited on every millimeter of the Journey of that Convoy the sea route from Cyprus was established in full sight with Israeli approval every inch of the road that the Convoy went along from the warehouse to the kitchens all of that was notified and the transport the actual vehicles and we're talking to detail the vehicles were marked the people in the vehicles were all notified to the Israelis there was an attack on the first vehicle and I'm told that what happened is that people then left the first vehicle those were alive and were wounded but that could they went to the second vehicle there are some reports that the Israelis were notified that the first vehicle had been hit then not long afterwards the second vehicle had been hit in was hit in spite of all the notifications the bodies and those who were able were brought to the Third vehicle the Israelis again so it's reported were notified about the strike on the second vehicle and lo and behold there was a strike on the Third vehicle now Mr Netanyahu in the clip that You' just played talk about talked about an incident a strike there weren't there were three strikes Mr Netanyahu so to pretend that it was a oneoff mistake no there were three of them and that suggests that there is a policy and you know you asked the question in your headlines is there a deliberate strategy a deliberate policy of targeting these people I'm afraid it's hard to conclude that there isn't that clearly is there's a policy called The Rules of Engagement which set out at every level in the Israeli Army how they engage with the Enemy how they um you know the rules that determine who gets fired on Etc and that policy has led to tens of thousands of women and children being killed and nearly 200 Aid workers s the Israeli Army says it's going to conduct a thoro impartial investigation should we trust the findings when there is no International oversight of this investigation my concern is that this is unfortunately far from the first time the Israeli military has killed humanitarian workers in Gaza um and also struck ambulances and other clearly marked humanitarian vehicles on a number of occasions they've said that they would conduct investigations in particularly in particular of some of the ambulance strikes and we have not seen any results of those investigations I'm also worried that they're saying they will conduct investigations maybe because the people killed were foreign citizens uh particularly of Western countries when 32,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza the vast majority women and children and we don't hear about investigations into those deaths so no I I am concerned that uh the investigation is not something that would be trustworthy and what we need is for the international criminal court to move more quickly in its investigation into potential serious International crimes committed both in Gaza the West Bank and Israel Bu The world seems to forget that almost 200 Brave relief workers were killed in Gaza over the last few months where does this all leave the work of the NOS that have been bravely operating on the ground to deliver Aid to those who need it most I mean yesterday's events again are not isolated we're almost at 200 Aid workers um killed including the UN workers um we have 300 health workers from the Palestinian Health Ministry that have been killed we have uh almost 100 journalists killed and you know almost 15,000 children killed Gaz has become the most dangerous place on Earth uh for these you know groups of people um and and it leaves us in a complete at a complete Crossroads where we're having to ask ourselves are we um abiding by our duty of care and our principles as humanitarian under international law um in sending our colleagues to the field and but you know we have those conversations with our colleagues all the time um and you know as to whether we continue operations we scale up we scale down you know this this is always a conversation and an ongoing one uh because this has been happening since the beginning and this you know the risk of of being killed in the field is something that you know is is not new again and so it's it's of course um the impact of suspension of operations is I mean massive at this stage uh I mean with with starvation and and and and famine likee conditions and famine underway uh uh essentially um uh you know Israel is using starvation again as a weapon of War to collectively punish an entire population um and and and instead of letting us do our job properly in accordance with international law Chris when you look at what world Central Kitchen has achieved so far is really impressive compared to what should Global players do so they had their own Tugboat barge which reached Gaza in mid-march and they were able to prepare the landing area in the northern Gaza and they started to deliver Aid now with them suspending their operations where does it leave the north which has been suffering most in the in the strip we have to put the spotlight on where it should be and that is the Israeli authorities the occupying power because as we speak for the second day in a row there have been no convoys Israel is blocking un convoys there are dozens of trucks at Rafa full of hundreds of thousands of tons of food and other Aid waiting to get in the UN has notified the Israelis that it wants these trucks to go in and Israel simply has not approved them so you know yes there has been considerable achievement by Chef Andrea and the world Central Kitchen and I applaud that but that in no way takes the pressure of Israel as the occupying power in compliance with the provisional order from the international court of justice to open all of the borders and that there should be unimpeded unrestricted humanitarian access that the Israelis should be cooperating with the United Nations the security Council in its latest resolution has also said the same thing and as SAR has alluded to the ICC the Rome statute is very clear that food cannot be used as a weapon of War so there's a triple violation the security Council the icj and the Rome statute Israel must be held to account what is different this time is that for example three British workers have been killed and whereas before we had after the 2007 2008 Gaz of War we had the Goldstone report and the Israelis Ed their scare tactics and they crushed that and the world buckled the Goldstone report it was a bril Brant report was kicked into the long grass yal disin the then head of shinb went to raal and threatened president abass he said we turn the West Bank into Gaza if this report goes forward so some pretty strong armed tactics were used and the world buckled this time however sunak has been told by Netanyahu there will be an independent investigation well I can tell you the British media are all over this and they're going to want to see that independent investigation and guess what they're going to want to see individual Criminal responsibility and that means the people who killed these people are responsible for the killing of these people are held to criminal account they need to be punished and that is something different with the killing of these seven foreign workers that there's a palting amongst them and of course there has to be accountability for him too but can I just make one other point 171 unra workers were killed Joe Biden picks up the phone and says to Chef Andrea I'm outraged it's disgraceful there must be an imp independent investigation does he pick up up the phone to commissioner general lazarini or Secretary General Antonio gutterz who say I'm outraged that 171 under Palestinian workers have been have been killed no he hasn't and that's outrageous it's a double standard and just as SAR said you know beyond that um 32,000 Palestinians have been killed each and every one of those has a a dignity and a destiny that must be investigated must be respected there must be full accountability for all of those killings uh s obviously when you listen to these radio officials they're trying to contain the ramifications from the international outcry do you think this could be a pivotal moment in this sense it could rally International push to hold the Israelis accountable for what has been happening in Gaza over the last few months I certainly hope so um so just to be clear um countries that are supplying the Israeli military with arms like the United States like Germany like the UK risk being complicit in further grave abuses if they continue doing so so this can end pretty quickly if the United States were to abide by its obligations under international law as well as under us domestic law and suspend arms transfers to the Israeli military that would be a very clear message that unlawful strikes need to end and that withholding and impeding the delivery of humanitarian Aid need to end us domestic law also forbids the United States from supplying arms to militaries that are blocking us supplied humanitarian Aid so that makes sense if men with guns are stopping you from getting the aid that the United States is providing the US should stop providing those guns if those actions are taken this could be a turning point and I I really hope so because with those ships lading with food turning around back towards Cyprus and the truck route still mostly closed people in Gaza can't really wait much longer well this comes against the backdrop of growing International concerns about the potential for more Aid in to Gaza and Aid agencies are saying it's about time to deliver Aid or thousands and thousands of people could die Israeli defense minister y Galan said on October the 9th that nothing no eight will be allowed into Gaza let's listen to what he had to say I have ordered a Complete Siege on the Gaza Strip there will be no electricity no food no fuel everything is closed we are fighting Human animals and we accordingly Bushra what's next for humanitarian Aid into Gaza are we likely to see more pressure on the NOS organization that have been operating there to say we have to pull out because it's really risky I mean I I I I you know the context is ever evolving it and and is is fastly changing um so we are you know of course adaptive and flexible um um you know what is what is incredible by many of these organizations operating on the ground and that been here for decades um including oxam is that we work through the local community so you know our our operations are all mostly through our local partners that are not only humanitarian workers but they're also members of the community they're also trying to look for the next meal for their kids and for their family um and they're trying to survive every day um and and so of course the pressure is on them um um the pressure is uh uh and so those conversations are ongoing um but I I I surely hope that you know this conversation has brought clearly what needs to happen so that Aid can come in um no you know uh creative ways of delivering aid aid should be delivered how it's always been delivered before the 7th of October um uh in Gaza through all of the routes the land routes that are available because that would also not make our Aid response so expensive um and and also we need we need access we need to be able to bring teams in um and there's been persistent and systematic denials also of permits and visas we have an entire team in the West Bank that could be also deployed to Gaza we're not allowed to go to Gaza and we're only an hour away um so there are many solutions that could be tomorrow activated at the will of is Israel and its you know closest allies Chris the World Central Kitchen accounts for more than half of non un deliveries mostly food to the people in Gaza they delivered 43 million meals since October they provide 50,000 hot meals on a daily basis to the people all that is gone what's next for the people Gaza and you have to and you have to look at why and the reason is that the Israelis are not allowing food in I PID Ute to Oxfam and I think what Bushra has said is absolutely right their work is extraordinary and if the Israelis let them they could do more but to be clear unra is the only organization the single largest organization that can really deliver Aid at scale there were before the war 1.2 million people on unr's food distribution list that figure will have risen exponentially it's probably somewhere near a two million by now they simply don't have the data but the fact is that unra has now gone through something of resurgence you have this Israeli attack you have the defunding by certain donors they're all now coming back anra has worked through this the Israel's tried to isolate anra and anra again has now got support from un agencies and is looking to move forward to deliver Aid at scale as the icj has demanded and what is happening Israel is continuing to block the aid there are hundreds of trucks waiting at Rafa to get in so looking forward unra can deliver we've now got a situation where the donors have come back the dodgy dossier which the Israelis produce with these false allegations against unra staff members that's all Fallen away we don't know there's no evidence of that whatsoever unra has really come back now and I PID tribute to unra for picking itself up and it's now in a position where it could deliver Aid at scale you need to ask the Israelis now because the the Biden Administration is very clear sunak is very clear all of the UNR donors are clear the international court of justice is clear the ICC is clear all of those mechanisms are clear that Israel has to allow Aid to be delivered at scale anra is the main organization that can do that and if that does not happen will be will be accused and will be rightfully accused of genocide and using starvation Mass starvation as a weapon of war the world simply cannot allow Israel to get away with doing that lives of 2.3 million people today are at stake sori as well as you work with Human Rights Watch you co-founded the Israel Human Rights group gisha which has been campaigning for freedom of movement of Palestinians and also for aid for the Palestinian people for years the nature of the blockade or blocking the access to the people in Gaza now how does it compare with past experiences with past years I mean in some cases it's unprecedented um in the in the five Wars that have taken place since 2008 the Israeli military has never blocked Ed water fuel electricity in the way that it is done now and it has always allowed Aid shipments in um even during a very significant fighting and they saw that as something they needed to do in the International Community held them accountable for that in some ways there is a precedent um because there was a period of time when the Israeli military counted the number of calories that it would allow people in Gaza to consume um as part of a a policy to deliberately restrict people in Gaza to know more than that but this goes well below it in other words the Israeli military has calculations about how much food people in Gaza need and it knows very well that we're going well below that maybe back in 2008 when the Israeli military first began restricting Food Supplies into Gaza albeit not at this level maybe if the response had been stronger they wouldn't have been encouraged to take it to this next step which is actually using starvation as a weapon of War Bush oxam May find itself in a position where it has to team up with other NOS to deliver Aid how does it really feel it feels like you know you're sending your colleagues into a battlefield and everywhere is a battlefield in Gaza uh there's been you know it's not localized there's it's it's and it's it's it's systematic and has been Relentless um I wanted to add another point you know it's not just about food um it's about every aspect of life um when you're when you reach the starvation level you don't need you don't need just food you need um nutrients you need health care you need a doctor you need to be systematically seeing and consistently seeing a doctor um and that's not available in Gaza you we need to clear the rubble um we can't deliver Aid when there's no roads um and so instead of for example uh building a 250 million uh you know uh floating Port um we should be using that to get Machinery in that Gaza does not have to clear the amount of rubble that could take up to two years actually to clear out um I mean effectively what we need right now is a complete permanent ceasefire so that we can do our job uh we actually not only operate through local Partners we actually operate through Ona as well um we have we provide trainings in Ona shelters we use Ona warehouses so I completely agree with my colleague we cannot do this without the onwa humanitarian arm that has been also operating in Gaza for decades and knows the communities we are the experts and we are there on the ground um and so I don't think I don't see us leaving uh Gaza in that way because we we form part of the community yeah Chis in less than a minute if you don't mind in the absence of strong indications of a ceasefire a deal between Hamas and the Israelis with a situation evolving on the ground do you still believe there could be a breakthrough well I certainly pray there is a breakthrough but there's so much internal division within Israel about the strategy is the strategy to defeat Hamas is the strategy to bring the hostages out and this is the problem that these crimes are going on there's Mass starvation in Gaza and as ever the fate of Gaza is held hostage forgive the expression um by internal Israeli politics and until that can be clarified there will be f confusion but to be very clear the buck stops with Mr Netanyahu has invoked the amalec biblical genocide with President Herzog who has said that you can't distinguish between ordinary civilians and Hamas um and your a Galant who said you know there'll be a complete as you had in your clip a complete blockade and these people have to be held to individual criminal account whatever happens with the hostages we have to see all of the borders open we have to see those responsible held to criminal account S we're not really hearing strong voices in Israel condemning what is happening particularly from a purely legal perspective I mean there there are some voices um there's right now a petition in the Israeli Supreme Court from a number of human rights groups um calling for the Israeli military to allow Aid into Gaza and to actually Supply it which is part of its obligations as occupying power we have seen demonstrations and posts from people calling making similar calls I think that um you know there there's been a lot of inconsistency So within Israel people were appropriately horrified by the October 7th Hamas Le attacks that killed so many civilians in southern Israel and the outrage comes from the fact that armed groups were targeting civilians but that principle has to apply irrespective of whether the civilians or Israeli or Palestinian so when the Israeli military is withholding uh food from civilians and God that has to spark the same amount of outrage both in Israel as well as among Israeli allies we have to leave it there really appreciate your Insight s Bashi Chris gunnes bushar KH
