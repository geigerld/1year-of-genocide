now the White House has denied media reports that Israel the US and Hamas have reached a deal to release dozens of captives in Gaza in exchange for a pause in fighting well for more on this let's go to our correspondent in Washington DC John Holman so John almost immediately after the Washington Post broke this news about a potential hostage deal the White House came out and denied it what are you hearing there yeah we've obviously put our own requests into uh the White House and also to the US state department for comment on this and they haven't got back to us uh yet this is a general uh denial obviously from a white house um spokesperson and it comes as you say just after the Washington Post reported that there wasn't a deal but there was close to a deal that was being uh mediated they said by Qatari officials between Hamas and Israel with the US's um participation um in which there would be more than 50 uh captives uh women and children that would be freed in exchange for a 5-day uh for a 5-day ceasefire uh um um um with isra the Israeli troops that are in Gaza and obviously the air strikes so that's what the White House is denying the a a similar deal to this it's not the first time that it's been reported media reports also surfaced more than a week ago also talking about a possible 5day ceasefire um in exchange for the release of captives so this is something in terms of captive release that's been uh negotiated and something has been tried to be uh struck over several weeks now uh and uh it seems for a moment that we might be getting close what is certain is that there's an increase in the pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get some sort of deal done there's been a 5-day walk by the families of hostages from Tel Aviv to his Jerusalem residents to try and put more pressure on him there's um thought to be more than 200 captives uh in Gaza that were taken from Israel on the day on the 7th of October when Hamas uh launched their attack uh on Israel so whether this deal is close to be getting done or as the White House now says is not being done there's definitely still significant pressure especially within Israel to do something and also John in the Washington Post we've had an opad written by President Joe Biden just in the past few hours talking about the war on Gaza who was that aimed at I think that would have been aimed as much for domestic consumption here within the United States as it would perhaps people in Israel Gaza the occupied territories over in the Middle East it talked about an event ual solution it talked about after what would happen after the war in Gaza uh and President Joe Biden was talking about a two-state solution he was also talking about the Palestinian Authority governing Gaza as well as the occupied West Bank which it currently governs there's several problems uh with that uh one whether the people in Gaza would want that um there wasn't mention of uh an election in uh President Joe Biden's uh oped and one whether Israel also would allow it they've prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that in its current form he wouldn't want the Palestinian Authority he wouldn't see that as an option that they were governing uh Gaza but definitely within the United States within President Biden's Administration and other governmental agencies there's been increasing resistance to the US's support that some have seen of as unqualified uh for Israel as it launches this Invasion uh within Gaza there's been a letter that more than 500 people have said they're in agreement with anonymously uh saying that they didn't support uh this uh the US's support for Israel uh members of governmental agencies also a letter with more than a hundred people the other way saying that they did support uh PRI uh President Biden's um support for Israel so this is obviously something that's dividing the United States right now and President Joe Biden's oped was meant to clarify that uh have uh some sympathy for the plights of the Paris Palestinians um but also set forth what he sees is the future there for Gaza John hman bringing us the latest there from Washington DC thanks very much John
