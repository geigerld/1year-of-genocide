well it is now 11 GMT that's 1: p.m. in the afternoon in Gaza where conditions for 2.3 million Palestinians trapped in the territory are rapidly deteriorating for the 23rd day now Israel has continued its Relentless bombardment more than 8,000 Palestinians have now been confirmed dead since this war broke out the UN Chief says that number is totally unacceptable on the ground the UN says civil order is collapsing and some of its warehouses have been looted of food and IAL supplies Stephanie deer rounds up the latest A desperate Scramble for supplies this is survival mode people broke through the doors of this un Warehouse in southern Gaza it's chaos we need fresh water we need food we're starving this is totally unfair our children can't sleep from hunger and thirst we need need to provide food and water for them we have no flour no Aid no water not even toilets our houses were destroyed no one cares about us we appeal to the people of the world all International powers are against us we needed Aid and we wouldn't have done this if we weren't in need Israel has cut off all food and water Imports to the strip there is a trickle that occasionally enters through Egypt's rougher Crossing but it's not enough the UN has warned of a humanitarian disaster but it's been warning that for years and somehow every year things get worse it's the early hours of Sunday morning but time means nothing here anymore Naser Hospital in hunas is at breaking Point may God please protect and preserve our people this old man cries there is nowhere to run nowhere to hide penned in this a war like Gaza has never seen people use their bare hands to desperately search for survivors but even the smallest of lives stand little chance against Israel's Firepower and the daylight brings no relief death comes suddenly death comes consistently and it comes from the air here time in Gaza is now measured between explosions and between life and death Stephanie deer Al jazer well since this War Began on October the 7th Israel's bombing campaign across the territory has killed 8,5 Palestinians that's according to the Palestinian Health Ministry it says2 have also been killed in the occupied West Bank in nearly 3 weeks and two Palestinian prisoners have died in Israeli custody Israel says that was due to natural causes the Israeli government says more than 1,400 Israelis were killed in hamas's Attack 3 weeks ago well let's speak to our correspondent on the ground Al jazer hanim mwood he joins me now from Khan yunes inside the Gaza Strip honey it must be a great relief for so many that Communications are finally back up after what was it two days do we know how they were restored and how long this might [Music] last well yes it's a great relief for so many people who waited eagerly uh for uh for news about the connectivity uh turned on uh again uh we know that cables and cell towers and and infrastructure in the central part of Gaza where completely damaged as due to due to air heavy air strikes in the area and another installation in the Gaz strip was completely destroyed leaving an entire uh Gaza Strip in Total Blackout that what happened sent uh speculations and and fear among people that this is the beginning of something atrocious as Gaza was put off of the gret now uh we we we heard from a a source at the at palel it's the official Palestinian telecommunication company who Express uh their frustration at what happened because it was since the beginning of the war the air strikes the Israeli bombardment and air strikes just destroyed most of of the companies in installations leaving it with one installation covering uh the entire Gaza stb and just to you know just for the past two weeks communication was difficult it would take uh many times many tries just to uh make a phone call or send a text message let alone being online using the internet but uh one installation that was left was completely destroyed and then the company uh re resorted to uh a a basic Alternatives uh just to connect people uh back again and and and just to uh help organizations such as the the Ona and the Red Cross managing its operations on the ground we we heard uh some of the uh really uh horrible stories of lack of uh uh Communications between the organization and and and their teams on the ground and and and people who were trying to uh reach them uh to report about a a a lacking of basic needs and supplies caused huge problem and we've seen in the past uh uh few uh the the past 24 hours thousand of Palestinians just breaking into a a warehouse of the of the United Nations and and lots of looting was going on and when people were asked about what was going on they were were just uh taking what they need needed what they needed to sustain them throughout the day the situations are very very Dreadful and escapable for many Palestinians a lot of people are afraid they're going to starve if Food Supplies continue to be blocked h m there with that report for us from the ground from kanun inside the Gaza Strip thank you so much hany well we can now speak to Juliet Tuma she is the communications director for unra the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees she joins us now from Aman and Jordan Juliet just talking a little more about the Looting of these warehouses your warehouses what sort of scale are we talking about here and what's the situation now with with some of the other distribution sites I don't have that level of information and uh what is really important about what happened yesterday is the level of Despair and frustration that people feel that led them to break into the Andra warehouses it is a worrying sign of a begin of a fall of civil order in Gaza but it's equally the highest levels of Despair among the people after three weeks of very tight Siege and a very very vicious War Juliet we've just been hearing there from our correspondent hany about how anxious people have been especially during the communications blackout over the last couple of days not knowing how or where to access supplies or or when they would receive them how much did that contribute to this and and as you say this disintegration of civil order I think the the cuts that we've seen in Gaza of communications including internet and other types of of cuts have isolated the people of Gaza uh from their families within the Gaza Strip but also from the rest of the world it also isolated us as Andra because we could not have a stable line of contact and also interrupted our humanitarian operations well speaking of interruptions to to your operation I I know only a tiny tiny proportion of what's needed in terms of Aid has actually made it into the strip how quickly is it being distributed I I know you've also lost many of your staff there I'm so sorry I I know that must be very difficult on multiple levels but it also has consequences on what you can do absolutely absolutely we have uh as of this morning the total number of colleagues who have been killed in the war in Gaza since the 7th of October only since the 7th of October only in this war is 59 and that is believed to be the highest number of um un people killed in such a short span of time in any conflict around the world uh these were teachers school principls um Engineers one doctor very uh many support staff who are the backbone of our operation in in Gaza so many challenges yes also because our staff themselves have been impacted and have been displaced when we get those very very little supplies that are coming on these trucks uh we do everything possible to pick them up from the borders even if it's uh nighttime even if if air strikes are ongoing and we put them in the warehouse and then start the distribution as soon as we can but I really want to say that these trucks are not enough I I mean we had just over 80 trucks in in in in more than a week I mean it's nothing so so Gaza before the war used to get every single day 500 tracks now we had 84 in one week it's nothing uh well Juliet I know one of the strictest conditions that the Israelis put on Aid in order to even allow it to enter Gaza was that it would not be given to Hamas that Hamas would have no access is there a concern that the Looting of warehouses now might give Israel any kind reason to restrict Aid citing security reasons I don't know I don't know what I do know is that we need more supplies that people in Gaza uh civilians in Gaza need more supplies that Andra needs more supplies it needs fuel as well um for us to be able to continue our humanitarian operation supplies are running out and uh we need more supplies and we need those convoys to have more trucks on them and to have fuel on them and to be more frequent yesterday because of the communications breakdown we could not coordinate for the Convoy so there was no Convoy yesterday uh into the Gaza Strip Juliet you mentioned their fuel your agency was warning earlier this week that if you received no fuel you would have had to halt your operations in Gaza I believe that was on Wednesday night so what's the situation now we have uh rationed the use of fuel we continue to call for fuel and we continue to call for fuel to be included as part of the humanitarian convoys that are being sent into Gaza Julia tum they're the communications director for unra the UN Refugee the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees thank you so much for joining us on aler Juliet thank you for your time and we wish you all the best with your work
