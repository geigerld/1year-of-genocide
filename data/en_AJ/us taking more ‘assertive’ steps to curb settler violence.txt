well the Biden Administration is delaying the sale of 27,000 us made rifles to Israel because of concerns about increasing attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank for more on this we can go over now to Heidi Joe Castro joins us now live from Washington DC so Heidi do we know what the US officials want in terms of commitments from Israel on this issue yeah Sammy what the US Administration says is it wants more assurance from the Israeli government that these military style rifles will not ultimately end up in the hands of extremist Israeli settlers to be used in the occupied West Bank now the history of this shipment is that initially it was requested by the Israeli police in the first days of this war and it was agreed to by the Joe bid Administration in fact these 27,000 rifles had already cleared the first hurdle of preliminary uh approval from the Committees in Congress but suddenly then the B Administration said let's hold off because of this concern as the violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank has increasingly escalated and this of course follows on the heels of the US administration's decision to issue visa restrictions against uh some a few dozen people who are associated with the settler violence and after many calls from Joe Biden and other top us officials calling on Israel to do more to limit this extremist violence against Palestinians uh by the hands of the settlers all right we'll leave it there thanks so much Heidi Joe Castro
