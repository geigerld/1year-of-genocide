abu's condition alzer's correspondent is Abu Amar arrived at the makeshift hospital after suffering severe injuries he was targeted by a drone missile close to the hospital upon examination his right leg was already severed in addition to shrapnel all across his chest and head as well as his left leg we suspect his femoral artery is cut off at the bottom of his leg we administered the necessary first aid before transferring him to the European hospital where he was rushed to the operation room he was bleeding heavily lost a lot of blood to the degree that has blood pressure and pulse were not readable this means he is in a very critical condition and may lose his life as a result of the severe Hemorrhage well our correspondent honey Mahmud joins us live from the ground in Rafa in the South honey tell us a little bit more about what's going on it sounds like a really critical situation yes Nastasia and this is uh the intense uh situations that are getting tougher and tougher by the hour here in RAF City just within the past couple hours more displaced families in Northern Rafa City experience yet one more time the horror of unpredictable falling bombs as a drone fired the missile targeting two journalists who were doing field work documenting the difficult living conditions and the the experiences that the this place families have been living through since the beginning of the war correspondent and colleague AB from Al jazer was targeted directly by a missile fired by a drone along with his cameraman both of them were rushed to a naar hospital a small size Hospital largely unprepared for the kind of injuries that is and his his cameraman sustained they were transferred to Gaza European hospital where they underwent a an immediate surgeries in which had no the doctor had no other choice but make a tough decision to amputate his leg from the knee down as it was pretty much shattered all the bones shattered to the point it was only a skin that attach it uh to the remaining part of his his body tough situations on the ground people are panicking there's an increased level of concern and fear right now and PE people Express Express frustration that this is only more indications of what's going to happen next as the threats of ground invasions are still going on and being suppressed publicly by the Israeli military and its political leadership Hy Mahmud there with the latest for us from the ground in Rafa and Southern Gaza thank you honey and please stay safe yourself well the government media office in Gaza has reacted to the targeting of journalist they've said we denounce and condemn in the strongest terms the Israeli occupation Army targeting of the Alero crew for the fifth time in a complete crime in violation of international law the targeting comes within the framework of intimidation of journalists and a failed attempt obscure the truth and prevent media coverage of the occupation's crimes against children women and civilians while we can speak to Fran marovich he is the executive director of the international press Institute he joins me now from Vienna FR from the images we're getting our correspondent is clearly in a flack jacket marked press in your mind is there any doubt that journalists have being targeted in this war um what we have seen so far is I've seen most of the pictures of the journalists who were killed or injured on the ground wearing the same blue press jacket helmets I spoke to your colleague Carmen jar who was herself injured in a air strike Israeli air strike was also in a marked car we are seeing journ clearly targeted because the Press symbols used to be defense it used to be a sign of protection now it seems to be a Target well according to the International Federation of journalists I was looking at the numbers they have 92 Palestinian journalists or media workers killed four Israeli three Lebanese there's been a lot of criticism shall we say of double standards do you think that the global reaction would be different if these were Western journalists I think uh I mean from my organization we are completely outraged by this situation we've been calling out this as the worst crime against journalists in the history of our organization and my organization has been monitoring press freedom for almost 75 years and this is the worst attack we have seen on journalists in any conflict this is the worst killing of journalists in the shortest amount of time so we are definitely calling it out and I'm very proud of my executive board which is composed of 25 editors from all around the world from United States Korea Japan Philippines including the Nobel Peace Prize Winner mariaa South Africa they are also expressing their solidarity with journalists in Gaza in this appalling situation who are under this terrible attack as you say this war in Gaza has been the deadliest ever for journalists but we know that the families have also been targeted is that something we've seen in other conflicts no I don't think we've seen deliberate targeting of uh journalist families in other conflicts and here there is far too many cases to be seen as uh accidents we have also seen uh reports of journalists receiving threats on their mobile devices um and then their families being attacked um so this is if you collect and this is something an important role that press Freedom organizations are doing like my own collecting evidence collecting all the documents with regards to this killing to try and show a deliberate attempt and a deliberate attack on the press in order to silence the Press you talk about collecting evidence but given the difficulties around access at the moment how easy is it to even keep track of journalists deaths and injuries it's it's extremely difficult as you point out the situation is appalling and one thing that adds to the situation is the fact that Israel is blocking other journalists from entering the Gaza region so we can only have the reporting by the Palestinian journalists who are there on the ground no other journalists have been allowed in which is again another restriction on uh press Freedom would it be fair to say then that this has also become an information War fight to try to dominate The Narrative that's I think the case in every war unfortunately uh in every War uh there is an attempt to control the narrative but what we are seeing here is quite clear steps of attacking killing threatening journalist and then preventing other journalists from entering and Reporting fr marovich the executive director of the international press Institute thank you for joining us on aler sir thank you very much and solidarity to your colleagues
