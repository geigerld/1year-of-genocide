well let's take you now to the ha where the international court of justice is on the fifth day of hearings into Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories the first representative from the British delegation you see her there Sally langrish she's the legal advisor and director general of legal at the foreign Commonwealth and development office is beginning her presentation let's listen in in participating in these proceedings the United Kingdom underlines its respect and continued support for the court our position on the Israeli pal Palestinian dispute is long established we firmly believe that a negotiated two-state solution is the only way to end Israel's occupation to deliver Palestinian self-determination and to preserve Israel's identity and security that belief is founded on the relevant Security Council resolutions and the party's existing agreements recent events only reinforce the importance and urgency of implementing in the existing framework on the 7th of October Israel suffered the worst terrorist attack in its history hamas's terrorist attacks and the ensuing conflict in Gaza have resulted in tragic and largescale loss of life and injury to civilians Palestinians now face A desperate humanitarian crisis in Gaza the United Kingdom wants to see an immediate suspension of the fighting in Gaza and then progress towards a sustainable and permanent ceasefire it is essential to ensure irreversible momentum towards a two-state solution guaranteeing security Justice and peace for both Palestinians and Israelis the United Kingdom has only addressed matters of propriety in its written statement rather than the merits of the request it takes the same approach in these oral submissions in doing so so the United Kingdom should not be taken to accept any factual allegation or legal proposition Advanced by other participants over the course of this week we have heard certain characterizations of Israel's actions which we don't accept we have also heard characterizations of our own conduct and the motivation for it which we emphatically reject we are confident that the court will find analogies with unrelated cases to be enti unhelpful what matters is the case before it today the United Kingdom confines its submissions to relevant matters of legal principle firmly founded on the Court's own jurist Prudence we submit that the terms of the request do not allow the court to give an opinion in a manner consistent with its judicial functions the United Kingdom will focus today on three key points concerning propriety which will be developed by professor sari they are first the impact of the non-circumvention principle in this case second the unsuitability of the fact finding exercise that the court would have to conduct to answer the request as presently framed third the effect of Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 each of these points independently provides a cogent reason for declining to answer the request the court will have have will have observed that our third reason has occupied a particularly prominent place in the participants oral submissions should the court be minded to issue an opinion then the United Kingdom would respectfully urge it to reformulate the questions to concentrate on the security Council framework in this scenario the court should focus on assisting the general assembly in supporting urgent progress towards a negotiated solution I will address this point in concluding the United Kingdom submissions later
