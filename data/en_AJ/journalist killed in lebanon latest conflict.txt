to return to some breaking news an El jazer team has been hit in an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon journalist kmen Baka and Eli braia were injured and have been taken to hospital they were traveling in a car when they were hit now journalists from Reuters and AFP were also hit in Alma Al shab near the Israeli border one of the journalists was killed well Ali hasham joins us live from Alma Al shab in Lebanon and Ali what more can you tell us about what has been unfolding there over the last hour Tom um there was a convoy of journalists we were we were all together so first of all we went to Marin and we were covering from there then when we started viewing shelling um we separated the team that um included the uh correspondent in Arabic Arabic our C Mania and uh colleagues from uh French French agency AFP and from writter they all they went separately to an open area actually but it was a bit high so it was overlooking the whole scene while myself and my colleague Ry the cameraman we went to to the Village inside the village and we were live on on TV all the time then there was this direct shell that hit the and U one of the colleagues U was killed our colleagues uh Carmen and El were injured other also other colleagues from other agencies were injured and it was clear that you know they they identified themselves clearly and whoever is is is observing or monitoring the border and of course the mil the Israeli Army is monitoring the the Border day and night and before before launching this shell on a on a new team on new teams Crews that were clearly wearing their flat jackets their helmets with press written on on them it was it was horrible I mean they were they identified themselves they were clear they were clearly journalists but they were hit by Israeli shell we we we watching as you're speaking we're we're seeing footage from the scene it it isn't live it has been pre-recorded um in the last half hour or so but can you tell us what is happening there now are you still there no we are now on our way to the hospital in the city of Ty to of course be with our colleagues there but I mean the situation was tense the whole day and we've been covering this Al yes and uh as journalists we were trying to be together all the time just to you know at least to to be safe together yes and every time we are in some in somewhere Ian we check on each other so actually even even the the the colleague who was killed in this attack we had a conversation before just separating and he said he's going to assess the risks and that's why he went to that place and the others followed him and it was he wasn't in a he wasn't I mean on the borders directly he was he was far from the border he was on a on a small hill overlooking the whole place they were clear with their cars with their cameras and there were of course foreign and and local uh Crews uh they work for international agencies but some of them are Lebanese and some of them are are foreigners yeah so this is this is the situation and yeah this is what we what I can say like you say they they were um clearly marked as as being from the media weren't they was there any warning at all leading up to this well I I don't claim to to to know if there was a warning warning because I wasn't there as I told you I separated from them uh but it was clear that because there is a a a shot by by Reuters showing the moment of the the shell attack the moment the shell was launched and it was clear there was nothing before no one was there was no uh um kind of warning shell for example that hit around them close to them in a way that they will be warned they will be alarmed and then they will park and leave there was nothing like that at least this is what we saw in the video now we're going to see our colleagues we're going to talk to them hopefully they will be in a better situation and of course we will explain more details on on what happened but this crew was together all day and the Israelis were seeing this crew all day because we were on the on the road all the time back and forth so it wasn't that this team just came you know I mean we were identified clearly so as I told you we separated them and this team was hit directly and they were all identified they all had their flag jackets on them and of course our team also I mean there were there were SMGs there were equipment I mean whoever whoever knows ABCs of of you know public affairs will know that these are journalists because they were clearly journalists there was nothing that could really uh uh be vague about their identity so it was a it was an intentional uh targeting just like what happened with our colleague Sharina in Palestine a year and less than a year and a half ago yeah Ali I just want to clarify one thing really quickly do you think that this was an a strike or you said it was a shelling a tank shelling most probably this was a tank shelling because it was a shell that H when we arrived there at the place there was a car Bing we saw we saw the ambulances the body of our colleague who was killed was probably still there the ambulance just just uh uh transferred him now to the to the hospital May so rest in peace and he I mean he was I don't want to give the name right now no no we understand that of all yeah maybe his family needs to know first of all I don't know if his family was was informed well he was a professional him four years because we've covered together several Wars before this is not the first war okay thank you so much for that Ali that's Ali hasham for us and Alma Al shab if you're just joining us there's breaking news uh this hour an Israeli Strikers killed one journalist and injured three others in southern Lebanon well alzer's Lebanon bureau chief maren Ibraham was there just after it happened this is what happened all the journalists were here together it's a type of safety measure this is to make sure that both the resistants and Israel know that we are journalists and in one location I can clearly say that we the journalists were targeted on purpose we were far from the confrontations the confrontations are up this hill Over the Horizon where the fires are this spot is where the journalist was all of the journalists were wearing the safety kit they all had the Press slogan on their chest and cars this car behind me the one that is totally damaged is the AL jazer car the AL jazer crew was inside this car my colleagues were transferred to hospitals reporter kmen Juka and cameraman Ellie brachia one other cameraman was killed journalists were killed and injured while doing their work
