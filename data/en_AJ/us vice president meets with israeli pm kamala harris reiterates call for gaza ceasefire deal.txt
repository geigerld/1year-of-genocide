[Music] all right good afternoon everybody walking out to give unscheduled remarks vice president kamla Harris made clear she had one message for the Israeli Prime Minister on the proposed ceasefire as I just told prime minister Netanyahu it is time to get this deal done so to everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire and to everyone who yearns for peace I see you and I hear you uned will never be the a new and clear message to the pro Palestinian protesters who have mostly been dismissed by the Biden Administration and while she pledged Ironclad support for Israel she spoke at length about the horrors the Palestinian people have been suffering for so long what has happened in Gaza over the past 9 months is devastating the images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety sometimes dis placed for the second third or fourth time we cannot look away in the face of these tragedies we cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent this is not how American officials usually speak about Palestinians they very rarely talk this way about the human toll the Dead the starving and in both meetings when the Press was allowed in sending a clear message to the Israeli prime minister by what they didn't say very few words of welcome and no praise for their visitor which almost never happens we got a lot to talk about our conversation the Biden Administration says they are close to finalizing the ceasefire proposal and some analysts see renewed reason to hope the knesset goes into recess July 28th and during a recess which will last until late October shortly before our elections here it's impossible to bring down a an Israeli government so if Mr netanel wants to do a deal he will have the political space and the absence of pressure from his right wing to do a deal if prime minister Netanyahu came to Washington to prove he still has us support he leaves knowing the images painted a much different picture around half of the Democrats in the house and the Senate boycotted his speech to Congress and the Biden administ ation is clearly losing patience with him and his continued war on Gaza Patty Cain Al jaaz Washington well prot make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
