well earlier I spoke to Dr Ahmed mahalati a surgeon at alifa hospital that's in the northern part of the strip and he says that hospitals are becoming more and more unsafe it's totally a horrible situation the one we are facing now to start with we don't know where's the end point of this one it's getting Tighter and Tighter the situation and the squeezing around the chipa hospital is getting uh tighter so targeting the biggest Hospital in Gaza which assumed to be the one to treat the injured patients now we can hardly treat the patients within our hospital and then we every now and then think that it's totally unsafe so we are in the middle of War Zone it's continuing with bombing air strikes from the sea the drones are within the hospital uh area and anyone moving between the buildings they feel totally unsafe the electricity stopped because of some issues with the electricity the engineer who went to try to fix that electricity was uh shot by the Drone and injured in his neck and he got paralysis of his four lmbs so the situation that you are totally unsafe even to move between the hospital buildings whoever in in one building can't move to the other building even if a doctor wants to see patient in the other they can't move there so what happened is the already we were in a bad situation collapsing situation of the health system running out of fuel electricity of water now the situation is tighter they attack the water tanks on top of the buildings now we don't have water in the whole buildings in the uh in the toilets for the patient hygiene
