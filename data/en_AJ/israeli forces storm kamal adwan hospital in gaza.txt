hello we begin in Gaza where the Israeli Army is continuing its bombardment soldiers have just stormed the Kamal adwan Hospital in the North after laying Siege to it for several days these pictures are from last week but they show the courtyard where Israeli forces are rounding up all the men in the hospital including health workers in southern Gaza at least 20 Palestinians have been killed in a dawn attack on several homes in rafah the Israeli milit is pressing on with its offensive and bombing civilian areas more than 18,200 Palestinians have now been killed since the War Began meanwhile in the occupied West Bank four Palestinians were killed in a drone strike during an Israeli raid on the city of Janine the Palestine red crescent says Israeli forces prevented ambulances from reaching the injured all of this comes as the United Nations is warning of what it calls a breakdown of civil order in Gaza due to the limited delivery of desperately needed humanitarian Aid Israel announcing it will set up new checkpoints to increase the number of eight trucks entering Gaza but critics say it will result in significant delays the UN says at least 200 trucks are needed every day just to meet basic needs Han Mahmud is live in southern Gaza in RAF Forest soy first of all uh this raid on the Kamal adwan Hospital what more are you hearing on that yes H there are more disturbing reports confirmed reports of Israeli military storming Kamal adwan hospital it's important to point out adwan hospital is a midsize Hospital the only remaining health facility in the northern part within the past few days it came under heavy bombardment and air strikes and Tang sh destroying the vast majority of its facilities and all the major roads leading to it now there are people who took it as a refuge a shter running away from the uh the air strike Relentless bombardment their neighborhoods now we're talking about hundreds of people inside the hospital including the medical team and those who were brought as injuries and the patients in the in the hospital and hundred other of evacuees inside the hospital the disturbing report what we got from the Kamal adwan hospital that the is really military on loudest speakers at order during the administration of the hospital to hand in all the guns that the security Personnel at the hospital carry in order to protect the the hospital uh they were collected by the Israeli military now there anyone above the age of 15 was also ordered to start evacuating the hospital with their hands above their their head the Israeli military started to blindfold those uh men inside the hospital Round them up inside the court of the hospital so far the situations are very very difficult for people inside just to give a broader picture of what happened over the past few weeks the hospital came under heavy air strikes and Tang Shi where a 100 almost 100 people killed inside the courty yard of the hospital and the hospital resorted into digging grave massive graveyard just to bury them because they could not take them outside the hospital this is not the first time Hospital are becoming under heavy attacks but it it looks like it's a war not only on evacuation shelters but also including hospital we seen a sha Hospital the Indonesian hospital as well within the past uh a few weeks it's also important to point out only nine out of the 40 hospitals across the Gaza Strip are remaining and operating at the low capacity possible in the central part and the southern part of the Gaza Strip and hany uh we heard as well about air strikes at dawn today in RAF at least 20 killed according to to Palestinian uh medical sources what are you hearing well this is another thing has that keeps overwhelming Hills facilities across the g d more air strikes means more death more destruction more displaced people they end up going to hospital seeking as a refuge with the adone earlier hours of this morning a group of residential home in the northern part of Rafa City a supposedly safe area as designated by the Israeli military came under heavy a massive multiple air strikes where a group of residential was completely destroyed we're talking about 23 people confirmed dead uh so far and multiple other injuries the number is expected to rise as still people searching under the rubbles and with with no equipments and and and little Machinery available people are using their bare hands to remove large pieces of concrete and cement just to get people from under dble we expecting the number to go up and this might take not only hours or days uh just an example of how he graved the situation and attack that took place in mid November people were able to remove a deceased body from under dbls within the past two days this is how long it takes giving the difficulty of the situations uh on the ground just within the past 40 minutes there were more air strikes two people were killed and those are strike brought to the Kuwaiti hospital here pronounced dead right here and multiple other injuries the air strike continue the bombardment continues and the war continue to pound the Gaza Strip from north to south hany
