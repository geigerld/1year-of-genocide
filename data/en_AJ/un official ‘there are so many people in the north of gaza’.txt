joined now live from Gaza by Gemma conell she's with the United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian Affairs good to have you with us so at this point very few hospitals operating all of them in the South How concerned are you that as Israel's offensive now starts to focus more on Central and Southern areas that whatever they are able to do those hospitals May face the same fate as hospitals in the North we're absolutely terrified that that is what will happen and even if the hospitals were protected which they aren't we continue to see attacks which hit hospitals in the vicinity around them but even if they were protected they are so overloaded and overwhelmed that what we're seeing now is both the casualties that come immediately after air strikes or tank shelling and gunfire but also the people who are dying simply because the hospitals are un able to treat them I was just a couple of days ago up in dero balah in alaka hospital after the magazi attacks and the health workers there who are such heroes in this response told me that there is no way that they can keep up with the volume of people coming in so when you walk into the emergency rooms of these Hospitals now there are people there with gunshot wounds with open bones with all kinds of horrific injuries that in any other place on any other day would be immediately add but here they can't because there is someone who's in more severe need and more urgent need for surgery and what does that mean for people like that are are people dying of what would have been very easily treatable issues yes the short answer is yes and we see it both in the north and in the South because again these heroic health workers who wake up every day striving to deliver the best possible services in the most impossible condition Ians are unable to treat everyone and I've been to the north I was in Al hospital just a few days ago where the health workers there can't even do the basics anymore so you have wounds Infested by flies you have people who will die of injuries that should not be killing people and again these health workers are appealing to the world and I've promised to share that appeal back with the world for this to stop because this is not about lack of medicines it's not about lack of supplies it's about the fact that this war and the sheer volume of people that it is killing and injuring is too much for anyone to take You' mentioned that you've been to the north just tell us about the conditions that the 800,000 people is what has been reported was still stuck up there what conditions do they face when they have medical needs when they have humanitarian needs they face a gauntlet every day to try and meet their most basic needs there is very very little food in the north once you cross W Gaza there is hardly anything there for people who are just literally trying to survive accessing Health Care is phenomenally difficult last time I was there I met with a woman who had tragically lost her baby because she had had to give birth in the street because she was unable to access the hospital due to the ground forces that were around her home so accessing food accessing Health Care accessing water it's extremely difficult today to get water in Gaza City so there are tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people and when you're there you see them in the streets and this is something I also want to stress there are people in the north of Gaza there are so many people who are there and they are surviving on the mere fraction of what it would actually take to keep them alive so we have to get assistance into North Gaza at scale have these strikes are these strikes respecting the sanctity of of medical and humanitarian installations I was listening to your headline just before just yesterday I was at the alal hospital in carun after it was hit yesterday I went with the Palestinian red present Society in a show of solidarity to the incredible staff there and the people that I met there asked me a very simple question which is why when we're sitting underneath the red present emblem are we not safe and the people who are in United Nations schools nearly 300 of whom have been killed while Sheltering in United Nations schools ask us the same question why when we're under the United Nations Flag are we not safe so I have to say I am not a lawyer and I will not judge but what I will say is that what we see every day is attacks that impact in devastating scale civilian infrastructure and clearly marked United Nations and health infrastructure well using this opportunity as you speak to us live on Al jazer what would be your call to the world my call to the world is so simple and I've been saying it every day since I arrived which is that in the name of humanity this war must end for everybody for the hostages who've been here for more than 80 Days who need desperately to be reun United with their families but for the 2.2 million people 2.2 million people in the Gaza Strip who now have nothing left to go on they have nowhere that is safe and just today when I was traveling I saw thousands of people continuing to stream into rapper where there is literally not a single spot of land for people to set up any more a makeshift shelter and even if they did there were air strikes here last night so it's not safe here so my message to the world is simple this war must end these people the people of Gaza the hostages in Gaza all of the people impacted by this war have their own lives have their own stories and have lives to live and for them to be able to live those lives the war must end tomorrow and it should have ended yesterday and just a a brief personal Insight how do you balance between your responsibility towards people and being in Gaza means no doubt you're also in danger right I sit in an incredibly privileged position as a United Nations official in Gaza and so every day my first thought when I wake up is for the people of Gaza and the fact that they have nowhere safe to go and what I am experiencing is absolutely nothing in comparison to the fear the anxiety the sheer trauma that so many people are living through right now I just want to share one last story yesterday when I was in Amal which you saw has also also been hit very close to there again today I met a mother of a 12-year-old boy Amir who'd been killed by a gunshot wound that came through a window into a place that they thought was a safe place of refuge and they asked me again to tell the world he had just had a cousin born 5 days old his little cousin who had been so looking forward to having a big cousin and those are the types of stories I see every day so for me my own situation is very much second to every person in Gaza who deserves to wake up every day to safety all right thank you so much for your time and sharing your experiences Gemma conell there
