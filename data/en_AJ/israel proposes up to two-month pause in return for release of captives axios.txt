now Israel is said to be proposing a two-month pause in fighting for the release of all captives being held in Gaza that's according to a report by axios which says the deal has been presented to Hamas through mediators The Proposal would be made up of several phases mediators from katar and Egypt have been working for weeks to reach the deal between Israel and Hamas well let's speak to Stephanie DEA she joins me now from occupied East Jerusalem Steph there's obviously nothing official about this deal but what do we know about this proposal that's ostensibly on the table yes it's now being picked up by all Israeli media and what we have is the bones of what seems to be a new proposal by Israel um to Hamas uh the US um Envoy Brett murk according to these reports is already in Cairo to discuss this deal and he'll be heading on to Qatar of course Egypt and Qatar crucial in the negotiation between the two sides what do we know about the deal well Israel is proposing a twomon pause in the fighting this is a very long time and then it's saying that the captives should be released in phases so first of all Hamas would be releasing those over 60 all women and those over 60 the second phase would be Israeli female soldiers and the men that Hamas deems as non-s soldiers and then the third phase would be uh the male soldiers and the bodies because of course there are also uh bodies that remain inside Gaza held by not just Hamas but other groups uh as well um and then also it specifies the redeployment of Israeli soldiers away from some urban areas uh to allow uh Palestinians to be able to return home of course the question mark is what do they have to return to but certainly this seems to be a new kind of deal the bones at least of what they may be discussing now Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is coming under a lot of pressure to do more to bring the captives back alive he has maintained defiantly even until yesterday that the fighting will not stop that the captives will be brought back militarily but you've had increasing pressure on the streets you've had families of the hostages storm the Israeli knesset the Israeli Parliament they're camping outside his home here in Jerusalem um so it seems to be that there is some form of Bones if you will Skeleton on the table now for negotiations these are early days but I think it's significant we'll have to wait and see what kind of compromises will be made on both sides but certainly for talking about a two-month pause in the fighting this is a significant time but again early days just the bones but it is a new deal um that that is being talked about we understand Stephanie de with that update for us from occupied East Jerusalem thanks Steph
