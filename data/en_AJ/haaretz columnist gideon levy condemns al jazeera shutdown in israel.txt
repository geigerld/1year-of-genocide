Gideon Levy is a columnist at the Israeli newspaper haret you're joining us from uh Tel Aviv Gideon your reaction to the shutdown uh by the Israeli government of aljazera in Israel what a shame what a shame to be an Israeli and an Israeli journalist on such a day what a shame to be an Israeli when my country is closing down such important networks like El jazer English and El jaaz Arabic only because some politicians do not like what's being informed there I can tell you as a viewer as a news consumer not as a commentator and not as a writer that for me the last seven months El jazer English was one of the most if not the most source of information about what's going on in Gaza because Israeli TV doesn't show anything from Gaza and El jazer English was such a reliable and and enriching source of information for me as a citizen not as a as a writer to close this down means to close down the option of Free Press in Israel not less than this Gideon what's behind this if Benjamin Netanyahu had wanted to shut down Al jazer he probably could have done so far earlier in this war right we're moving into the almost the eth month of the war why is this happening now and what's behind the decision so there are two things why now and why at all at all as usual in Israel everything is focused at the domestic politics and the base likes it if you fail in the battlefield at least you can you can win in another Arena namely to close down an Arab intern Network they love it the the right wiers in Israel here we show the Arabs in their in their language how strong we are and how courageous and devoted we are and and by the way to point out the obvious correct me if I'm wrong but that you say the bass loves it the Bas netanyahu's Bas does not watch aljaz I think is pretty safe to say so they're they love the shutting down of a network that they don't watch absolutely absolutely they don't watch and they don't want to watch but they want to see it beaten so if you can't beat Kamas at least you beat a jazer so that's one sentiment about the timing I have my suspicion but this is not based that the timing has to do with the deal because finally Al jazer is a katari network and Scatter is one of those who is pulling and pushing for a settlement for a deal and Nan is doing in the last two or three days anything possible to sabotage a deal and this might be connected so I'm trying I want to make sure I understand uh this this hypothesis here that you're explaining you're saying maybe Netanyahu is trying to pressure uh Qatar by shutting down Al jazer in the context of qatar's mediation on the seesar deal absolutely and by the way the Qatari mediation was a reason why he postponed this decision for so long because the Americans or the Qatari directly or through the Americans put pressure on Nan not to close it down but now when he feels that there is a chance for a deal he goes for an option let's destroy everything including eler okay you mentioned that this is good for netanyahu's base so I understand the political benefit to him I would surmise that there is also a long-term political cost not just for Netanyahu but for Israel in general when you shut down an international news network you know even the White House was talking about freedom of the press and their concerns over this when the law was passed a month ago when you shut this down it becomes that much harder to say that you're a very healthy and robust democracy and when you kill 13,000 children there is no thinking for the long term now ever since the 7th of October Israel is not thinking in any long terms in any long terms do they have any plan for the day after do they know what they want from Gaza do they know what is a total Victory I mean we are in the last seven months led by a government without any plan without any consideration about the consequences of its policies it's only from today today to please the base and to survive in power one final question because you were saying earlier going back to what you said at the beginning of of your first answer I think it was you said you know in the Israeli media you don't see the War uh you don't get the information that you get when you watch aljazera what so what does the war look like as seen and as presented by Israeli media to Israelis very very simple picture we are the victims we are the only victims as usual there was the 7th of October and we will stick to the seventh of October which was almost the Holocaust in the eyes of most of is of the Israelis and this seventh of October enable us and legitimize us to do whatever we want in Gaza Gaza doesn't interest us Gaza is Hamas and Hamas is Gaza and therefore we should punish them all and if possible even kill them all destroy them all and and we will we have no interest to see what's the suffer of Gaza what's the punishment of Gaza what's the innocent people of Gaza are going through we are only interested in the brave Soldiers the hostages and the victims of the 7th of October that's our world and that's the world that the Israeli media as a whole is describing to its viewers for seven months now seven days a week 24 hours a day only this you don't see Gaza I just want to add one one sentence with your permission my news pep haret is Will publish tomorrow its leader about against the decision to close down and jazer it's a very sharp and and very clear message that we are against it okay uh I'll be reading you I'll I'll be reading that and I do read you as a columnist in haret Gideon pleasure talking to
