the same hospital that run out of fuel to run its generators last week and its surrounding areas have been repeatedly targeted by Israeli attacks in recent days well earlier Al jazer spoke to the director of gaza's Civil Defense Agency who was at that hospital he describe the desperate conditions that doctors treating the injured from jabalia are facing the beds are not enough the dead and wounded are on the floor since today and yesterday there are people who we cannot guarantee to treat if we don't have fuel our operations will completely stop the operations the Intensive Care units the Kidney Care patients will all lose their lives in this case the world has signing the death warrant of these people Yad Alm is a spokesperson of the interior minister of Gaza a short while ago he described the extent of the damage caused by the attack on the jabalia refugee camp one ton of explosives to destroy block six in jabia refugee camp completely this District consists of houses and buildings next to each other and they are old and they include and they host hundreds of citizens the occupation War PL have destroyed this District completely with six USM made bombs thrown to these places thrown on these people and every single one in these districts have lost the lives and have been wounded Al jaz's anas Al Sharif is at the site of of the attack in jabalia refugee camp he describes to us what he sees there was a little girl in this place they are trying their best to reach this little girl it is a massacre committed by the occupation against the innocent people the kids the children oh my God look at the destruction most of the victim are kids children and women we hundreds hundreds of victims hundreds of victims we've seen hundreds of victims here and the destruction is huge the destruction is huge and the corpse cannot be described under any circumstances we are doing our best to reach the martys who lost their lives here in this spot I cannot describe what's going on it is a massive Massacre you cannot count how many buildings have been destroyed and leveled in this place the civil defense units are trying to reach some people here they are trying to reach some of the mic under the rubble well let's bring in another of our correspondents in Gaza that's Tark Abu AUM who's in can Unis in southern Gaza uh Tark uh just bring us up to speed with what happened at the jabalia refugee camp it wasn't just one building that was hit but several of them talk to us about who the victims [Music] are well there was a neighborhood in that building in that area that has been completely destroyed by the Israeli occupation Air Forces du Balia refugee camp considered to be one of the most densely populated refugee camps in the Gaza Strip where there more than 100 thousands of Palestinian are residing in adjacent houses even the streets considered to be absolutely narrow that nobody can really freely uh can move within its streets uh this area has been completely uh neighborhood has been completely destroyed uh claiming the Israel attack claimed the the lives of more than 100 Palestinians complete residential buildings were flattened as still till this current moment victims are still under the rebels waiting for further Rescue by the Palestinian civil defense teams the occupation uh forces dropped uh six uh heavy bombs uh in this on this neighborhood uh each bomb contains or consist of uh around 1,000 uh kilogram of explosive materials which can BR Devastation a mass Devastation to the region uh this massacre added the added to the history of the Israeli massacres and crimes in the Gaza Strip as they did in Al Arab hospital where more than 500 Palestinians have been killed uh the situation there is dramatic hospitals capabilities are not yet able to uh to uh to observe and even to uh contain the current situation uh on the ground as more victims are reaching to the hospitals and more wounded people also are laying on the ground of the Indonesian Hospital receiving a prime treating by Medical Teams the the the scene the sight of the accident the pictures that we're watching right now are just unbelievable to to to to watch and and to understand what's happened there you see this huge crater and people still trying to pull victims from under the rubble what do you know about you know the search and rescue that's going on there right now it's extremely difficult of course given the circumstances given that Gaza is being bombed by Israel to help the victims to pull them from under the rebel yes definitely uh the the suring number of the Israeli strikes on the territory claiming the lives of thousands of Palestinians uh till till now and making the operation of rescue for civil defense team are really uh critical as they really lack and have such a deep shortage of necessary equipments in order to help them to evacuate victims also another another reason that they are facing such great difficulty in terms of uh rescu to the uh victims ofand of the rebels is that the accelerating rates of bombardment every single caller every single District in the territory witnessed massive bombardment in different areas uh during uh the the same hour so medical uh I'm sorry uh the the civil defense team are rushing in order to evacuate victims and they are trying at least to evacuate the people who still alive under the reppel by asking them are you still alive if there any sound just tell us in order just only to to help them to be rescued from the bombardment till now there are more than 2,000 reports about messing still under the rles as the medical as the civil defense team cannot till now evacuate them right we're hearing of at least 300 people injured uh these pictures that you're watching right now are exclusive to Al jazer we obtained exclusive footage showing the massive destruction after the attack on the jabalia refugee camp in Northern Gaza the victims T you're saying are being taken to the nearby Indonesian hospital and it's a pretty chaotic scene there as well because this is one of the hospital hospitals that run out of fuel and has very little supplies to treat these injured people uh yes the Indonesian Hospital considered to be the main Central Hospital that provides uh treatment for hundreds of thousands of Palestinian residing in the northern area of the Gaza Strip uh as already it has been flooded with patients and injured people due to the Israeli previous attacks since the early beginning of this route of fighting between Palestinian Fighters and the Israel occup forces now with this attack the number has been doubled and the capacity of the hospital has reached its limitation they are not no longer can a can be able to carry out uh hard and even difficult uh surgery for different wounded people sometimes uh different surgeries could be delayed until uh the second day in order to have a chance to carry out the operation for this patient now they are conducting operations without having Bank Killers even sometimes due to the to the run out of fuel they are trying to carry out the operation by using their smartphones line the the situation that is really catastrophic now they are depending on the alternative generators that are about also to run out of fuel of this of the Israeli ongoing clo and prevention of a fuel injury continues so doctors conducting operations without anesthesia injured people being treated on the ground there at the Indonesian Hospital on the floor at the Indonesian hospital because there's simply uh not you know not enough uh medical supplies and beds and so want to treat them as this is happening tar uh Israeli ground troops have been pushing through the northern Gaza Strip heading towards Gaza City and that fighting has been described as very Fierce talk to us about the latest on that that ground incursion what do we know is happening right now uh yes the Israeli occupation forces keeps pushing uh deeper to the into the territory in order to to gain more control on land and even to destroy the military infrastructure of the Palestinian Fighters as the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced earlier since the beginning of this round of fighting uh the the Israeli troops are trying to get into their territory from different uh axis and from different even areas starting from the north of the Gaza Strip two uh critical areas that they are trying to have a kind of further uh incuding into which considered to be the Eastern area of B hanol City and even the northwest of ble which considered to be the coastal line so they are trying to carry out stimulous ground invasion in both aspects of the territory also the the Israeli ongoing uh troops uh in cruden continues also uh in the uh zun neighborhood they are trying even to uh to um to divide Gaza Strip into separate areas in order to isolate the north from of the Gaza Strip from the other areas in order to gain control over this space of land also the uh the Israeli ground maneuvering continues in the uh North in the Eastern areas of kanun they are trying to make more uh more uh and to expand their military operations on the ground as as they have been encountered by the Palestinian fight fighters who open fires and prepared military Ambitions for for the Israeli maneuvering troops on the ground okay tar thank you very much for that update our correspondent tar Abu AUM with the latest there from Gaza let's now speak to nebal farak who's spokesperson for the Palestinian red cres and Society she's joining us live from ramala IND occupied West Bank uh thank you so much for being with us uh I want to ask you first about this latest attack by Israel on Gaza on the largest refugee camp in the Gaza Strip This is the second single worst attack by the Israelis we saw the bombing on alali Hospital of course earlier this month which left more than 400 dead and here you have 100 people dead 300 injured what is your reaction the Palestine Red Cross and teams as a lead emergency medical service provider in Gaza Strip are now working on the ground try to um transfer the wounded people and the facilities to the hospital the situation is absolutely horrific we have been witnessing this uh increasing number of casualties among Palestinian civilians in Gaza due to attacks against um residential buildings homes streets as well as even places of worship and hospitals so as you can see hospit are already overwhelmed and they barely can deal with this increasing number of casualties that they are dealing with every single hour now uh hospitals are even treating patients and injured people and wounded people in the corridors because it is absolutely overwhelmed and hospitals are working in full capacity this comes uh as well as at the same time all hospitals are literally collapsing due to shortage and medical supplies as well as medicines and they are running out of the fuel which is urgently needed to have electricity and continue operating yeah the victims of this attack are being taken to the Indonesian hospital where we've seen a chaotic scene as you can see on those pictures bodies everywhere outside the hospital inside the hospital people are being treated on the floor because there's no space there's no supplies as you say how are your teams able to work in these conditions on the ground so over 25 days the Palestine red crescent teams are working around the clock to deal with this increasing number of casualties absolutely they are super exhausted overwhelmed um they even stressed out due to this continuous work they are on top of their Duty since the beginning of the escalation unable even to go back to their homes and check on their families um having being able to witness all of these horrific scenes each day like the scenes of children and women who are killed due to Israeli bombardment it just also add another level of stress as well as traumatized because of this ongoing um escalation that is uh happening since the beginning of the escalation at the same moment they are literally putting their lives in danger in order to go and transfer the wounded people to the hospitals as you know we have already lost four colleagues since the beginning of the escalation and on top of that they are still able to go outside trying their best in order to evacuate the people and transfer them uh to the hospitals we call on the International Community to ensure the protection of civilians as well as healthare personnel and healthare Facilities according to the international humanitarian law as you say these teams red crescent and other teams are trying their best under very difficult circumstances the victims of this latest attack on the jabala refugee camp many of them women and children they're the ones bearing the brunt of of this war Women and Children of Gaza absolutely More than 70% of all victims of thousands of victims who have been killed since the beginning of the escalation are elderly people women and children we uh always emphasize the importance of the protection of uh civilians who are victims this is extremely important in any um according to the international humanitarian law so we need the International Community to intervene immediately to ensure the protection of civilians as well as healthare Personnel what we have seen since the beginning of the escalation is just an alarming number of increasing and targeting civilians wherever they are whether in their houses homes residential buildings um even a total neighborhoods have been raised to the ground nebal uh the International Community of course has been you know there's been calls for a ceasefire and so on called for a humanitarian Corridor but this seems to be you know going nowhere right now um and and it's the women as you say the children that continue to suffer the civilians of Gaza you wonder where we go from here it seems that every day the situ situation is only getting worse for the people of Gaza as we're seeing on these pictures today with this latest bombing on the jabala refugee camp absolutely the situation is getting worse and worse we're talking about over 2 million civilians now are lacking food water without food without water without Med medicine without electricity with no fuel with almost nothing and they soon will be even without getting treatment or medical services this is an urgent situation we are already witnessing a catastrophe in Gaza and this has to be stopped as soon as possible it has to be stopped immediately a ceasefire is um is really um an urgent matter now and we hope that the international leaders International Community could intervene to call for a cease fire um to happen urgently as well as we call an a Non-Stop safe entry of humanitarian a into Gaza including a few the situation is simply catastrophic over 2 million now are lacking every single basic humanitarian needs half population of Gaza Strip are now internally displaced we're talking about hospitals have been transfered transport all hospitals now they are not only a place for wounded people and injured they are uh Sheltering thousands of people in a very bad conditions you're talking about lacking everything f food water even hygiene and they are absolutely encouraging to have uh diseases between those displaced uh persons who are ging in the corridors of the hospitals on top of all of that we still witnessing extreme shortage of medicine and medical supply and most importantly fuel many hospitals are going to shut down soon because of running out of a fuel which is importantly needed to H get uh the electricity without electricity we can't continue operating and providing our life saving services and this also threatens the lives of thousands who are connected to life support machines as well as babies and incubators yeah nbal as you say many hospitals are facing a shutdown right now but these hospitals like the Indonesian hospital near the jabala refugee camp right now are the only hope for people for the victims of this latest Israeli bombing on Gaza thank you so much nbal for speaking to us nibal farak is a spokesman for the Palestinian red Cresent Society uh you're joining us on Al jazer as we're covering this latest breaking news story out of the Gaza Strip where more than a 100 people have been killed and 300 injured after an Israeli attack on the jabala refugee camp in Northern Gaza this is the largest refugee camp in Gaza densely populated the interior Ministry of the Gaza Strip says six bombs were dropped by the Israeli military on jabalia refugee camp and these pictures that you're watching right now are exclusive pictures that Al jaaz obtained showing the massive destruction as you can see after the attack a crater there uh with people still buried under the rubble and the search is continuing for the victims of this attack buried under the rubble but it's proving extremely difficult as our correspondent was saying because it's difficult for rescue teams to move around Gaza because the bombings Israeli raids are continuing and these pictures now are of inside the uh Indonesian Hospital which is near jabala refugee camp very nearby this is where most of the victims of this latest Israeli bombing on Gaza have been taken to and it's been absolute chaos in that hospital doctors are overwhelmed patients are being treated on the floor doctors conducting operations without anesthesia because they've simply run out of supplies there's no more space no more supplies and these hospitals are the last hope for the victims of this latest bombing among them many women and children because this refugee camp again a civilian area targeted by Israel inside the Gaza Strip
