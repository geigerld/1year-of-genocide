an investigation has revealed the Israeli Army has been using an untested AI base tool for its bombing campaign in Gaza the online magazine plus 972 found the software known as lavender had listed as many as 37,000 Palestinian men as targets the Israeli Army also judged it impermissible to kill more than a 100 civilians in attacks if the target was a top ranking Hamas official well let's speak to Anthony Lowenstein about this is an independent journalist who wrote a book on Israel's arms and surveillance industry called the Palestine laboratory he's joining us from Sydney Anthony thank you so much for being with us so you wrote this book about uh Israeli Army tactics and arms can I ask you first how widespread is the use of artificial intelligence in Israel's current war in Gaza and what effects it's having on the Army's conduct on the ground it's ubiquitous is the short answer it was used by Israel before October 7 in previous Wars in Gaza but it's massively accelerated since and there's been two reports by the author you just mentioned jual Abraham who's an Israeli journalist who talks about the extensive use of AI by Israel in Gaza since October 7 and also matches some of the reporting and sources I've been speaking to the short version is that that story goes into great depth about how essentially there was an attempt to kill huge numbers of low-level Hamas operatives and the question of course was made how is that decision being decided is it being made by humans is it being made by machine that report states that at many times huge numbers of thousands upon thousands of lowlevel operatives and it's worth saying how that operative is defined is not clear and there are a lot of Israeli officials in that story that say that at times only 20 seconds at best was given to every so-called Target that was offered to the military in other words massive numbers of people would deem to be Expendable could be killed and one of the key points of that story that I think is so damaging to Israel apart from the massive civilian death toll which we've seen in the last six months is that there's no proportionality in fact this is the opposite of that International lawyers have said in the last 24 hours since this report came out that in fact this is the key problem for Israel here that there was an attempt as the story itself says for Revenge Revenge is not international law revenge is illegality interesting I was going to ask you what you know international law says about the use of such tools uh in in war and this specific tool but also the the human supervision aspect of it is is this tool supervised on the ground well the short answer is no and that became very clear in that report that huge amounts of targets are generated and that information's coming from Israeli sources human sources my suspicions is American intelligence sources potentially also Australian because Pine gap which is a major US military base in the cent of Australia was also used by the us to give information to Israel all this information feeds into a system and it spews out massive amounts of targets and the problem is that the Rules of Engagement are so loose as this peace states that families of these alleged militants are killed civilians women women men ET even you know non-militant children and that's a problem because the death toll particularly in the first months was so staggering I me I think 15 20,000 in the first few months and there's no evidence in fact by the way any of these people have any connection to terrorism zero and we've seen the impact on Gaza right it's been leveled which of course has been the point as this report states that was the most uh shocking aspect of the report for me the amount of collateral damage Israeli military was willing to accept when killing just one command Commander or or two commanders now coming back to some other reports in the Israeli media uh following the killing of these Aid workers which have suggested that there's a lack of discipline within uh the Israeli military that's operating in Gaza right now is it a lack of discipline per se where where you know commanders on the ground are not obeying orders or is it more a case of the commanders on the ground setting the rules for the themselves it's a combination of both I mean this sort of lack of real um moral ethical legal barriers existed long before October 7 there huge amounts of examples in the last years of Israel essentially committing Mass Slaughter in Gaza and frankly at times in the West Bank and there's no accountability for these crimes which of course is why they continue to happen I think also it goes to a broader point about Israeli Society something I've written about for years having lived there for quite a long time is that there is a culture of dehumanization of Palestinians so if you don't see Palestinians as human beings or as equal if you kill 15 20 30 40,000 who cares it's justified in that mindset putting aside the illegality of those orders it's also worth saying that after these reports about AI enabled Warfare in the last months and this ties into what I've written about in my book Israel is currently trying to sell these tools to foreign entities two governments that are looking to what Israel is doing in Gaza not with discust but actually with admiration and we'll find out in the coming months and years who they may be but my sense is it's going to be countries that are currently saying they're opposed to what Israel is doing but in fact are looking to engage those tools in their own conflicts and wars in their own countries interesting it'll be interesting to see what international law says about all this as as AI tools evolve and so on thank you very much for talking to us Anthony loen uh author of the book The Palestine laboratory joining us there from Sydney it was very interesting to talk to you thank you thank you
