well Israel says it's preparing a fullscale Land Air and sea invasion of Gaza the next stage of its military offensive against Hamas it's unclear though when that will happen Israel has killed at least 2,329 Palestinians in its bombing campaign on Gaza since last Saturday 724 of them were children and the death toll keeps Rising 1,300 Israelis have been killed in hamas's military operation including some 286 Soldiers the combined death toll makes this conflict the deadliest on both sides of all five Gaza conflicts meanwhile hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are making their way South a dangerous journey through a war zone Israel has ordered more than 1.1 million Palestinians to leave their destroyed neighborhoods in the north water and electricity have now run out for 2.3 million people after Israel imposed its total Siege Aid workers say host hospitals will run out of fuel within 2 days with devastating consequences for thousands of patients Hospitals and Clinics are overwhelmed the health Ministry says 70% of the population in Northern Gaza has no access to medical treatment since the UN Palestinian refugee agency evacuated its centers this video shows a paramedic responding to an attack in southern Gaza that's where Israel had ordered Palestinians to flee for their own safety Israel denied is targeting the area well let's get the latest now on the situation inside Gaza Jamila Abu Zuna joins us now on the phone from Kan yunes in the southern Gaza Strip Jamila I understand you live in Gaza City but you've had to flee with your own family and with so many others I'm glad that you're safe I understand you're now in a shelter in the South can you talk us through what conditions are like yes uh today is the third day uh of staying at a un shelter in the south of Gaza and Junes uh where now about 20,000 people are staying here and even more are coming are still coming um it's really it's after we have been forced to flee and evacuate our our houses our homes in Gaza and we went South not knowing what's going to happen later but as you said earlier uh it's happening they're launching a land attack is the next phase it's another 1948 uh uh diaspora so it's happening again the world is seeing this but still nothing is changing J my situation Sor I was just wanting to ask you said 20,000 people are Sheltering there with you Ian that's a huge number can you talk us through what what you're seeing there around you uh it's it's devastating to to try to describe actually um we've been sleeping on the floor literally uh we have no access to clean water no electricity um even no clean bathroom for instance uh even food is is very limited all the supplies are limited uh all and we have to mention that most of the people here of the people are uh infants children and elderly people who need urgent assistance medical assistance Jam we've also been hearing that there have been strikes on people as they've been fleeing the northern part of the Gaza Strip what do you know about that it's true uh yesterday one of the families who evacuated uh who came to the shelter we in they're saying that uh they evacuated the last minute and the other people who were fleeing uh after them were were completely um bombarded while they were on the way so it's not safe they say they're making SE ceas Fires for people to to um to give people chance to flee their home to the South but still there is no safety Jam Abu Zuna there Jamila please do stay safe with your family thank you for sharing that report with us we'll be staying in touch with you in the coming hours thank you jamala well Hamas is continuing to fire Rockets from Gaza into Southern Israel warning sirens have sounded across Israel with people in the coastal city of Tel Aviv and the surrounding towns they're taking shelter well let's now go to Al's Charles Stratford he's in sedot in southern Israel Charles there has been more movement by the Israeli military overnight what's been happening well just to bring you up to date where we are here in stot um I suppose the last half an hour or so it literally just stopped but some very heavy and sustained gunfire that we can hear we estimate probably around about a kilometer from here behind us towards the Gaza border the Gaza border is around 3 km nothing being said about this yet by the Israeli military but what we do know is that in recent days or since that initial attack on October the 7th the Israeli Army has been struggling to deal with repeated infiltration attempts by Palestinian fighters from Gaza that kind of firefight would suggest possibly well we can't confirm another infiltration attempt meanwhile we've heard a lot of outgoing uh we understand Heavy Artillery pounding areas of Gaza um from areas surrounding us here um and yes as you say there have been Rockets fired by that's another we understand outgoing um there have been Rockets fired overnight various different places and this morning um we heard Rockets being intercepted last night very loudly in Ash DOD as you you mentioned Tel Aviv also ashalon so yeah the situation remains obviously as you can imagine very unstable here but um it's small arms and heavy gun heavy machine gun fire like that so close to the border that as I say would suggest possible new infiltration attempts but we'll be able to confirm that later Charles we're hearing also about evacuations taking place around where you are what more can you tell us and also about the military buildup that we've been seeing towards the Border that's right the town of stot the mayor here is repeatedly called for an evacuation I think for all intents and purpose he might actually get what he wants today um around 25 to 30% of the population of stot are still here that's around 7,000 people I mean the streets are are pretty empty those 7,000 if indeed those statistics that we're understanding have been supplied To Us by the local authorities are true then as you can imagine most people are staying in their homes there are buses apparently being laid on collection points in this town we haven't seen any of those buses yet but we have spoken to people here um the few civilians that we've seen on the streets and some of them are saying some of them are looking for these buses and saying now is the time to get out and others are refusing to go we literally a few seconds a few minutes ago spoke to a man who passed us on his bicycle and said that um he uh he didn't want to go but he would possibly be forced to leave not by the military but because there was not much food left all the shops as you can imagine are closed it's a similar scenario in various towns um close to the Border as well an attempt by the military to evacuate the remaining civilians from these areas and meanwhile the military buildup continues um hundreds possibly thousands of Tanks APC heavy military equipment that is now moving into positions we understand possibly forward or more forward operational positions um some of the areas that we've seen equipment gathering in the last few days is now empty um and they have gone we understand into a closed military zone so all indications are that yes after last night's Announcement by the military that it was planning such a big offensive into Gaza it wouldn't be in conceivable if that offensive could start in the hours certainly the days ahead Charles there with the latest Forest on the ground and sederot in southern Israel thank you Charles
