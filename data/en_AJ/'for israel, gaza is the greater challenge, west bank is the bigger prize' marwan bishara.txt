well you're watching eljer a reminder of our top stories this hour the Israeli Army has bombed the officers of Palestine red cresant in gaza's southern city of KH Unis thousands of displaced Palestinians have been Sheltering there video has emerged showing Palestinians stripped and rounded up by Israeli forces at a sports stadium in Gaza the footage was released by the Palestinian kuds news agency it comes as the UN sounds the alarm about Israel's treatment of detainees and Israeli forces have killed two Palestinians during a raid on a refugee camp south of Hebron in the occupied West Bank at least 55 Palestinians were arrested in incursions across the territory on Tuesday well let's bring in Maan Bashar Al jazer senior political analyst once again I want to uh stick talking about the raids in the occupied West Bank they have happened almost nightly since the War Began uh but they have seemed to be more intense in the last night or so a number of uh different areas were raided overnight at least two people killed more than 50 people arrested why do you think it is that Israel seems to be ramping up the pressure and the tension when it comes to the occupied West Bank I think we've seen something similar that happens in Gaza and the West Bank albe it a different style of fighting while uh there's a a genocide taking place in Gaza there's a low intensity Warfare against the West Bank and against the Palestinian the West Bank happening at the same time clearly the netan government wants to take advantage of the attention uh being given to Gaza in order to carry uh that kind of uh action in the West Bank and what is that action it's actually mostly land theft uh destruction of houses and sometimes communities on the West Bank uh while uh doubling down on the settlement the illegal settlements of uh Jews in the West Bank Bank to try to uh coup up the Palestinians basically shrinking in as much as possible the land available to the Palestinians in the future so are they using the war in Gaza as an excuse as a distraction to really push further into the occupied West Bank both as an excuse and a distraction uh in the sense that uh while we are all paying a lot of attention to the to the real challenge to the real genocide to the real suffering in Gaza they are carrying their intensity uh Warfare on on the Palestinians but the thing is um that while Gaza is the greater military challenge uh the West Bank is the real political prize I I mean um Israel would like to get rid of Gaza if possible you know sever relations or push the Gaza to the Sinai when it comes to the West Bank it's much more difficult and hence they're trying to do whatever they can in order to control as bigger parts of the West Bank as possible while the world is not paying attention now the American Administration has sort of invoked a bit the issue of the settler violence against the Palestinians but nothing about the Israeli military violence against the Palestinians let's remember that uh before October 7 there were about 5,000 uh Palestinian prisoners now Reuters uh report rep that there's some 10,000 political prisoners so they're actually using the time in order to crack down to repress to oppress to to steal it's a daylight theft of the Palestinian territories and the preferred weapon is the bulldozer the way they're bulldozing entire communities houses and so on so forth yeah now the Striking thing here right is that while this is happening the subtler violence and the military violence against the Palestinians in the West Bank the Palestinian Authority that's supposed to be taking care of the security and the well-being of the Palestinians in the West Bank is doing nothing about it it's doing even nothing about the settler violence which if it does it will probably get a lot of uh praise from those in London and Washington who have been condemning settler violence against the Palestinians wh why why haven't they been doing anything and what should they be doing well let's let's talk about what they are not doing right uh just to broaden up up bit so Israel responded to the killing of 1200 Israelis uh many of them soldiers many of them killed by Israel itself on the October 7 by killing 20,000 plus Palestinians H with casualties now probably over 100,000 right that's was the Israel the respond now as Israel kills more than 20,000 Palestinians the Palestinian Authority does not nothing nothing actionable nothing serious I mean it goes to the United Nations but in fact on the ground in as far as wherever whether it's symbolic or practical or serious it's not doing anything now I can imagine that a lot of people argue that the the Palestinian Authority is not strong enough and doesn't want to carry anything suicidal against Israel today invoking greater violence against them but they can do a lot that is both symbolic practical actionable in order to stop the isra the Israeli aggression against the Palestinians now why I think it's both willful and Wishful why do I say that I I think willful in the sense that the head of the Palestinian Authority has long said he will never ever use violence against Israel no matter what right even when Israel carries a genocide against yes that's the willful part The Wishful part is that he seems to buy into the American lies about a vision of a two-state solution he's been promised that once the genocide in Gaza is finished that he will get a reward a state in the West Bank of course the Israeli Prime Minister says there's going to be nothing and we don't even accept the Palestinian Authority let alone accept the Palestinian Authority and a Palestinian State yeah so there is a willful and a Wishful part on the part of the Palestinian Authority that that is rendering Palestine Gaza unlivable and Palestine and and the West Bank basically uh um you know slowly but surely under Israeli control which basically means that the illusion of a Palestinian state is going to be a a total reality in the sense that with the pales with the Israeli settlers growing up to a million and the Palestinians coed up in their little Villages and refugee camps it's going to make anything that looks like two entities impossible okay thanks so much M we really do appreciate it's m Bashar for us there
