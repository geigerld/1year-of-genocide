while both Israel and Hamas have been accused of violating International humanitarian law with their attacks on civilians Israel has dropped thousands of bombs on crowded residential areas of Gaza flattening entire neighborhoods and these indiscriminate attacks on civilians are in violation of article 25 of the hay conventions a series of international treaties now legal experts say the intentional targeting of civilians by both Hamas and Israel also constitut a war crime the Israeli military has imposed a total Siege on Gaza Palestinians and Aid workers say the lack of food medicine Fuel and basic supplies has made the situation in the Gaza Strip catastrophic 101 healthcare workers have been killed in Gaza and 25 ambulances have been damaged the World Health Organization says the evacuation order for hospitals in Northern Gaza is quote a death sentence for newborn babies and patients in intensive care and Palestinians in Gaza describe the forced evacuation order in the North and the Relentless bombardment as collective punishment and under the Fourth Geneva Convention Israel as the occupying power is prohibited from deporting or transferring part of the population from the land that it occupies we can get more on this with Jeffrey Robertson he's a former United Nations war crimes judge he's joining us from London welcome to Al jazer sir so um we know that the United Nations Commission of inquiry said that it was collecting evidence of war crimes committed by all sides they said this at the beginning of the war now one of the goals of the Geneva Convention is to protect civilians who aren't involved in the fighting can we safely say that what we're seeing here is a Defiance of the Geneva Convention yes it is and war crimes are being committed the first the provoked the second was the Hamas barbaric attack on Israel killing and taking hostages which is contrary to the Geneva conventions and to the international criminal court law so that gives Israel the right indeed the duty to pursue uh the attackers to find if they can the hostages to arrest and prosecute the Hamas leaders who gave these horrific orders not to to mutilate uh the Prisoners the the people people that they killed now then we have the Israeli cabinet the Prime Minister and his War cabet who have authorized what is an indiscriminate bombing campaign and indeed a form of starvation there are war crimes because the bombing has been indiscriminate Aid agencies at the moment uh estimate 2,700 children have been killed uh that is truly appalling and it is it's something that is being discussed today and tomorrow at the UN General Assembly but You' got to understand the general assembly is a talking shop the Fatal flaw in the UN is that all decisions must be made by the security Council and the Security Council is poxed and can't make any decision because of the vetto wielded by Russia wielded by yeah we certainly keep an eye out on what happens at the general assembly but just back to the issue of of uh war crimes and these violations of international law that the UN Chief is describing taking place in Gaza with these violations with children being killed with children with children being being being killed tar Israelis targeting the hospitals as well as the shelters how can these people how can the women and the children the innocent civilians be protected from these attacks very obviously they can't be because as I say the security Council has the only Power and it's not it's ineffective hopelessly divided and Mr GES has made some reasonable and sensible uh views uh and has been attacked for them but but there it is until we can have an operational system of international law children are being killed in Ukraine by barbaric bombing by Russia and it's a bad time if you like to be a child and the general assembly is quite sickening you see the Diplomat from Iran talking about war crimes when Iran is guilty of the worst crimes against humanity uh in the past so there it is we have a world where law international law is not enforced and where war crimes can be committed by uh a government an elected government uh with with almost impunity so how can these parties be held accountable sir how can these parties be held accountable under International humanit law well eventually eventually those involved in the decisions both by Hamas and by Israel may be arrested abroad and they may be prosecuted in courts the I the international criminal court can take out indictments and certainly should against Hass leaders it can take out indictments against Mr Netanyahu and his War cabinet but at the end of the day but seeing that Israel doesn't recognize the jurisdiction of the IC can that work I mean who will hold Israel to account does America nor Russia so this is the difficulty we have international law sure but we don't have an effective system we can pick it up there can be uh as I say prosecutions in the future and people like mosovich people like madic and kich have been prosecuted 20 years after their crimes and uh are now in prison but it's a long process and uh we don't even have a c tribunal to punish aggression right which was committed notably by Russia thank you so much Jeffrey Robertson we appreciate your time thank you so much we have to leave it there thank
