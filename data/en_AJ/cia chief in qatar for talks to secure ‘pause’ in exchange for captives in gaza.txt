the head of the CIA the United States Central Intelligence Agency will visit Qatar to discuss the Gaza War William Burns will meet government officials here to discuss ongoing negotiations over the potential release of Israeli captives held by Hamas in Gaza up to 15 captives could be freed in exchange for a ceasefire Rob Reynolds reports from Washington DC CIA director William Burns has been traveling for the past several days in the Middle East he went first to Israel then to Egypt and now to Qatar a country which has played a key role in negotiating the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza the talks appear to Center on a idea of a three-day pause in Israel's attacks on Gaza in return for the release by Hamas of 10 to 15 hostages and analysts say the talks appear to be gaining momentum there's a lot of sort of movement in the right direction on the hostages that will be a main focus of what burns is up to and Hamas and and Israel at times they'll take this Maximus positions we won't do this unless all of that happens but both sides are also talking about women for women children for children elderly for elderly Fighters for Fighters so when you have that type of rhetoric there is a glimmer of hope that some hostages Will Survive and be released burn spent much of his long career as a diplomat in the Middle East and is well known to the leaders in that region he is also reportedly traveling to Jordan and the United Arab Emirates as well as possibly other countries all in a bid to provide some respit to the inhabitants of Gaza and the release of some hostages as the war rages on Rob Reynolds Al jazer Washington and we're also hearing that the Amir of Qatar shik tamim bin Hamad Alani will travel to Egypt tomorrow on an official visit he'll be holding talks with Egypt's President Abdul fatel CeCe Glenn Carl is the former deputy National Intelligence officer for transnational threats at the CIA you're joining us on Skype from Boston in the United States I'd like your read on all of this first of all the presence of the head of the CIA here in Qatar I mean look secret Services have many ways of communicating and talking to each other if the head of the CIA wants to come and have these talks in person what does that tell you well he frequently the head of the CIA is a member of the cabinet in the United States not always but frequently he's clearly one of the top most senior officials in the government so his traveling obviously is a sign of the the Deep strategic interest that the United States places on the issues that are on the war and and all of the potential Fallout and consequences that it has there's a there are tactical reasons why he would be meeting with shik Alani and and the kares you touched upon them that would be the immediate objectives I think which are to find some way for um a release of the hostages and perhaps an easing or a stopping of the fighting with perhaps humanitarian pauses however you want to call it so is that sort of the immediate objectives the larger objectives why he would be traveling why the Sheik would be going to Egypt and why the director Burns would be going to Cutter and elsewhere is to try to find some uh long-term solution to the horrors that are unfolding to to um address uh hamas's attack uh on Israel and to stop that kind of event from occurring and to address Israel's response and invasion of Gaza and displacement of half of the population at least so it's a measure of importance the United States places on those issues staying on this shortterm negotiation and again I appreciate we don't have all the facts here all this happening behind closed doors but this deal that Rob was reporting on that's reportedly being negotiated right a temporary pause in the fighting versus the release of a number of hostages U we're talking about potentially 15 captives being released what can you tell our viewers about the challenges of these conversations how they happen number one and what are the challenges number two well there are conflicting currents that are at play Cutters in the United States are are close allies and yet cutter is the closest strongest supporter of pamas uh yet at least the United States can engage substantively at any time and at all different levels with the the government of cutter unlike that of Iran which is not an ally of the United States of course and is the other great supporter of Hamas so this is an opportunity and a challenge both for the United States and for cutter which have overlapping and uh somewhat contradictory uh objectives with respect to Hamas uh Gaza and the whole crisis with the Palestinians and Israelis talk to us about the leverage right who has leverage when you walk into that room uh there are Qatari representatives there is the US head of the CIA there's a US base right here in Qatar Qatar also as you said has uh contacts uh with strong contacts with Hamas their political leadership here in Doha who has leverage in that conversation well that's why they're talking is that both parties the United States and cutter in this instance have leverage but different but leverage in different uh areas of the whole issue or The Clash the United States has some influence less than most people imagine uh on Israel because of the US's long-standing diplomatic and material financial support of Israel and kter of course has some influence on Hamas because of its financial support and diplomatic uh support for for Hamas also so that is why it's interesting for each party to talk with the other uh and in the encouraging sign on the hostages issue and and others is that cutter and the US are allies and do seek uh not identical objectives but uh overlapping ones uh so that's that's what brings them together and and gives some hope that there might be movement on the hostages or on larger issues if any two parties can have some influence I would say it would be cutter in the United States on on this specific issue Glenn Carl former deputy National intell elligence officer for transnational threats at the CIA thank you so much for uh making a time for us today okay I want to bring uh wer s into this conversation you're a professor of law at the University of Colorado's School of Law and you've been watching events unfold with us today we've been having um we've been talking about various aspects of this uh since the beginning of the day now this conversation that's happening between um Qatar will happen uh according to our latest report in Qatar and the head of the CIA the idea would be to obtain a temporary pause in the fighting in Gaza versus a release of a number of captives what are the scenarios afterwards mean if that happens maybe 15 captives released if this is successful what we're talking about and then a one day two day thre day truce in the fighting then what well I think one of the you know the the the the background to all this is that you know one of the things that the Hamas movement has been saying consistently is that the issue of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli detention facilities and jails is kind of Paramount in this current round of fighting and it was the reason why they took all these people and held them captive in in Gaza and continue to hold them in Gaza so at some point it would stand to reason that there's going to be some sort of agreement despite the bellicose rhetoric of the Israelis that they're going to go in and free the prisoners you know by military means which doesn't seem to be particularly realistic so these are the type of kind of Peace meal moves that we're seeing you know William Burns as far as American actors are concerned has a kind of a longer history in the region you know I think a relatively good reputation for kind of direct and honest dealing and he's come he's coming here to Qatar to as your previous guest was talking about you know talk to the other party with leverage it's also a little bit kind of you know it it it it shows the kind of Stark positions that when a country like the United States decides that a group is a terrorist group that says Hamas is a terrorist group it assumes that it can't deal with it on any level so you have to have this kind of um inter these intermediaries talk which makes uh deals and um stopping the fighting so strin and so difficult which you know in the in the face of the the the humanitarian crisis that I'll say it you know even if the Israeli military spokesperson doesn't agree in the humanitarian crisis in Gaza this these type of measures are so desperately needed and it's just that we see how cumbersome and and complicated it can be uh given the positions that uh that actors have taken in in in this current round and so looking back at previous conflicts when you when you have mediation and when you have deals like this again this deal at this hour is not done we don't know if it will materialize or not there have been moments in the in the last few days where there have been reports rumors that a deal was on the cusp of happening and and they didn't until now happens could be a confidence building measure if I'm hearing you right towards perhaps a bigger deal yes I mean I think that you know that when there's a war and I mean I'm not a historian a military historian or anything like that but it it seems that when people are shooting at each other you have exceedingly hard feelings and nobody wants to be the first to kind of you know to kind of give up or or feel like they've been defeated so you see the situation on the ground is active fighting so these peace meal steps are you know are I guess the best we can hope for or expect you know and you know to to to to kind of look at what's actually been going on you know the Israelis have said they're not interested in these type of pauses they're not interested in deals they're interested in Victory their rhetoric is very kind of bellicose and unwavering so it's interesting to see the kind of you know Hamas on the other hand have said we're open for deals it's the Israelis who aren't who aren't doing it so we'll see what the reality actually is pending you know this current development but um you know in in such a such a dire sit situation you know maybe there's some element of Hope um it's that's something obviously we're going to continue watching very closely what da thank you very much
