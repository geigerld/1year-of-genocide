uh we just have to interrupt John an whistle to uh have a listen to uh Mr Martin griffits from the under Secretary General of the humanitarian Affairs emergency relief coordinator let's have a listen as we have heard from The Honorable president Fierce hostilities continue across Gaza from the air sea and now on the ground casualties continue to amount with the dead reportedly exceeding 11,000 people the majority of that astonishing figure children and women the actual total however is likely to be much higher as figures have not been updated for 5 days due to a collapse of communication networks in Gaza and due to the fact that bodies under the rubble take time to be discovered more than 41,000 housing units have been destroyed or severely damaged amounting to around 45% of the housing stock the total housing stock in Gaza the nature and scale of Civilian harm is characteristic of the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in a densely populated area and I reminded that tomorrow marks the first anniversary of the adoption of the political Declaration on strengthening the protection of civilians from the humanitarian consequences arising from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas there's no greater reminder of the importance of its Universal endorsement and implementation than when what we see today in Gaza more than one and a half million Gins are estimated to be internally displaced many of them have fled southwards in search as you said Mr President of relative safety only to be now told to relocate many for the second second time to the West nevertheless nevertheless let us not forget hundreds of thousands remain in the north but the fierce fighting and bombardment is taking place there's little to no medical care available in Northern Gaza I look forward obviously to hearing as we all do from Dr Tedros of wh and Dr Madame Natalia of anra on this matter out of 24 hospitals with inpatient capacity in the north only one Al in G Gaza City is presently oper operational and admitting patients 18 hospitals have shut down and evacuated since the start of hostilities another five hospitals including alifa are providing extremely limited services to patients already admitted these hospitals are not reliably accessible because of insecurity they do not have electricity or essential supplies and they are not admitting new patients now we've all seen the fighting in and around the alifa hospital in recent days it behooves me once again not for the first time as as others have done so too to make clear that under International humanitarian law all parties must protect civilians and civilian objects and these include hospitals to ensure the wounded and sick receive Medical care hospitals have always had specific protection this means also this means also they must not be used to Shield military objectives from Attack this is also a breach of international law it also means that even if hospitals lose that protection that I have spoken of warnings and other precautions must be implemented to avoid civilian harm and of course disproportionate attacks are strictly prohibited across Gaza but particularly in the north food and water supplies are running perilously low and you Mr President have already mentioned the terrible predictions from unra the lack of f fuel means that Communications and other essential functions such as water desalination are progressively dropping off line and this despite recent agreements to provide a modicum of fuel on a daily basis excuse me across the border civilians in Israel endure the Deep pain of their own as They Mourn the brutal killing the inhumane killing the sudden unnecessary unacceptable killing of 1200 people new details of the horrors of 7th of October emerge each day Rockets continue to be fired into populated areas and tens of thousands of people are displaced let us not forget nearly 240 hostages from babies to octogenarians face their 41st day of captivity as you have said Mr President they must be released immediately with no conditions in the interim they must be treated humanely they must be allowed to receive visits from the international Committee of the Red Cross setup for precisely this kind of purpose my colleagues from the other un agencies and departments Dr Natalie from unra Dr Tedros from World Health Organization Mr aim Steiner undp commissioner High Commissioner vul Turk Cindy McCain Dr Natalia Canam and Miss Lana Rik from UNICEF who join us today will provide further detail on the horrendous situation on the ground but it is without doubt a humanitarian crisis that by any measure and we have so many so many measures in this angry world of ours is intolerable and cannot continue in many respects International humanitarian law appears to have been turned on its head in this regard we welcome also the resolution 37 2712 of 2023 adopted by the security Council on Wednesday reaffirming that all parties must adhere to their International legal obligations this joins of course the strong position Mr President as you have mentioned set out by the general assembly in its resolution earlier on 26th of October on the protection of civilians in the occupied Palestinian territory and in Israel this morning I want to set out what we at the office for the coordination of humanitarian Affairs see as the necessary requirements for the humanitarian response there are 10 points all of which are standard practice for humanitarians we have learned all over the world in areas of the greatest tragedy how to do this some of the worst jobs in the world most are underpinned by obligations under IHL to take constant care to spare civilians and to meet their essential needs including by facilitating the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief number one we must be able to move from ad hoc delivery of assistance to a continuous flow of Aid it's like anyone in any society in any Village in any Community civilians need to meet have their essential needs met they need to know when the next treatment or delivery will happen they need to know it will be unimpeded and they need to know that Aid will arrive number two more Crossing points into Gaza for Aid and importantly commercial deliveries of ials addressing the scale of needs across Gaza from a single crossing point in the South as now is logistically impossible at the very least we need permission to use the crossing point at K Shalom through which 60% of goods were in the past delivered before those hostilities began in October number three fuel as we have highlighted repeatedly fuel is critical for the onward distribution of Aid throughout Gaza the trucks that come in through Rafa and offload to the warehouse in Rafa are then reloaded on for onward distribution of Aid to the people of Gaza and for the functioning including through fuel for the functioning of vital services in other words fuel is essential very very simply for keeping people alive in the past few days I'm very glad to say and to announce anra has rece has been allowed to receive 24,000 lers of fuel for two days of Aid distribution within Gaza this is most welcome it is also a fraction of what is needed to meet the minimum of our humanitarian respon responsibilities across Gaza north and south to do so I'm sure anro will speak to this the requirement is 10 times as much or around 200,000 liters per day number four we need to have the security assurances and additional facilities to establish relief distribution hubs particularly in the south of Gaza Mr President you will know very well humanitarian operations depend on shelter which is safe and identified and distribution hubs which are used as places where families can visit or from which deliveries to families can be made we need those distribution hubs identified deconflict agreed as safe particularly in the south of Gaza these will be locations where people know they can access Aid and as jumping off points for the comprehensive delivery of aid number five safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian organization to Del deliver Aid throughout Gaza this is of course is a point which hardly needs restating it requires a facilitation of access and needs assurances for the security of humanitarian personnel and assets and as you have said Mr President anra our brave brave brave colleagues of unra have already suffered over a hundred deaths from their Brave Personnel in Gaza which brings me to six an improved humanitarian notification system this aims to ensure and again it is common in many parts of the world where there are humanitarian operations it aims to ensure that the parties have the information they need to meet their implications sorry their obligations to protect and facilitate humanitarian operations we notify them of convoys movements or of places where relief is to be distributed or of shelters where people need to be safe and their obligation is to protect those places number seven civilians must be allowed to move to safer areas and when circumstances allow to voluntarily return to their residences civilian movement is a privilege protected under international law they choose where they want to go where they want to be safe and where they want to move this connects directly to number eight we need to expand the number of shelters for displaced civilians across Gaza hundreds and thousand excuse me hundreds of thousands have so far taken shelter in unra facilities these shelters the heroic efforts of unra have been the buffer between survival and tragedy for so many of these people and still are but these facilities as you have said Mr President are overcrowded overburdened overwhelmed we need to expand the number of locations and Facilities I referred earlier to the issue of distribution points particularly in the South where hundreds of thousands of civilians continue to arrive we need a stretch of places where people will shelter will be safe and where the parties will be notified of their presence I'm number nine funding impossible to have a humanitarian speech without a reference to funding I'm afraid humanitarian operations cannot proceed without the money to fund them the emergency appeal for Gaza brought out just recently by my office amounts $1.2 billion doar 1.2 billion dollar so far we have received $132 million what is this 10th to do our job to reach those people in need we need the funds to buy the supplies to run the trucks to repurpose the schools to pay for the salaries of those Brave health workers who remain number 10 and you mentioned it yourself Mr President a humanitarian ceasefire you can call it what you will and everyone has many different words for it but the requirement from a humanitarian point of view is very simple stop the fighting to allow civilians to move safely do it for an indefinite period to facilitate an unimpeded response give the people of Gaza a breather from the terrible things that have been put on them of these last few weeks and without condition release all the hostages we need the full leverage of the UN membership to achieve these objectives and as we know from the speakers Mr President that you have lined up for this informal session we have the means to do the job that we have done elsewhere and that we can do here we're not asking for the Moon we're asking for the basic measures required to meet the essential needs of the civilian population and St the course of this extraordinary unexpected un necessary and unacceptable crisis for as dire as the situation is in Gaza we all know in this room it could get far worse I have as many others do real actions that if we do do not take action now this is a conflict that could spread its tendrils further into other parts of the occupied pal Palestinian territory and Beyond and drag the region into a configuration with catastrophic consequences which will make today look like a day of comparative safety and it is not so thank you Mr president okay that was uh the UN relief Chief Martin griffi speaking at the United Nations General Assembly you heard him there at
