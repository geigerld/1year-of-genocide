Angela Davis thank you so much for joining me on UPF front thank you Mark uh in the midst of uh Israel's Relentless attacks on Gaza uh numerous black activists in the US have expressed their solidarity with Palestinians and they've called once again for an end to the occupation uh back in 2020 in Gaza City in the midst of black lives matter protests a Palestinian artist painted a large mural of George Floyd the African-American man of course who had recently been murdered by a police officer in Minneapolis uh these two places are more than 6,000 miles away from each other yet Palestinians and black Americans have found a common cause with each other's struggles uh how does a moment like that how do these moments come to be well um you know Mark for as about as long as my political memory goes back I think the causes of Palestine and black liberation have been intertwined and I I just can't imagine uh that those of us who call ourselves um scholar activists I can't uh imagine um uh not uh calling for justice for Palestine I can't imagine the whole uh agenda of social justice in the world not including uh Palestine uh and this respect I think um uh black people in um the US and throughout the the uh the the the the region of the west of this hemisphere should feel a very special tie to Palestinians of course there there is a long history uh but I um you know I I think back to June Jordan the incredible poet when very few people were talking about the importance of supporting Palestine uh June was upfront uh arguing that it was not only necessary to support people in Palestine but to recognize that that that that Palestine itself is a kind of um moral litmus test um for the world yeah of course Nelson Mandela said that South Africa would not be free as until Palestine is free so Palestine um occupies a very central place in the political imagination of the last of uh 50 75 years a lot of people when they hear the word solidarity uh they think sameness uh but the conditions between Black Folk and Palestinians the conditions are different in certain ways how much of the solidarity movement hinges on us having the exact same oppressive conditions and how much uh of it is about the broader systems of power that put us where we are how do we and because I think a lot of people say well I'm my life isn't like a Palestinian and Palestinian says well I don't have to deal with those things over there uh how do you how do you tease that out those who assume that they live in a very small insulated space in the world uh uh are are just not recognized ing conditions as they are today uh uh we do not live in silos uh uh we do not have our little bubbles in which we get to choose what affects us uh uh as as as as individuals uh uh you know I think that thatth what is really exciting about this last period as much suffering as we have witnessed and experienced um is that we've seen um movements Against Racism uh expand uh we would not have imagined so many people identifying uh with uh of these anti-racist uh efforts and now of course you we're seeing you know what uh we're seeing those who are reacting against it uh uh and um you know those who don't want to see us move move forward uh in our understanding of the way in which racism in the US is very much connected to a paride in South Africa which is very much uh connected to a parade in in in in Israel um so yeah this is a question that can't be answered abstractly I think it's a it's a question U that that has to play out in the course of of the practice of solidarity one of the things that's come up in that practice of solidarity is conversations about the role of policing as well well uh for years there have been exchange programs that bring together police uh Ice uh border control FBI all from the United States along with uh soldiers police and Border Agents from Israel uh to share tactics on quote unquote counterterrorism uh both the US and Israel have been accused of repressive policing of racial profiling uh and they continue to sort of deepen their ties uh toward developing a kind of shared security model uh when you see those relationships what can we learn from that well those relationships uh that uh link um the militarization of the police and the Us and other countries uh to uh the the leadership of of uh of Israel uh the the IDF and which is trained police forces all over the country uh uh it it it it becomes um clear I think that that all these issues are intertwined uh uh you know let's remember that uh cop city is developing uh in Atlanta yeah and precisely at a time when when when the police were on the on the defensive as a consequence of the struggles that were catalyzed by uh the lynching of George Floyd uh um the police were on a defensive uh for a little while but now it appears as if they're trying to not only regain the position they had before but but but but move forward uh and only and mean I was just thinking it's it's not just governments either right I mean private entities are also involved in these kinds of exchanges for example we've seen the export of security and Technology from private Israeli companies that Supply some of Israel's military equipment surveillance equipment for things like the separation wall uh between Israel and the West Bank uh the same companies are working with the US to provide technology for things like bolstering surveillance and militarization along the US Mexico border when we see private corporations benefiting uh from oppression even through the discourse and language of security uh that has the comp that complicates the analysis a little bit doesn't it well I think that should probably be at the center of the analysis uh uh you know because we we often don't explicitly talk about uh capitalism and the reasons you know why the ties the political ties between the US and Israel for example are so strong uh what does that have to do with the development of global capitalism over the last decades and you know what does the prison Industrial complex have to do with uh Shoring up a capitalist system uh that's often times the elephant in the room that's often times that about which we do not speak but it is Central it is absolutely Central you have a very Grand radical uh Freedom dream for dismantling capitalism for abolishing policing in prisons and for ending the occupation of Palestine I mean these are not short-term goals these are not easy solutions that we're looking for here and in all of those areas we see progress and then we see retrenchment we see two steps forward and then we see steps back sometimes one sometimes three given where we are right now on the question of Israel and Palestine do you remain hopeful you know uh I don't think that I get to uh decide on that basis uh of course there are moments when we feel uh extremely distressed and this is you know one of the um tragic uh moments uh in our recent history uh but I also uh should say that um it takes time it takes time and often times we are unable to see where we're headed uh uh but we have to believe that it is possible to make change uh and we can't give up we can't give up we can't not hope uh because hope is the condition of all struggles we'll leave it there Angela Davis thank you so much for joining me on up front thank you so much Mark
