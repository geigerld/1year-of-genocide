I'm joined by Yosi Bellin who's a former Israeli cabinet minister who took part in negotiations that led to the Oslo Accords he joins us live from Tel Aviv a very warm welcome to you so as you probably heard from our correspondent in Lebanon there the feeling is at least in Beirut that this is a somewhat contained uh conflict in the south of the country but are we sleepwalking towards something more full-blown between Israel and Hezbollah well I I hope very much that this will not be the case it doesn't have to be we understand that hisbah is doing something which is not exactly um fitting the the needs of the people of Lebanon and the government of Lebanon I think that there is a gap between his bala's interests and the civilian interests of Lebanon and if we can ER work in order to put an end to to this EX change of fire and I heard today that there is an American French initiative to find a solution for the current situation I think that this is the what both sides need more more than anything else the to have a a a a gain a war between us and Them it may happen I hope very much that it will not happen there is no need for that and it is always civilians on both sides which are becoming refugees which are killed which are wounded if every side is of course blaming the other side and there is no end to it there is of course irrespective of what may or may not happen whether or not this may spiral or not very much the need for a new security Arrangement uh between Israel and uh Hezbollah how might that work behind the scenes as somebody who was heavily involved in previous negotiations in the past well the the UN resolution 1701 ER was very reasonable one and ended the second Lebanon war but eventually was not respected by byah now the question is whether we can renew the efforts toward something which will resemble it very much and there is also another point that Lebanon is is saying that there are differences about the border between the the two states and I think that the current government of of Israel is is ready to to talk about the Border too so if there is a solution for the Border there is no need for a war I mean who who who can tell me why should we fight Lebanon of all places why should they fight us of all places so you were suggesting that there are very much um lessons to be drawn from history from that 1982 Lebanon war yeah I mean the the war in Lebanon in my view um was totally unneeded I was one of those who did whatever we could in order to assure that Israel withdraws from South Lebanon and that happened on May the 24th 2000 I think that it was a very important uh decision I don't think that we should get back to to Lebanon we don't need it the lebanes don't need it of course and that we can live in peace between the two the two countries I remember that for years especially when I was a very young men when people asked who should be who would be the first Arab countries making peace with Israel it was almost obvious that it would be Lebanon and that regretfully never happened of course the the worst case scenario at least for Israel is that if indeed this does escalate it could be potentially fighting two conflicts on two fronts what would that mean for Israel first of all I I hope very much that the war in Gaza will end soon um I I think that we exhausted it and that we weakened Hamas H we did not catch all its leaders you you you never had have exactly what you plan to have to H to do but after 8 months and and so many people who were killed in this war enough is enough so I I I hope that there will be no uh two front war and that there will be no FR no no front at all because the the war with with Lebanon is is very artificial because what happened is that the crazy attack on the south of Israel on October the 9th was followed by an Israeli attacks on Gaza on Hamas and Lebanon said yes because we identify with Hamas we will attack Israel too and and bombard Israel but there is no conflict now between Israel and Lebanon or even not Israel and and andala so here I believe that there is really I mean if we were now begin a war a war and we have two fronts or one front I believe that it is totally totally totally unneeded uh y b it's been a pleasure to have you on a here many any thanks thank you thank you for having me make sure to subscribe our channel to get the latest news from aler
