meanwhile survivors of Israeli air strikes near dear albala in central Gaza being admitted to the AL AXA hospital they were injured in the latest Israeli bombardment of the al-ag magazi neighborhood funeral prayers were held for those who succumbed to their injuries let's go to hanim Mahmud who Li for us in Rafa in southern Gaza and Han as we outline there the strikes continue overnight and into this morning bring us up today with the [Music] latest yes as we are back to uh our site here we we got reports confirmed reports of ongoing massive uh bombings going on in the central area and as the Israeli military and its uh tanks and army vehicle are pushing deeper into the Central Area particularly around uh zaa area that's in the middle of the central area in the Gaza Strip and what they trying to do just carve a route from Za area all the way to anat Refugee came a densely populated area despite the large number of people who have been evacuating from the Central Area there is still uh hundreds of thousands of people in that area simply because they don't have a place to go to and or they came to a conclusion that there is no safer Place uh in the G strip but in in addition to the artillery shellings and the the air strike there are attacking drones hovering at a low level in the disguise of the Central Area there are confirmed reports of people arriving uh to not to alaka hospital that's the only remaining health facility semi functional health facility in Dar bah City where they were shot at by these drone attacks there's signs of being targeted through snipers as well confirmed by alaka Hospital the the lat this what we heard is just a person who was called by his name to come out of his house and just within meters away from his house was targeted by these attacking drones that fired at directly at his head and killed him and when his brother came out to check on him to see what's going on with him he was shot at and then his son came after and they were he was killed uh right at the same time they were shooting at other uh at the other people but this is the the the scene that is quite horrifying and when when we talk to some of the people who were who made it to RAF City and described the horror from overnight and and early hour of this morning as they were trying to to leave the Central Area describe it in one word it's hell on Earth that's the common uh words that we heard from a thousand of displac Palestinians coming to uh to RAF City and and Khan unit where most of the the fighting is it's it's taking place the Israeli military is pushing deeper into kanun and now expanding its aerial bombardment to Al AML District that's the western side of kanun an area that was described and designated as a safe for people from Eastern kanun to evacuate to and also houses the palestin society and it's a charitable Health Facilities hospital that came under bombardment for the fourth time in less than 10 days and what seems to be a systematic attacks on remaining health facilities in the city of Han unun the scene and the reports we're getting from the central area and and khun is are very difficult to describe and and people are are are are unable to describe the horror they have experienced uh within the past few days but one one stable fact that we we know so far thousand of people are fleeing uh the the horror of this ongoing genocide War okay hany such a difficult situation such a difficult job that you were doing we really appreciate you reporting hany Mahmud there for us live in Rafa in southern Gaza meanwhile Israel's defense minister YF Gallant has unveiled his proposal for Gaza once the war is finished under the plan Israel would have the right to oversee security and conduct operations inside the strip if necessary Israeli settlers would not occupy the land local Palestinians would have limited control of Gaza except for those affiliated with Hamas Gallant did not name specific groups and a us-led multinational task force including European and some Arab countries will be involved in the economic recovery in the strip Egypt will control gaza's main civilian border crossing in collaboration with Israel and the United States let's speak to our correspondent Laura Khan who's in occupied East Jerusalem tell us a bit more detail about y of galant's proposals and what reaction there's been to it well this is the first official proposal set out by a top uh minister in Israel and essentially spells out a four-pronged plan at the most important aspect of it for them is that Hamas will not rule the day after the war instead there'll be a Palestinian entity this is not going to be the pal ing in Authority which is governing parts of the occupied West Bank but it it does put many stipulations there that this International task force uh will come in it will help uh rehabilitate and rebuild the Gaza Strip bear in mind More than 70% of it has been completely destroyed but it will also allow the Israeli military to come in and raid as and when it pleases a lot like it does in the occupied West Bank and it wants to maintain an airse and land and blockade so the day after the war could look a lot like the day before the war now it's really important to mention this isn't Israeli policy it's not come from any cabinet this is just a proposed plan but it was supposed to be discussed in a war and wider security cabinet meeting however ministers in that meeting reported to the Press on condition of an anonymity that it descended into chaos now much of that was between the far right camp and top Israeli military brass mainly because they' planned a probe into what happened on October 7th why there was such a big security breach in Israel but the people that uh the chief of staff harzel Hy has put in charge of the probe were also involved in the 2005 disengagement from the Gaza Strip they helped to pull the settlers out of the Gaza Strip the far right were very annoyed with that they said it shouldn't be happening during the war and started talking about disengagement other hit others hit back and said this has nothing to do with disengagement now hle Hy has come forward with comments today saying what he meant is it's a probe into how the Army conducts itself but there was a lot of criticism leveled at this even being in the media um the opposition in Israel said this shouldn't have been leaked especially that it's a security meeting and it's about the day later um so I mean this has caused not only criticism but chaos and disunity inside the cabinet thank you for that Laura Khan there us unoccupied East Jerusalem now Israeli forces have carried out air strikes in towns in southern Lebanon the Army released this
