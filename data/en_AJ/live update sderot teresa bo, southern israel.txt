Charles filed that report from as we speak is Israel still sending more military assets around Gaza well that's correct I'm here in stot where the population that remains here is still trying to recover from the shock from the shatter sense of stability that they had prior uh to this incident the air strikes are ongoing right here we were able to hear at least 10 air strikes this morning we do know that the Israeli milit saying that they have hit at least 100 of Hamed's Targets in Gaza and at the same time they have started they continue moving uh troops towards this part of the country we have seen uh we have seen armor vehicles we have seen tanks lots of soldiers among many other things they're also using vessels from the sea they with Precision guided munition uh the Israeli military saying that they have hit for example the Hamas headquarters in central Gaza also a bank that operated uh with hammer however right now the big question is about when this ground operation could take place the chief of staff of israeli's military has addressed the soldiers here telling them that the operation is still ongoing that it is a priority however that the lives of those who have been kidnapped is a priority right now the Israeli government is saying that 199 people have been kidnapped they're currently in Gaza there's been lots of tension between the Israeli government and the relatives of those who have been kidnapped many are very very critical of the Israeli government handling of the situation they want their loved ones safe and that there's also ongoing negotiations that we know of that involve Qatar and Egypt among many others who want to see uh the hostages released especially women and children Hamas is saying that foreign Nationals that have been kidnapped could be released if the situation on the ground changes if the air strikes we have been seeing nonstop happening right here in B hanon on the other side where that's Northern Gaza that you can see right behind me stop however what Hamas is saying is that those foreign Nationals who have been serving in the Israeli Army won't be released it's interesting because when you're here you get a sense that Israel the whole objective of Israel right now is that something uh like what happened will never happen again again and that's of course is a huge problem for Palestinians right in Gaza and in other parts of of this area Teresa B reporting from deral in southern Israel thank you very much
