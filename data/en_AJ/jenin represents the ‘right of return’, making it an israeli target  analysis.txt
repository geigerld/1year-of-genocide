take this on with Ibrahim fat he's an associate professor of conflict resolution at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies welcome Ibrahim I wonder if we could just dig into the story of Janine a little bit I mean you're from Janine yourself um because the people who are there are descendants of those Palestinians evicted from their homes back in 1948 right so tell us about Janina and and why Israel feels a need to Target it yeah thank you uh first of all it's the story of uh the Janine refugee camp uh which has about uh 13,000 people living in a very small area that they come actually from the area of 1948 that was occupied in 1948 many of them are come from the city of haa that we know today and they've been living in this refugee camp since 1948 and uh nothing has uh changed over the past U years uh and they've been living um in disastrous situations in this kind of a refugee camp in the area of Janine now uh Janine refugee camp has been uh targeted many times in the past decades by the Israeli Army uh for more than one reason one is that it's the issue uh and the cause of uh a refugee camp which reminds them of the the issue of U being Palestinians displaced from their communities from their areas from their homes where they used to live in 1948 and this is something that uh keeps the cause of the right of return alive which is something that the Israeli government government want wants to bury that they don't want to hear about uh that people were displaced from their homes and under international law they have the right to return to their hom so it's very important for them is to Target these refugee camps and it's not only engine by the way in toim as well they were targeting n shs refugee camp right it's across across the area isn't it the occupied West Bank but from Israel's P perspective what will they feel they have achieved by doing what they have done now they've pulled out of Janine in this particular attack basically uh this is not the first time where they target Janine because in 2002 we had a similar um attack on refugee camp where um hundreds of Palestinians were buried under the rebble of the attack led by Shaul muas at the time the head of the Israeli Army Army um in in Refugee in Jan refugee camp so today uh they wants to the Israeli government wants to send a message that no one is immune the entire Palestinian people are a Target and uh that they're going that it's not only happening in Gaza it's also happening in the West Bank which goes to the larger vision and larger objectives of the Israeli government of to depopulate these areas from their own on citizens and uh to control to be in control um of the uh of the West Bank the West Bank there has been uh resistance armed resistance in many places so it the Israeli Army wants to send a message that we're here we have the upper hand we're able to access to these areas that these areas by the way that they shouldn't be there according to the oso Accord because this is the responsibility of the Palestinian Authority exactly so it undermined the presence the strength and the control of the Palestinian Authority in these areas and became less effective and irrelevant actually to the security situation right and the Israeli Army acts with impunity and we're now seeing these reports of this US citizen who's been killed who was shot in the head during the protest anti setler protest thank you uh two major points here to remember one is that uh there is a collective punishment that the Israeli government is sending and we seen this on camera of destroying the infrastructure um the streets and the water supplies and even the closest allies of Israel like the German foreign minister said uh commented on this saying that self-defense doesn't mean destruction of infrastructure engine or the Water Supplies of that so so it's clear even to the closest Protectors of the Israeli government uh the German for Minister as for for the American activist this is also not the first time unfortunately we have many several examples in the past of Peace activist we have Rashel huri that was killed by Israel 20 years ago that was crushed under the Israeli buildozer and until now Israel has not released any investigation or pursuing of who killed Rashel huri an American peace activist that was again crushed under the Israeli bulldozer we have also Shireen abaki Jen also an American citizen so those are American citizens in the in in the West Bank being killed by um the Israel army Shak the AL jaer journalist is an American citizen and no report no pursuing or no punishment of who killed Shireen ab and this is just one more case that actually puts the American government on the line where the American government uh always uh talking about an American citizen of also an Israeli held by Hamas but no mentioning uh of the American citizens who are killed by the Israeli government as if they're second or third class citizens in the United States right okay I we'll have to leave it there but thank you for your perspective we appreciated it Ibrahim frad here in Jud thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the
