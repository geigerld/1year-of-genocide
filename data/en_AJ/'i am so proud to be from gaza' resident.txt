You sent us aircraft carriers. With what you did, you made us proud of ourselves. I hold my head up high. The whole unjust world is conspiring against us. I am not conspiring, but by word of mouth. They sent missiles, they sent planes, they sent an aircraft carrier, they sent soldiers, they sent such-and-such, they sent an army, and they sent intelligence. Oh, Gaza is strong. I am proud that I am  From Gaza, I am proud of this country that everyone has conspired against, and despite all this, the world is conspiring against us, and I help and sell planes, tanks, and missiles, tools of oppression. Oh, I am proud to say, and raise my head high, that I am from a region that one day the whole world will conspire against, and the whole world will war against it.
