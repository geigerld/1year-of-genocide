Luis Moreno comple thank you so much for joining us on up front my pleasure my he very frustrating what happened hamas's October 7th attack and Israel's subsequent bombardment of Gaza uh have both been met with accusations of genocide and ethnic cleansing and various other war crimes uh but before we get into the specifics of these accusations I wanted to ask you if you could first sort of briefly Define what constitutes a war crime well War crime are basically defined by the Geneva Convention and now by the Roman statute and they basically they are limits how soldiers could behave during a war that is a war crime then you have another type of crimes crimes against humanity and genocide crimes against humanity is a widespread or systematic attack against the civilian population and that why the the Hamas attack is a crimes against humanity but in addition you have a specific crime genocide genocide is an attack is a crime to destroy an EIC religious or russal group and I believe that's important because the genocide is a convention and is the convention requiring the states part is to prevent genocide that's why genocide is so important because it's the only crime of these crimes that they have this obligation not just for not to commit the crimes there are 153 States parties of the genocide convention including us and Russia and all almost all of the countries uh who are committed to prevent and panish genocide that's why genocide is so important uh how about ethnic cleansing uh some some people have argued that what's happening in Gaz is ethnic cleansing how do you define that ethnic cleansing ethnic cleansing like a poem it's a poem ethnic cleansing is a nice expression but it's not a crime itself any cleansing is a warning used to avoid to define something as genocide why because if you if you a state if you are us and you say it's a genocide you have the duty to prevent if you say is that any cleansing nothing happen okay so let's let's talk about this idea of genocide um according to Palestinian Health officials as of this recording uh Israel has killed over 15,000 Palestinians around 40% of that number are children uh they've bombed hospitals schools uh refugee camps uh Israeli Army spokesperson Daniel hagari in fact openly admitted that the quote emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy and of course this is all in addition to Israel preventing ending nearly all food from coming in all fuel from coming in uh people argue that this is a form of collective punishment uh my question is is there an actual genocide taking place well let me summarize the standard should be reasonable based to believe it's very low we are not in a court of justice it's we understanding if I am persecutor I start investigation when there are reasonal basic to believe in the Hamas Israel conflict you have Hamas committing war crimes including today the hostages is a war crime crimes against humanity and the the crimes committed on October 7 in Israel and probably genocide because hmer has intention to destroy Israelis as a group then Israel reaction is also included many crimes it's complicate to identify the world crimes because each bombing need to be evaluated but there is something very clear the siege of Gaza itself that is extermination or persecution as a crime against humanity and is a form of genocide article 6 C or 2 C in the genocide convention defin that you don't need to kill people to commit genocide the the the rule say inflicting conditions to destroy the group that itself is a genocide so creating The Siege itself self is a genocide and that is very clear the Israel won The Siege is very clear and the intentions to destroy the people many officers from the Israel government are expressing genocidal intentions that why it's leasy to say and the reasonable Bas to believe Israel is committing a genocide in Gaza just on the siege then each bombing each of the killings should be properly investigated but come on we have already cleared The Siege itself is a genocide and that why this fire should not transform in a new genocide please you you talked about Hamas also uh being engaged in war crimes uh of course on October 7th they killed hundreds of Israeli civilians at a music festival they've also kidnapped civilians these included babies children the elderly the disabled I mean we can agree that Prima fascia those are war crimes no exactly Hamas October 7 is clearly a war crime you're attacking civilians it's a crime against humanity because it's a it's a it's a plan attack against civilian population and it's a genocide because the killings were intended to destroy Israeli group and that's the genocide and that why the October 7 attack is a war crime is against humanity and a genocide and reason Bas you say could you say a bit more about why this constitutes a genocide I mean some people have argued that they are engaged in an act of resistance intended not to destroy Jewish people as an ethnicity nationality or race but to defeat a nation state that is attempting to occupy them they're defeating an occupying power well I am influenced because when I was a prosecutor I was involed for three years in the Palestine Israel conflict that why it's for me so painful to see what happened today because in those days we have hopes and I remember hamama sent to me a professor working with them and he explained to me that Hamas believed Jewish people should not be in Palestine it's not just about protecting Gaza Hamas believe there should be no Jews in in in Palestine that why for them killing the the Jews in in Israel is is is part of the strategy and and that I'm sorry it's a genocide because it's a it's a it's a it's an attack taking trying to destroy a group in this case the Israelis in Palestine okay uh the Hamas Charter uh was updated as you know in 2017 this is an update from the 1988 Charter uh and in it uh they explicitly State uh Hamas affirms that its conflict is with the Zionist project not with the Jews because of their religion Hamas does not w a struggle against the Jews because they are Jewish but wage is a struggle against the zionists who occupy Palestine I'm not here to argue whether that's true or not but if we were to assume that that were true for a moment would that then nullify the argument of genocide as a legal matter well as I say I am using as a standard the the standard is not so high it's reasonable based to believe that's a standard to start an investigation and according with that standard for me the genocide should be investigated in the case of Hamas and maybe they adjusted and maybe they they now are not trying to do that but this event sound that they want to to kill these people to remove the to expel the the Israeli people from the land so that is for me that provide reason Bas to believe that a genocide I'm not saying it's a conviction because that's the point to convict one of the Hamas leader for genocide you need a proper trial you need to offer the Hamas leader the opportunity to explain his arguments and present evidence and then the judges to convict a person will have a higher standard they had to go to Beyond res doubt standard it's high standard that why I'm talking about one of the things I've also been wondering about is Palestine is a member of the ICC uh Hamas could be prosecuted for war crimes uh under that premise uh Israel however is not a signatory uh to the IC and it has not ratified the Rome statute so what jurisdiction does the IC have to investigate and or prosecute Israel well the international criminal court has jurisdiction in Gaza West Bank and East Jerusalem that was a long process started in my time and ended in 2021 the court accepted that Court the investigation have have to investigate crimes committed in Gaza West Bank and East Jerusalem that mean any crime committed in this places for any person could be mitigated by the international criminal court that's why Israel committing crimes in gasa could be investigated by criminal court and I would suggest for me even so important What's happen in Gaza which is massive is what happen in West Bank because West Bank it has more influence the Min of security of Israel and I'm shocked that this man is min of security the person with me of security is today Israel Armed Forces rejected him as a soldier because he was an extremist he a man who was investigated convicted for hate so this man an extremist settler is providing weapon to settlers and and running activities in West Bank fueling the G that's why for for me in the same way is so appealing and and awful what happened in Gaza it's incredible that in in West Bank there's no more violent because this person the me of security has influence there is providing weapons to settlers and in fact there are almost I understand more than 200 people killed so that why for me Gaza is one awful scenario but West Bank is also very important and you have to understand should he in particular be investigating should itamar bin gavier in particular be investigated for for war crimes Mr G should be investigated absolutely yes on on what he's doing providing weapon to sers is he inciting sett to violence I I read that he he was using the police to to crash the meeting of the family meeting with those who were liberated from jail and also the the incarceration there are now people incarcerated in in bank so all these activities should be mitigated and prevented and stop it in March 2023 the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin Russia however is not a signatory to the court and aside from the warrant restricting Putin's travel to countries that are signatories he's basically faced no consequences so can the ICC really do anything to prosecute non-members can anything actually be enforced well you got to understand the enforcement of the core decisions of the international coure decision H is in the hands of the states so President Putin was indicted and no no one is actively trying to arrest him but he could not he had to stop Flying to South Africa or going to Brazil because Brazil and South Africa could arrest him and in fact that happened with president bashid when I indied president bashid for General side H he went to South Africa to show his free but he had to escape because the judge from South Africa order to arrest him so there arresting is the most complicated thing but answer your first question was can I investigate W Bank crimes absolutely yes can indict people absolutely yes arresting is a different matter but my point is I is doing what it should do and it's very important but criminal law is the last resour should not be the first resour so what I what I I feel we are lacking is the commitment of the International Community including the bigger states to respect make Israel and hamama to respect the law look since September the UN advisor on prevention of genocide is alerting about five genocide ongoing in two months so that why the problem is today the state the states are not respecting the legal boundaries and we will kill civilization we are not just killing individuals in Gaza or in West Bank or in in in Armenia we are killing civilization and that why it's not just about Israelis or Armenians or theur people or TIG people in Ethiopia or rohinga in in Myanmar it's about civilization we are going to catastrophe so it's time to change the game and we need leaders not just prosecutors or judges Luis Moreno compo thank you so much for joining me on up front thank you
