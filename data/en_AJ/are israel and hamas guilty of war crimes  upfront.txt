on October 7th Hamas launched a barrage of rockets from Gaza followed by a coordinated incursion into Israel by Hamas Fighters scores of unarmed civilians were killed and many taken hostage in response to the attack Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu swore quote a mighty Vengeance against the group Israel has since retaliated with a Complete Siege of Gaza launching air strikes that raised entire districts killing hundreds and injuring thousands in the Palestinian Enclave on today's show we'll delve deep into the conflict coming up in the second half of the show we'll speak to the former deputy foreign minister for Israel and former foreign policy adviser to Netanyahu Danny Ione with us first is senior spokesperson for Hamas Osama Haman Osama Hamden senior spokesperson for Hamas thank you so much for joining me on UPF front thank you on October 7th Hamas launched an attack uh when they fired thousands of rockets into Israel uh militants entered the country and took scores of civilians hostage including women children and the elderly while the right of resistance is absolutely secured for all occupied people under international law the use of force is not unlimited and targeting civilians and taking hostages are war crimes how can you justify attacking civilian targets well thank you for having me first of all I have to say that this is the uh story from the Israeli side which is not really true I have to turn you to Oren Z who is an Israeli journalist he was today inar Aza settlement and he said there is no evidences that Hamas slaughtered children I'm sorry that the Israeli government is using that to commit its crimes in Gaza so this is this is the first part of the answer we have also some Israelis are telling this is not happened and it's used it's a St story fake story used to kill more Palestinians but this is but the question was how do you justify attacking civilian targets that was the actual question one second no no the question was how can you justify attacking civilian targets you are asking their own question no no no the asking you are asking the question we we may disagree on what the right question is but but I do want I would like you to answer this question how do you justify attacking civilian Targets this is our own question I I'm not going to the same game of the Israelis I'm asking a very clear question about civilians let let me ask a very direct question have any civilians been killed well I don't know exactly because this is what told by the Israelis what I'm telling you that for this Israeli government you just cited Orin Z he says civilians were killed no he didn't say he he said no evidence that children he were slaugh I don't know he said doz of he said dozens of bodies of Israelis murdered in their homes excuse me those were his words you are you are wasting the time it's your time it's not my time you are wasting the time all right let's pause for a moment sir my question is if you find out that civilians have been killed would you consider that justified or would you consider that unjustified there is 300 children have been killed today in Gaza by the Israelis 200 women have been killed today Day by the Israelis in Gaza 1,200 children were injured 1,000 women were injured today just today and yesterday in Gaza you are asking me the wrong question you have to ask about what is happening in Gaza which is under the siege for the last 17 years which which is under the offensive Israeli attack for the last four days you keep asking about the Israelis why you don't ask about the Palestinians a that's a fair question sir sir sir that is a fair question that excuse me I have to continue you are asking about the Israelis you don't ask about the Palestinians no one cares about the Palestinians this is the story the story is the occupation 75 years of occupation for the Palestinians we have to talk about the occupation and how the Palestinians are looking to for this occupation and how can we make an end for this incubation this is the story it's not the story about what you are asking about okay I I I understand your perspective to be clear after this interview I will be interviewing a representative of the Israeli military and I will be asking him about Israel's war crimes I absolutely acknowledge that Israel has committed war crimes in fact I have written a book with a whole chapter about Gaza and the and the war crimes that have committed against Gaza there so please do not suggest to to me that I do not take this issue seriously however however let me finish I allowed you thank you for iow you finish thank you for the clarifying but I so now that we clarify that let me let me can't compare I okay I'm not comparing any I'm not comparing anything but please allow me to finish my question for you is is is everyone living inside of a settlement a a legitimate military Target for Hamas according to the international law the settlers are not civilian so sir again uh human rights organizations have said the legal status of settlements under International uh humanitarian law does not negate the rights of the civilians living there the fact that a person lives in a settlement whether legal or not does not make him or her a legitimate military Target so getting in light of the fact that human rights organizations would argue that even if settlements are illegal the people living inside of them are still considered civilians how do you see moving forward uh hamas's vision of whether or not settlements are legitimate military targets well uh the legitimate thing which I believe in that Palestine Is Our Land our people are living on our land challenging the occupation for the last 75 years on those 75 years the women the children were killed by the Israeli Soldiers the Israeli settlers their Homeland was taken they were replaced by Israelis who came from everywhere in the world they talk different languages and they claim that this land is for them if you ask any one of them about the grave of his father he will take you to Poland or to Argentina but if you ask any Palestinian about the grave of his 17th grandfather he will take you to some place in Palestine showing you the graves telling you this is where my 17th grandfather was buried or maybe before that we are in this land from the days of Jesus Christ don't ask me about the those settlers and those soldiers who are killing my people every every day every time and this is the fact which creates the resistance of the Palestinians the Palestinians did not start the war let's talk about uh the Israeli response uh to the Hamas attack which has been horrific uh Israel is bombing R and declared a Complete Siege uh it's cut off uh food Fuel and water from being admitted to over two million people thousands of Palestinians are going to die uh one resident from Ken yunice said this is a bloody war that is different from previous Wars what is going on right now is total Annihilation we see this horrific response by the Israeli government my question for you is uh have the actions of Hamas over the past week made things worse for Palestinians on the ground the Israelis have done this before they done that in 2014 14 they they cut the electricity from Gaza in 2014 for 17 days they cut the the AIDS for the hospitals uh in 2014 2,500 Palestinians were killed in 2021 more than 1,000 Palestinians were killed no one remembers the the numbers because they are only Palestinians but I want to tell you they were shocked by what had happened to their army 11 11 points military points were attacked by the militants of Hamas the soldiers were killed or being taken as War prisoners and the Israelis were shocked this is the main troops attacking Gaza for the last 10 years they fall down in a few hours this is the shook they want to get back the image of Israel army they want to show everyone that Israel can destroy everyone that's an interesting point sir that's that's an important Point you're making you're saying that Israel uh sort of commits to a certain kind of response when it looks bad that Israel responds disproportionately and that Israel already wants to use uh this as a pretext for destroying the Palestinian people I'm saying if you know that's going to happen then how do you calculate the decision to launch an attack knowing that a University is going to be bombed knowing that power is going to be cut off knowing that fuel's going to be cut off knowing that people are going to die because of the Israeli response if you know that why do you still make the uh the attack particularly when the Palestinian people don't have a say in whether or not that's going to happen this is a good question you know uh the fact that the Israelis are killing the Palestinians on all the ways all the times for example in W Bank in the last 10 months more than 500 Palestinians were killed most of them were civilians they were shooted in the streets just demonstrating peacefully against the Israeli troops the fact which everyone have to understand is that this occupation is killing the Palestinians all the time he's not giving them any chance to have normal life he's not giving them the chance to be independent and to have their independent sovereign state even after 30 years of s signature of Oso agreement he's not implementing any International resolutions he doesn't care about the international law so we are uh facing this fact the Israelis are killing you if you are treat treating them peacefully or if you are resisting them and at the end of the day the occupation is still there so it's better to resist than being slaughtered daily without even resisting the occupation what was the goal of last week's actions what was the what was the immediate goal of last week's actions what what would you say the Target or goal was the goal the goal the the goal is to make an end for the Israeli attacks against the Palestinians to make an end for the Israeli attacks on Jerusalem ala in West Bank taking over the lands and to lift the SI on Gaza the Israelis are planning for a long a long occupation on Palestine and I think if they don't get the lesson from what had happened the last four days this Army will not protect them their violence will not protect them even if they were supported by the United States if they want to be protected they have to acknowledge the Palestinian rights and to implement the international resolutions which gave the Palestinian people their rights without negotiations those are rights no one can negotiate our rights thank you so much for joining me on up front thank you we tried repeatedly to get an Israeli Army spokesperson on the show to respond to Hamas but they canceled the scheduled interviews for more on the developments in Gaza we are joined by Israel's former deputy foreign minister and a former foreign policy adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Danny Ione Danny Ione thank you so much for joining me on UPF front my pleasure Danny last Saturday the 7th Hamas launched a devastating attack thousands of rockets were fired towards Israel and hundreds of Hamas Fighters crossed into the country uh there are reports of horrific killings of Israeli civilians a clear clear violation of international law uh in response uh Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened to turn the Gaza Strip into quote rubble and the government announced a quote Complete Siege of The Enclave since then we've seen Mass bombing in Gaza with reports that hundreds of civilians have been killed and while the actions of Hamas are a clear and I want to emphasize that a clear violation of international law isn't the collective punishment of all gazin also by definition a war crime not really because the situation is very clear you know as you mentioned rightly so Hamas perpetrated a um an attack which was a surprise attack the IDF was caught un on unprepared and they got a major victory for the first 24 hours but who was this Victory against babies and children and all families that were massacred in bed the IDF was nowhere to be seen when the IDF came back now they push them back into the Gaza now the problem with Hamas is that they're committing a double um War crime because they are targeting only slovenians and they're using their own civilians the poor Palestinian of Gaza as human Shields and what Israel did gave them a fair warning and I think this is the only way to do with them is we told the uh the gazan people to clear the area temporarily so we can go and take Kamas out and then of course they can come back so this by the definition is not a war crime we understand the plight of the Palestinians they deserve their dignity and everything else but nothing justifies butchering families you know this day as you mentioned 7th of October was the day that more Jews were killed in 24 hours than any other day since the Holocaust so you see I mean without without without question respectfully this this is a devastating uh moment uh an extraordinary act of violence that that again is a violation of international law but you said a couple of things that that I want to push that I want to push you on uh the idea of collective punishment is one of the things that we're talking about here uh electricity has been cut power has been cut fuel has been cut the the gazen people right now are being punished for the actions of Hamas how is that not by definition Collective punishment two two things uh first of all Hamas has turned Gaza into an enemy state so there is no law nothing in international law that uh uh compels a country you are uh in in a war with to supply them the the electricity now what do they use the electricity for as as as an OCC as an as an occupying power international law does say that you have certain responsibilities by law uh but but but but before we get there even if we we'll hold it for a moment the power thing uh there are residential buildings being hit there are hospitals being hit this is a densely populated area the idea of being able to run away or to escape or go to a safe area seems impossible also according to your own military uh Representatives you've abandoned the idea of knocking on rofes that is say to say giving uh a warning of dropping a non- explosive munition on buildings before people go so people aren't getting a warning they have nowhere to go residential buildings schools and hospitals are being hit how is this not again an act of collective punishment and how is this not a target of Civilian unless of course you're regarding everybody in Gaza as an enemy combatant okay well I hear you I hear you but again what we gave the population is a fair warning what would you do you know what what was the is the fair warning this I just want to make sure we're on the same page here uh Benjamin Netanyahu told everyone to leave the area where were they to go okay very very I mean this was this is thought out it's not something that we tell them go uh go to the beaches go drawn yourselves God forbid not at all there is a huge expense almost endless space in the Sinai desert just on the other side of Gaza the idea is and this is not the first time it will be done the idea is for them to live over to the open areas where we and the International Community will uh prepare the infrastructure you know 10 cities with food and with water you know what just like for the refugees of Syria that fled the butchering of Assad few years ago to Turkey Turkey received two million of them this is the idea now Egypt will have to play ball here because once the the population is out of sight then we can go you know what the pal what the what Hamas did you know when the you said the population out of sight is that practically possible in such a densely populated area and and 40 I mean you have 2 million people in a densely populated Enclave 47% of the inhabitants are children is it reasonable or plausible to to think that all those people are going to relocate to this ex excluded area and be safe from from from a bombing attack and again the war we're saying there's warnings but there are numerous reports on the ground that there are no warnings that people are getting hit that families have been killed from these attacks uh I'll tell you in a practical manner what we should do and what we can do create like in the past in history a humanitarian Corridor when there is a humanitarian Corridor and we have been discussing this with the United States uh then we can guarantee in this Corridor that nobody will get hurt now again I say there is a way to receive them all on the other side for temporary time on on S because what did Hamas turn out on the other side we talking about RAF are you the other side that go to Egypt yes absolutely absolutely and Egypt will have to play ball because this is human life is at stake if something human life is at stake because you're cutting off power you're you're shutting down hospitals you're bombing residential buildings right now there is a hospital that has not does not have sufficient power there is a hospital where people are literally going to die and israeli's energy uh Minister uh Israel cat said said no electrical switch will be turned on no hydrant will be open no fuel truck will enter until the Israeli abductees are returned home now the icrc spokesperson Hisham Mahana said that by cutting that power hospitals are going to turn into graveyards this is not an ideologue this is the international Committee of the Red Cross they're saying that because of your country's actions not the actions of Hamas not the actions of Egypt but because of Israel's actions the graveyards how is that not a war crime how is that defensible by any standard first of all the war crime if anything is Hamas they are the ones and I know exactly what you're talking about Hamas does not allow sometimes when they can they keep those civilians captive they don't allow them to run away because this is what they want now I know the area and I'm I suppose you're talking about the main hospital which is the shifa hospital the shifa hospital has been turned into to a Hamas bunker if Hamas wants to save them they should just leave their arms come out and nothing will happen but as long as they keep the shifa hospital just like uh schools and kindergartens as bunkers and they fight out from there there is no law there is no law in this universe that protects them and this is what we're doing and this is why the world is is is there are there any independent reports are there any intelligence reports that show that the shifer hospital is it is is it h is primarily Hamas bunker and not an actual medical site yes and you know what where you know where and mark my words and and you can show it again because I know it's it's recorded when this war is over and we will bring in the international press to shifa and to all the bankers the underground tunnels that Hamas is created in Gaza ask intelligence Services of every country in the world they know it but anyway what I'm saying is no no no just to be clear for the audience's benefit no intelligence Services has claimed that not one government has claimed that the shifer hospital is a is a Hamas bunker that is your claim and I want to make be very clear that that is your claim and you're saying you don't have any reports but that I should just trust you no Mark your words trust you and later on it'll prove be proven true I'm telling you everybody will see okay after the war is fair enough I have I have to move on just in the interest of time but but I want I want to continue on the same vein because the Secretary General of the UN Antonio gutterz said that he was deeply distressed by Israel Israel's announcement of a Siege on the Gaza Strip he said that the humanitarian situation quote will only deteriorate exponentially and that crucial life-saving supplies including fuel food and water must be allowed into Gaza so the UN is saying You must do this you are saying you're not going to do this um how do no we're not we're not saying that he's saying do he's saying doing it immediately what I'm saying is what you what you doing he's saying doing do do it immediately I yeah I got you I'll tell you exactly what we're saying I'm saying we will do everything for the gazan people once and now we demand immediate surrender unconditional surrender of Kamas if Hamas people come out with their hands up and clear their weapons believe me everything will be restored to Gaza it is Hamas in Hamas hands okay now I understand thank you for clarifying that sir I I I think I think I think we're actually on the same page here you're saying that once Hamas leaves you'll you'll Grant the the the guys and people food shelter fuel electricity Hospital schooling and if they don't and if Hamas doesn't leave then they'll continue to starve and die in hospitals you are defining for the International Community right now Collective punishment you're saying until until Hamas acts differently the two million people in Gaza are going to be treated this way and once Hamas acts differently these two million people in Gaza will be treated better that is exactly what Collective punishment is you're holding them accountable for the actions of others that is the definition the textbook definition of of of collective punishment sir now you may you you may accept that that's what you want to do but this is absolutely a contravention of international law well I'll tell you exactly no had we had no if we had we pushed into the wall not pushing them to the wall we want to open a humanitarian Corridor so they can leave but if Hamas so that who can leave so that who can leave citizens you're saying civilians can leave but only through the Rafa border correct at this point yes so they can't where isse your country they can come into Israel I'm telling you one more thing I want to say I want you to I want you to address that point don't just smile sir respectfully you're saying they you're making a corridor they can go to they can go to Egypt you're bombing them you say you want to save them but you they can't come in first of all I'm not smiling I'm crying in my heart I'm crying in my heart for All The Butchery of thousands of Israelis why do you think the world is with us why why do you think the world is wise all the international media was there so don't talk to me about Collective punishment don't talk to me about humanitarian these are new rules of the game there is no coexistence with Hamas which is worse than Isis and we will not stop we are allowing the population to leave but if Hamas will surrender there won't be any problem whatsoever Danny alone thank you so much for joining me on up front pleasure all right that is our show up front we'll be back next [Music]
