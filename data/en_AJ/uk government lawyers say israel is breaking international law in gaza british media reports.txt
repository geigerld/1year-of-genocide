now the British government has reportedly received advice from its own lawyers that Israel has breached International humanitarian law in Gaza but it has failed to disclose this publicly for more on this let's speak to Jeffrey nice who's a human rights lawyer who prosecuted former Serbian leader Slobodan milosovic and he joining us from Canterbury thank you very much for your time so the lawyers of the British government themselves according to this report have told it that Israel is breaking international law but they haven't make this public are you surprised at all uh first of all by by this Revelation first of all I'm not full surprised that the government would seek advice from its lawyers it would have to do so as soon as it became public that many commentators more important many people in Authority in the United Nations were concerned about Israel's military uh attack not being proportionate proportionality is what's required for an attack to be lawful so they were bound to seek legal advice given the of opinion not the fact that they've ignored it would seem this advice is that surprising is that unusual can can you repeat the question please the fact that they received this advice from their own lawyers but it would seem have chosen to ignore it is that unusual is that surprising we don't know that yet we have I have not seen the advice this is a report which refers to an an an account of the advice let us assume first of all there would be an advice would the advice deal with the question of proportionality and lawfulness of the attack yes it would is there is the advice likely to have found that there could be or was lack of proportionality and therefore criminality it certainly could have reached that conclusion given the majority opinion among those not me but people close to the war and with real Authority from the United Nations and elsewhere would be unsurprising if the advice gave that conclusion if the advice did did give that conclusion and if the government acted without regard to that advice that would be very concerning not just to those who are lawyers acting in an international environment but it' be very concerning to the public The public's interest in this war has been very substantially aroused emot not that emotions are very valuable but emotions are pretty high and the public is in would like to know and I would say is entitled to know what the advice said this way or that way right so concerning you say what about the legal implications of this by continuing to sell arms to Israel is the British government complicit in in the crimes that are being committed and and you know if if the ca if it is the case could there also be then a case against against the British government at an international Court yeah if any government has received clear advice What's Happening by the combatant party is unlawful then in providing weapons for an unlawful activity it runs the risk of being found to be complicit might it get round that risk by saying oh well you can have these weapons but you can only use them in certain circumstances difficult and we understand from the latest alleged provision of Arms by America it's not using that get out clause so yes there is a real risk that a government providing arms to a party engaged in unlawful Warfare could find itself complicit that's not very surprising if you know your neighbor is about to commit a crime and wants a gun and you hand them the gun well of course you're guilty with the neighbor you can't get out of it so it's a it's a big problem for governments right and what and I think yeah go on go on please finish your thought and then I'll ask you the next question well I think what's going to be interesting is to see whether these sorts of concerns are going to be resolved by publishing the advice received by governments not just our government America and all other governments involved in provision of arms and who knows they are the advice may may solve the problem but if it doesn't solve the problem or if the advice is not published what's going to be the next step when as one is bound to hope the whole matter is eventually uh laid before an international Court of some kind to deal with criminality of both sides Hamas and uh the Israeli Defense Force which is what the public at large would want well you may find that governments the big powerful governments will try and stop those legal proceedings there's a lot to play for here right and presumably Mr Nice if British lawyers are making these conclusions other law ERS in other countries must also have had the the same advice probably to their governments you talked about possible legal proceedings at the international level what about at the local at the national level could they be cases at the national level against the UK for example well there might be I suppose um but that's a bit of a stretch because you've got to have an appropriate jurisdiction that can deal with the government which is not that easy whereas the international court for example can bring in individuals who are responsible and maybe the international court of justice can look if if genocide is alleged and shown in any way at governments but I think um what what's really interesting and important over all is that all countries developed countries will have obtained advice from their lawyers about the legality of what's Happening in Israel if their governments are involved on either side in the provision of arms to to one side or the other it's pretty clear that hamas's use of arms has been unlawful because they've been firing unarmed rockets at civilian areas something very difficult to justify and they've also been engaged in the horrifying along with maybe other groups yes no it's let me just finish on the 7th of October so governments on either side will will have who are possibly involved will have obtained legal advice and in each in all cases we the public you and I the world citizen need to know what the advice has been Jeffrey nice thank you very much for talking to us as always very good to get your Insight Jeffrey nice is a human rights lawyer joining us there from Canterbury
