and I have just left the warm we set where decisions are made on Israel Security on our most sensitive interests I brief the secretary on strategic developments in our region and the chief of staff together with the IDF leadership shared our our operations defense coroporation and US support in the Pentagon in the White House in the Congress ensure freedom of operation and enforce our capabilities in fact today we will receive the second aircraft carrying essential munition to the us deployment of assets on land in air and at Sea sends a strong message on to both our partners and enemies in the region on behalf of Israel's defense establishment and of be on behalf of our citizens Mr secretary thank you very much let me remind you all our audience who is the enemy our neighbors is Hamas the Isis of Gaza an organization enjoying the Iranian payroll I cannot let the world forget the brutal attacks Hamas terrorists conduct against Israeli children Israeli women Israeli eldery and entire families murder rape kidnapping this is what we face in this war this is a war on the existence of Israel as a prosperous State as a democratic State as the homeland of the Jewish people this is a war on freedom and on our common values and we are on the front line we will keep fighting and we will win this war we will prevail with your permission Mr secretary I'll say few words in you're watching Al we're bringing you live of a press conference that's happening in Tel Aviv between Israel's defense minister y Gant who's just been speaking there talking in Hebrew for the latter part of his statement earlier on he was referring to the the fact that us support was insuring ensuring freedom to operate for the Israeli military he said that they would receive a second aircraft carrying essential equipment to the Israeli military we're going to go to V Marx who live for us in Tel Aviv we are waiting for us defense secretary uh Lloyd Austin to speak uh villm clearly uh uh you have Galant there making it very plain that they are relying on us support and as far as he's concerned the US is firmly behind Israel in this yeah and echoing Rob very much what prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday comparing Hamas to Isis talking about the support that they allege uh h Mass has been receiving from the Iranian government that second aircraft arriving he said will likely also contain further Munitions the first aircraft arriving focused on essentially bolstering the capabilities of Israel's Iron Dome system we know that US Special Operations teams are already working with some of their Israeli counterparts on both intelligence and planning strategy planning for a potential ground incursion and other operations ongoing inside Gaza really interesting to hear what Lloyd Austin will have say when it comes to the deterrence efforts that the United States has already tried to put in place very soon after those attacks began on Saturday President Biden ordering at least six US Naval vessels to the Eastern Mediterranean including an aircraft carrier and many guided missile Cruisers and destroyers along with dozens of different aircraft that have been rebasing all over air bases in the region part of an effort they made very clear the Americans to try and deter both non-state and state actors that would be groups like Hezbollah governments like Iran in their words from interfering in this current crisis both linkoln and Biden previously saying they had one word for those considering that kind of interference don't Rob vill just while we're waiting for Lloyd Austin to speak and he may be speaking fairly in fact I think he Lloyd Austin has begun speaking now let's listen to Lloyd Austin we'll come back to you close touch but it's good to see you again in person and it's good to be back in Israel even during such terrible days as a US Secretary of Defense I am here in person to make something Crystal Clear America's support for Israel is Ironclad and I extend my deepest condolences to the Israeli people for those killed or wounded in this terrible Slaughter by Hamas I'm also here in solidarity with all the family still living the waking nightmare of not knowing the fate of their loved ones and we will continue to coordinate closely with Israel to help secure the release of the innocent men women and children in the clutches of amas including American citizens now Israel is a small country a place where everybody knows everybody and in times of trial the intimacy of your Society deepens the intimacy of your grief but that's not a weakness it is a profound strength and in times of testing Israelis know what to do over this awful week we've seen Israeli hotels and homes Tak in those who've had to to flee we've seen long lineups to donate blood we've seen whatsapps explode with messages as people raced to support Neighbors in anguish and per perhaps because I'm a retired General I was especially moved by the story of a retired General named Noam T-Bone his son called him on Saturday from his home near Gaza to say that Hamas terrorists had stormed their caboots and were closing in and the retired General jumped into his car in Tel Aviv and raced toward the combat zone he linked up with other Fighters and rescued his son his daughter-in-law and his granddaughters and when the general arrived at their house one of his granddaughters just said Grandpa's here and these are arrays of Hope in a terrible week and in times like these Sometimes the best that a a the best thing that a friend can do is just to show up and to get to work now this is no time for neutrality or for false equivalence or for excuses for the inexcusable there is never any justification for terrorism and that's especially true after the this Rampage by Hamas and anyone who wants lasting peace and security for this region must condemn and isolate Hamas Hamas does not speak for the Palestinian people or their legitimate hopes for dignity security and statehood and peace along side Israel as a former commander of Central Command the deliberate cruelty of Hamas vividly reminds me of Isis bloodthirsty fanatical and hateful and like Isis Hamas has nothing to offer but zealotry bigotry and death the world has just witnessed a great evil the deadliest attacks on civilians in the history of the state of Israel and the bloodiest day in Jewish history since the end of the Holocaust so make no mistake the United States will make sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself and Israel has a right to protect its people you know and there are many phone calls this week President Biden has told prime minister Netanyahu that the United States would also respond swiftly and decisively to such a ma massive terrorist assault and the President also underscored that democracies like ours are stronger and more secure when we uphold the laws of war terrorists like Hamas deliberately Target civilians but democracies don't this is a time for resolve and not revenge for purpose and not panic and for security and not surrender at President Biden's direction we have moved urgently to respond to this crisis and to send to send a strong message M of deterrence the USS Gerald R Ford carrier strike group is now in the region led by the largest aircraft carrier in the world we've augmented us fighter aircraft squadrons in the Middle East and the US Department of Defense stands fully ready to deploy additional assets if necessary as President Biden has said for any country for any group or anyone thinking about trying to take advantage of this atrocity to try to widen the conflict or to spill more blood we have just one word don't the world is watching and so are we and we aren't going anywhere we will remain in close contact with our valued Partners across the region and security assistance from the Department of Defense is already rapidly flowing into Israel that includes Munitions and air defense capabilities and other equipment and resources it also includes more interceptors for Iron Dome to save israeli's Li Israeli lives and we will continue to ensure that Israel has what it needs to keep itself secure now Hamas attacked at a time of global challenge but the United States is the most powerful country in the world and we remain fully able to project power and uphold our commitments and direct resources to multiple theaters so we will stand with Israel even as we stand with Ukraine United States can walk in chug gum at the same time and US SEC security assistance to Israel will flow in at the speed of war and as this harrowing week draws to a close and as Shabbat draws near we stand together and we stand strong United States has Israel's back and that is not negotiable and it never will be and after this terrible week I wish you and all the people of Israel shabbat shalom thank you we'll be starting with the question starting with Alon B Channel 13 thank you uh Mr secretary um your presence in the Eastern Mediterranean clearly projects power but should Israel be attacked from the north from hisbah in Lebanon will you be willing to exercise your force and join the fighting you I ordered additional assets to the region to bolster deterrence and again the message that we would send to any country or group thinking to take advantage of this situation and white and widen the conflict don't I won't speculate on on anything that could happen in the future I will just tell you clearly that the United States will continue to support Israel's right to defend itself please a question to the defense make sure that this threat will never be there on our borders and we will be ready quite ready for ABC thank you both for doing this secretary Austin the US Administration has told Israel to avoid causing civilian casualties and to uphold what you called just now the laws of war given how Hamas fights deliberately launching operations from dense civilian areas how could Israel permanently end the terrorist threat posed by Hamas without inevitably risking many civilian lives and as we watch the civilian death toll in Gaza rise while Israel conducts its counterattacks and perhaps a ground invasion do you believe the moral culpability for those Palestinian deaths belongs to Israel Hamas or both I'll leave it to Israel to uh to talk about its potential plans and uh its approach to uh conducting operations uh Matt I'll just uh um say again that Israel has a right to defend itself and we will support Israel's right to defend itself we will continue to flow and security assistance and I've worked with Israeli forces over the years over many years as you know I wore a uniform for 41 years my experience in working with the Israeli forces is they are professional they're disciplined and they are focused on the right things and so I expect that uh going forward they will continue to exhibit that same degree of professionalism that we've seen in the past but but you know Matt we've seen this before uh the International Community fought Isis uh who in some cases was uh was embedded deeply in builtup areas and that International Coalition uh fought Valiant and and protected civilians and created corridors for uh humanitarian uh movement even in the midst of a of a pretty significant fight so again this is a professional Force it is well-led and I I have every expectation that it will be disciplined thank you and for Minister Gant have you seen evidence that Iran was directly involved in planning or executing the recent attack on your country or any signs that either Iran or its proxies are seeking to exploit the situation and if you do come to see signs of an imminent attack on Israel are you in favor of preemptive strikes Iran balah and Hamas is one axis an axis of Evil everything is directed generally from Iran the permission is given by Iran the money is supplied by Iran and the ideas are shaped in Iran therefore it doesn't matter if they give or didn't give the permission but the idea is an Iranian idea as to the actions future actions of IDF I will uh stay confidential for good reasons thank youan Mas Mr secretary thank you for this um house um Foreign Affairs shair Mike m said that we know that Egypt had warned Israel 3 days prior to that event like something like this could happen we don't know how we missed it we don't know how Israel missed it so can you tell us what really the US knew before attack what I can tell you is that if we had known or if we know of a pending attack against an ally we would clearly inform that Ally uh but what we're focused on now Solomon is we're f focused on making sure that Israel has what it needs to defend its Sovereign territory and to protect its citizens and the minister and I spent uh a good bit of time talking today about what those requirements are and what we need to do to urgently meet those we concentrate for the time being to follow my instructions and to achieve Victory and to defeat Hamas as I said before this is the decision now we will achieve the Victory and we will beat Hamas last question from Tom secretary thanks for doing this Mr secretary as you just stated you were involved in the major effort to Stomp and eradicate Isis when you talk to the minister and others and that experience courses through you what kind of Lessons Learned do you feel or might be helpful in this case especially dealing with that whole Urban situation that you just referred to the proposed the evacuation of civilians from Gaza those kind of challenges what kind of ideas and thoughts that you have that you can share please well thanks Tom I would tell you that um encountering Isis I felt as if we were staring evil in the eye it was truly evil and what we've seen from Hamas uh it takes that evil to another level and so uh that's the first thing that we need to we need to remember and and consider there are a number of things that uh that we talked about today that you there are some lessons learned that we we be more than happy to share with our our allies here uh in in terms of operating effectively in uh in dense Urban Terrain creating uh safe humanitarian corridors uh making sure that we're thoughtful about how we shape the battle uh and making sure that uh you know our objectives are well defined uh and uh and so um we'll we'll continue to share uh the lessons that we've learned over the years and of course as the Israelis prosecute this fight uh we will learn lessons from them and so I I think it's this great uh teamwork that has served us both well o over the years and we'll continue that Mr Minister uh there's been some confusion over the 24-hour deadline that Israel announced to for civilians in Gaza to to move South to evacuate and move South uh there was a 24-hour deadline initially reported and then there's been reports that Israel has modified that have left it open in other words not sticking to 24 hours of a deadline would you please clarify specifically is there going to be a deadline what can you tell us about the deadline and what will Israel do if anything to help civilians move some of the people have said that's homicide problem it's not our problem well first of all I would like to remind all of us what happened less than a week ago 1200 Israelis were brutally murdered raped burned alive kids were tied one to the other and shot at the hand this is Hamas this is the Isis of Gaza and as secretary said they took evil to another level that's first issue second Israel never and ever will not shoot civilians in purpose therefore we are asking all the civilians in Gaza City to go south of Gaza and the reason is that because we don't want to have them the common flash of the terrorist is the Civil population therefore we need to separate them so those who want to save their life please go south we are going to destroy Hamas infrastructures Hamas headquarters Hamas military establishment and take this phenomena out of Gaza and out of the they cannot live among human civilized people but 24 hours is that deadline still holding the 24 hours thank you very much we're done today thank you hi you're watching Al ja we're bringing you a a press conference from Tel Aviv between us defense secretary Lloyd Austin and the man who was speaking at just at the end there Israeli defense minister yov Gand they covered a lot of ground uh in that very long uh press conference but predominantly the message was that the US is standing behind Israel following the attack by Hamas uh us defense secretary Lloyd Austin saying American support for Israel is uh iron clad he said that Israel's um this was a time of neutrality he said and not false equivalence they also both made comparisons between Hamas and Isis also known as isil saying that Hamas was essentially the same as Isis as I say also known as Isis Lloyd Austin said this was a time for resolve and not Revenge they also went into some of the background Logistics that the US was going to be offering uh to Israel in its fight we're joined by Abdullah alari and he's associate professor of history at the Middle East at Georgetown University in in Qatar he's been here with us as this press conference has been uh going on it's quite clear that the US is determined to show that it it stands uh full for square if you like behind Israel nevertheless it is in a kind of difficult situation in one sense isn't it because it wasn't long ago that we were talking about the abrham Accords and the growing closeness if you like between Israel and for example Saudi Arabia a normalization um as it's called of relations with with the Arab world um given everything that's happened where do you think that stands now well I mean I think that policy was based on a certain logic that the Palestinian uh plight could be completely ignored by the US by Israel and increasingly among all of these Arab states who have made the choice to normalize I think the events of the last week uh have shown that you simply can't ignore the plight of millions of people who are either besieged or under under direct military occupation or um the threat of settler violence and who are having their land appropriated and are being denied their rights and so forth I think what we're seeing now uh you know we have to be really clear about the fact that the United States is now offering full-throated support uh for a state who is currently engaged in the killing of civilians we've seen over 500 children in Gaza killed we're seeing the targeting of First Responders we've seen that the UN workers who are there on the ground are being killed journalists are being killed um and so I think the idea that the United States is is still continuing to offer the support also at a time when the government is not just openly you know some of its members are openly threatening uh genocidal intentions but are actually poised in a position to do so and I think this threat against 1.1 million people in the north of the country brings back Echo to the founding of Israel all the way back 75 years ago when so many people uh were displaced I mean just to give you a sense of the of the kind of comparison at that point it was 750,000 Palestinians who were forced from their own land now we're talking about 1.1 million people and doing it in in 24 hours not in a in a span of one year which is what originally occurred let's not forget also that 70% of the population of Gaz are either Direct surviv of the nakba from 1948 or their descendants and so we're talking about also Refugee population that has already been displaced at least once uh in the course of their lifetimes and so I think what we're seeing um just in the last day has been a a really terrifying escalation abdulla thank you very much we're going to leave it there for the moment Aran thank you very much indeed for your time
