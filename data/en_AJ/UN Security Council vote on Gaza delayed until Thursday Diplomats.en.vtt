00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
there's really two key Parts there's a
 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.229 align:start position:0%
there's really two key Parts there's a

suspension of hostilities that was the
 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.430 align:start position:0%
suspension of hostilities that was the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
first issue that the US was kind of
 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.550 align:start position:0%
first issue that the US was kind of
grappling<00:02:15.000><c> with</c><00:02:15.319><c> would</c><00:02:15.560><c> they</c><00:02:15.879><c> accept</c><00:02:16.319><c> that</c>

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
grappling with would they accept that
 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.750 align:start position:0%
grappling with would they accept that
and<00:02:16.680><c> the</c><00:02:16.840><c> second</c><00:02:17.200><c> is</c><00:02:17.360><c> now</c><00:02:17.560><c> this</c><00:02:18.000><c> monitoring</c>

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
and the second is now this monitoring
 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.030 align:start position:0%
and the second is now this monitoring
mechanism<00:02:19.319><c> We</c><00:02:19.480><c> Believe</c><00:02:19.920><c> could</c><00:02:20.080><c> be</c><00:02:20.200><c> a</c><00:02:20.360><c> point</c><00:02:20.840><c> of</c>

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
mechanism We Believe could be a point of
 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.309 align:start position:0%
mechanism We Believe could be a point of
contention<00:02:21.640><c> in</c><00:02:21.760><c> the</c><00:02:22.319><c> uh</c><00:02:22.440><c> draft</c><00:02:22.760><c> resolution</c><00:02:23.200><c> it</c>

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
contention in the uh draft resolution it
 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.190 align:start position:0%
contention in the uh draft resolution it
calls<00:02:23.560><c> for</c><00:02:23.680><c> a</c><00:02:23.840><c> monitoring</c><00:02:24.319><c> mechanism</c>

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
calls for a monitoring mechanism
 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.990 align:start position:0%
calls for a monitoring mechanism
essentially<00:02:25.720><c> in</c><00:02:25.879><c> short</c><00:02:26.239><c> what</c><00:02:26.360><c> that</c><00:02:26.519><c> means</c><00:02:26.800><c> is</c>

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
essentially in short what that means is
 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.630 align:start position:0%
essentially in short what that means is
it<00:02:27.160><c> would</c><00:02:27.360><c> mean</c><00:02:28.000><c> empower</c><00:02:28.599><c> the</c><00:02:28.760><c> United</c><00:02:29.239><c> Nations</c>

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
it would mean empower the United Nations
 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.869 align:start position:0%
it would mean empower the United Nations
uh<00:02:31.120><c> uh</c><00:02:31.280><c> to</c><00:02:31.640><c> facilitate</c><00:02:32.519><c> the</c><00:02:32.720><c> entry</c><00:02:33.120><c> of</c><00:02:33.400><c> Aid</c>

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 align:start position:0%
uh uh to facilitate the entry of Aid
 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.270 align:start position:0%
uh uh to facilitate the entry of Aid
into<00:02:34.360><c> Gaza</c><00:02:35.319><c> and</c><00:02:35.519><c> then</c><00:02:36.000><c> facilitate</c><00:02:36.680><c> its</c>

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
into Gaza and then facilitate its
 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.869 align:start position:0%
into Gaza and then facilitate its
distribution<00:02:38.280><c> essentially</c><00:02:38.959><c> taking</c><00:02:39.480><c> power</c>

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 align:start position:0%
distribution essentially taking power
 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.949 align:start position:0%
distribution essentially taking power
away<00:02:40.280><c> from</c><00:02:40.480><c> the</c><00:02:40.599><c> Israelis</c><00:02:41.200><c> on</c><00:02:41.400><c> that</c><00:02:41.640><c> part</c>

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 align:start position:0%
away from the Israelis on that part
 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.790 align:start position:0%
away from the Israelis on that part
there<00:02:42.560><c> so</c><00:02:43.239><c> clearly</c><00:02:43.840><c> the</c><00:02:43.959><c> US</c><00:02:44.360><c> has</c><00:02:44.519><c> some</c>

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
there so clearly the US has some
 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.350 align:start position:0%
there so clearly the US has some
problems<00:02:45.200><c> with</c><00:02:45.400><c> this</c><00:02:46.159><c> and</c><00:02:46.280><c> if</c><00:02:46.360><c> you're</c><00:02:46.560><c> asking</c>

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
problems with this and if you're asking
 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.430 align:start position:0%
problems with this and if you're asking
yourself<00:02:48.360><c> why</c><00:02:48.560><c> this</c><00:02:48.680><c> is</c><00:02:48.879><c> important</c><00:02:49.280><c> is</c>

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
yourself why this is important is
 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.790 align:start position:0%
yourself why this is important is
because<00:02:49.720><c> the</c><00:02:49.840><c> US</c><00:02:50.159><c> can</c><00:02:50.319><c> veto</c><00:02:50.800><c> this</c><00:02:51.400><c> and</c><00:02:51.519><c> then</c><00:02:51.640><c> it</c>

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 align:start position:0%
because the US can veto this and then it
 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.030 align:start position:0%
because the US can veto this and then it
would<00:02:52.239><c> uh</c><00:02:52.519><c> stop</c><00:02:52.879><c> any</c><00:02:53.080><c> further</c><00:02:53.400><c> movement</c><00:02:53.879><c> on</c>

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
would uh stop any further movement on
 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.589 align:start position:0%
would uh stop any further movement on
this<00:02:54.239><c> resolution</c><00:02:54.800><c> of</c><00:02:54.959><c> course</c><00:02:55.120><c> they're</c><00:02:55.319><c> one</c><00:02:55.440><c> of</c>

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
this resolution of course they're one of
 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.430 align:start position:0%
this resolution of course they're one of
five<00:02:55.760><c> countries</c><00:02:56.040><c> with</c><00:02:56.239><c> veto</c><00:02:56.640><c> Power</c><00:02:57.159><c> number</c>

five countries with veto Power number
 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.869 align:start position:0%
five countries with veto Power number
one<00:02:57.680><c> but</c><00:02:57.840><c> number</c><00:02:58.159><c> two</c><00:02:59.159><c> why</c><00:02:59.319><c> are</c><00:02:59.519><c> these</c>

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 align:start position:0%
one but number two why are these
 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.190 align:start position:0%
one but number two why are these
negotiations<00:03:00.519><c> dragging</c><00:03:00.920><c> on</c><00:03:01.239><c> so</c><00:03:01.560><c> long</c><00:03:02.000><c> the</c>

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
negotiations dragging on so long the
 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.110 align:start position:0%
negotiations dragging on so long the
answer<00:03:02.519><c> is</c><00:03:02.760><c> we</c><00:03:02.959><c> believe</c><00:03:03.879><c> because</c><00:03:04.440><c> this</c><00:03:04.599><c> is</c><00:03:04.799><c> so</c>

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
answer is we believe because this is so
 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.949 align:start position:0%
answer is we believe because this is so
high-profile<00:03:06.040><c> because</c><00:03:06.400><c> the</c><00:03:06.680><c> language</c><00:03:07.319><c> is</c><00:03:07.480><c> so</c>

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 align:start position:0%
high-profile because the language is so
 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.589 align:start position:0%
high-profile because the language is so
important<00:03:08.879><c> because</c><00:03:09.200><c> it</c><00:03:09.440><c> would</c><00:03:09.760><c> is</c><00:03:10.040><c> a</c><00:03:10.200><c> binding</c>

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
important because it would is a binding
 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.149 align:start position:0%
important because it would is a binding
by<00:03:10.760><c> international</c><00:03:11.400><c> law</c><00:03:11.760><c> if</c><00:03:11.879><c> it</c><00:03:12.080><c> passes</c><00:03:12.959><c> we</c>

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 align:start position:0%
by international law if it passes we
