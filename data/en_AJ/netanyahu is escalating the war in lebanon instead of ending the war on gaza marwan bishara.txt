let's bring in Mar bashara whose outs are a senior political analyst joins us now from London following these events as well so marn as Zena was just saying Israel has been trading fire with Hezbollah across lebanon's Southern Border in parallel uh to the war in Gaza and it appears to be this kind of slow managed almost escalation yes but there's a big butt this week you get a sense that we are um at a at a turning point perhaps either there's going to be ceasefire in Gaza and end to the confrontation on the Israel Lebanese border or there's going to be continued uh war in Gaza and intensification of the War uh on Lebanon you just get that feeling that a full-fledged war on Lebanon is just a matter of time if this thing continues to escalate now yes it is important to note that while Israel and Hezbollah have been attacking military bases and Military targets the attacks on Villages the attacks on civilian population centers is also making things worse and you and you you get the feeling that they're becoming less and less indifferent about the consequences of their actions and hence if the ceasefire negotiation continue to be block and in fact it escalates in Gaza as it has been somewhat the last few days the situation on isra Lebanon borders can get quite more dangerous if a SE far did come good news for Gaza of course but would it mean would it mean that this escalation the slow escalation that we're seeing across the border with Israel and Lebanon would just be turned off at that point well at least that's what Hezbollah or Hezbollah leaders have been saying uh for the past many months is that uh the front on the Lebanese Israel borders are meant simply to relieve the uh the Gaza or the Gaza front from Israel's wrath that if only Hezbollah can draw some of some of Israel's military capacity to the north uh its capacity to inflict more and more damage with more and more confidence would be reduced so the idea of of a ceasefire in Gaza the idea of reconstruction in Gaza could certainly pave the way for uh some resp fite and potentially or normally an end to the skirmishes between Lebanon and Israel so those negotiations are continuing the Seas negotiations that is uh but it's hard to read which direction they're going we do know that Israeli negotiators have returned from Cairo back to Israel and they're returning to Cairo on Sunday it seems to me that they are uh they're digging in into the details and the details that they complicated or they like to complicate it especially the Israelis uh because for Hamas it's very simple get the hell out of Gaza get the hell out of our land you destroyed enough of our houses and universities on hospitals and kindergartens and so on so forth it's time for you to leave but for the Israelis no we're going to maintain military presence here and Military oversight there and we're going to have to be at the borders they basically want to reoccupy God albe it not flagrantly the United States has sort of tried to facilitate that for net allowing for some of his red line to creep into the so-called new bridging proposals which are as we've heard at the UN Security Council very inconsistent with the original proposal unlike what American diplomats say my sense my reading Nick and I've been saying that for a number of days all the Ducks are lined up for a ceasefire deal most importantly because this this draft ceasefire deal will not lead to security and permanent ceasefire necessarily the whole point of it is that it was diluted it was watered down to be a three phases disconnected without an automatic move from phase one to phase two to phase three and hence the idea that this could pass or should pass is not a big deal right the whole world wants it to pass everyone wants some form of Rite and those who supported Israel's genocide the past 10 months would like to be seen as advocating for ceasefire advocating for more Aid to the Palestinians so even those with the bad intentions like those with the good intentions everyone wants a ceasefire except Netanyahu he seems to be still the odd man out hoping to get more and more popularity in Israel as a wartime leader hoping to prolong the war as much as possible hoping to milk the United States for more concessions and even milk milk some of the Arabs for more concessions all right Mar thanks for that Mar bashara there in London more on this as we get it and as the bulletins go on thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
