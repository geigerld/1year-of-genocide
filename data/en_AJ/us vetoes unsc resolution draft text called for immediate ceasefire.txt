inian representative to the United Nations Riad Mansour joins me now from the UN headquarters in New York many thanks for joining the program what is uh your reaction to the events of the last few hours the US veto at the UNC it's very regrettable that the United States now after almost 145 days of the continuing of this uh uh crime against our people in the Gaza Strip uh described you know by you know those who went to the icj as a genocidal you know war against the Palestinian people by the occupying power and not to yet agree uh through a resolution in the security Council to call for uh an immediate ceasefire Call It Whatever humanitarian describe it as you wish but immediate ceasefire as requested by the Secretary General of the UN and almost all humanitarian agencies of the United Nations and massive number of countries in the general assembly and almost everyone in the security Council with the exception of the United States of America so it is regrettable it is the wrong message to be sent by the security Council to Israel and we will continue knocking on the door of the security Council the general assembly all components of the United Nations including I myself I was before the icj uh yesterday in which I pleaded the case of the Palestinian people through the tremendous amount of pain that you know to be a Palestinian today uh to convey it to all the judges in the icj in a Humane in an emotional and hopefully in an in effective way so that the security the SG icj to also add their voice through the provisional measures that amounts to calling for a ceasefire for Israel to stop its action and its crime so that the six provisional measures that the icj requested to be able to be implemented and Mr Mansour what did you make of the explanation given by Linda Thomas Greenfield the the UN Ambassador uh when she explained why the US had used their veto uh she said that the current resolution the Algerian resolution uh would put sensitive negotiations in Jeopardy that is not true because two of those who are involved in this sensitive negotiation the representative of Qatar and Egypt indicated that that is not so ceasefire will help the negotiation to move forward swiftly and you know to accomplish the objective of the exchange of prisoners hostages and therefore it is not what uh uh what was claimed and also let me add if the idea that they are now introducing a draft resolution to a call for a long uh ceasefire long lasting ceasefire or a longlasting pause who is stopping the United States if it can uh convince Israel to uh Implement that in order to help the current you know underway negotiation from implementing that nobody would be objecting nobody will be unhappy all of us we will welcome any action that will Stop The Killing and save lives of the Palestinian people um so the US have proposed their own draft resolution what what is going to happen with that are members uh like yourself uh going to be examining that further is that something that you're going to consider my understanding that the the normal mechanism in the security Council any member can introduce uh draft resolutions they engage in consultations and amendments and changes and if they reach an agreement and then they can proceeded to uh vote on that draft resolution they can also uh introduce it to excuse me to be put to a vote even if they don't agree provided that the American side can Master enough number of countries to cross the threshold without any of the permanent members to castavo excuse me okay I'll let you go uh thank you so much uh for joining us we will see we we will you're you're very welcome thank you you so much the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations Riyad Mansour speaking to us there from the UN headquarters in New York
