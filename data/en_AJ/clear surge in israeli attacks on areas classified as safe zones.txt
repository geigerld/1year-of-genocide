well TK Abu joins us now from outside alaa Hospital in dear Al Bala ter can you just give us an update on these deadly strikes this morning in central Gaza We Believe at least 15 people have been killed uh since Dawn yes uh that's right Tom the Israeli military has been upscaling the military attacks across many areas in the strip but the main focus within the past couple of days and even within the the early hours of this morning and B own is that on the middle areas including Alat Al magazi and even Dar balah where we from reporting on the ground these areas have been classified by the military uh save zones but yet what we notice is that there is a clearly surge of military attacks in thei specifically that within other the night attacks at least six Palestinians have been killed after a residential house was completely targeted two others being killed here in darl balah and alongside there is ongoing constant bombardment in Alber refugee camp especially with the limited Military encourging of the Israeli military troops in the Eastern areas of that very densely populated zone now what we do know and hear from citizens that the vast majority of attacks that were carried out a br down bedone and even within the early hours of this morning but carried out without any priate warning they have been targeting densely populated areas with no any kind of preco among the uh to avoid any casualties among civilians and that reflects the Israeli intentions to broen the military operations as also the Israel army has been saying that they are attacking Hamas operatives and Hamas command centers but what we do see inside the mor of the hospital and even within the emergency department is that the vast majority of casualties are children women and elderly people as we see lots of the funerals today earlier as the families of the uh victims are completely have great source of frustration from this ongoing military genial campaign we do not believe that they are unable to live uh safely and peacefully due to the Israeli unprecedented scale of attacks that uh contributed to destroying their basic houses alongside with all essential kind of inal infrastructure and that also included the uh killing of the head of Anda municipality as there is a systematic military campaign of eliminating the main officials in the uh interial uh in the interial and in the internal fronts and civil fronts in order to create a state of chaos among Palestinians and that will help to destroy the fat break of the community here as all kinds of KN and means of Life across this trip and in particular in the Central Area have been destroyed by this ongoing campaign that's T was for us there in De albala in central Gaza thank you
