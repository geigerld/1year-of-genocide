it is 10 GMT 1 p.m. in Gaza where Israeli strikes are continuing across the strip including in Rafa that's the main city in the South where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have been Sheltering the un's top court has ruled Israel should stop its offensive in the city the international court of justice also ordered Israel to open the Rafa border crossing to allow an aid that says hospitals are running out of supplies shelling and gunfire has also been reported near the Kuwaiti Hospital in Rafa and missiles have hit the crowded Al shabura refugee camp begins our coverage from Al Bala in shabura Camp in central raah civil defense crew tried to find survivors after an Israeli strike in the 10th City Palestinians here are hoping there is change after the court order because there's nowhere safe to go for displaced Palestinians at this makeshift Camp inah decisions at the international court of justice don't go far enough after 8 months of Israeli bombardment they want decisive action to end their suffering we want these decisions to be implemented on the ground to stop the war and not just to talk about ruer they've committed genocide they've committed massacres we want all the Arabs to to stand with us and for the world to stand with us and stop the war they shouldn't say one thing and do something different everything here in Gaza was completely destroyed so the decision what the Palestinian need is immediately stop War we don't need declaration we need application on the peach here while the UN Court delivered its ruling there was Heavy Israeli bombing in rafah many Palestinian remain skeptical that the court order for Israel to stop its assault on rafah will have any effect back at a shabura camp emergency workers put out fires in this residential area after an Israeli strike they're searching homes and telling people to leave as more bombs are expected to fall alaza Palestine our correspondent hany Mahmud is joining us live from De Al Balan Central Gaza and hany there have been attacks not just in Rafa but it's a rapidly deteriorating situation in the north too yes within the past 12 hours we're looking at this Israeli military scaling of attacks across the Gaza Strip from further southern part of the strip in Rafa city where the Israeli military has expanded its military operation beyond the central part of the city right now operating within the uh refugee camp that's a Shabu refug cam where the last remaining the only remaining operational hospital now running at the lowest capacity possible is under Fire the majority of the public facilities roads leading to the hospital being either completely destroyed or severely damage preventing paramedics and ambulance from being dispatched and bringing back injuries and and those were need to be saved from targeted areas in the central area and the northern part the Israeli military continue to attacks across the strip killing more people inside their residential home trapping people inside evacuation Center as it's happening in the northern part m in the jabalia refugee camp where it forc further internal displacement for the remaining uh population all of this happening while the UN top court has ordered Israel to hold it offensive uh on the uh on the city of RAF just to get better and and broader context on what's going on we are joined by Maha Al husseini a strategy director from the Euro mid uh human rights monitor Maha thank you so much for joining us thank You Maha the UN top coure just uh issued a dramatic ruling ordering Israel to hold its offensive on Rafa City and increase humanitarian Aid what does that mean for Palestinian well this is a very important and crucial step that uh the the world has long awaited for uh for decades not just since the beginning of this uh genocide on the Gaza strap since the 7th of October uh this is finally a recognition by the International Community that has long resorted and um uh only issued timid statements about Israel's violations that what Israel is doing in the Gaza STP is has actually uh cross all limits um since the beginning of this Palestinian catastrophe and back in 1948 for example when Palestinians have been forcibly expelled from their homes and Villages and when the International Community has continued not only to set on the fence but also to support Israel by providing arms that have been used against the Palestinians and have been uh involved in war crimes and crimes against humanity Palestinians have uh uh lost faith in humanity uh they have felt that they were abandoned failed by the International Community this is now a milestone but what is more important now is to ask what's next uh will this be uh just uh ink on paper like Palestinians have long uh witnessed will this just be uh uh orders that will not actually be uh pressure on Israel to abide by international law this is the most important question we are now witnessing a genocide that the world is watching on their screens and while we are we are witnessing and living this genocide there there's no much time left we do not have any time every hour every minute there is a New Soul that is lost there is a new life that is devastated and we need to take action now this is really important it takes me to the next question a question of applicability this is not the first time we see resolution decision at the international level is being made the general assembly the UN Security Council but again the question now how applicable is that on the ground well unfortunately successive Israeli governments have failed to comply by International orders and international laws including conventions that Israel itself signed on and ratified so including by for example the icj's provisional measures which have been uh issued a couple of months ago uh Israel has failed also to uh ader and comply by these orders Only Yesterday following a couple of hours following the decision of the icj uh Israel has continued to uh uh bom brafa and also they have carried out unprecedented Israeli air strikes on the center of Rafa uh including by preventing uh medical Crews and ambulances from reaching this area preventing or uh also targeting every moving thing uh in the center of Rafa so this is actually um a sign that Israel is also failing to uh adere by these AC by these decisions and this is also a sign that the eraso community uh is now more than ever needs to uh take tangible steps to to impose uh these decisions and to pressure Israel to ader by them including by imposing diplomatic economic and political sanctions on Israel M the Israeli government almost everyone in the war cabinet came out and vly denied uh the that the ruling is based on on allegation basically denied all the accusation they said these are South Africa madeup allegations and denial that in your work what you do on the ground you document basically for the past months everything happened on the ground the the genocidal act the practices the ongoing failure of of providing Aid what what do you what is your response to these uh like this denial to the ruling well this is very important to highlight because this is not only a facet of the genocide but also a consequence of Israel's blackout imposed on the Palestinians on the Gaza Strip including by for example preventing and banning International Crews including un teams and investigative teams and also International journals from covering the events and the real on the ground in Gaza uh the Israeli offical officials since the beginning of this genocide have long talked about their um adherance by international law and the legality of their actions but when talking about genocide we cannot talk about legality these are two concepts that are diametrically uh opposed uh we are talking about war crimes and crimes against humanity Israel has uh almost uh violated every provision of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Rome statute and conventions they themselves have ratified and signed on uh for example since the beginning of this attack we have documented several war crimes and crimes against humanity being uh committed against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip two days ago we have issued a report a detailed report of 42 uh um forms of torture and inhumane and degrading treatment uh uh practiced by the Israeli Army against Palestinian prisoners and uh uh deines in from the Gaza STP including sexual assault threats of rape uh spting and urinating on Etc so uh the Israeli Army actually in Gaza is not only uh um following orders from Israeli officials to Target and kill everything that is called Palestinians or everything that is Palestinian but they are also given a green light to improvise new kinds of crimes and uh kinds of torture against Palestinians just for being Palestinians in the Gaz STP which is part of the genocide being practiced against these Palestinians so what we are talking about is crimes against humanity being uh uh documented not only by our organization but also by un organizations un experts and international organizations working on the ground and these crimes are not deniable M thank you so much so as we heard from mahad the strategy director at the Euro uh made human rights monitor the the concern right now is not the ongoing Israeli failures to abide by these rulings but also the lack of mechanism to put pressure on Israel meaningful a pressure whether it's an American or at the international level to actually Force Israel to stop all the genocidal acts and practices on the ground and and in the uh the war hany thank you for that hany mahm joining us live from there Al balah in central Gaza make sure to subscribe
