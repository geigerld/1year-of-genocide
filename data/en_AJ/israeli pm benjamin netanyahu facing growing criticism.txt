the display of rare political unity in Israel may be coming to an end first in a televised interview opposition leader Yer lepid demanded prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu resign Israel has lost faith in the Prime Minister we cannot allow ourselves to conduct an extended war with a prime minister that the public does not trust then even more criticism of Netanyahu from politicians this time from his far-right Coalition partners national security minister itar bavier and Finance Minister bezel smotrich both slamming the war cabinet's decision to allow small amounts of fuel into Gaza labeling the move a grave mistake insisting it signals weakness and while it's unclear how much of a threat these internal divisions May yet pose to the Prime Minister he's also facing growing outrage about the way he and his government handled the issue of the captives still being held in Gaza conventional political wisdom in Israel holds that Prime Ministers typically get a boost in popularity during times of War but since October 7th survey after survey suggests the opposite even as most Israelis continue to Rally around the flag and support the military pamin netanyahu's approval ratings and Trust in his leadership have plummeted to alltime lows when asked recently about public condemnation of his leadership Netanyahu deflected there will be a time for politics now the public is United around achieving our three targets destroying Hamas returning our hostages and making sure that the situation in Gaza won't ever return to what it was before so just how much political danger is Netanyahu facing political analyst Yoni bin manim says everything will ultimately depend on the outcome of the war in Gaza people want to revenge and their dignity their national pride back and you can get the national pride back only by defeating Kamas so this is the two things that they want if Netanyahu can supply those two things he has a chance maybe to survive with all his political Maneuvers but if he doesn't Supply it he's finished while many have counted Netanyahu out before Israel's longest serving prime minister is also considered the ultimate political Survivor but the blame he's facing for his government's intelligence failures goes beyond mere crisis or Scandal and is leading many to believe his days could be numbered Muhammad jum AL jaaz West Jerusalem make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
