[Music] turning to old traditions as a means of survival in the midst of war and famine these young men are crafting a Lifeline to counter Israel's blockade we started making clay ovens two months after the War Began it was seen as an opportunity to make a living and also to provide people with a means to bake as there is no electricity or gas people can use these ovens for cooking and there's been a very high demand traditional clay ovens have been a part of Palestinian Heritage for Generations but haven't been used on this scale for a very long time I learned this craft from my father he wanted to be here with us today but couldn't my father used to work with my uncle when he was 16 years old they stopped for a long time when gas and electricity became widely available but when the war returned we went back to this craft from 6:00 a.m. until the end of each day this group is hard at work using a bucket to mold a round base with cement and pouring straw and Clay over the top then leaving it to solidify in the hot sun this craft has saved people a lot because there's no electricity it helps them cook and bake or even grill food if anything this has saved people a lot of trouble the effects of the ongoing Fuel and electricity shortage are more more Apparent at night rescue crews are forced to use cell phone lights to search the rubble for victims but for families it means modern cooking facilities don't work increasingly they're relying on clay ovens and firewood of course it is tiring and consumes a lot of firewood and even firewood is scarce but what else can we do there are no Alternatives we try to adapt to the situation even if we go back to using clay ovens we are resilient people and thank God we try to adapt to the situation no matter what adapting to circumstances has become a daily reality as people increasingly struggle to find food water and medicine with few options left Resurgence of this family craft is helping to feed Palestinians or desperate for an end to their suffering bad mahichi Al jaaz make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
