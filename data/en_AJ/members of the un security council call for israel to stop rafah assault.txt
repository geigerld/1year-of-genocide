from the impact on civilians and efforts to help them we have described it as a catastrophe a nightmare as hell on Earth it is all of these and worse to prospects for a ceas fire if talks do not resume I fear for the worst un officials described military activity in Rafa as a new low in the war on Gaza and increasing threat to the region so did many members stes Rafa is the last remaining area in Gaza that has not been completely destroyed Rafa is the sole region where humanitarian actors could still operate Rafa is now the final refuge for gazans displaced from their homes the UN says more than 800,000 Palestinians have been displaced from Rafa since Israel issued its evacuation orders two weeks ago and even now with the construction of a pier and Aid getting into Gaza by sea humanitarian needs are only increasing the Rafa border crossing once the main access point for Aid remains closed while other access points are too unsafe to meet the growing needs even the United States Israel's closest Ally in the security Council called for deconfliction we also do not support and will not support an Israeli reoccupation of Gaza and we have long m maintained our objection to any large scale military operation in Rafa that risks Mass civilian harm the Palestinian Ambassador noted past condemnations of Israel have had little impact Israel is asking you to destroy the international based order with your own hands so it can continue killing our people and annexing our land in full impunity it will not listen to reason or to your protests to your calls or your demands Israel vowed to continue its assault as long as Hamas is in power it the fire of Terror is burning in Rafa sadly there is no alternative Christen salumi Al jazer the United Nations make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
