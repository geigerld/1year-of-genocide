Han mahm joins us now from outside Thea hospital and the latest air strikes just go to show hany how the simplest of tasks like looking for internet can mean you lose your life in Gaza yes saman this is has been part of the the pattern of attacks we've document documented monitor for the past seven months the attacks on all means of Life all Social Services have been eliminated to include the services as simple as being connected to the internet or having your phone charged properly a group of people were on Al Jala Street that's at the one of the major streets in Gaza City where at a point trying to get internet connection were targeted by a drone that's that attack a drone that targeted him by firing at least one missile at the crowd three people reported killed right at the spot and one more person reported uh killed inside the hospital as soon as arriving to the hospital that sustaining critical injuries and could not make it there are other injuries who were transferred to the hospital but are still at very critical conditions particularly at this difficult time look at a hospital that is largely running at a very low capacity in terms of medical staff and the medical supplies inside the hospital unable to provide the necessary needed uh medical uh support whatsoever uh on a separate attacks the Israeli military continue to strike and to intensify its artillery Shilling as well as the air strike on jabalia refugee camp where more people reported killed and causing a great deal of Destruction including a journalist and his family within the past couple hours as journalists were inside the the refugee camp documenting the Israeli attacks on the public facility the residential uh buildings were attacked along with his with member of his family were reported killed in an air strike hany as we were coming to air we got word that the United Nations is saying the number of people displaced from RAF in the last week or so we're not talking about the total number of displaced Palestinian just the number displaced from rafah is now 600,000 what does that look like on the ground there yes you know Sammy we're expecting the number to increase dramatically within the coming days as the Israeli military is pushing deeper into the central part of Rafa City where more than the 600,000 that we're looking at now fleeing graa City are more people are going to be in forced into this enforc displacement and just to to give a background information Rafa has been the The Refuge for 1.5 million displaced Palestinian for the past 6 months who AFF flit the horror of the war in the northern part in Gaza City and more recently from Kan yunes and the central area right now they found themselves in the line of fire as the Israeli military intensify its attacks and and just to remember also the past 6 months seven months haven't been easy on ra the city was repeatedly attacked despite declaring it as a safe zone for the hundreds of thousand of families who uh have been Sheltering uh inside the city but right now those 600,000 people and the number is going to increase are pouring into either parts of khun that's the evacuation Zone in Al maasi area but the vast majority are uh are are coming to the central area mainly in into city which something that we look right now in the streets and on all the public facilities available on uh major uh areas uh any available pocket of land here is full of people right now there are more people are pouring into the city more people are using uh uh running making the the the city run out of a space running out of infrastructure that is already overwhelmed the fact that there is a serious lack of basic necessities such as water supplies and and and water and Food Supplies as well as medical supplies making it very difficult for this large number of people to be accommodated all right thanks so much hany Mahmud there now Israel's defense minister is calling on prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu to rule out any Israeli postwar control over Gaza I call on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to declare that Israel will not have a civilian rule over the Gaza Strip that there will be no Israeli military Administration in the strip and that a governing alternative to Hamas in the Gaza Strip will be promoted immediately Muhammad Jam jum joins us now live from Aman in Jordan because the Netanyahu government has shut down Al jazer in Israel so Muhammad first of all what are these statements tell us about the severity of division in the cabinet right now well Samy there is a very public argument playing out right now with members of the war cabinet in Israel you had that press conference that happened uh just in the last few hours in Tel Aviv in which yab Galant the Israeli defense minister said among other things um that the government needed to make a decision about postwar governance in the Gaza Strip he went on to say that he would not support open-ended Israeli military rule over over uh the Gaza Strip uh he said I will not agree to the establishment of a military government in Gaza uh according to him a civilian military regime in Gaza will become the main effort in there and come at the expense of other Arenas uh we will pay for it in Blood and victims and it will come at a heavy economic cost he also said that soon after the War Began that he had promoted a plan for a new Palestinian Administration in Gaza that was not linked to Hamas but that he had gotten no response from various Israeli cabinet ministers and Forum so he's clearly very frustrated about this and saying there needs to be a post-war plan and there should not just be under military rule shortly after that you had a response from the Prime Minister from Benjamin Netanyahu Benjamin Netanyahu said as long as Hamas remains no other actor will run Gaza certainly not the Palestinian Authority and then after that you had uh Benny gance who is a member of a war cabinet a former Defense Minister in Israel and he publicly stated that um Galant meaning the defense minister speaks the truth that it is the leadership's responsibility to do the right thing for the country at all costs so these are three members of the war cabinet in Israel at a critical time uh having a public dispute about what needs to happen going forward you have been aant backing yav Galant yav Galant arguing with um with Benjamin Netanyahu and it's all really just going to show how complicated the situation is right now um and how the divisions are being laid bare throughout the Israeli government Sammy and all of this coming after we've heard doubts from us officials Muhammad about an Israeli outright Israeli Victory about an Israeli post-war plan is that some of that building up to kind of undermine Netanyahu now well this certainly looks as though yoav Galant is heeding the advice of the Americans and over the course of the last few days when you look across the Israeli media landscape we are seeing more and more quotes from Israeli military officials unnamed officials but officials nonetheless speaking to Israeli media expressing grave concerns about where things stand when it comes to the war and the decision- making of the Prime Minister on the one hand these military officials have said that they're very worried about the relationship going forward with the us that they feel that there may have been a fracture and they're worried that it will only grow even though publicly the defense minister has said that any disagreements with the US will be handled behind closed doors we're hearing other military officials say they're worried that the relationship with the US is close to potentially being broken they're also concerned that if there are further weapon shipments from the US that are halted that that would impact not just the war on Gaza but also might impact future conflicts in other Arenas and on other fronts uh and they're also just concerned some of them have said that they are concerned that the prime minister is prolonging the conflict in order to continue to survive politically because once the war is over um there is so much outrage of the intelligence failure that led to the October 7th attack that they believe that the prime minister's days would be numbered so a lot of concern for military officials these days certainly what we're hearing now today from yov Galant certainly indicates that perhaps at the highest levels of the military uh in Israel they are concerned about what the US is advising and that perhaps they should be listening closer than Netanyahu is doing at this time Sammy thank you so much Muhammad Jam jum there make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
