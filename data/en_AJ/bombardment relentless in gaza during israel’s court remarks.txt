Let's cross over to tck Abu aoom our correspondent in De alala in central Gaza while that presentation tarck was happening by the Israelis we were also showing live pictures of what's going on across Gaza right now the Israelis are talking about Crossings being open Aid going in and everything's just fine yet there were huge black plumes of smoke hitting the Gaza Strip as their presentation was underway at the ha just bring us up to speed on what was going on this last [Music] hour well all what Israel has said was completely contradictory to the realities on the ground you have been contacting with members in Rafa Crossing they have been confirmed that nothing has entered the Gaza Strip from Rafa and K Abu Salam Crossing Borders in terms of humanitarian Aid only what get into the territory just before the Israeli military incuron to rafah was one fuel truck to the Ona had been delivered and that's absolutely reflects how much Israel is working to aace truth and to even to change facts on the ground as we they continue their in a unrelenting circle of bombardment aurus Rafa and in the North in jabalia refugee camp now uh the United Nations have been responsible for getting all kinds of AIDS in the previous periods that were were completely pre the invasion of Rafa and we have been insisting on the fact that any potential military incursion of Rafa will be a big plow for all humanitarian efforts being made on the ground to mitigate the aggravating humanitarian crisis and within the past couple of hours more intensification of bombardment by the Israeli military in the north of this trip in jabalia refugee camp as battles did not witness any kind of until now as the Israeli military is demolishing complete residential neighborhoods one after the other in light of their ongoing efforts to seize all kind of military control on the north of this strip as till now the Israeli military tanks are still surrounding the entrance of banan town in the north as bombardment continued as well in B Laha town and the far Northern western parts of the north of this trip Amed ongoing hovering of Israeli military drones as you can hear right now in the background in Dar balah this is where Palestinians have been told to seek refuge and it's going to be a safe place for them but yet more casualty among civilians are getting into ala are getting to Al AA Hospital from different parts of the middle regions as bombardment there continued as well tarck Israel gives the impression that this is a voluntary move of those that are in Rafa but this is really forc displacement isn't it they're warning people you need to move or you're going to die well it's not all related to the controversially evacuation orders being passed by the Israeli military they have been using this under intense fire power means that it's sending a clear reminder for Palestinians if you did not leave you will be killed not you're going to die only because that is the military approach that being used by the Israeli military in the initial months of the war when they invaded the north of the Str now they have been expanding the fighting to reach kanun and right now ending up in Rafa families and civilians in the north of the in the Eastern portion of Rafa District have been receiving warnings to flee they managed to flee we are talking about more than 100 uh I'm sorry more than 600,000 Palestinians fled Rafa since the beginning of the operation there and at the same time there are still thousands of people in Rafa in the middle and even in the western areas of rafah District which is close to al- maasi and that's absolutely a very devastating scenario if Israel is trying to smoothly expand the military incursion of Rafa City especially in light of more growing uh even warnings for people in the middle area specifically speically on the vicinity of Al Kuwaiti hospital and the shabura neighborhoods as Medics as we have been confirming before that they have been receiving calls by the Israeli officers to leave the area because hospitals will no longer be safe places even for medical workers T briefly I just want to ask you one final question because we know that Israeli surveillance zone is in your vicinity and based on what we've just heard at the ha I just want you to clarify for our viewers are the crossings open or closed have has any any Aid come in is Israel in your opinion and the sources that you're talking to on the ground abiding by humanitarian international law and looking after the Palestinians in Gaza and the field hospitals and mobile clinics that the Israelis just talked about in the ha are fully staffed and have lots of medicine can you just briefly tell us what your opinion of that statement is well to make it clear soale now both K Abu Salam and Rafa Crossing are closed now from the Palestinian side the Israeli military is taking full control as Egypt refused that Israel will be responsible for conducting and running a Rafa Crossing and they are calling for an independent Palestinian entity to run the border and to allow for further Aid to get into the Gaza Strip now K Abu Salam Ming is under the Israeli control initially and they have been also challenged by the settlers attack on Aid convoys that are getting into the Gaza Strip pre Raa operations but since the beginning of the operation no Aid get into the Gaza Strip throughout the southern Crossing Borders of the strip in the north there was a new point that Israel has made in order to allow for a to get into the strip and since the establishment of that point only a very limited number of trucks get to the people in the north and since the expansion of the fighting and the new operation being launched in jabalia refugee camp no Aid get to to the people in the north so what Israel has been saying in the international court of justice hearings is completely contradictory to what we have been going through and feeling on the ground we do not see an aid get into the Gaza STP there was more growing appeal from United Nations about the importance of of reopening all Crossing Borders to avoid any kind of famine could be looming in the Horizon and mainly Palestinians are graveling now to get food what only get into the Gaza Strip are 52 Commercial trucks that were in inserted to their territory in coordination with the Israeli side they all gone to the private sector and they are right now sold in the Palestinian market with the skyrocketing prices so that's all the reality on the ground as Palestinians till this very moment are struggling in order to get their Basics life- saving supplies and they are saying that the new martime and floating dock could not be a proper effective alternative for land routs that could be more helpful than the maritime one was recently established in the middle area Tabu isum there for us in darl Bala with that Israeli surveillance throne above his head thanks very much uh tarck will'll check in with you later in the day as well
