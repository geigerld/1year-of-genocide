what's the extent of US military aid to Israel in its war on Gaza Washington has been sending military assets to the region saying they're for deterrence purposes but are they really and could it trigger a wider conflict in the Middle East this is Inside [Music] Story hello again I'm James Bay refugee camps hospitals apartment blocks nowhere in gazer is safe in Israel's bombardment of the besieged territory the humanitarian needs are dire and growing by the minute yet Israel's biggest Ally the United States is still not calling for a ceasefire instead it's sending more military assets to the region Washington says the aircraft carriers and Naval support vessels will serve as a deterrent but could American troops join the War and what would this mean for the Middle East plenty for us to discuss with our panel in a bit but first this report from [Applause] saril a grim Milestone 18 days into the war on Gaza the Israeli bombardment has killed more than 5,700 Palestinians daily life in the besieged territory is synonymous with the unpredictability of air strikes but throughout the offensive the United States has maintained an unwavering commitment to Israel we must must be Crystal Clear we stand with Israel we stand with Israel and we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens defend itself and respond to this attack while international calls for an immediate ceasefire grow louder ceas ceas now the Us and other Western allies have refrained from asking Israel to SC Gil back its attacks on Gaza instead Washington has sent not one but two aircraft carriers and their strike groups to the region each has roughly 7,500 military personnel it's one of the largest deployments of US troops to the Mediterranean in decades this additional uh deployment um sends another message to those who would who would uh seek to widen this conflict President Biden said earlier and as you've heard me say uh if any group or any uh country is looking to widen this conflict and take advantage of this very unfortunate uh situation that we see um Our advice is don't Iran's foreign minister has accused the White House of double standards we've received messages asking us to practice restraint and also asked us to invite others to show restraint but the us over the past 2 weeks has been sending milit equipment to Israel so how can they say they don't want the expansion of War now I'm saying to Biden stop your hypocrisy the US hopes its support for Israel and its own increased military presence in the region will be enough to prevent the conflict from widening but it's also clear that any miscalculation between Iran and the United States risks changing the Dynamics of this war very quickly Sara Gil for Inside well let's bring in our panel of guests to discuss all this further in Doha we have Colin Clark who's director of research at the sufan group a global intelligence and Security consultancy in New York it's Omar Raman he's a fellow at the Middle East Council on global Affairs where he focuses on Palestine Middle East geopolitics and American foreign policy in the region and in Boston it's Glenn Carl Korea CIA officer he's a former deputy National intelligence officer for transnational threats at the agency great to have you all with us to discuss uh what is going on in the region and particularly what's going on with regard to the US deployments because more and more uh us assets are going to the region particularly Naval assets some people say it's the biggest Amada that's been seen uh in the region since the 1990s Glenn would you agree with that well I don't know if that's true but I certainly believe that it is uh true two uh aircraft carriers bring along as part of their combat um I forget the the term steps my mind for the moment but in any event they deploy with probably a dozen ships or more each so I think that's probably a true statement yes and Colin I've been looking it's quite hard quite opaque to get information off the off the Pentagon website but reading through all the transcripts and everything that's out there in public um as Glenn says I mean we've got the largest warship in the world world the USS Gerald Ford we've got another um aircraft carrier so two aircraft carriers the Dwight D Eisenhower uh which is also there and then I think a total of eight warships in their two strike groups and then we've got something called the batan amphibious ready group uh which has on three ships a total of 4,000 Sailors and Marines on it this is this is a very large deployment isn't it Colin yeah it's a it's a massive muscular response from Washington multiple carrier strike groups uh you know Patriot batteries fad missile defense this is about we're not going to allow any jug and just tell me what fat is please quickly terminal high altitude air defense uh missile missile defense essentially uh Force protection uh deterrence uh and then if need be some uh potential offensive assets there's also intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance uh on these carrier strike groups as well so all around preparation from Washington in case things do escalate and Colin staying with you what is your reading of the main reason for sending so much uh to the region I think you know first of all it's deterrence it's a warning to the Iranians it's a warning to Iranian sponsored groups like Hezbollah to remain on the sidelines or at least to keep activity at a very low and manageable level uh but again it's also to protect the bases that the United States have in the region it's about Force protection and lastly it's about preparation uh the Biden Administration is still stung from the withdrawal from Afghanistan how poorly things went there and they want to be prepared in case they need these assets including to evacuate American citizens from a number of countries in the Middle East Omar let me ask you how you think this will be seen in the region because one person's deterrence could be another person's provocation yeah I think I think uh it opinion on this will be split in the region to some extent based on your relationship with the United States and where you're coming from and how you're viewing the current uh conflict although I think across the Arab world there is heavy concern for this escalating and you know in some senses uh maybe not a provocation but certainly the US is is escalating the situation by bringing in hu huge Naval forces uh into the region and it's in in a sense emboldening Israel to carry on what it's doing in Gaza and that is the obviously uh the source of the escalation at the moment that is the reason why there's anger erupting across the Arab world that would be the reason why you might see attacks on uh US military bases in the region uh or uh you know what we've seen maybe uh houti Rebels firing Rockets towards Israel if that's actually where they were headed uh so you know at the heart of it it's you know it's embold Israel I think to carry out uh this mission in the region Glen see if right with my assumption here my assumption is that uh they sending this big arada because they can't use their military bases of air base in Doha and their naval base in Bahrain because of the circumstances right now does that seem correct to you uh partially correct it certainly would be a complicating factor to use forces out of Doha given um Cutter's relationship with Hamas and the and Brotherhood uh however I don't think that's really the primary reason I think as I believe it's Colin the first Speaker said uh clearly to me the primary objective is deterrence dissuasion the the buildup is not really to um enable the Israelis to act but rather to keep the conflict from spreading becoming a regional or even broader war and I think that most uh we call them Arab governments but they're in this instance it's more relevant to say Muslim uh countries uh understand that and and uh don't want to see the conflict generalize and so really are accepting of the US deployment now the what we call the Arab street is another matter and Muslims of course will be um dissatisfied and angered by what they will characterize as a provocation but but to me clearly the objective of the United States is to stop stop Iran's proxies from so provoking Israel or the United States that the conflict generalizes into a wider War Colin um we've talked about the deterrence role but there's also a role in protecting us assets that are already in the region let me read you a quote from the Pentagon Press Secretary breger General Pat Ryder we will do everything and take all necessary measures to protect us forces we've already seen some instances um W with regard to what has gone on in the Red Sea and what has happened in Iraq and Syria let me take those one by one first in the Red Sea there um there was a US warship the USS Carney which took down four land attack cruise missiles we think they came from the houthis is that your understanding yeah it seems likely uh it's constant with previous behavior and actions by the houthis and for the United States it's just unacceptable it's not going to allow its personel or its basis to be targeted by any actor in the region and and on that Colin um do we know what the houthis were aiming at because uh the U the Pentagon spokesman again said they took them down but they didn't necessarily think they were aimed at the Cary and they were going in the direction of Israel to your knowledge do the houthis have anything that could hit Israel it's possible I think you know they they very well could have been headed that way uh I think you know one thing that this whole conflict has taught us is that we need to question prior assumptions right I think uh many people didn't think Kamas had the capabilities that it displayed on October 7th so I would be very concerned about uh examining prior assumptions about the capabilities of Hezbollah the houthis Iraqi Shia militia and others I think you know clearly the Iranians have helped them develop capabilities they've given them all sorts of uh different hardware and missiles and so so uh at this at this point uh we're still in the early stages of this conflict we're hoping to keep it to a low boil uh it's best to be in a defensive posture Glenn we've also seen attacks in Syria and Iraq there are still based in Iraq 2,500 US troops and in Syria there are 900 uh US troops but also a lot of military contractors I mean I think some people to start with would be quite surprised there AR so many US troops still in Iraq and Syria what are they doing well multiple uh missions one of course is to continue uh to observe and try to stop um Isis or jihadist uh groups and elements from uh conducting uh terrorist operations and destabilizing things another is to help try to keep the governments in place from being destabilized further by such terrorist actions and the third is of course to watch over to the extent possible um Iranian efforts to extend its influence which is a large component of what we're seeing happening with the houti with the groups in Syria with um hisbah on the border and with Hamas uh and Iran is playing a cynical very dangerous game destabilization and trouble death and turmoil in Israel is a good thing for for Iran because it's hostile to Israel on theological philosophical and political reasion and two because it helps Iran extend its influence so the one of the missions of the US presence there is to try to keep this kind of destabilization from occurring uh and uh really to stop Shia meaning Iranian uh influence from uh from spreading even further than it has Omar apparently we think about eight attacks on US troops in four different locations in Iraq and Syria and it's interesting reading what's been said by the US hierarchy uh quoted the Pentagon press secretary before we don't necessarily see that Iran has explicitly ordered them yet the White House and the uh strategic Communications coordinator John Kirby we know that Iran is closely monitoring these attacks and in some cases actively facilitating these attacks what's your view on how involved Iran is is Iran ordering this uh whether they're ordering the attacks uh in places like Syria and Iraq I mean it's it's probable given their links uh to uh to those uh those groups that are operating in those countries I think it was a little overstated I think in in terms of uh you know their their connection to the initial Hamas attack on October 7th I mean clearly they're you know a sponsor a financial backer material backer of Hamas but you know they a lot of the reporting that came up out out of October 7th you know implied or directly asserted that you know Iran was heavily involved in the planning process I think that uh is overstating the overstating the connection but certainly I think uh their connection is much deeper uh to the armed groups that are operating in Syria and Iraq uh and so you know I you know I don't know whether they're directly involved but it's uh you know worth it's worth considering for sure okay back to you Colin because you brought up the acronym Fad in the first place what the US is deploying it seems because of these specific attacks in Iraq and Syria is this terminal high altitude area defense system or Thad and also some additional and there's no specified number here Patriot battalions also just explain to me what these things do uh Patriot are missile missile defense batteries surface to a missiles that are going to be used to guard against what we saw uh just the other day against the numerous attacks and provocations from uh various Iranian back actors in the region the United States and the Pentagon clearly expects more of that in the days ahead uh and so this is again a defensive and precautionary measure to protect United States assets it's it's nothing more it's nothing less uh the Iranians for their part are doing what they always do they're continuing to attempt to push uh the United States out of the region and extend their own influence Glenn we've got 2,000 extra troops in addition to those Marines I told you about who are at um and all the other Naval Personnel 2,000 extra US troops are on standby to deploy with high Readiness I mean is that what are the circumstances in which these troops could actually do something because one assumes you deploy troops yes you deploy them as a deterrent but you have to think about where you when you might use them and there might be circumstances when they could be used what would you say to that oh this is where the line is not easy to draw very clearly but I think the example of the Carney gives a good indication uh the video that I think numbers of us have seen which purports to be taken from the hooti who fired the rocket to um an untutored eye such as mine it appeared that it was firing at the ship and you could hear the people saying well essentially let's see what America does to that and take it America but the response for the US was to to shoot down the missile and then to say it had occurred and do nothing else uh in other circumstances the military the United States would want to eliminate the threat the perpetrator of an attack like that but it hasn't happened why because it seems pretty clear that uh the description of the Thad system that we just heard from Colin I think it was um make describes what US objectives are which is to Parry um attacks and to keep the violence the war from spreading if however ever US forces and Facilities were seriously harmed um Americans killed and and capabilities destroyed then it would be much more difficult for the United States not to use the 20000 um soldiers Marines I think they are who are in place as a dissuasive measure they are there not to be used the success is not to see them have to be deployed uh failure of American objectives would be that the Iranian proxy succeed in causing such harm that the US or Israel would feel obliged to respond with uh with Force rather than just uh countermeasures Omar so if the US are attacked that is what the forces are there for and might and that's when they might actually be used do you see any other circumstances where these forces could be deployed given how uncertain things are with regard to the war on Gaza and a possible escalation in the north bringing in Hezbollah yeah I think the the primary reason for them being there and this was obviously mentioned uh is you know or the primary maybe cause of escalation would be if US forces were attacked but I think if there was a massive assault on Israel say hasah was to fire you know thousands of rockets into Israel you might see the United States respond and I think that's obviously part of the reason it's there I mentioned earlier you know it's enabling the Israelis obviously you know I didn't want to imply that the US was seeking escalation uh in the region the carrier forces are there to deter uh but obviously you know that type of deterrence uh is read by Israel as a kind of a license to do what it wants and that can cause spark a type of escalation so if it does come from Lebanon uh or if it comes from elsewhere Iran or Syria or Iraq in kind of a massive scale something that can't be uh you know handled with minimal effort then I could see the US getting involved in this and that's a very slippery slope and a dangerous uh a dangerous Colin to you quickly I mean are there other possible roles given you've got all of these Naval assets there let me give you some examples could could there be a role for them in extraction of US citizens who are being held captive could there be a role in intelligence and surveillance and whatever for Israel I mean I assume they have quite a lot of capabilities in that regard and could there be a base for some sort of covert action by Special Forces look the troops are are not purely ornamental they're there for a reason uh again I think this is largely about preparation uh this is about the possibility of a Neo a non-combatant evacuation operation uh getting US citizens out of the region if need be uh logistical support you mentioned intell intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance uh I think you know as a very very last resort you know the US would use them in a kinetic way uh but really the United States does not want to get involved in this conflict this is purely about escalation management uh and these are the assets that are being brought into theater to achieve that Glenn we've talked about the possibility of the northern front becoming a second front a twoof front War some have even talked about the West Bank being a third front um and we've talked about the possibility of Hezbollah getting involved in this conflict actively but there are also reports that the Israeli defense M Minister yoav Galant has advocated a preemptive strike in the north against Hezbollah who he says he 10 more times more dangerous than Hamas and so far he's not won the argument um in the Israeli War cabinet but if Israel would do that that puts the us then in a very difficult position doesn't it if if it's Israel that starts the fight in the north well it could possibly be the case yes it depend it would depend everything always depends on the size of a quote preemptive strike and and that the uh amount of uh damage killing that are caused it's certainly true hisbah in conventional military terms is U exponentially more powerful than Hamas and uh we all have I think heard the reports that that Iran has provided hisbah with 120 to 140,000 Rockets many of which can uh strike any part of Israel there their range extends well beyond the borders of the furthest point away of Israel uh so Israel has a um a real legitimate um concern about uh it is an attack uh from our assessments imminent and uh would it be less dangerous to preemptively strike to try to stop that or not and and that's an a very difficult equation so far uh consistently the Israelis have shown restraint because they don't want to expand the war either uh but that is the the very complex equation that one has to make in real time when all decisions have negative consequences uh if if you go right it's negative if you go left it's negative um and yet you have to go some direction it's the uh the hard challenge they have but that certainly is why they would be considering a preemptive strike in the seemingly paradoxical objective of limiting uh harm certainly but uh expansion of the conflict uh actually Colin how much um restraint does the US have an ability to restrain Israel if it want I've read reports that there now is a us uh Lieutenant General James Glenn who previously headed the marine Special Operations was involved in the operations against isil in Iraq he's been embedded now in the Comm structure uh at the defense Ministry in Tel Aviv well it's unclear uh how much the United States can limit the israeli's response I do think uh Israel will listen to us advisors and again I think the United States has little interest in watching this conflict escalate uh and has zero interest in getting dragged into it so I think uh the United States is over there providing advice hoping that cooler heads prevail let's not forget at the human suffering involved here the hostages uh that are involved and the children that are dying every day in this conflict this is heart-wrenching to watch I think anybody with a heart is is hoping that uh that this war ends sooner rather than later and I hope uh the United States is helping figure out a way to bring the fighting to an end Omar major military power projection like this also has a global diplomatic effect how do you think this will be seen this us troop presence in the region by Russia and China um you know a little difficult to say Obviously China has warships in the region that have been there for a while but are kind of making a tour so that uh Dynamic I think U creates a certain type of tension uh that we you know we don't want to see escalate into into that Arena um how those powers are perceiving it uh it's difficult to say but I do know that um you know how this has evolved and if if the Biden Administration you know didn't didn't want to see uh escalation and I don't think it does but it's its reflexive uh reaction to this whole episode uh from day one has brought us to this point and if you didn't think it would bring us to this this point uh then you know then this was a a huge mistake on its end to think that you know an Israeli uh bombardment of the Gaza Strip without a real plan uh for the day after wouldn't bring us to this point and so uh you know the whole thing has been a kind of a dangerous Reckless game uh that's escalating tensions in the region and I don't think anybody really wants to see it evolve into something much worse but that's kind of the direction we're headed in Glenn can I end our discussion with get your reaction to a grim anniversary that just passed 40 years ago it was October the 23rd 1983 that's when a suicide bomber hit the US military barracks in Beirut International Airport killing 241 US servicemen um that was a disastrous moment in the US's involvement in the Middle East and of course now the president is Joe Biden he not only knows his history he lives it because he was a US senator at the time he said we've got to change this crazy policy as he introduced a resolution calling from the US withdrawal uh from leban what's your thought on on that Echo from history some of my colleagues were killed in the the attacks the Marine Barracks and the American Embassy which occurred not far distant in time from each other one of the lessons that the us some parts of the US uh Learned was the primary reason for those two attacks was that we were seen to have been seen to have taken sides in fundamentally a civil war but also in between the pal Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel and so we uh angered one of the sides enough to to try to kill us uh a tactical lesson that we learned was that The Rules of Engagement of the American forces deployed at the time were designed to uh avoid escalation which is a laudable objective but it meant that the uh the response in real time was insufficient meaning that some of our guards were not allowed to fire on an approaching suicide truck and those Rules of Engagement subsequently changed and I think in the current crisis it is relevant because we've all been talking about during this section session is the advanced deployment of tremendous force and the repeated warnings that the United States will use it if uh provoked uh if someone tries to expand the uh the conflict uh that's a l Glen thank you very much for that lesson from history uh for all the talk of a pivot to Asia it seems the US is being forced by events back to to the Middle East thanks to all our guests Colin Clark Omar Ramen and Glenn Carl you can find much more detail on the conflict on our website and if you want to watch this or any other of our programs go to al.com
