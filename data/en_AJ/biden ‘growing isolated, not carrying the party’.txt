well joining us here now in studio is Mark Erin Jones He associate professor of Middle East studies at hammed bin Khalifa University could have you with us again just to analyze what's going on through the day Imran was you know suggesting as we all have in our conversations about this issue of Israel dragging Iran into this after that attack on the Consular Office in Damascus and Israel knows when it comes to the issue of Iran it will always be backed by the US and that's been reconfirmed by blinken's Iron cloud guarantee is that always set in stone I think it's pretty hard to see uh the US abandoning Israel and I think given the current politics of Iran I mean over the past five years since the Trump Administration Biden hasn't done much to actually reestablish the the jcpoa agreement so Biden has been continuing the US um relationship with Iran in such the same way as his predecessor so I don't think we're going to see that change and I think but Netanyahu knows that by attacking Iranian soil he is going to create a battle of rhetoric uh the Iranians are going to increase their threats their verbal rhetoric to threaten Israel which they are doing and we seen the supreme leader even participate in this and simply by doing that that's going to necessitate a US response as we have seen with the Biden reaffirming his his commitment to defending Israel and of course this also undermines Biden's uh previous criticisms of Netanyahu because he's gone from saying hey I'm being firm with Netanyahu we need to get Aid to the gazans to basically going down a different tag and say hey we will always support Israel so what message did that send that sends the message to Netanyahu that it doesn't matter really what Netanyahu does at the end of the day Biden is going to unequivocally support what he Israel does so really that takes the pressure off Netanyahu to try and for example resolve the aid uh situation in Gaza and certainly take the pressure off to try and find a political solution here which Hamas are trying to look for in their call for a ceasefire indeed I mean there's a lot of speculation and there's a lot of um an at the moment we have to be very careful about what we say in terms of what may happen next CU we don't know um but at the end of the day there are lots of moving parts and when you have this scenario and this conversation happening uh from Israel uh about what they intend to do what they want to do and how they're going to react this makes the neighborhood nervous yeah and we're not seeing at the moment that much comment from Aman from Cairo from Riad I'm just wondering what the thought process there was knowing that they're all involved in the negotiations to try and find a peace pause or ceasefire in the current war on Gaza well I think no one in the neighborhood so to speak wants a regional escalation and I think a man we see in Riyad are being extremely cautious because anything they say now can actually be interpreted in such a way as to potentially jeopardize or or harm the negotiations that are going on between Qatar Hamas Israel and Cairo so I think there was an element of caution then and um you know I think people are also uncertain you know there there is like you said there's a lot of moving parts and a lot of the things that have happened have been hard to predict for example the assassination of Ismail hania's children and grandchildren was something that people didn't necessarily know you know expect so I think there is a level of not just caution but actual U perhaps um an inability to actually know what to do and this there's traditionally this notion that you know well us leadership in the Middle East this desite being problematic is something that a lot of the Arab states have have kind of sought as important but now the US are equivocating and I think the states in the region are actually not sure necessarily what to do with that right so I think it's creating this kind of leadership vacuum there is a leadership vacuum and people are looking to tan Netanyahu and Biden to see how this is going to end which is what happens for the moment Marco and Jones Thank you thank you
