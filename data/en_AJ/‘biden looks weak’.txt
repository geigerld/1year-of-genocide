John's in Washington DC John so a little bit more detail now uh on the story three drones um shot down uh over Iran what are you hearing from us officials there if anything at this stage well Darren this all happened late Thursday night it's now about 2:00 in the morning Washington time uh so the administration is certainly up there are people at the Pentagon at the state department at the White House who are surely fielding all of this information right now but they haven't come out with any statement so far we do expect that in the coming hours but us officials have confirmed to us media that this was an Israeli strike that the US did have warning on Thursday that within 24 to 48 hours there would be a strike and uh we were told that in the in the previous couple of days that it was likely this would happen as after Passover which starts on Monday so this is sooner than that and there there was discussion between the US and Israel of what the options might be some of those options Were Striking Israeli Pro I'm sorry Iranian proxies outside of Iran and while the strike seems to have been fairly limited it was on Iranian soil so the Israelis appear to have taken a m a middle ground on that but the important Point here I think is that the US had been counseling both sides to deescalate this conflict and Israel went ahead with a strike in any case uh John I mean would the Biden Administration have received any warning from the Israelis that they were about to carry out some kind of retali to strike against Iran yes the US is definitely the biggest sponsor of the Israeli military program donating millions of dollars each year for that and there are strings to that uh and generally the israelies would tell the US and indeed we are told by us officials that that did occur that the us was given notice the Us official says that the US didn't endorse or support this effort the US didn't participate in it but that it was made aware Lloyd Austin the defense secretary spoke to yav Galant his counterpart in Israel earlier in the day we don't know if that's where uh the US got the notice that this strike was coming but uh it was certainly discussed because the US has been warning Israel that whatever it does it should not escalate this conflict President Biden has has been saying take the win uh to Benjamin Netanyahu and that would uh would apparently seem to mean don't launch a strike or don't launch a major strike so uh I think in the coming hours we'll find out just how big that strike was and whether that is likely to mean that there will be another response from Iran which of course would be an escalation which is the last thing the Biden Administration wants Daren all right John hendron live for us there in Washington DC John thank you for that
