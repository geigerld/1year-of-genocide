let's take a look at how and where Israel is intensifying its attacks in Gaza the new phase of Israel's ground invasion is targeting Khan Yunis in the South it's gaza's second largest city and home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians forced from their homes in the north Israeli forces are battling Palestinian fighters from the kasan brigades and Islamic Jihad in the regions shaded in red there's also heavy fighting in several neighborhoods in Gaza City all the fighting and troop movements indicate Israel is aiming to divide Gaza into three areas the north the central region and the South T abum joins us from outside the Kuwaiti Hospital in rafah and today Wednesday started with news of those Israeli strikes claiming more civilian lives such as first aid responders and now we're hearing the family of one of our colleagues mman sharafi have fallen victim to those strikes yes Sammy first of all I would like to send my uh my condolences to our friend and colleague M lrai for the loss of his parents a number of his siblings alongside with the wives and their children in an air strike that destroyed the building that they were taking shelter inside in jabalia refugee camp uh may they rest in peace as the Israeli attacks on the North and across the territory has intensified during the last couple of hours and since the early beginning of this round of fighting mfi family were were was one of the Palestinian families who did not find any safe shelter out and any safe passage to evacuate to uh Rafa or to the south of the of the Gaza Strip and they have been living under very intense bombing for more than 60 days until they have been killed by the Israeli fires we have also contacted a number of residents inside jabalia refugee camp earlier today in order to check on the situation on the ground they told us that the situation there is very dire as they are really facing a very notable shortage of food water and even they did not find any medical drug to be obtained in order to cure themselves from illness and even uh diseases so the situation on the ground in the north of the Gaza Strip continues to be very complicated and complex as the Israeli occupation forces are expanding the military operation into jabalia refugee camp where the Israeli troops are having different fire exchange with Palestinian fighters in the the outskirts of the refugee camp alongside with the main Central areas of Gaza City and ttic along those lines I think it's fair to say we're seeing street fighting intensifying these days where's that leaving the battle for Gaza yes the fighting on the ground on separate areas inside Gaza continues between Palestinian Fighters including the alasam brigades fighters and even alot brigades uh Soldier fighters who are trying to confront and even to thwart the Israeli ground Invasion into main aan areas of gasa City and in the north of the territory now these battles are getting much more intense and Furious due to the fact that Israel is intensifying their attacks and the the Palestinian Fighters are destroying and attacking a different artillery tanks by using anti-tank missiles and with a diversity of uh light and heavy weapons and in order just ear to force them to to evacuate and to step back uh from the areas where the civilians are still inside as the bombardment continue on several residential buildings uh the Israel occupation right now is intensifying the raise of their attacks they depend on the destruction of complete residential neighborhoods which gives a guarantee that no one can remain alive from the uh from the bombing and it will help also to intimidate other residents to flee to the south of the Gaza Strip but meanwhile death is in every corner across the G talking about death around every corner the UN now speaking of around 80% of Gans having been displaced what's happening to them yes that's definitely true 80% of Palestinians have been forced to flee from the houses due to the Israeli intense bombing now they are all located in one District in raah District in the far south of Gaza Strip where they become very overpopulated area uh with notable uh demand and increased consumption of uh of products in the Palestinian market now they are taking shelter in public areas they went to to go for empty lands in order to set uh tinted camps to live and to protect uh themselves alongside with the family members uh they are facing very difficulty in terms uh a notable difficulty in terms of having access to enough amount of food uh they were they are also forced to line up for long hours uh to get some access for water uh and the they literally on the ground they are facing a very notable deterioration in their conditions uh I saw earlier today a number of residents who were crying as they walking due to the deterioration that took place uh to their conditions they said that we did not used to have this similar condition before we used to have everything uh what's going on in our life right now Everything Has Changed upside down and made growing concerns to be also displaced from ra District but where to go no areas remains inside Gaza as the bombardment had destroyed everything than you all right thanks so much T our Zoom let's
