well Dr Gabel mate is a physician author and Trauma expert he joins us from Vancouver now we appreciate you being with us here on Al jaaz put simply what's your view on the killings of thousands of Palestinian civilians during this Israeli military offensive it is a continuation of something that began in 1947-48 when um the sinist movement whatever its justification in terms of redeeming Jewish trauma in Europe realized that the only way they can establish a Jewish state is by the exposion and mass killing of Palestinians and that's been going on ever since and that's not historically controversial this has been documented by Israeli historians reported on by Israeli journalists it's just a continuation of what's been going on now for close to 80 years and uh you know there was the Hamas attack of October the 7th but what Israel was doing as long long ago stopped being a response to that it's what it really is is the continuation of the political extinction of the Palestinian people given what you say I mean how important is it to understand the historical context of the events we're seeing today well without that context October the 7th just looks like another anti-semitic outrage and of course you know I don't know any body who justifies supports or thinks Fair the killing of civilians or The Taking of syian hostages and from the perspective of not knowing the history it just looks like another Pilgrim that used to happen to Jews in Eastern Europe but if you understand the context it's a different story altogether because Israel has been conducting quite apart from what happened in 4748 in 56 and in ' 67 since ' 67 it's been conducting this rapacious brutal murderous occupation of Palestinian lands and the suppression of Palestinian people and their continued ethnic cleansing and from that point of view however unjustifiable maybe some of the actions that occurred on October the 7th may seem and and are it's no longer a question of anti-Semitism it's a question of a people desperate somehow resist an occupation and uh Janine that you mentioned on new reports well I've been there those people have every right to resist by arm force a brutal occupation every people have the right to resist that and as long as we only talk about Israel's right to defend itself we're not asking what about the right of the Palestinian people to defend themselves so again we don't have to justify we with any particular action but we thought they still context it just seems like um a country defending itself against unjustifiable attack well the tactics may have been unjustifiable but the resistance is not as you say you yourself have visited the occupied Palestinian territories uh what was your impression of what you saw and how did that affect you well I've been there three times the first time doing the first in probably around 198 n or so I would think I'm not sure exactly the year and I mentioned in other interviews I just cried for two weeks at what I saw because the Palestinian narrative is simply not presented in the west and we're seeing it simply to the eyes of this is they're terrorists and they want to kill the Jews and they want to destroy Israel and what I saw was a people in deep suffering and deep oppression human beings just want to live live like human beings last time I was there there was a year and a half ago I was working with Palestinian women who' been tortured in Israeli jails and as somebody said to me there we don't have postraumatic stress disorder here because the trauma is never posted so this is a people living under constant trauma and when there is an a an explosion of Palestinian rage La day was in October the 7th then the world notices and is horrified at some of the things that happened but again that explosion was almost inevitable if not justifiable it was certainly inevitable given what those people have suffered including of course the people in Gaza where in 2025 an international study from that the most traumatized children in the world were actually living in Gaza this is [Music] 2005 given what you say what message would you give to the Israeli government right now you give messages to people who are capable of listening that Israeli government is determined to dominate all of Palestine the could Charter includes the denial of the rights of anybody but Jews to have a state west of the Jordan River so why would I say anything to them there's nothing to say to them I'm saying to the world world stop these lunatics before they destroy even more human lives and ultimately themselves but to the Israel government I have nothing to say to the Israeli people I would say wake up be aware of what's Happening a few miles away from your homes you don't know what goes on in your name you don't know what is being done in the name of the Jewish people you don't know the history and the ongoing suffering and the misery of the pales Ian people to the Israeli government I have nothing to say to them talking about history you yourself have suffered in the past tell us about that and how you feel that relates to others right now how does my own experience related to this is that what you're asking um I mean my people I don't have to tell you underwent the most horrific event in human history which was the Nazi Genocide and I say it's the most horrific because it was the delivered planned and mechanical scientifically organized destruction or attempted destruction of a whole people and I nearly fell victim to that as an infant I lived under Nazi occupation for a year as an infant uh my father was in force labor my grandparents died in MZ and the question is what lesson shall we derive from that experience one lesson to derive is the zist lesson which is that Jews have to be strong and ruthless and um beat down everybody else before they beat us down that's one potential lesson you can derive we can see where that has led us to the Mass Massacre of Palestinian children the other lesson you can derive from that same experience is let's not treat each other like nonhuman beings let's look at everyone like fellow human beings have the same rights same desires same aspirations as we all do so never again from that point of view is not a tribal slogan but it's a slogan for Universal understanding and truly if most people actually understood the real experience of the Palestinian people for the last 80 to 100 years they'd have a very different view of what's going on right now and you don't have to be anti-jewish in fact from my point of view the most pro-jewish you can do Jewish thing you can do is to stand up against this occupation because ultimately it's not good for anybody we understand that you're very much involved when it comes to uh children's trauma describe how children suffer in something like this not withstanding the thousands that have already been killed well uh children grow up with a fear sense of fear in the world a sense of lack of safety insecurity anxiety children grow up with grief children grow up with humiliation because their parents can't protect them and their parents are being humiliated so they develop a sense of themselves as as insufficient and and all kinds of mental health conditions the God and mental health system was overwhelmed long before before this last set of um violence and atrocity and so that mental health conditions like depression anxiety psychosis um these all you know attention problems these all increase as a result of trauma and that trauma is passed on from one generation to the next and what appeal briefly would you give to what you would call International Community who are watching what's going on right now what would I say to the International Community is that what you're asking indeed I'd say first of all do the research don't just accept what the mainstream Media or because the mainstream media generally is lined up with American foreign policy this is true at the time of the Iraq War the mainstream media yammered on about weapons of mass destruction we knew there weren't any nobody found any but that's what the mainstream media trumpeted at the time of the Vietnam War the um mainstream media pared the line of the state department in the Pentagon and that's what the mainstream media is doing now and people that wanted to find out what was really going on in in Iraq or or in Vietnam or East Tour or anywhere else they had to do their own research so first of all don't just get your information from the mainstream media look around and find those sources both Jewish and non-jewish both Israeli and non-israeli who question the mainstream M merited that's the first thing I would say is just get the information number one number two listen to your heart what do you feel like whatever your political opinions are what do you feel when you see these children's bodies being dug out of the rubble okay forgive me Dr gab mate we have to stop there we've run out of time but thank you very much indeed for joining us
