now let's get more on the intensified Israeli raids that are also going on in the occupied West Bank we can join Imran Khan he's live for us from rala there and Imran big raid going on in Janine and elsewhere in the occupied West Bank tell us more well the raid that started in Janine is by far the largest uh that we've seen since October the 7th it began around midnight and ended at 7 a.m. in the morning hundreds of Israeli soldiers were being told fought their way into the camp they met with stiff resistance from Palestinian uh gunmen uh once they managed to get into the camp interestingly enough they actually arrested a senior fut leader uh that's the other big political party here in Palestine interestingly enough the last raids that we've seen have all been against Hamas leaders not fut leaders the first time we're hearing about that the family actually says that the fut leader was actually badly beaten after he was arrested uh there was a lot more fighting going on and that's when they used a drone strike uh to try and keep control uh of the area um and then after that they brought in armored bulldozers three of them this time that's a big number we haven't seen really anything more than one in these previous raids where they dug up roads and destroyed symbols of resistance after that there was another rid began around 2: a.m. in Darden uh and that is where a 65-year-old palis I man was shot that's like four people who have been killed in these two raids in total however 56 people have been arrested in those two raids and another one in the occupied West Bank uh that brings the total of Palestinians in Israeli jails to 6,600 18800 of those are under administrative detention basically held without charge and since October the 7th almost 18800 people have been arrested and Iman all of this causing so much anger throughout the occup occupied West Bank what's going to be happening today in ramala well not just in ramala but across the occupied West Bank they've organized a general strike that's every government building that's hosp uh schools rather that's all of the shops the businesses everything is shut down and the strike Laura is actually holding take a look around you uh ramala is simply a ghost town right now um there have been protests that have been moving around uh rala expect to see those protests uh get slightly bigger during the day uh in a couple of hours there'll be another de an hour in fact actually there will be another demonstration outside the United Nations building Palestinians in rala in the occupied West Bank are showing their solidarity with uh the Palestinians in Gaza but much more than that this is all in the aftermath of that massacre in jab a refugee camp okay Imran Khan joining us there from ran thanks very much Imran well as Imron was saying in Janine in this raid there's been an air strike that hit the refugee camp Charles traford joins us now live from Janine Charles tell us first of all what you're seeing there well you join us on a street here just on the outskirts of the camp the refugee camp that is inside Janine we've been inside the camp we've looked at the level of Destruction there there's been talk about an air strike or air strikes certainly what we've seen that the locals describe to us as being air strikes I wouldn't say they qualify as that now whether indeed there were projectiles that were fired from some for of drone that remains to be seen but you can see the level of Destruction on this street cars destroyed the locals here are telling us that it would have been about 2:00 a.m. that um the Israeli military came into Janine this road here that you can see was literally just dug up by one of these military grade bulldozers that we see to the use being used to such devastating effect in in these raids that are now happening every night um there were tens we are told of Israeli soldiers that that that came into Janine last night there were a number of arrests there was at least three people killed here in Janine another 11 injured uh one in a critical condition but when you talk to people here their reaction as to why for example this was done here on the street where they say there were no clashes there were no uh there were no kids throwing stones um it was a quiet quiet night last night and this bulldozer just came in and dug this road up and of course they call it a form of collective punishment now there's a theory sort of banding around that this effort being made by the Israelis to destroy civilian infrastructure like this is a means or an effort by them to try and turn the local population against the armed resistance groups that exist here in Janine for all intense of purposes that seems to be failing there is no indication here whatsoever talking to the civilians that they would they would do that and bear in mind that Janine has for many many years been a center for the armed resistance here in the occupied West Bank there are various different factions various different groups a lot of weapons there have been a lot of arrests and there have been a number of people killed here since the beginning of the war and the situation has got a lot worse obviously since the beginning of the war on Gaza but there's no indication here of people being moved Enough by this kind of Destruction to turn against the armed resistance groups now this street we're told still no electricity electricity was turned off apparently just before the raid happened not right the way across the city but within within given areas um we're going to be going to the hospital we're going to be speaking hopefully to the hospital staff there about the level of injuries but yeah there is a great sense of fear and tension here in jine because these raids are happening every single night um the clear up operation continues here and U yeah we'll be bringing you more reaction throughout the day absolutely okay we will hear from you more uh Charles as you visit more people there in Janine and in the hospitals for the moment thanks very much for bringing are seen there in Janine refugee camp in the occupied West Bank following the latest raid
