Israel has been expanding also its ground assault deep into Gaza on several fronts with at least 15 of its soldiers having been killed in the last 24 hours as we've reported satellite images and reports from the ground show Israeli troops invading the territory from Three locations in the north and east Israeli tanks have been seen south of Gaza City on the main saladine road linking the north with the South Israeli media say the military is trying to reach Al Rashid Street along the coast if it succeeds the Gaza Strip will be effectively cut in half well let's discuss his military moves with Az haa who's a foreign affairs and Military analyst joining us from laor in Pakistan thank you very much for your time um so let me ask you first about this latest attack on jabalia refugee camp another one on this Camp uh Israel on Tuesday said that a top Hamas Commander was killed uh in the air strikes on Tuesday Tuesday we we've heard time in time about Israel having the most sophisticated militaries in the world why is one of the most sophisticated militaries in the world with all its Precision weapons why is it that it can't kill one top Hamas Commander which is it stated military objective without killing a 100 civilians thank you for having me well uh Urban uh combat is very tricky uh in fact uh Hamas actually rejected the claim that they had killed uh one of their leaders uh and so you know Israel has constantly been saying that Hamas uses civilians as as a shield uh but uh the second attack basically makes no sense because a Israel is made no Claim about why it did it and it seems to be part of uh this you know the unfolding scenario that we've been witnessing unfortunately and very tragically since October 88th following the Hamas military operation against Israel which is uh about Collective punishment you know I've been constantly watching your channel uh a number of analysts and international law experts have been very clear about the fact that all these actions constitute war crimes but uh going going in is where Israel is gradually losing its aetric advantage over when you say going in you mean you mean the ground offensive the ground incursion the ground offensive yeah the ground incursion because militarily technologically obviously the IDF is one of the strongest militaries in the Middle East and also in the world and Hamas doesn't have Air Force Hamas cannot counter that uh uh but once you go on the ground the asymmetric advantage that Israel has with reference to its uh its Iron Dome system or its Air Force or the kind of TNT that it has been dropping on Gaza according to their own uh you know estimates 11,000 bombs I mean sitting here uh I cannot even imagine the kind of TNT that they have dropped there right but once you go in you lose that ismetric Advantage because now you're going to go face to face man to man Street to Street Rubble to Rubble destroyed buildings to destroyed buildings right let me let me just pick up on that because as you say they have the air power to support this ground incursion and we've seen it we've seen it with the constant air strikes the constant bombing as the Israeli troops are going in and yet in in the last 24 hours or so we've heard of 15 Israeli soldiers killed what does that tell you about this ground incursion and the type of resistance Hamas is putting up what is Hamas doing to counter this in your view right as I said Urban combat is tricky I mean we can go back in history Stalingrad gry mosul fuja uh you you can bomb the city but ironically uh when you bomb a city you create a lot of rubble half destroyed destroyed buildings and then you go in and tanks and armored fighting Vehicles essentially after a while become fairly useless Because unless you you know you've got to get the dozers and everything you got to clear the rubble that you created in the first place uh and you need to have foot infantry even if you go in with mechanized infantry at some point people have to get down and that is where their initial Advantage uh is is uh essentially new neutralized because the adversary that you facing uh is in a place where it knows the terrain like the back of his hand uh and you know I haven't been to Gaza but from what I've been uh you know uh reading and watching over the last many many years about the tunnels and the previous conflicts uh that is where the where Hamas has an advantage so once the Israelis go in uh on Fort and as I said previously where they have to face off uh you know through infantry weapons and infantry weapons frankly uh even in 21st century are the essentially the same as they were in the 20th century you've got assault rifles you got sidearms you got shoulder fired rocket propelled grenade launchers uh Hamas now also uses uh you know innovatively these uh normally commercially available drones that they're using as direct attack munitions we've seen that on October 7th uh they've also said that they've got they've developed these uh these shoulder fired Rockets right which can take out the maaas and and the armored fighting Vehicles so yes uh it's it will now get down to the numbers and and how far uh Hamas can sustain this through ammunition food water the rest of it and whatever they've stored for uh for a you know protracted conflict very interesting to hear your your thoughts about this and and thank you for your sight AZ hater a foreign affairs and Military analyst joining us there from Lor in Pakistan
