well a truck carrying fuel has entered Gaza for the first time since the start of this war the UN has accused Israel of using fuel as a weapon of War during this whole conflict after more than a month Israel has allowed a single truck carrying about 24,000 liters of diesel to enter the Gaza Strip through the Raffa Crossing but that fuel is only meant for UN trucks to distribute Aid it's not for use in hospitals or for other critical civilian needs the un's refugee agency says it needs 60,000 lers every day for its basic humanitarian work the head of unra has warned about 70% of the territories people will soon have no clean water or fuel as generators desalination plants and pumping stations all stop working this crisis as we know has hit hospitals the hardest the largest alifa isn't getting the 10,000 lers of fuel a day that it needs and has been forced to suspend servicers and telecommunications companies are expected to run out of fuel on Thursday leading to network breakdowns well let's bring in Juliet tumor she is the director of communications for unra the UN Palestine refugees agency she joins us now from Aman in Jordan Juliet we've been covering this fuel crisis for weeks I know unra has been leading the charge here can you give us a sense of the scale here that the numbers really don't quite do it justice I mean yes um there are many numbers I think the number that should stay with all of us is that More than 70% of the population in Gaza were forced to flee their homes 70% and as a result now we have hundreds of thousands of people who have sought refuge in our shelters our shelters are overcrowded we do not have the enough supplies or the capacity to deliver assistance to that huge of a number and we also do not have fuel Juliet so with no access though this fuel is not meant for your operations it's not meant for hospitals what difference will this fuel actually make good question not much that fuel was conditioned the use of that fuel was conditioned by the Israeli authorities um a very small delivery of fuel I I don't remember the figure that you use but it's the equivalent of of half a truck right I mean it's not much we can use that fuel for two days to go to the borders pick up the supplies put them in a warehouse we're not even able to distribute those supplies or use the fuel for medical facilities or other um part of our humanitarian operation is there The Hope Juliet that even with this small amount that's gone in that this might be the beginning of more I know obviously Israel had had a complete opposition to any fuel at all now that they're allowing some in could there be room for negotiation for more given that the fact that this will will basically make no difference at all as you as you just described look uh every um gesture is is is welcome but is it enough it's by far not enough it's like the conversation you and I had when those trucks of supplies started coming into the Gaza Strip we call them A Drop in the Ocean so no it's not enough it's not enough and and fuel should not be used as a weapon of war and organizations like the organization where I work like and should not be begging for fuel because we need it for our humanitarian operation it's very very simple there are international humanitarian law implications of this too right Juliet Sorry come again there are international humanitarian law implications of restricting fuel it is being used as a weapon of War just like water has been just like food has been just like this whole Aid operation that we've been managing at Andre is being trapped is being strangled due to all these uh restrictions including those trucks that have been coming in very very good that supplies have finally started going into the G strip after two weeks of very tight Siege but they're not enough the volume is not enough they don't have fuel on them it's a cumbersome operation shouldn't be the case it's humanitarian Aid that should flow very easily and smoothly to the communities in need of course well we understand too that telecommunications which also requires fuel is now on the verge of collapse how long do we have anytime I mean in some parts of Gaza it already collapsed you see it's it's not very scientific you can't say oh well all across Gaza today there will not be telecoms it it doesn't go like that or oh the all the bakeries will shut down it's not very scientific it depends on how much St storage of fuel you had in a plate right so it's not going to be like a total shutdown and and this is why you know those very specific questions cannot be answered right what we do know is that fuel shipments have not come into Gaza since the 7th of October yesterday we had a very very small shipment of fuel that is absolutely tiny that was very conditional this is not what we need to run a massive humanitarian operation the size of the one that and runs in Gaza Julia tum they un's head of communication speaking to us from Aman and Jordan thank you very much Juliet we really wish you all the best with your work you and your staff thank you
