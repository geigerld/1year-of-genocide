it's been in a state of near Perpetual War for decades it receives billions of dollars a year in Aid and weapons and it has consistently broken international law by expanding its occupation and settlements is Israel a normal State how does it compare to failed States this is Inside Story [Music] hello and welcome to the program I'm SEL vaner Israel is a relatively young State and one of the most troubled fighting several Wars with neighboring states since its Creation in 1948 it has one of the world's best equipped armies thanks to billions of dollars in US military and financial aid each year the current coalition government is the most right-wing in Israel's history and before this Gaza War Mass protests were taking place for months against the government's efforts to weaken the Supreme Court's Powers Israel has ignored international law and United Nations resolutions on the treatment of Palestinians and the occupation of Palestinian land governments and international rights organizations accuse its military of war crimes in the brutal offensive that we're seeing in Gaza for its leader prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East a view often repeated by supporters but for critics Israel is a political entity that can only survive with repression the denial of rights and violence so is Israel a normal State could it be defined as a fragile state or does it have characteristics of a failed State we'll be putting those questions in more to our guests in a few moments first though this report from K Lopez huran Israel is under pressure with protesters demanding prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu bring home the captives Hamas is still holding in Gaza Netanyahu is often referred to as Mr security but critics including former Military Officers say he and his right-wing Coalition have failed the country too many social and political fragilities they say have been exposed and the war could magnify them it's derailing out of control as it continues to snowball and more and more death amasses and the cycle of death continues uh I don't think it's bringing security Now and I don't think it's it will bring security for the future I think it'll do the the contrary it'll be the opposite Relentless attacks on Gaza and the growing toll of Palestinian casualties have led to other concerns from the judicial system where Palestinians can be imprisoned indefinitely without charge to the inequality faced by Israel's minority groups other issues such as the expansion of Israeli settlements illegal under international law and the distribution of assault rifles to Israeli civilians I in the occupied West Bank have also raised alarm the Prime Minister says political Rivals are using the war to fuel baseless criticism we have a desire to avoid harming the population we have a very strong desire to hurt Hamas but long before October the 7th tensions were already brewing with some of the largest demonstrations in Israel's history netanyahu's push to curve the powers of the Supreme Court led to widespread spr condemnation at home and abroad critics accuse the Whitewing government of false advertising by presenting Israel as the only democracy in the Middle East now its war on Gaza has opened up another front there is a sense the country is in a Perpetual state of War Israel is trying to keep its allies close but as the horrors of Gaza unfold daily more around the world will be asking if Israel can function without being at War kaan for insight story let's bring in our guests in Chicago we are joined by Ali abuna the co-founder of the electronic inata an independent online news publication focusing on Palestine in Washington DC is Paul Turner the president and executive director of the fund for peace that's a nonprofit research organization that produces the annual fragile States index or FSI we'll be talking about that in a moment and in hia is Ilan Pape Israeli historian author of the idea of Israel a history of power and knowledge a warm welcome to you all Ali let's go to you first one year after operation castled that was the 2008 uh war in Gaza you wrote an article entitled Israel resembles a failed State and that assessment was based partly on the destruction that you saw in Gaza on Israel's standing in the inter International Community as well as other factors if you had to complete or rewrite that article today 14 years on what would be your assessment sadly it would be the same uh what I wrote in 2008 or 2009 and again in 2014 is Israel is a so-called state that was founded on expulsion ethnic cleansing and what uh historian Elan Pape is called incremental genocide and what we predicted over the years that is that this incremental genocide could become a very rapid genocide and that's what we have seen since October 7th a genocide that is being fueled by Lies by demonization of the Palestinian people by dehumanization and uh I think that a state that can only exist by oppress ing uh expelling dispossessing and ultimately Exterminating the indigenous people of the territory exists on Paul Turner uh president and executive director of the fund for peace a nonprofit research organization that produces the annual fragile States index as I said in the in the opener I want to talk about that index because you rate Israel and you rate separately Palestine on this fragility um gradient um explain to us how it works I mean the the briefly your methodology is that you look at a number of quantitative qualitative factors uh the politics of a country the economics of a country the Society of a country so we can put that up on screen because you you do share that with people who go on your website and then you give all these countries a grade and you put them in buckets from sustainable to at the at the low end of the scale um failed State essentially where does Israel stand I I think Israel is facing a really challenging situation and that it has both external and and internal pressures a lot of countries um that are out there obviously uh will will experience one or the other um those internal pressures have been escalating recently um for for reasons that you've already shared in in the broadcast um however I think it it currently is is far from a failed State um when when we think about failed States a lot of times those for example in the security sector uh they they talk about how they no longer how they have a monopoly on the use of force um within their borders at the fund for peace is as you referen we tend to believe it's it's more meaningful to talk about uh terms of State fragility than than State failure necessarily because every country in the world has pockets of fragility uh and that fragility exists on a spectrum or a Continuum where countries have very high social economic political and security stresses and some have less um and is Israel is is experiencing a combination um countries at the top of our fragile States index for example like Somalia and Afghanistan have difficulty governing across their territory uh they typically have Forest borders often armed groups operating within their borders and experience major societal divisions uh fragile States typically experience protracted recurrent humanitarian crisis uh with with high levels of sustained human suffering so as you hear some of those descript is of of a a failed State you can tell that Israel really has has quite a ways to go before it gets there which is a good thing but it's also experiencing those incredible stressors and it needs to be proactive in dealing with those in instead of let letting them fester and and exacerbate so I noticed actually looking at your index so to be clear index um Israel rates pretty highly uh it rates pretty well in in that index it's near uh where the United United States is it's in the 140 range and you measure about 179 countries if I'm not mistaken but uh a while ago a while back you used to measure Israel and the occupied West Bank and you would get to a very different grade overall grade whereas I've noticed now over the last I think it's three years you measure Israel and Palestine very uh you measure them separately and such that Israel gets a essentially a good grade it's you assess it to be a stable country and Palestine a low grade on fragility index why did you disassociate the two bearing in mind that Palestine is uh the Palestinian territories the occupied West Bank is well occupied by Israel uh great question so with with all things we do our best to let Data Drive us we we um uh strive to be the nonpartisan and and uh not not show favoritism and let the information lead where it may um so as a lot of different um data sets begin to uh to provide information both on Israel and on Palestine we followed suit um we work by pulling in thousands of different data points both from existing indices as well as from um kind of tools that are are designed to to go out and look at what's on the internet and bring that forward and then work with experts to qualitatively assess that so uh as new became available that allowed us to separate the two uh that's why that happened there wasn't anything else behind it other than that sure but it it does present a very different picture when you look at them together and they are inext inextricably linked certainly and and I think um it it might be a little bit naive um given the uh interdependence within the region to to only look at those two uh because I think that you'll see um the activities taking place today in Israel and Palestine are having a huge impact across the region and so to to be able to um to justifiably separate you know any attempts to understand what's going on by only looking at one place or another I think does it does it a real disservice Ali I see you frowning uh I'll give you a chance to address that in a moment but I I want to turn to Elan um Elan you know when I look at the FSI the fragility uh index it it goes from essentially failed to sustainable now correct me if I'm wrong but looking at the long Arc of your work um I think it's fair to say you argue pretty powerfully that Israel in its current construct with its current policies within its current borders um and with its current Administration not just of of Israel but the occupation of Palestinian territories that trajectory is not sustainable is that fair I think it's a fair assessment because I think Israel is not just a state Israel is a project it's a settler Colonial project and I do think that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of this uh project because it rests on three pillars one is material of course and and there I agree I mean when you use an index that looks at sustainability of State according to their material capability Israel is doing well and as you mentioned in your introductory remarks he does well because of the mainly because of the United States so this is a condition that can change the second pillar is the social coherence of the settler society and we know that this coherence is non-existent anymore uh there is a bit of an optic illusion because of the Hamas operation on the 7th of October that created a sense of unity but it's not going to cover up for the uh frag mation of the society that we have seen until the 7th of October it seems that coherence that is based on social coherence that is based on hatred of of the Arabs or the Palestinians and doesn't have very much anything else in common is not very sustainable and more importantly than anything else of course there is the legitimacy pillar and of Israel enjoys the legitimacy of Western governments or uh governments in the global North and therefore there is a sense that it can still be sustainable because of that support of the elites but it has lost the support of the Civil societies and this is why probably it's the only state in the world that lobbies for its existence not for its policies not for its better economic uh performance but but but for its very uh moral justification and it's Los that battle uh just a caveat uh uh as an historian I can tell you that when projects like settler colonialism are reaching their last phase unfortunately this can be quite a long period it doesn't happen in one day or two days and the problem is of course that they become more brutal and ruthless in that last phase which is on the one hand very bad news for for those who are the victims of this state or been always the victims of this state which are the Palestinians but it also means that the Palestinians can and have to get their act together because I do think there will be a vacuum once this uh colon settler Colonial project disintegrates and there will be something else coming instead of it which of course uh we all hope at least I hope that the Palestinian Liberation movement would lead us uh into a better future when this will happen Ali what did you want to say earlier yeah I I just I mean you saw me making a face it's because I find this kind of very dry very technical uh pseudo uh academic discourse of these indexes as if you can measure these things with numbers and it all looks very objective I just find it very unconvincing and I find it unconvincing and this is not anything personal about your other gu guest it's a comment on the structure of how these indexes are produced but when I look at the website of the fund for peace this organization it's funded by the British government the Australian government the Dutch government by NATO by Chevon by a major oil company among others and so these are not um parties that are going to produce research that uh casts Israel in a True Light to talk about Israel as a stable country when it has murdered more than 7,000 children in the past 60 days to talk about Israel as a stable country when it is has attacked and destroyed hospitals when it destroyed uh in the last few days the Palace of Justice in Gaza destroying the court records and the legal records for hundreds of thousands of people this is not a a country or a state by any normal definition and to talk about it in that way is utterly obscene and shows a complete disconnection from reality uh look at the pictures on the screen now this is not what normal countries do and uh to to separate the West Bank and Gaza from Israel is another fiction to pretend you can carve off Israel as some kind of normal stable country and the West Bank in Gaza to even there's no Palestinian state to call Palestine EST state is false it's like calling the wars or ghetto EST State uh this is a killing field and it's utterly obscene to uh to to to uh distract attention away from that Elan is correct this is a settler Colonial project and it's one that has only ever been able to exist through massacring Palestinians uh starting from the 1930s with the Bings that the zionists carried out in Market places in Palestine to the massacres of derin and Andia and Sabra and chatila to today normal countries don't exist on the basis that Israel exists of Massacre after Massacre after Massacre Israel is not a state it is a criminal Enterprise Paul I assume you probably want to write a response to some of what Ali was saying about the FSI this the your the fragility index that you put together um sure I I can just share briefly that uh we actually haven't had any funding in the development of the fragile States index for many years uh so that that's all done inhouse um and we haven't ever had a donor come in and and tell us um how we are to use or to manipulate data uh that that's not something that we would stand for and goes against our operating principles um I think that there's a little bit of of internal dissonance or or friction in terms of our our conversation um there are a number of countries including my own um that are are fairly stable uh but are also involved in in Acts that go against some of the the international norms and and and even arguably the rule of law uh we were involved in two conflicts for almost 20 years um and and have uh active operations taking place around the world um that um that didn't necessarily destabilize us as a country other than having some economic impacts uh so I I think that that that may be something that uh is worth really trying to parse out uh issues of stability versus whether or not we see um approval in the way that a country conducts its business um and whether there is human suffering that's taking place that's a question I was actually wanted to ask you is about this sustainability since since you measure country R the FSI measures countries right from from being a quasi failed state to being sustainable um and I would point out that your report was put together I I believe before the Gaza War it may look a little different now I don't know how you would update it um in fact that's the heart of my question is this what we're seeing um sustainable if you factor in what's happened in the last two months that's a a great question um I I think that when you look at Israel and and and what is causing some of the issues of its fragility we see uh concerns in two different places one is in the area of group grievance kind of the internal divisions that are taking place and the other is around the factionalization of the elites um whether or not the what's taking place the last two months is sustainable um you know we don't have a crystal ball nor does anyone else um I I think uh as we look out to the future we could anticipate fairly significant drops in in uh fragility in other words it's becoming increasingly fragile um and I think that the data will certainly reinforce that um we also have a tool called a crisis sensitivity simulator where you're able to take the historical data and introduce low medium or high Lev shocks to a country and see what happens and then when we do this with Israel uh we see that that it does have uh a protracted effect over time and I think we could anticipate a multi-year effort to recover from from the shocks that this is creating both internal and externally okay let let me take that to to Elon um so Paul was talking about Israel would be will be increasingly fragile as a result of of this conflict what we've seen over the last two months uh it's possible that future reports will reflect this you told us a few minutes ago that you think this is the beginning this marks the beginning of the end of Israel's settler project I was wondering what makes you believe that do you see concrete signs of that or is that uh is that more of a general perception no no it's not a general perception I can see very concrete evidence for this uh the um debate that was was was more than a debate it was almost like a called Civil War that did not at all concern the Palestinian it was an internal Jewish debate between uh you can call it the secular state of Israel and the theocrat itic fundamentalist state of Judea namely the state that grew in the occupied territories in in the settlements you could obvious you could clearly see that the idea of a Jewish State translated into a an ethnic racist uh theocracy is winning over the idea which would anyway to my mind was never going to be uh realistic of having the same occupation and colonization alongside a pluralist liberal uh Society so between these two options the options of a fundamentalist non-democratic some would say even fascist uh Jewish State and I'm I'm not yet talking even about the Palestinians uh is winning support among a large sections of the Israeli Jewish society and that means that internally there is hardly any cohesion to keep the society uh together and economically the people are holding Israel together from an economic uh perspective namely the economic Elite of Israel belongs to the secular so-called liberal Israelis and they were about to take out their money out of Israel before the 7th of October many of them talk about talked about relocation or IM immigration uh the uh events in the last two months gives the impression as if this is all behind us but it's not this will return and of course I I I would join Ali in in in saying that apart from all of this the colonization and occupation of millions of Palestinian through State apparatus that involved hundreds of thousands of people to maintain it is not as an historian I I'm I'm sure this cannot be upheld forever and uh this is not just because of the the Palestinian resistance but it's also because of uh uh processes that we see taking place in the neighboring Arab states in the Muslim world in the global South and in the large section of the Civil Society in the global North all of it doesn't evot well for the for the Zionist project because it seems to be going against history if you think about it history is now moving towards decolonization to the end of colonial projects the end of settle Colonial project and Israel is moving into enhancing the settler Colonial project there's so many groups in the world that see that their own struggle for justice is the is combined with the struggle of Palestine for justice yes it has not yet influence the governments but it has the potential to do this you know you can look at it differently there is a huge movement of solidarity with the Palestinian called the BDS the boycott divestment and sanctions the Bood and divestment is working the sanction has not happened yet but you can see the movement the potential movement from the B and D if you want the boycot and divestment into the suction exactly as happened in the case of a part South Africa that's why I'm saying in this story we see all these indication that this is about to change unfortunately as happened in aart that South Africa this is a moment a very dangerous moment also for the Palestinian people because these regimes always fight uh for their life with the most ruthless and most powerful lethal weapons as we can see unfolding in front of our eyes in the Gaza Strip today just briefly uh Ali I'd like to bring you back in and this is probably going to be the last answer as somebody who's uh advocated for um one B bational states with equal rights for all um do you agree with that assessment that we might be right now witnessing the end the beginning of the end of Israel's current political project yeah I just I just want to be clear I I didn't mean to suggest uh regarding the fund for peace that uh any of these funders were coming in and directly manipulating the data of course not I just meant to say that an organization like that knows that if they're producing information truthful and critical about Israel the funding from the Pentagon the state department and the defense intelligence agency which the fund for peace also receives according to its website would pretty quickly stop but yes we are seeing the end of this colonial project um it's a bloody end uh it's much bloodier than South Africa because at the end of the day the South Africans said we don't we we can't sustain the level of violence it will C it will take to keep our white supremacist settler colony alive and they went into negotiations to peacefully end apartheid Israel needs to be brought to that point through maximum International pressure and the state that commits genocide as Israel is doing right now as we speak has to be brought to a peaceful conclusion and replaced with true democracy equality restitution and decolonization there is no future for this genocidal entity in Palestine or the region and it has to be brought to a peaceful end Ali abuna Paul Turner Ilan
