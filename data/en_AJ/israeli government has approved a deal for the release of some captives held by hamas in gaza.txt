the Israeli government has approved a deal for the release of captives held by Hamas in Gaza prime minister Benjamin netanyahu's office has released a statement saying 50 women and children will be released over a period of four days during which there will be pauses in fighting it comes after weeks of negotiations mediated by katar but Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war there is Idle talk outside as if after the truths to return our abductees we'll stop the war so I'd like to make it clear we are at War and we'll continue with the war we'll continue until we achieve all our objectives eliminate Hamas return all our abductees and missing persons and ensure there'll be no element in Gaza that threatens Israel let's get the view from occupied East Jerusalem ham salut joins us live from there so hamda despite some opposition the vote finally went through what more do we know about the deal right Meen after around six hours of discussions and debate in the Israeli Parliament the vote finally went through to accept this deal that will see the release of 50 captives who are women and children in exchange for a 4-day pause in the fighting however the Israeli government statement did did not stipulate any of the conditions that they have agreed to for the Palestinians but it rather went on to say that they are hoping to release all of their captives and that this is a step in the right direction however in the statement Hamas released shortly after the Israeli government's decision they released a lot of the details that were reportedly part of the negotiations which include the release of 50 captives who are women and children the release of 50 Palestinian prisoners who are women and children a complete pause in the fighting this means that Israel will not allow any military vehicles into Gaza there will be no drones flying over the southern part of the Gaza Strip for the entirety of the 4 days and for the northern part of the Gaza Strip from 10: a.m. to 400 p.m. for those 6 hours there will be no air traffic there additionally Hamas has said that Israel agreed to not attack or arrest any Palestinian Fighters inside of the Gaza Strip for these four days asking additionally they said for hundreds of trucks of humanitarian Aid and Fuel and additionally freedom of movement for Palestinians on salahadin road where we have seen hundreds of thousands of Palestinians go from the north to the South evacuating that heavy Israeli bombardment now all of this is stipulated in those agreements but the Israelis have not yet released what they have agreed to this is all coming from the statement from Hamas but after 6 hours of discussion the Israeli government was clear about one thing that this is a simply a temporary pause in the fighting and it is in no way an indication to the end of the war but rather that the Israeli Army will regroup in these four days and continue their ground operation continue their Air Raids and continue with full force until they have achieved all of their objectives which include the return of all of the captives and the complete dismantlement of Hamas both militarily and politically okay thank you for that ham salut there for us in occupied East jerusalm let's get the view from the United States we can speak to Mike Hannah in Washington DC Mike so the Israeli cabinet finally approving this deal presumably this takes some pressure of the Biden Administration the US has a lot riding on the steel isn't it yes indeed the US Administration invested a lot in this deal it played an active role in a number of the negotiations President Biden himself went to Israel in person you also had a situation where American diplomats were traveling widely through the region an important point of contact in terms of getting all the parties together using leverage in some quarters and certainly this is something that is going to be deeply welcomed by the Biden Administration now I believe you were briefed by a senior Us official uh what did he have to tell you well it's astonishing actually the depth of the diplomacy that was involved in this whole process it's a process that took weeks and one must remember too is that you're dealing here with governments but you are also dealing with a non-state actor in the form of Hamas now these negotiations were ongoing very difficult obviously since many of them are not face to face they threw contacts cutter playing an absolutely critical role in all of this at one stage says the official Hamas went completely dark the whole process ground to a halt and at that stage President Biden personally called the Emir of Qatar and that was beginning to unravel and at that stage the deal began to come back together again and what is very interesting in terms ter of the briefing from that senior official is the degree to which President Biden was personally involved and handson the administration officials saying that Biden was being brief from hour to hour about what was happening he phoned or spoke to Benjamin Netanyahu at least 14 occasions he spoke to president CCE he spoke to the Emir of Qatar and this all helped bring the situation together and also restarted the process once it appeared to come to a halt now the official also made clear that from the announcement of the deal to the implementation could take as much as 24 hours saying that it looks as though the hostages will begin to be released Thursday morning uh local time and that at that particular stage we're looking at maybe a multi-day period in which the hostages are brought back those who are captured are brought back and the Palestinian prisoners are being released now the official also said uh that there are still some uh tees to cross and some eyes to Dot and that is going to be done back in qter before the full details of this deal emerg but certainly it's been a painstaking process involving a number of countries a number of governments and that one non-state actor amas but most importantly it appears the massive role that President Biden personally played in reaching this agreement Mike very interesting to talk to you Mike Hannah our correspondent there in Washington DC well we can speak now to James dorsy he's an honorary fellow National University of Singapore's Middle East Institute he joins me now live from Jakarta so still more details of this deal emerging every minute what's your reaction to what we've heard so far well I think obviously it's important to get whatever hostages when can out and as much Aid into Gaza but what this tells you is how difficult things are going to be going going forward with other words um once you get to the question of releasing Israeli military personnel held captive by Hamas these negotiations are going to go more become much more difficult my senses that Israeli Prime Minister uh Netanyahu was caught in a bind on the one hand domestic pressure which wants the hostages released and wants them released now uh and on the other hand the US pressure to uh allow for for a truce and the Israeli fear of course there is that Hamas would use that to its military advantage in terms of U regrouping restocking whatever it may be but I think more importantly Israel wants to come out of this war as having as being seen as having restored its deterrence deterrence capability what it's so far shown is its destructive capabilities it has not yet uh really succeeded in wiping out the senior leadership of Hamas or uh to paralyzing them and as long as it does isn't able to do so the question of its ability to deter uh and that's important not just uh Visa the Palestinians and Visa V Gaza but it's also uh in incredibly important in ter Visa Iran and in terms of its posture with the Gulf States okay and in terms of this deal uh we heard there from our correspondent talking about you know how Hands-On President Biden was in terms of these negotiations and interestingly uh before Netanyahu went into to discuss the deal with his cabinet he thanked President Biden for making the deal sweeter for the Israelis how significant do you think that is I think it is significant and one of the things that I think is also significant in this it took significant Israeli or us pressure to get this deal done which really tells you what it's going to take uh in terms of us pressure to get something more permanent in place if not a transition towards Palestinian uh self-rule of some kind you know Independence or control of Gaza at least um I mean on the plus side uh welcome release uh for the people involved in the fighting the humanitarian situation uh we are hoping that Aid will go through but prime minister Netanyahu making very very clear that the fighting is going to resume obviously anything is welcome that relieves uh pressure on Palestinians even if it is only briefly and uh brings the guns at least in some area is to fall silent but I think overall Israel is in no mood to end this conflict or end this war uh at this point it hasn't achieved its objectives yet uh and it also so it and not only for the reasons of deterrence but at this point it also needs Victory because it's lost the information war and uh so Israel has every interest in continuing this conflict and I think that's what uh uh that's what Netanyahu made clear really good to get your perspective James dorsy honorary fellow National University of Singapore's Middle East Institute speaking to us there from Jakarta thank you for having me
