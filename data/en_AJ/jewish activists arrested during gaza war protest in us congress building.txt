well Sonia May nox is a communications director of the Jewish voice for peace she joins us live from Washington DC welcome to the program overall then what does this protest actually hope to achieve this protest gathered over 400 American Jews rabbis uh students descendants of Holocaust survivors from all across the country gathered together in the heart of Congress to tell our president to tell our vice president to tell our elected official that what we need right now is a weapons embargo we need an end to the US funding and and aiding the and sending weapons to the Israeli military we need a ceasefire right now and the only way we're going to get that is through a permanent weapons embargo that will ensure that our weapons are not being used to commit a genocide but how much impact can you actually have though when you consider how committed the US Administration is when it comes to Israel the US Administration um likes to pretend that it is completely um oblivious to everything that um the incredibly popular Palestinian Liberation movement across the United States and the world has been doing and yet we have seen seismic shifts it's not enough we are going to continue pressing we are going to continue doing more but the only way that US foreign policy has ever shifted to Center human rights in its long history of doing terribly egregious things has been when there has been a popular Uprising demanding change and we are seeing that right now we were 400 people having a peaceful Civil Disobedience sitting in the heart of Congress but we represented the majority of American voters we represented the majority of the American Jewish population all of whom want to cease fire and support a weapons embargo let me ask you then have you had any contact with the families of captives trying to lobby for their release and what have they said to you we haven't met with those people but do have members with us who also have either family members or friends that are um that that are that are captive and we know from our from their conversations with their families and with their friends back in Israel that what everybody wants is to see a ceasefire and a diplomatic solution because that's the only way we're going to actually have a a future where everybody where're Palestinians where Israelis where everybody is safe and free and equal what kind of reaction then have you had to this protest and what happens next uh the the reaction from um the people that happened to be in in the building was quite positive the police were um obviously distressed um and uh they arrested over 300 of us um but we are going to keep going and tomorrow uh us-based Palestinian groups are organizing a massive massive protest so that the exact same time as the war criminal Netanyahu is addressing US Congress thousands and tens of thousands of people all wearing red will be forming a giant red line around Congress demanding this is the red line we have to have a weapons embargo now and Jewish voiceful peace will be will be there in the midst son Maron KN thanks very much indeed for joining us here on Al jaer thank you so much make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
