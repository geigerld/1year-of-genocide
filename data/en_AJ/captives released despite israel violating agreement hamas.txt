so yes we begin with that breaking news this news are the military wing of Hamas a kasan brigade says it's released two more Israeli captives after mediation from qat in Egypt it says they were released for humanitarian reasons our correspondent Sarah haret is live in occupi the Jerusalem for us but first let's go to T Abu aom who's in conun in Gaza so TK first off what are you hearing there in Gaza about the release of these two captures yes that's true uh today the military ring of Hamas Al kassan brigades has uh posted in telegram platform that they had released uh two uh Israeli hostages who are dual nationalities uh today after being suggested before to release them due to humanitarian uh reasons uh this time uh the uh the military brigades of Hamas had announced that they will release them without any anything in any charge uh for them also those two hostages released due to humanitarian uh humanitarian reasons and meanwhile before the the Israeli occupation government refused to receive those hostages without having any clear illustration why behind the reason of not uh receiving those hostages those hostages have been uh delivered to the regional mediators in order to be later uh handed over to the Israel side uh uh uh to the Israeli side uh right now so uh these kinds of uh release this is the second time that uh the military ring of Hamas released hostages before they have released two hostages a mother and a daughter who were holding the American nationality uh later they were uh they were released uh and they were handed over to the Egyptian side in order to be delivered to Israel so these kinds of steps have been taken by uh the Palestinian fighters in order to uh B the way for further kind of prisoner swaps in the future uh meanwhile the uh on the ground there in Gaza the bombardment is Relentless it's just continuing in an unrelenting fashion just as a third Convoy is arriving well uh Israel keeps bounding the Gaza Strip with thousands of strikes that really Pro massive destruction to Residential Building industrial sectors and even to private and public uh properities uh during the last hour massive bombardment took place in jabalia refugee camp also uh three-story building was leveled to the ground uh uh one Palestinian was killed and other were and other injuries were reported also in Dar Bah uh in der bah there was a residential flat was destroyed in addition a further strike took place in a zaa whereas a residential house was leveled to the ground and the number of casualties also have been reported uh till this current moment uh more than uh 400 Palestinians uh have been killed am the ongoing Israel strikes on the bes territory all right T we'll leave it there for the moment T abuo and conun in Gaza let's bring in Sarah haret whose life has in occupied East Jerusalem and Sarah so what about this release of the two hostages how is news of that release going down well interestingly I was just hearing tet there saying that tamas said that they're dual Nationals but what's being reported over here uh in Israel is that um they're actually Israeli citizens they say and of course none of this is actually officially confirmed but they're saying that they're uh two women that are elderly um they've named them as yurit y Shak and Yos LIF uh one of them being 79 and one of them being an 85 year old so still at the moment information is coming through it's not clear exactly the details as to for example their nationality as I was just saying and you know the last two um had US citizenship if these two are Israelis it will at least calm uh The Temper amongst families of those that have been held captive because there have been concerns that uh people with dual citizenship or foreign citizensh ship even were being made priority Israel has said that it's not involved in any of the mediations with Hamas um and of course we know that katar and Egypt especially Qatar with the help of the US has been uh across this and making sure that this is uh one of the conditions they put forward as the releasing of some of these captives all right Sarah thanks for that Sarah har more with you later well earlier I spoke with Isam Mamon and the senior spokesman for Hamas about the two Israeli captives that have been released here's what he had say it was clear uh we have declared uh on Friday that we were ready to release and another two Israelis women at that time the Americans accepted to have the two uh those two women back but the Israelis rejected that prime minister n rejected that but now he has accepted that maybe under the pressure of uh uh the street so have they actually been released now what is the process and when will they be returned to Israel well they were already released although the Israelis did not respect uh what we have agreed on uh they did not follow the uh rules which was discussed anyway that shows how the Israelis are not committed to anything they are not committed to what uh this whole release was done in in mediation with katar in Egypt so so what did Hamas in return for this release and and that you say that Israel has not adhered to in fact we get nothing we released them uh for humanitarian issues uh but we were talking about the process itself uh everyone knows that uh we want to guarantee the the safety of the two women so we asked to stop bombing Gaza at least for the time to release them sending them to to the Red Cross and then turning them to the authorities so the Israelis do not follow that at uh according to what we have agreed on anyway it shows that on Israeli side there is no trust can uh be talken about you can't trust the Israeli side and it shows how they do not uh accept to follow the rules all the time okay but so an Israeli military spokesperson said on Sunday that more than 212 people are currently being held in Gaza presumably that is now 210 do we now have a prospect for more uh captives to be released well uh I I think it was clear from uh the first time that we are not talking about the militants the militants are War prisoners and if you want want to talk about them we have to talk about prisoners every but we have talked about some civilians who were kept in Gaza and we considered those civilians as GS they are not uh hostages they will be sent back home as soon as there is a special conditions uh guarantee their safety and not being killed by the Israeli bombing not being killed by the Israelis in order to say those people were killed so that happened on Friday we hope that we may happen better than uh what happened today but anyway uh we will uh we will keep is is responsible for killing of those people because they don't care about their lives they just want to kill more people do you not have a big problem with these captives given that on the day on October the 7th ordinary civilians including the elderly and children were taken and that's just created a huge problem for you hasn't it here here we are going back to the Israeli lies here we are going back to the Israeli Lies We said that the first time we have only War prisoners soldiers from Israeli Army and then when when the Israeli Army fall down all the people went inside taking those people we are just trying to find who is where and this is a hard job under the bombing of Israelis on Gaza you can't follow all the lines or or or or all the situations while Israel is bombing everywhere so if they want if they want to have them back they have to give the Palestinians a chance to follow all the threats to find where are the people this is the idea H uh those lies were told by the Israelis that those people were taken as hostages it still lies and what we have done in the last uh in last Friday and today it shows how they are they were lying that is zamah Hamden senior spokesman for Hamas speaking to us from Beirut about the two Israeli captives that have been released let's return now to occupied East Jerusalem Sarah H is there for us and Sarah so oama hamon they're saying that the possibility of 50 captives being released as is being reported in the Israeli media simply not true yeah and it's interesting because again we still haven't heard uh from the Israeli government we haven't heard from prime minister Benjamin nany on this at all um and Israeli media tends usually to get this right but there's it's a real Quagmire for all of those involved you have Israel that insisting that it's not going to negotiate at all with Hamas it's many times been saying that Hamas releasing captives is a form of propaganda uh trying to prove to the world that it that it's not um as uh in what we what prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said is that it's not a terrorist organization um and trying to paint themselves in a good light and this is a line that he's used many times and says he won't entertain any sort of mediation with them or any conditions well of course Hamas you just heard there are saying that they they've required conditions that Israel has agreed upon I doubt very much that Israel will say that it's agreed on anything it's very much uh told its public which has been increasingly asking questions as to when are these captives going to be released um even just to get some information from the government they're telling us is very difficult they said that they Fel have felt that this hasn't been a priority if those two captives at least that have been released now are Israeli that could potentially appease a lot of the family members a lot of those that are concerned for their loved ones uh that have been taken across because so far the focus has seemed to be on those with jeal Nationals or foreign Nationals and of course um because this involves many other countries not just not just the us but a lot of other citizens from other countries so it'll be interesting to see if Israel is going to be responding to any of these claims uh this evening um they have often done so in the past but sometimes it takes a while and they have uh very much uh confirmed many times that they again will not be involved in any form of negotiation what we do know is that Qatar is very much pivotal to this with the help of the us as well but this also ties into the question as to whether there's going to be a ground offensive anytime soon because of course um for many some people are saying the delay in a ground offensive is to ensure the release of these captives Sarah thanks for that Sarah haret life for us in occupied East Jerusalem thanks a lot
