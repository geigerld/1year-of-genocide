now the images of people escaping north to south in Gaza strike a resemblance to the black and white images from 75 years ago when Palestinians were forcibly displaced from their towns and cities in Palestine nbar or the catastrophe refers to the forced expulsion of Palestinians from their homes back in 1948 when the state of Israel was created the images were seen now from gazra similar to those from nbar but in color and of course right now in 20 23 let's bring in nor who's a political analyst and writer joins us now from rala nor good to have you with us very striking pictures of hundreds and hundreds of Palestinians streaming South very evocative and a somewhat chilling reminder of History absolutely uh they are traumatic on a massive scale for Palestinians watching this fearing uh that this dispossession from the northern Gaza to Southern Gaza is just the first stage in what they uh uh you know dread uh might uh uh be uh just um a plan to get all Palestinians out of Gaza this is still a very haunting fear if you will for Palestinians watching uh the events unfold in the Gaza Strip the Ona says about 50,000 people were able to walk that Trail of Tears if you will um uh for miles and miles with their hands up waving a white flag carrying um um uh only what they can carry with their hands so it's a it's a very um striking image especially if you take into account that these people are going to the South where bombing continues and where there is very little anybody can offer them uh by way of food or shelter uh just the bare minimum of the requirements of life right and when you align those black and white pictures with those of today those those two sets of images uh right there we have the very context of everything that's happening that has been missing in so much much coverage of this conflict absolutely absolutely and and and I think it's so important to remind viewers of that context to remind viewers that the majority of the population in the Gaza Strip are in fact refugees uh the many of those who made that walk yesterday and in the days before uh themselves had to make it as children in 1948 so this is a recurring trauma for them um many of the residents of B hanun for example in the north have been displaced repeatedly during previous Israeli assaults so this it for them it it keeps happening it's a trauma on a loop if you will that they keep living in the absence of any safeguards or protections to them as civilians yeah what has changed in 75 years nor so bring It Forward too today talk of this truce perhaps a three-day truce gaining steam uh some kind of prisoner swap the heart of all of this yeah I mean I think the the news would be welcomed by everybody who might you know they need desperately a little bit of calm to gather themselves to receive uh uh humanitarian Aid one would uh think that the logical dialogue going on about uh the release of those 15 captives would include an increase of the humanitarian assistance we heard from Oxfam about two or three days ago saying that the amount of food that entered the Gaza Strip is just 2% of what it needs so people are are uh going hungry the the food that they buy or are able to find is not replenished in grocery stores uh that humanitarian assistance is urgently needed um it but it won't be enough three days or two days won't be nearly enough to meet the uh the needs of 2.2 million people who have been under siege for over 30 days denied uh access to just about everything and it remains to be seen whether that pause uh would include getting uh humanitarian assistance to Northern Gaza where it's really really darely needed uh there you have no no access to food no access to fuel no access to medicine for the remaining uh hospitals in that northern part and hundreds of thousands of people who continue uh to Bear the brunt of that Israeli offensive so the CIA director William Burns he's flying into cata and presumably his focus is going to be very much on on this issue the the potential for prisoners to be exchanged absolutely especially when we take into account that the talk um um or some of the insinuation the leaks that we've seen is that the the 15 would probably be dual Nationals so they would be um Nationals of of various countries presumably including uh Americans as well um and the US has had a very heavy role in all of this it has been involved um from day one um not as an Arbiter but more as a representative in many cases of the Israeli side it you know adds one more irony to the picture of all of this and one more complication if you will to the political Dynamic but that is the role the uh Biden Administration is playing and the presence of Burns in Qatar would indicate that there is significant progress maybe a few Kinks to be worked out but definitely a sign of progress also another sign perhaps more ugly sign is Israel ramping up its air strikes which is a familiar pattern when we come close to break in hostilities in these kind of conflict yeah I mean that's the pattern that we can uh definitely see in this round and in previous rounds every time a talk of a ceasefire approaches there's a ratcheting up of of violence and um not just the attack on hospitals or the vicinity of hospitals but we've heard from the UN saying that only eight bakeries remain in the entirety of the Gaza Strip 2.2 million people depending on eight bakeries for their staple food uh bread in Gaza is what rice would be to uh uh people in Southeast Asia for example there's just no uh going around without it no uh living without it that's what people depend on to survive so the the need for those things is awesome and and one has to wonder why uh attacking those sources of Life uh would uh uh would constitute or be justified as any kind of uh military Target no uh thanks very much for that stick around because we'll get more of your perspective a little bit later for the time being thank you
