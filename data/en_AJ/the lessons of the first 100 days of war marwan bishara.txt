for the people of Gaza the past 100 days have felt like a 100 years that's the message from the UN Agency for Palestine refugees as a grim Milestone is reached at least 23,9 168 Palestinians have been killed since the War Began more than 10,400 of them children demonstrators in Tel Aviv are holding a 24-hour rally to demand the release of captives held by Hamas in Gaza protesters also expressed their anger at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government's handling the crisis Israeli forces have conducted more overnight raids near romala and hibron in the occupied West Bank Israel has detained nearly 6,000 Palestinians there since October the 7th over 100 days of bombs and destruction some Palestinians in Gaza have returned to the ruins of where they once lived it's become a way to gather and console each other one of those women is um Al Abid she lost her home and many members of her family in an Israeli strike on Rafa she tells us how she and her remaining family are trying to cope I no longer have a home All That Remains are these ruins these have become my home I gather my daughters and we start reminiscing we remember that Abid was killed here Hamid died there kareim lost his life there and my grandchildren were killed in that corner we shed tears sometimes we cry our eyes out sometimes we're overwhelmed with Serenity this is our life this is our home we spend all day here we were gathering at home and all of a sudden the roof fell on our heads I told my son we should leave he refused and said said where can we go within seconds we were hit again with another missile my son's daughters were around me some were injured others passed out when she was conscious again she started crying weeping for losing our home I told her let's take my grandchildren to your sister's home and we can return here again the father refused and said we should not leave our home we live here we die here we are like all other gazin after a while Ahmed came back crying oh grandmother my father my brothers and sisters and my uncles were killed they were all killed I asked him what happened and he said oh grandmother our home was bombed and they were all killed inside Maran bishara aljazira senior political analyst is back in the studio with us Marwan you were telling me something before the show I'm wondering whether you can elaborate on that for our viewers you were saying that as um Palestine itself becomes weaker the Palestinian cause becomes stronger it's just the nature of things nowadays right uh since the assault in Gaza Gaza destroyed in front of our eyes in plain sight but the Palestinian cause have been revitalized there's certainly a Synergy between the two meaning the more the Palestinians have become victims the more the international public opinion is reacting in favor of Justice thankfully that there is a conscience of sort among the international public opinion but I think this time around there's even more to it than that uh if you look carefully about at those who are demonstrating around the world at those who are expressing themselves in favor of Palestine around the world you will see that there are three or four distinct groups you see them even together in the in the C capitals of Western cap the capitals of Western Powers Washington DC London Paris and so on so forth one you have the the anti- U uh um global warming activists the it's almost like a rallying call for the uh for the anti-climate change uh activists just as it is a rallying call for the life's black matter and anti-racism crowd you also see all these people the activist organizers in Palestinian uh demonstrations Pro Palestine demonstrations you also see the trend that's been quite strong the last uh 20 years or so the social justice Trend uh Israelis ask feminists in the west why are you for Hamas the answer is we're not for Hamas We Are For Justice in Palestine we are against war crimes we are against occupation against colonialism it's it's normal for a feminist to be against the domination whether it's male or otherwise of power of one against another group so you see these groups the anti- uh global warming the anti-racism the anti the pro-social Justice groups and activists all coming together in these sort of rallying for Palestine and what's in common between them what underlies them underlines their uh their call and even couples it is the fact is the generational issue it's the young people around the world who are standing for Palestine the hacks that are watching walks Fox News and BBC or whatever they are still you know couch potatoes saying yes for uh you know the establishments in the west and yes for Israel and and the old slogans that they've heard I don't know in the 60s and the 70s during the Cold War and so on so forth but a whole new younger generation is not ideological that way it's moral there's a moral generation that is against global warming that is Against Racism that is for social justice this new generation and we're seeing it now in the polls look at the Democratic Party in the United States for example look at the Young activist in the labor party in Britain for example look at the activists in the streets of Paris and Ma for example so you have a new generational thing a new generational energy for justice in Palestine which means that the future is promising in that way right so you have social movements and you have a a generational issue in favor of Palestine hence while Israel is giving Palestine a beating the Palestinian cause is gaining popularity around the world what other lessons have you drawn from the last 100 days so I'm going to summarize quickly because we've been speaking a lot about this the last few days the last few hours so I will say the foll first of all colonialism has no place in the 21st century colonialism aparted racism occupation of of the kind we've seen in Israel Palestine over the past 75 years the past 56 years certainly the siege of the past it has no place certainly it has no place if you want to have peace and if you don't pursue peace you're going to get War there is absolutely no doubt about that there is no way in between aparted stable and just goes on forever it's impossible three might does not make right Israel can use all the American weapons it has it's not going to gain legitimacy security or peace fourth Arab regimes who are unfair to their people are not going to be fair for Palestine America can be counted on for Israel under Biden I don't know if the next American president or the one after that will be as attentative as the old Zionist Joe Biden will be to for Israel so I think Israel is going to have to start looking for its own not just dependent on the United States and its protection and its money and its weapons it needs to be act like a Middle Eastern country rather than as a western client in the Middle East right and I think in the sense of what we're just talking about in terms of the social movements so so there's a lot of room for optimism that way right that something G to give when when the international public opinion as it gave for AP parted South Africa in the 80s we've seen a change in 1990s and last but not least there's the curse of geography we have 7 and a half million people Palestinians 7 and a half million Jews living in a little minuscule piece of land the maximum distance between them is about six miles between any Palestinian and any Israeli six miles in the end of the day either they going to have divorce nicely and happily or they going to have to marry together there is no Third Way violence is going to get worse with time because violence is going to change from using planes to using arms engagements because you're too close to be bombing one another real quick which do you think it's going to be marriage or divorce I don't know I hope it'll be marriage alha Z senior political analyst Marwan bishar thank you thank you
