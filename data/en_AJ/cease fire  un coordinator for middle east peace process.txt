L the UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process he joins us here in dah good to have you with us thank you for having me is do you believe we are close to a ceasefire so I know we've been meeting a lot of people I cannot give you the timing for that but what I can say is that uh I have been working on this now since the immediate aftermath of the startup I met with the uh for minister in Cairo Wednesday in the first week to have the assurances of Egypt's involvement in assuring humanitarian access through Egypt into the strip what the Egyptians have done is to provide for that capacity and uh now my I've sent my humanitarian coordinator there to follow that up and uh see is on the ground as we speak what does that mean are are you hopeful that soon Aid will be able to enter gasa well we cannot have an effective distribution of Aid in gasa in the middle of a war we need the space to get that in and get it distributed to more than 2 million people on the inside so that is what we have been working on into the nres over the last uh days and that's is it coming though Contin it do you think it's going to happen anytime soon I think it's going to happen and I hope it will happen as soon as possible you've also been uh having discussions with different diplomats in the Middle East I'm wondering from your discussions with the Iranian foreign minister what do you understand about an Israeli ground offensive might that trigger a response from Iran well now you're into the secret files and I am not we love the secret files yeah I know but I'm not accessing them as un so I mean don't ask me that question because honestly I can't respond to it I got to ask you these questions though you understand unfortunately you know we the people want to know what is basically going to happen next and the the the fear is the next phase of this will be an even bloodier ground offensive which will then trigger a wider escalation throughout the region let me put it this way without asking you to divulge what discussions you've had with anyone are you person ly worried that a grand offensive will lead to a wider escalation across the whole region Le let me put it that way the longer this going to last on the ground the more intensive it is the bigger uh the chance is for some incidents to happen that would trigger uh a very very dangerous situation also regionally that's my view and uh I see no nothing to revise that one at the moment and I must say that one of these incidences was the hospital incident in uh in gasa yesterday and I really want to step back and and present the condolences and my deep sympathy for for those who were hit by that one I I have had my family in situations that scares life out of you and I can only imagine how the Carnage was it's terrible and it's an example for why we have to go into this in order to give the necessary space for work to be done on the key files now supplies in uh get the space for that to happen and also actually to to have the space to address uh the situation of abducted people held inside Gaza do do you believe the parties are any closer to that kind of understanding I think it's pretty clear to both sides in this conflict and also I can tell you to the regional part parties that I've been in contact with and to the International Community that this is needed the question is when we set it the Secretary General is going to the region Now isn't he he is coming in tomorrow and I'm going with him there to participate in the political discussions that will take place in Cairo uh on Saturday there need to be a political framework addressed just now not only to deal with the nitty-gritties but also actually to look at the day after uh and if we don't start looking at the day after in the middle of the situation we are in now it will be too late what is the day after what should it look like according to your vision well we have to set up a system the day after that gives the necessary assurances uh to the people of Gaza that there will be a different direction coming an end of occupation I would just say it the following way if we we are not starting now to address the key issues that we haven't been able to address properly for the last three years we are on we are in the wrong direction of things okay but specifically there should be would you say there should be an end of occupation an end of Siege so that both Israelis and Palestinians can live in peaceful dignified lives with equal rights that is the international line that is the UN line how that will look when we start moving into and working it out that we will have to see and uh final quick question the Secretary General finally made a call for a ceasefire what prompted that did it have to take the bombing of a hospital for him to call for that we are superbly cautious both to what we are saying and when we are saying it and we are saying it when we think it's important to get it set it wasn't important 24 hours no I'll explain that for you thousands of Palestinians have died uh we have 1,000 I don't know more than 1200 Israelis have died right wasn't this important 24 hours ago yes it was uh but here is the background for that as I told you we have been working on the integrities of getting the space done to get supplies to two and 2.3 million people in Gaza we need to get that into place now it has been very clear to us from when I was in KY last Wednesday up until today that that space has not yet been there now we need it and that was why he addressed it now it has to do with where we are to resolve the conflict to address it thank you very much sir for coming in talking to us thank you thank you
