at least nine Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank the Israeli military is raided multiple locations including nor shem's refugee camp in taram at least five Palestinians died during armed confrontations at least 73 Palestinians have been killed and 1300 injured by Israeli forces or settlers since October the 7th only that ibraim joins us now live from rala so is The Siege another Siege in the West Bank turning bloody now yes and and you word that Palestinians haven't heard in years a curfew at the N Shams refugee camp where Medics are finding it difficult to reach the wounded and possibly the dead so we're hearing from locals inside the camp that they're unable to count the dead so far the Palestinian Health Ministry has announced that five Palestinians have been killed in tarim area alone after Israeli forces raided the refugee camp since the early hours of Monday they've been turning homes into military posts destroying roads there's no electricity no water inside the camp so we're talking about basically a total isolation of the camp where Palestinians are still trying to get to their dead and to their wounded so we are expecting that numbers to rise as we speak now and as Palestinian Medics are trying to get inside the camp and assess the situation let's not forget that this not isn't is not the first time that the Israeli forces raid the nem refugee camp because we've seen them do so before we were there just in late September and we've seen the Israeli forces bulldozing also through roads there are dozens of armed Palestinians there in the camp and we believe that Israeli forces are trying to Target them but as we've seen from early pictures from within the refugee camp itself some of those who were killed were not involved in the fighting a a a 16-year-old has been shot and when his father tried to help him he was shot as well the father made it but the son did not so we're talking about a very tense situation that is unfolding now in toim and that talk to us about how the anger the protests are shaping up across the West Bank and Beyond well let's not forget that Palestinians here in the occupied West Bank need Israeli military permits that are almost impossible to get to be able to see their fellow Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip so they are geographically separated and separated by the fact that they fall under one military occupation so you can imagine the amount of frustration some people have families in Gaza and they cannot even uh get a chance to get to check on them to call them because of the problems and the communications issues that are uh facing Palestinians there so there's a lot of anger but also you talk about Palestinians here in the occupied West Bank whose situation is probably a little bit better because when we talk about the death toll yes the death toll in the occupied West Bank is less than that in the besieged Gaza Strip but when you talk about the Israeli measures they are so similar you're talking about Palestinians who are saying that their lands are being taken that they're being targeted with an excessive use of force by isi forces so there's a lot of similarities between the way the Israeli forces are dealing with the Palestinians in their different geographical locations so you can imagine how that makes Palestinians feel and also since the beginning of the war Palestinians would tell you that the amount of arrests of Palestinians have tripled the amount of killings has increased 73 Palestinians so far have been killed just since October the 7th and we've been already saying before this current escalation that the Palestinians have had their deadliest year here in the occupied West Bank in two decades so you can imagine that 70 people or more have been killed just in a span of less than two weeks and in the whole year we had 200 Palestinians so we are looking at an intense situation and with the raids that are ongoing in different locations in the occupied West Bank tension is still mounting all right thanks so much nid ibraim reporting to us from the West blank
