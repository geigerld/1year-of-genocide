let's bring in M Bashar Al senior political analyst as we said to our correspondents a day to remember but also want to ponder about the future I mean the Naka has historical meaning right now but even that historical meaning is changing with time it is to some to some degree but I've actually always wondered why do the Palestinians commemorate the nakba since it's an ongoing process the catastrophe didn't happen in a day or in a year it has continued over 75 years nonstop and none of the issues none of the underlining issues that made it a catastrophe back in 1947 49 have changed refugees are still refugees dispossession is still dispossession occupation increased over the years repression and racism increased over the years Israel's Supremacy and the supremacy of Zionism in the land of Palestine having increased over the years so it's been 75 years of continued catastrophe topped this year and last year of this what they called even the Israelis themselves as you've reported earlier calling it the new nakba the neba of Gaza which really goes a long way to tell you um that uh what we've seen back 75 years ago and continues today requires a solution the solution that is not being provided and why does it require a solution say unlike you know when we comate I don't know first first world war or the Holocaust or what have you right it's an event that happened at one point in time more or less but here this requires a solution it requires a a historical context in the sense that and I've heard some of your discussion with your previous guests is it worse is it better and you know better not better but is it worse you know comparing the incomparable Horrors that happened to the Palestinians there is something to be said about that what happened in 1947 49 was a major disaster for the Palestinians because most of them were displaced this time around Israel is unable to displace Palestinians outside Gaza except a number of them that decided that just need could not tolerate any more or they were killed or or or or or sick or or what have you right so we are stuck and Israel is stuck today with more than 7 and A5 million Palestinians living in historic Palestine so the project of displacing of ethnic cleansing the Palestinians has basically failed and that's definitely important to recall and you say it needs reform it needs to be answered it needs to be dealt with we've got the the the world economic Forum happening in Doha right now and there are statements coming out of it certainly from the Saudis about the fact it says without a real political pathway it' be very difficult for Arab countries to discuss how we are to govern I.E lower the temperature make sure there's a two-state solution and be behind the Palestinians I mean this is a conversation happening between Saudi Qatar the United Arab Emirates and Egypt how important is it that these countries are you might say standing up or standing together in this forum not just in Doha but generally globally it's important to a certain degree that at least in terms of their declaration the Arab regime seem to be in agreement that what's going on today 7 months later is horrible it's a a genocide of some sort but just as they were divided in 1947 1949 just as they were impotent in 1974 1979 1947 1949 they are as impotent and as divided today and incapable of stopping a genocide that's taking place if this genocide was taking place as it were for example you know in Bosnia and and other places the Europeans intervene and there were a number of war criminals from Serbia taken to the hag but in our region in this region Arab leaders are incapable of taking care of uh or or preventing or stopping a genocide that's unraveling in PL side the only people who are capable and have been more capable than before of doing something about it are the Palestinians and this is the central point here because if the Palestinians did not stand up for their rights I don't think the Arabs would the Arab regimes would have over the past in fact pistan was going to become a Kama right a semicolon in this region if the Arab regimes and nany would have had it their way now after October 7 things have changed there's no doubt what's really most important to understand is that while the Palestinians have been pummeled while they have been beaten again and again and again why Israel has won one war after another War at least until 1967 right Israel might have won but the Palestinians have never lost they have never recognize their loss in terms of strategic loss to Israel so until today 75 years they are still struggling they are still fighting they are still steadfast if the Palestinians wouldn't lose Israel cannot win and if we just develop this a little bit more you know we talk about we talked only just last week about this whole American armed shipment being paused or not um it reminds me of the phrase because we're hearing now that this arm shipment is going ahead of the Native American Indians who would often say you know white men speak with fork tongue yeah and now we have this scenario where one minute it's a pause one minute we're sending arms to Israel it it's all about the USA and whether you can actually trust what they say this is the thing that uh our correspondent Kimberly out of Washington said about how the atmosphere in Washington is Biden trying to walk a fine line a thin line trying to balance between uh freezing uh am ammunition shipments and at the same time selling Israel new weapons which is kind of a contradiction in term right in the one hand you say I'm not going to send the the ammunition but I'm going to sell more a billion dollars of new weapons to Israel now you could say that as Biden put it well this is used for ra other ones used to defend Israel it's a bit of a fine line right between both but as you stated earlier I think I heard you in one of your interviews it's like that like the West stood with Israel back in 1948 it's standing with Israel today but there's a big difference in 1948 the West was still trying to cover up its complicity or role or whatever in the Holocaust and Israel was basically came out of the ashes of the Holocaust only a few years later for the past 75 years there was no Holocaust if any if anything it's the Palestinians that have paid the real price of the Holocaust 75 years later the West cannot say I am complicit for because of the Holocaust so they try to manufacture this whole humbug of anti-Semitism there is no issue more F in the west than anti-Semitism anti-Semitism is banned in the west so to provoke or to invoke the question of anti-Semitism in order to be implicit or complicit in supporting Israel that's a sham and we'll leave it there for now but continue to follow what happens as well thanks very much for your analysis bashara there our senior political analyst make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news
