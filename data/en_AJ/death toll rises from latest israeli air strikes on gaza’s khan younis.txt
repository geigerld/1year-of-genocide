well Israel also carried out air strikes near a hospital in Gaza on Wednesday the explosion you've just watched happened outside the alwafa hospital which is already out of service due to previous strikes nearly half of the Gaza strip's 35 hospitals have now been forced to close down well let's speak to alzer's hanni abua he joins us now from outside the al- AXA Hospital in de albala which is in central Gaza honey I've been speaking to you and all of our brave teams in Gaza for days now and today I really have no words how is wild doing well it's been very very sad morning for Palestinians living in in Gaza particularly people who live in nsat Camp where a a massacre took place at late hours of last night a residential home that was targeted and completely destroyed killing more than 30 people 13 of them are from one family and three of those people who got killed are the family of our colleague Al jaaz correspondent in in Gaza uh air strikes are everywhere and as we speak there is Heavy Artillery uh Shilling going on in the eastern part of the city of hanun and there bombing more homes and destroying more infrastructure uh there are uh uh air strikes carried out by sophisticated attack jits uh destroying every bit uh and every sign of life in the Gaza Strip the tragedy of this that there is a there's an extreme lack of equipment and Machinery to help uh removing the rebels and save uh people from under the reub the rebels unfortunately it's always late when when an attack happen on a strike destroy a residential home uh first responder paramedics rush to the side they save people who were in the vicinity of the attacks because they are the easiest to reach but those who under the rebels sometimes they stay there for hours and that's and it that's the reason why every attacks leave so many casualties and when you have a three-story building a five-story building coming down all the sudden with people inside and with no equipment proper equipment uh the the the number of people who are killed in the casualties is massive and you say in different parts of the Gaza yeah sorry I was just going to ask because you're saying that these attempts are still ongoing to get people out from under the rubble with barely any equipment no electricity I believe the people who are missing under the rubble included some 800 children yes that's exactly correct there are more than 1,800 children are missing under the Rebels on top of that there is an ex exact number of women and elderly as well under the building this number is scattered across the Gaza STP from north to south when people were ordered to evacuate from the northern part of Gaza all the way to the South they just found themselves in the past days under heavy bombardment and air strike similar situations uh that they were ordered to evacuate a FR uh which is very ironic some people decided that we want to go back and and die in our homes why do we why Israel is asking us to evacuate to a place that is supposedly be safe for us take it as a shelter and then come and bomb us so some of these families try to are are working on just making their way back to their home they said death is is is the same everywhere so we we better die in our homes at least people will know uh exactly who we are now the number of people who are at hospitals and and paramedics are unable to identify so massive it's because family members are scattered in different part say for example I I've known of a family that is two individual are in the in in in in the Central Area uh three more and in in the the the southern part one remains with the with the with the wife and children Gaza so if if anything happens to anyone of these family and because the the communication system is completely disrupted it's hard to get hold of everyone in the north and Gaza it's easy for people to go missing and not being identified for days of course and hany we're actually seeing from from our reporting as well that people are now tying armbands around the wrists of their children so then they can identify their bodies if they're wounded or or found dead I mean all the grief that we're seeing it seems that there's no respite either the bombardment has been continuing how are the hospitals holding up there I know you're outside one in in central Gaza right now yes well there's no sign of deescalation of the air strike it's either intense mass bombardment by air strikes or it's heavy artillery Shilling and sometimes both at the same time leaving no chance for people just to even think what is their next step now what people have been doing here because of fear of going missing and because there's no way to communicate with family members either they tie a bracelet into their children hands or WR using a a whiteboard marker just to mark them so in case h they they go into pieces they would identify those be and this is exactly what happened the past two weeks a family member recognize his siblings the the the pieces the flesh pieces of their sibling just from the Whiteboard markers that he used to mark them it's such a very very heartbreaking uh situations for Palestinian literally running for the life and and and trying to save as much as they can terrible terrible stories Hy abua there on the ground for us in the central part of the Gaza Strip thank you so much honey and please please we hope you and your family also stay safe
