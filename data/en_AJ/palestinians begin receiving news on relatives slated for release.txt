there is some movement uh on this when I say this I mean the release of Palestinian prisoners these are the latest pictures that we're getting and there are pictures that are showing us the transfer of female Palestinian prisoners from Damon prison this is a prison near hia to the ofer detention center near rala uh just a little while ago this all of this in preparation for their release as part of this exchange deal remember 39 Palestinians to be released today some of those 39 it appears are in those trucks that you're seeing as they're being transferred from um from Damon prison to ofer detention center so n Ibraham joins us now from ofer prison south of rala in the occupied West Bank nid you may not have seen them but the pictures we just got and we just showed our viewers several white Vans leaving Damon prison headed to where you are uh there must be huge anticipation across the West Bank really tell us about what you're seeing on your end I don't know if there are families gathered what do you know let me tell you about the scene here we've seen those videos you're referring to surl of the buses being uh uh moved uh having prisoners being moved from adamon prison to inside here we've also have an important answer to one of the two questions since the morning families of prisoners have been asking two questions who's on the list and when they're going to be released now we have the names of 39 Palestinian prisoners who are expected to be released from AER prison that is just behind me now we've been talking to a family of one of the Prisoners the father his name is nafz his son raan has been in prison for the past eight years he says he's been denied from entering uh the prison to visit her but but he received the news as we were with him when he saw his names his daughter's name on the list he says that this is a joyous day for him but still he was saying that it's hard to celebrate given the amount of killing the scenes that we've been seeing uh for the past month and more coming from the besieged Gaza Strip under continuous bombardment now let me tell you about the people who are here they're waiting and they're looking at those buses we just have been talking about surl and they were looking to see whether there are three buses who were lined up before theer military prison they were guessing are these the female prisoners who have been just uh gotten out from the Deon prison have they made it here you know this area is very symbolic of the occupation when it comes to Palestinians because not only does it have theer military prison but it also has theer military Court in which we see Palestinians including miners being trialed and being uh uh taken to military Courts for uh uh what Israel says are crimes that they've committed so now we're talking about this scene this location over here being one of the most important ones that Palestinians are looking at for the potential release happening here we've been speaking to also families of those prisoners whose names have appeared on the list from Bethlehem they're from Jericho Janine all across the occupied West Bank and they've been telling us that since they've seen the names of their family members on the list they've made it here but let's not forget we're talking about 39 names and when we compare that to the numbers and the thousands of Palestinians who are currently in Israeli prisons we're talking about a fraction still it is indeed a happy day for those Palestinian families who are going to have their sons and daughters back home with them now if day to day day after day these uh exchanges of captives versus prisoners happen and if this continues for the whole four days you should see 150 Palestinian prisoners released I don't know if this will all be happening at oer where you are but for right now um what is your sense of the timing of the release am I correct in assuming that this will only happen once we have knowledge of the Hamas captives being released indeed this is what Palestinians are expecting and they also believe that Israel would continue this waiting game as much as they can to give Palestinians kind of like a difficult time you know we have families here who are saying you know although we've seen the news that they are expected to be released here we're seeing buses being moved here but we're not sure because in the past we've seen the Israeli forces changed the location of the releases of Palestinian prisoners several times there has been one incident of a Palestinian prisoner a hunger Striker who has said to be released in one place all the journalists everyone and the family members went there but he has been released from another place he didn't have a phone on him he had to call his family using one of the people who were passing by in the occupied Westbank to call his family this just gives you an idea of how difficult the waiting game is how everything is uncertain and even those families who were telling us you know yes we've seen the list we hope that they're coming but let's not get ahead of ourselves we don't know what might happen you know so th this is part and parcel of what Palestinians go through when they talk about their detained Palestinians that they can't visit them you know since October 7th the visitations have not been allowed but for some families for security reasons that Israel says they don't even get to visit their family members at all so this gives you a lot of uh uh kind of tension anticipation I I hope that I am conveying the picture that many and the feelings that many of Palestinian families are going through right now no look you absolutely are and the issue of Palestinian prisoners this is why we spend you know time talking about this the issue of Palestinian prisoners is absolutely Central to the Palestinian uh nationalist movement and nationalist cause nid Ibrahim reporting there from ofer in the occupied West Bank
