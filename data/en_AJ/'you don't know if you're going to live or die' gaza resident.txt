well since the war on Gaza began on October 7th exceptional levels of damage have been inflicted on the Strip the UN estimates that around 183,000 houses have been damaged in the bombing that's around 45% of all homes 28,000 homes have been completely destroyed leaving entire neighborhoods flattened out of 35 hospitals 16 are not functioning 51 basic health care centers have closed and 50 ambulances have been damaged 1.4 million of gaza's 2.3 million people people have been forced from their homes in a territory that was already densely populated Al jazer hanim Mahmud spoke to a young woman in harit about life under the Israeli bombardment well it's certainly been very scary I think the best word to describe it would be like uncertain because the uncertainty surrounding the entire situation it's very scary you don't know if you're going to live or die you don't know if you're going to be able to stay in this place you don't know if you're going to be able to have enough food to eat eat tonight and a big part of it for me was that I don't know whether any of my friends any of the people I care about are alive are safe because I have no way of contacting them and it's so scary it really is so scary cuz like it was so normal everything was normal a month ago and just after one day my whole life has been flipped upside down and I don't know what's going to happen and I don't know if I'm going to be alive tomorrow Fatima we know some of the foreign Nationals and and palestini with you with the dual citizenship were contacted uh and because their names were listed to leave Gaza have you been contacted by your Embassy or anybody talk to you and if so are you planning on leaving with your family or what what's going on we have been contacted by the Canadian embassy they've been emailing my mom but like the emails are really of no use they just tell us they give us these useless tips they tell us stay cautious make sure you're in a safe place but there really is no safe place they haven't been able to guarantee us a safety if we want to go to the border so we are most likely planning on going when our names come out but we're not sure what's going to happen my dad said like it depends on how the situation plays out we really don't know Fatima someone at your age early teens of your life what are your expectations I know it's very difficult to do to ask question like this at these difficult time but walk us through what are you what are your hopes what are you expecting my hopes I hope that this war will end as fast as possible I hope that we'll be able to get our land back I hope that I'll be able to lead my normal life again I hope that I'll be able to go to school and see my friends and I hope I'll be able to see my family and that everything will be okay but I just don't know what's going to happen cuz looking around me the building right behind us got bombed and it's so terrifying looking at those ruins thinking that could have been me it was right beside us it was it's terrifying because I really don't know what's going to happen like I said no one knows what's going to happen the there's nowhere that is safe we don't know what to do I don't know what to do PA a message to your Embassy the Canadian embassy and your government official what do you want to tell them get it together why are we not being guaranteed safety to get to the Border I don't understand how they can send like how they can send aids to the Israel to Israeli people but we can't even be guaranteed safety to leave our to leave this country to get to safety like there are so many people who have tried to get to the border and they have been killed so how do we know that we won't be one of those people how do we know that we can leave safely it's like they haven't guaranteed us anything all they do is send us emails telling us to stay safe but they give us no way of staying safe they really haven't done anything for us and I'm so disappointed about that and I've heard that my friends of some of my British friends they've already been able to leave and I'm so happy for them but I'm just wondering why not us why haven't we been able to leave yet I don't like they haven't been able to guarantee US Safety they said they can guarantee US Safety on the Egyptian side they can give us a loan of $100 so what so what I still don't know whether I'm going to be able to get out of here alive there really are no guarantees and that's the problem
