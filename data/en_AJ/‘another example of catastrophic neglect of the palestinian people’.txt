challenge there let's go now to Dr James Smith he's an emergency medicine doctor he worked in gaza's hospitals during the war and he now joins us from London good to have you with us I'm sure you're following what's happening at the nassa hospital how worrying is it to you as somebody who's worked in Gaza hospitals that a hospital can be shelled it can be stormed the medical staff treating patients rounded up because a Waring party claims it suspects bodies of of captives might be at this hospital I mean this is another catastrophic uh example of another egregious attack on on a on a healthc care facility in in Gaza in the last 3 four months alone um more than 400 attacks on healthc care across Gaza um almost the same number again in occupied West Bank um what's happening now in in in in NASA hospital is symbolic of or or representative rather of uh a complete neglect of the most basic rules that conduct uh that that that guide conduct in times of armed conflict um as you've mentioned and as we've heard we're hearing stories of patients that have been killed in their hospital beds uh artillery fired directly into the hospital patients that have been killed because the electricity has been cut from the hospital um others who've been forced to flee uh but then fearing for their safety having to pass through um Israeli uh military um um screening have returned to the hospital uh it's really yet another example of the most catastrophic neglect of the Palestinian people all right there was a a statement and see if we can bring it up uh came out of Medan s Frontier uh in which they were talking about let's see if we got the script all right so what they were talking about is that the NASA Hospital in Khan Yunis in Gaza was shelled in the early hours of this morning despite Israeli forces having told medical staff and patients that basically they should go back and and stay in the in the hospital um are we reaching new lows it's it's hard to understand how something like that can happen uh I should be really clear here I mean I think those new lows have already been reached over the course of the last couple of months we have reached those new lows and we have stayed there and what we're seeing now is a global either neglect uh or inability to do anything about uh what the Israeli military is is doing in Gaza currently um these latest examples from NASA Hospital are Beyond tragic um they fill you with sadness and and and rage um but they are um yet another example of of exactly the kind of things that we've seen in alifa some months ago and in several other healthc care facilities across the Gaza Strip is there some obligation upon the world powers now to intervene basically are we seeing a failure that's on a much higher level than just the Waring party absolutely uh there certainly are very very clear obligations they existed um prior to the international court of justice uh ruling but they are certainly made even clearer now on the back of the icj ruling uh the icj has imposed provisional measures um saying that there are uh uh very plausible concerns that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people there is no uh allegation more grave uh than than than that of genocide um that places immediate moral political and legal um obligations upon all um world powers particularly those who up until this moment have continued to finance and to provide political and diplomatic support to the Israeli State and by this we mean of course uh foremost among those States uh the United States uh the UK and several other influential European and North American uh government all right good to have you with us thank you very much for your perspective
