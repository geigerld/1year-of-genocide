well meanwhile the armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad the Al's Brigade says it's prepared to release some captives for humanitarian reasons we announce we are prepared to release a woman for humanitarian and health reasons considering we will not be able to offer her medical treatment we are also prepared to release a young man for humanitarian reasons because he is of a young age and consider the Israeli prisons are full of Palestinian children this is an initiative that will come into Force once the necessary requirements on the field are present well let's get more on all of this from Alan fiser he's an occupied East Jerusalem Alan starting with these pauses Israel has obviously roundly rejected a ceasefire but it will there be these pauses how are the Israelis talking about this well the Israelis don't see this as anything new it would be almost fair to say they're quite surprised at the excitement over the white house announcement they say their policy will continue There Will Be tactical delays tactical pauses to help them uh in their operation of trying to move people out of Northern Gaza into Southern Gaza and this is just a continuation of the existing policy so they see nothing new in this you remember that it was a week ago that join Kirby asked Israel for these tactical pauses the Israel has always said that there is going to be no ceasefire and in fact within minutes of join Kirby's statement being made public the prime minister's office put out its own statement saying there will be no ceasefire until the captives are released that has been Benjamin netanyahu's position from the start and it hasn't changed even with this announcement from the White House oh well speaking of captiv Allen have you heard anything from the Israelis about this new offer of captives being released by the aluts brigades well they're certainly dismissive of a video that was released within the last couple of hours which showed a 77y old woman and a 13-year-old boy now the suggestion would be that these are the two that are being talked about as possible people to be released uh in the video they are critical of Benjamin Netanyahu saying that he is responsible for the current crisis that has been largely dismissed in Israel as words that have been written by Hamas rather than the true Sentiments of the two people and they have again called this propaganda video as for uh the idea that certain conditions have to be met to secure their release nothing official from the Israelis but again we go back to the statement from Benjamin Netanyahu there is no ceasefire until all the captives are released at the same time Alan fiser there with all the latest from occupied East Jerusalem thank you very much Alan
