Maran let's just uh take stock of where we are right now I mean you hear the positivity coming out of the US yet you hear Netanyahu saying this war will go on until we achieve Victory even if it takes more time and Hamas saying we haven't been informed of anything yet what do you think is going on look tactically the past uh several weeks uh two three months in fact uh the Biden Administration has been more eager than before to reach a ceasefire even if a permanent ceasefire and that's why it came out with that three-phase plan so that nany government come buy into it in in a sense that there will be a temporary then perhaps a permanent ceasefire Netanyahu is not exactly buying biting And he as we heard him today continues to insist uh that there are red lines and that the war will continue and it will achieve its objectives Hamas disagrees because Biden's because Nan's objective is to destroy Hamas Hamas does not want to be destroyed so you can you know figure out exactly why they're not EXA in agreement but what is seem to be going on is there something between behind the scenes between the Egyptians the Americans and the Israelis that's where the security arrangement for the day after are happening that's where uh the Americans are trying to figure out who is going to be responsible for this Security in Gaza with whose help this is the kind of role that the Egyptians play in and you could guess that maybe there is some movement on that Egyptian Israeli American front there could also be some progress on the Kari uh American Israeli front about the captives who's out who's in who's going to be release the names of the Palestinian prisoners with the long long sentences and so on so forth these are my educated guesses judging from the various leaks but who knows Maran look you say that over the past few months the Biden Administration has been more eager why do you think that is what's changed for the Biden Administration is it simply domestic politics at play here that's a that's a by the way it's a very important question and I think we need probably going to be discussing for the days to come but let me just say there are at least three major factors one America sees the bfield better than Israel it has a kind of a more uh 35,000 ft uh view of the Gaza Lebanon and the region and it judged already by late March early April that the war must wind down and this whole idea of attacking Rafa and continuing with the war that Israel is simply gonna really get stuck in Gaza and this is not the time it's the time to pull out because the war objectives and as far as destroying Gaza is concerned anyway that's happened uh and then there's the idea that Biden is now entering a crucial uh period of his election and the time for uh relaxing the war the time for talking about peace and ceasefires and American management of PX America in the Middle East is also very important and third and last and that's to the credit of Hamas is that I think Israel understood at least its military understood that you simply cannot defeat Hamas as we've been saying from the very beginning and Israelis came to recognize as well as the Americans that after n nine months of War Hamas continues to resist and not only Hamas the idea but in fact Hamas the organization you cannot just destroy you cannot just finish off the way Netanyahu wanted to okay so do you anticipate pressure then being put on Netanyahu by the American president or by the likes of Bill Burns and Brett MCG who are involved in these negotiations I mean because Netanyahu as we've been saying has pretty much flat out said just a short while ago that the war will go on until we achieve Victory and we know that he hasn't achieved his victory yet yes so Biden is in a bind in terms of using uh enough leverage on nanyo to force him into a ceasefire because that will have a political price and Biden doesn't have much of a political capital Capital he's down in the polls as you know his repetion is being really in the mud because of his poor performances and so on so forth so he doesn't have much of a political capital in Washington he's afraid of the Israel Lobby the powerful Israel Lobby and he hence he's not using sufficient leverage but behind the scene my guess is that especially through the Europeans but more importantly through the Israel military that's where America is exercising its influence on the government because the strong EST relationship with Israel is with the Israel military the best relation the deepest relation the longest relationship is with the Israeli military and I think America is using that already and that's why we hear more and more nuanced voices from the generals from the military spokesperson that we need to wind down this war that we could win it in a different ways but that we need a ceasefire we need to release the captives this new tone and stance from the Israeli military I think comes in part because of American pressure okay Maran thank you so much Maran bishar joining us from Paris make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
