and there have been more Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank soldiers killed a 21-year-old Palestinian Baker in the early hours of Sunday morning in the city of cilia Witnesses say soldiers indiscriminately opened fire as they entered the town Israeli forces also raided homes in noas at least 60 Palestinians have been arrested in the past 24 hours that includes five girls and Israeli soldiers also shot and killed a Palestinian Carpenter and father of six near nablas the 39-year-old was initially attacked by Israeli settlers in the town of caroet bani Hassan settlers then forced him out of his car and burned it before he was shot in the neck by an Israeli soldier elsewhere in the West Bank 10 masked Israeli settlers raided a Palestinian owned restaurant in the village of sawiya security camera footage that you're seeing here captured the attack which caused significant damage to the building okay let's speak to H abdal Hamid who's in hibron in the occupied West Bank Huda the release of Palestinian prisoners during the week-long ceasefire put the spotlight on the number of Palestinians that are still in Israeli jails and also the treatment that they've been receiving there I know you've been doing a lot of reporting on this what can you tell us well absolutely I mean one could even argue that the the number released has been offset by the number of uh Palestinians taken in as you're saying 60 overnight well out of the 60 eight are from heon here four uh women and for uh men now we heard from those coming out about the ill treatment in prison especially after October the 7th we're here at the prisoners Society in Hebron this is actually the first step for families uh to come and inquire about the whereabouts of their of the person who has been detained because simply when the soldiers show up usually in the middle of the night or early morning they don't give any information as to where they're taking the the son the daughter the Father the brother so it is for the families then a very complicated process to be able to figure out where they have taken uh to and for what now I'm joined by amjad naar he is from the uh prisoner Society here in heon the spokesman also for the entire occupied West Bank you told me that there is a large number of the detes here come from heon almost 13 of the 3,500 dayes arrested since October 7 why to begin with hiin is to be uh can be described as a strien province over the past 58 days heon was a stage at the epicenter of all the operations by the Israeli occupation forces across the city more than 973 were detained over this short period of time this is an astronomical figure within the very short span of time the Israeli occupation forces the Israeli occupation government consider heon is the second most important and Sacred City to the Jewish people under their false pretext and false allegations that heon was the Cradle of prophet Abrahim that's why the majority of Israeli radicals and settlers are centered and residing within this hin that's why the number is relatively high today more than 5 100 dayes come from heon those who were released spoke to us about very harsh conditions as we speak the number of detain from heon more than 446 only in October before that they exceeded 900 detes you are absolutely correct all those released from the prisons were tortured abused verbally and physically by the Israeli occupation soldiers behind the bars all these are deay or files yes those are the administrative detention the Israeli occupation forces is the only state on Earth that detain our people without any trial if you look at this this detain is poses a threat to the security of the region and he has a secret file with the intelligence this is sufficient to keep you in under administrative detention from 4 months to 2 years you spoke to me about one person who was detained for 18 years under this administrative detention execute my question is once a Palestinian is detained the family tell us that they do not know about their whereabouts how can you offer them help that's true a decision was handed down by Gallant uh by when the emergency state was imposed no one is allowed to collect any information about any detail before the passage of 8 days this is a criminal act per se 8 days is too long one if any is detained his family comes to us they fill in the relevant information and we with the little resources at hand we start gathering information about the detention centers however we cannot gather any information before eight days we can get some information through the video conference at the court for 3 minutes only all those released men and women they spoke about excessive sexual harassment this particular issue sex sexual harassment was raised following the release of the swab deal however this is not something new since 1967 the Israeli occupation forces have been detaining our women and they have been subjected to physical abuse and sexual harassment however through out the past few days the Israeli occupation forces have been excessively abusing women Palestinian women they even POS uh threats they start even threatened the Deton with rape blindfolding them physically harassing them and all these acts were documented most of the women detes were subjected to harassment of various degree from caressing their bodies to other uh forms of abuse that at the end of the day they are threatened with rape this as a statement made by all those released I interviewed them personally and they were arest physically by the Israeli soldiers however you confirm that no none of them was raped no none of them was raped but they were threatened of being raped as I said a number of the male soldiers place a Deton woman in the middle and start to Circle dancing around her now once there is a swap deal and theones women and juvenile are released and this is was one of the conditions raised by hamz and I'm sorry we have to cut it here thank you I mean yes a lot of thees have been released but more and more have been taken in and this morning we spoke to a mother who told me that the soldier actually bluntly told her that her daughter was being taken in in case there's another deal and another prisoner swap then she will be released then that's H abdal Hamed reporting from herbron you've just been interviewing the head of the Palestinian prisoners Society thank you very much h
