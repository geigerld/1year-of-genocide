now let's go to our exclusive interview with US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin he discussed the war on Gaza and the prospects of a cease fire between Hamas and Israel alzer's Jalal Chara began by asking him about where the negotiations currently stand 12 days ago um President Biden laid out this proposal and in that time almost the entire world came out in support of it uh including the United Nations security Council but also the Arab League virtually every country in this region and well beyond um Israel accepted the proposal Palestinian Authority uh accepted the proposal uh Hamas was the one answer we were waiting for and the answer that we got last night uh that was submitted to um cutter it was submitted to Egypt uh and to us as the mediators in this process unfortunately was not the yes that everyone else had provided uh it was um looking for more changes to the uh to the agreement including uh changes on items that Hamas had previously accepted so the hard reality is um we could have a ceasefire we could have maybe had a ceasefire 12 days ago uh but we don't in this moment because Hamas has not said yes we have I think some changes that Hamas is looking for that are workable that we can uh try to uh uh close close the gap on there are others that are not workable so we have to see in the days ahead uh whether we can actually close the gaps I think that um uh the gaps are are bridgeable but just because they are doesn't mean they will be ultimately Hamas has to decide everyone else has decided Hamas is not what is not workable for you and for the Israel well I can't get into the details you understand that given the sensitivity of the negotiations um we're not going to talk about the the details but what I can say is this the um proposal that President Biden laid out 12 days ago was virtually identical to one that Hamas had accepted uh and put forward itself on May the 6th so there's no reason why uh this U agreement should not be reached the only reason would be Hamas continuing to try to change the terms but here's what's the reality the reality is as this negotiation is going on during the 12 days that it took himas to respond the world wasn't standing still Gaza wasn't standing still people were suffering every single day uh Palestinian children women and men suffering every single day so from my perspective from our perspective it's time to stop all of this haggling and back and forth and start a ceasefire Hamas said the priority is to stop uh the war um uh what information did you receive from um uh prime minister Netanyahu during your meeting with him few days ago in Israel um U concerning the the permanent ceasefire in Gaza so what I can tell you from my conversations with the Prime Minister Netanyahu was a reaffirmation of Israel's acceptance of The Proposal that's on the table and what does that proposal have in it it it says first of all that there'll be an immediate ceasefire immediate and in that during that immediate ceasefire um Israel will pull its forces back from populated areas in Gaza will surge more humanitarian assistance into uh Gaza um Palestinians living in Gaza will be able to return to their neighborhoods their homes if their homes are still intact anywhere uh in Gaza and during that initial Phase 6 weeks both parties Israel and Hamas commit to negotiate toward a permanent ceasefire with the understanding that uh the initial ceasefire will continue as long as those negotiations are going on and this is backed by the United States it's backed by cter it's backed by Egypt this is the quickest most effective path to a durable ceasefire and that means an end of the an end of the war it also opens up so many other possibilities for where we want to go um to try to get a truly durable peace for everyone in the region and one place that we believe it's important to go is the realization of Palestinian State how how do you plan to address the situation now what are the next steps so I've met over the last uh two days with Qatari and Egyptian counterparts we've been uh intensely engaged with uh with all of our colleagues who've been working as mediators on this agreement uh we have to continue to analyze the document and then see if um over the coming days we can find a way to bridge the gaps that have emerged because Hamas wouldn't say yes well Hamas has released a statement saying contrary to to Israel it does want a deal signed the Hamas movement has demonstrated it says in all stages of negotiations to stop the aggression the required positivity to reach a comprehensive and satisfactory agreement based on the FED Ms of our people for a definitive sensation of aggression a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza the return of the displaced reconstruction and a serious prisoner exchange deal the statement adds that there hasn't been any confirmation from the Israeli side that they have approved any ceasefire proposal well let's bring in Maan Bashar Al jaer senior political analyst he joins us today via Skype from Paris Maran we're seeing both sides blaming each other again now blinkin keeps saying that all that's missing is a yes from Hamas but Israel hasn't said yes either well it seems according to the Secretary of State Hamas has I mean Israel uh has said yes secretly covertly only to the Secretary of State not to anyone else it seems because no one else in the world is testifying to the fact that Israel told them that it agrees to the ceasefire uh no Israeli official has come out publicly no isra government vote uh has been held to adopt the American come you Security Council uh resolution so you know I'm not sure how many people are going to take the Secretary of State's word for it he clearly hasn't come through on many of his uh words and commitments and declarations over the past eight months but be that as I may let me just underline that uh it's great to have the secretary St on our Channel he certainly brighten our screen that he's uh nice to us and we're nice to him you know uh we asked the questions he answered them the problem is um that he repeats more of the same of the past so many uh months for example and probably this is the most Stark example for me he says since President Biden uh made uh his uh proposal public several hundred people were killed in Gaza well since the Palestinians and the Arabs and others have called for a ceasefire and America blocked it back in October 2023 more than 30,000 people have been killed and since then the United States Secretary Blinn have blocked every single call resolution draft resolution for a ceasefire for a permanent ceasefire uh in Gaza and as a result here we are today Gaza is totally destroyed a genocide is under way Mar I'm just picking up on something that you alluded to there this idea of a permanent ceasefire and that's been a sticking point since the beginning has there actually been any progress made are you seeing momentum here look I appreciate the fact you say alluded but I don't elude I said it very very very very clearly this is exactly the problem since the very beginning the entire world except the United States and at one point Britain and Germany was on board for for an immediate and permanent ceasefire everyone in the world wanted a permanent ceasefire except the United States and its lackes in Europe so what we have today is not a permanent ceasefire and that's why Hamas and so many others have a problem with it they got on board with the UN Security Council resolution for a simple reason the United States said to the world to China Russia and others my way or the highway th you accept my proposal or Israel is going to continue with its war crimes in Gaza so after they basically became desperate all the world powers and the smaller States at the UN Security Council came on board with the United States they accept the reality that Israel Palestine is within America's sphere of interest and if it's America doesn't agree to it it's not going to happen and America and Israel are going to have to manage the so-called uh temporary ceasefire moving forward and it's going to be up to Israel if this thing happens as it move to the second phase to decide whether it wants or not yeah a permanent ceasefire Maran Israel is saying that the negotiations are continuing what's actually happening behind the scenes right now especially as we see these strikes continue in in the strip in places like al- maasi oh there's absolutely no doubt that the Israelis are doing what the Israelis have said they're going to do from the outset which is continue with their war and they're going to use every possible opportunity extra time uh afforded to them by the United States to do just exactly that destroy Gaza and go after Hamas and it's whatever presence there is in Gaza so Israel is not going to save any effort or any time to do just that and that's why the Israelis are saying even if they embrace the UN Security Council resolution they will continue with the war soon after because it affords them that why because in phase two it does say upon the agreement of the parties which mean upon the agreement of Israel Israel is not going to agree to a second phase where it withdraws all forces from uh Gaza so Israel is doing now what it has done the past eight months what it will probably do the next weeks and months which is Contin with its War because America continues to gives it ex excuses and secretary blinkin continues to cover for it Maran bashara alzer's senior
