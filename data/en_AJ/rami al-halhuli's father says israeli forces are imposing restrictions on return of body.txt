the father of a Palestinian child shot dead by Israeli forces in occupied East Jerusalem says Israel is imposing restrictions on receiving his body 13-year-old Ramy alh Huli was shot in the chess while playing with fireworks near the shat refugee camp checkpoint on Wednesday let's bring in Laura Khan in occupied East Jerusalem for more on this Laura what are these restrictions and why is Israel imposing them well as you said 13-year-old Ramy alhur shot in the chest and he eventually died in a hospital uh the Israelis took his body um to an Israeli Hospital in occupied East Jerusalem and then the Israeli military took his body now his father has released a statement to many Palestinian media to say that they have promised to give his body back on Friday midnight but with some major caveats the first is that only four members of the family can go and collect the body then he'd have to be buried inside schwat refugee camp now schwat refugee camp is the other side of the Israeli separation wall um it's part of occupied East Jerusalem but he's from this side of the wall and his family burial site is also on this side so of course they would want to have him buried here they also said only 50 members of uh the family and friends are allowed to attend the funeral usually in these kind of refugee camps you see hundreds perhaps thousands and especially with such a young kid shot um while he was essentially and according to eyewitness accounts and also corroborated by video that we've seen shooting fireworks up in the air during Ramadan the Israelis of course have contradicted this say he shot them towards them and this immediately endangered them hence why they shot and killed him now put this into context for us Laura what is the Israeli policy on withholding bodies well there was a resolution passed in 2017 uh to say that they can withhold bodies they can keep them and they can only return them with major caveats and that's up to security officials to decide what they are but they did say that Hamas or groups similar to them fighting groups against um Israel can be kept and withhold forever now B Salem which is an Israeli Rights group say they often used as bargaining chips during any future negotiations and Palestinian prisoner rights groups say around 245 um dead Palestinians are being held by the Israelis at the moment but this is a policy and a practice that's been going on for many decades and we know that many hundreds of Palestinians bodies have been held um the most recent um one man he was supposed to be released in September his body has been held out since July the Israeli promised to give his body back um he was involved in a shooting where one Israeli soldier was injured but they still haven't returned it so there is a possibility that has given some sense of false hope and certainly an underlying feeling for so many Palestinians waiting for these bodies to be returned there's going to be false hope for him actually being returned on Friday evening Laura thank you very much for that Laura can live there in occupied e Jerusalem
