we begin in the ha where Germany has been accused of aiding and abetting genocide in Gaza in a case before the un's top Court it was brought by Nicaragua and calls for emergency measures to stop Germany from selling weapons to Israel it also wants Berlin to restore funding to the un's agency for Palestinian refugees unra more than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in six months of bombardment nearly half of them children if the actions of Israel continue unrestrained as they have since its birth as a state and they continue to receive the indiscriminate support of States like Germany then a new generation of Palestinians will rise up again in the near future and we will hear a future Secretary General conventing this did not happen in AUM the case before the court is an opportunity to break this vicious cycle without support of States like Germany Israel would not feel they can act with totally imp Unity Nicaragua is hopeful that states particularly with the history of Germany will he heed the decisions of this court our correspondent step vasson joins us now live from the ha step Nicaragua spent two hours this morning making its case to the court you were there listening to all of it what else did we hear from its Representatives well it's been a very uncomfortable morning for Germany here at the highest court in the he 80 years is uh after the Holocaust and although Germany hasn't been directly involved in the war in GA in Gaza Nicaragua says it has been facilitating genocide by sending weapons and instead it has an obligation uh to prevent genocide because it's a signatory to the genocide convention but what Germany did instead it has increased uh the sales of weapons to Israel tfold uh compared to 2022 especially after October 7 and also Nicaragua argued this that Germany is citing for its commitment to Israel which is unconditional because of what happened in the past because of what happened during the Holocaust is misleading because naraga says it's about Israel and that's a different thing than talking about the Jews and he also said that in that Germany is making a lot of money selling these weapons and the arms facturers are making real profits right now and that's also something one member of the legal team uh David Müller actually said Daniel Müller sorry during the trial this includes export licenses for weapons of war in the value of 20 mil million EUR such as 3,000 anti-tank weapons which according to one manufacturer in Germany are a complete toolbox of shoulder lounged infantry weapons used against tanks but also Vehicles structures and buildings and persons 5 100,000 rounds of machine gun ammunition 44 propellant charges a key component in artillery ammunition and 239 IGN ignition charges and the German news magazine dagel revealed information about plans of the German government to deliver tank ammunition from the stocks of the German Armed Forces well tomorrow Germany will have it its chance to respond to the allegations uh tomorrow Germany will have its chance to uh respond to the allegations uh with its highest legal advisor to the foreign Ministry uh and but it already came out this afternoon saying that all the allegations made by Nicaragua are grossly biased it's going to be a very interesting test case for international Justice because the two countries Nicaragua and Germany are not directly involved in the war in Gaza so it's an unprecedented case so legal experts around the world are really following this and we will hear uh if a ruling will be made on provisional measures Nicaragua has asked for in the next coming weeks okay step many thanks for bringing us up speed on all the events that have been happening there at the ha at the international court of justice this morning well lawyer and diplomat Tanya Von AA Glon is representing Germany before the icj and she says that the government is upholding international law Germany rejects the allegations made by Nicaragua today Germany does not and never did violate the genocide convention nor International humanitarian law nether directly nor indirectly on the contrary Germany's committed to the uphold of international law and this is what work for internationally we will tomorrow present our position in detail to this court so much I can already tell you today Nicaragua's presentation was grossly biased and we will be telling you tomorrow how we fully live up to our responsibilities our correspondent in Berlin Dominic Kane joins us now live and Dominic Germany is saying that it's been misrepresented by Nicaragua in court today is that the general feeling in inside Germany the thing to point out here is that the government's reaction that we've been hearing there has been being put out for several days now certainly on Friday the foreign office spokes people were saying effectively what we just heard there this idea that they really have no truck with the case that's being brought forward that that puts them in the frame as it were there is no question that this issue is div dividing opinion in this country on the one side you have people who say that they can't understand why the German government takes the position it does Visa Israel in a more General sense about the support that it offers to the state of Israel about the protections that it puts in place for the state of Israel and then on the other sides of this debate you have people who say well actually no it is important for Germany to recognize its cultural and historical responsibility in this situation and to be protective of the state of Israel and its right to exist that certainly is something which government ministers and many different people in in the government's infrastructure as it were have adhered to going back many years many decades even there is opposition isn't there in Germany what are we actually seeing uh manifest itself in in opposition to the government support of Israel well this is where it becomes more uh as it were a matter of conjecture because there has been certainly over the course of the last 12 hours 24 hours or so a statement put out by what is claimed to be several hundred German civil servants none of whom is prepared to metaphorically put their heads over the parapet and go public with their name and their face but have put out a statement which calls on the German government to disassociate itself from its policy thus far regarding Israel to remind to remember its commitments to Justice to the humanitarian cause around the world that sort of thing and in doing that what they are doing as it were is continuing something that has had a head of steam as it were building up over the course of the last few months from other civil servants around the European Union and Beyond certainly in the United Kingdom as well who in the course of the last few months have put out statements again under the cloak of anonymity saying that governments in the west should be much more mindful of what they are doing and the effect of the policies the effect the policies that they are maintaining in so far as Israel concerned is actually having on the ground in Gaza but it is worth making the point there is this opposition but it is coming from people who are using the shield of anonymity in order to put out their point of point of view okay Dominic Kan bringing us the view there from Berlin thanks very much Dominic
