well the US Secretary of State is in Israel to reassert American support his visit follows the first shipment of US military aid that arrived in Israel on Wednesday blinkin is also set to meet Palestinian presidents makmur Abbas and Jordan on Friday Sarah hardat reports from West Jerusalem see another us reassurance to Israel this time face to face we're here we're not going anywhere US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shake hands firmly a show of solidarity between two countries whose Alliance and friendship goes beyond politics building on his Jewish Heritage and referencing bipartisan supports for Israel blink had this message you may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself but as long as America exists you will never ever have to we will always be there by your side the standing together in unity Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the US's help Mr secretary your visit is another tangible example of America's unequivocal support for Israel Hamas has shown itself to be an enemy of civilization US citizens and other foreign Nationals were among those killed or captured during the attack on Israel by Hamas fighter on Saturday intelligence and Military Support from the US arrived on Wednesday in the form of the world's largest aircraft carrier fighter jets and other military aid Lincoln's visit in the formation of a so-called War cabinet under an emergency Unity government is supported nationally in Israel the United Nations and other nations though are urgently calling on the country to allow safe passage for people to leave Gaza but for now they have no way out as Israel continues its bombing AL jazer West Jerusalem well let's speak to ABD Hamid who is outside the knesset in West Jerusalem and uh as we heard in that story there the Israeli Prime Minister announcing the declaration of war um the formal declaration of war clearly he's building a case uh for a full escalation or Invasion potentially into Gaza is there any support what is the support like within Israel for that I think the it it's kind of a mixed bag I think that and you could hear that uh or decifer that really from the words of the Prime Minister uh he was basically going through this formality as you said but at the same time speaking to the Israeli public saying that you cannot not sit or talk with Hamas and the only way forward is to get rid of the group and debilitate or as in his words annihilate uh the group equating Hamas uh to isol now um how much support does he have Israelis are known that in time of crisis in time of difficult times they sort of unite and stand together in solidarity uh but the Prime Minister knows perfectly well that he's under uh a lot of scrutiny and then once the dust settles once this war is over uh he will have to answer some very tough questions I'm just going to give you the results of one poll that came out today uh well according to 94% of those questioned is um uh they believe that the government is responsible for the defense failure when it came to the gaza's trip and not 84% put the the uh blame of what unfolded on October 7th that the day Hamas attacked Southern Israel on the failure of the political leadership and 56% say that Netanyahu should go once the war is over so there is a lot at stake here for the uh prime minister whether it is for the survival of his political career or indeed his legacy hter don't go anywhere because I want to ask you about a shooting near uh herod's gate and occupied East Jerusalem that happened just a short time ago before we go to that there is we're also listening in and seeing uh some huge huge explosions that are happening right now in Gaza clearly Israel's bombardment continuing uh relentlessly uh this evening there in Gaza we've seen it right throughout the day huge big plumes of black smoke filling the sky now it is night time you can only see uh smaller plumes and often orange and red flashes as the bombs continue to raise rain down on Gaza okay h i I want to ask you again uh about this shooting uh that's happened near herod's gate in occupied East Jerusalem that happened just a short time ago yes it was according I mean all the information we have is from the Israeli police accordingly there was an exchange of gunfire next to a police station there would be a number of policemen that would have been wounded in that exchange of gunfire but the Israeli police say that um the attacker has been neutralized now that's the word they use to say that indeed he has been killed I think this is also one of the challenges uh the Prime Minister and his emergency Unity cabinet have in mind uh because as every with every day that passes with those pictures of those huge explosions happening in Gaza not very far from here about an hour and a half drive from where we are uh well the the mood among the Palestinians is one of increased anger um so keeping the cities inside the borders of Israel quiet is a huge Challenge and being able to really the I think that's one of the roles of this war cabinet is also being able to make sure that all the resources are very well divided between the ongoing uh War uh in Gaza if there is a ground offensive but also keeping the peace or trying to keep the peace inside the cities around the country and in indeed along the northern border with uh Israel so it's a very complicated situation and with every day that passes and all this International support you know the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin in Tel Aviv earlier showing uh supports to Israel H the US President Joe Biden also showing is saying that there unequivocal support to Israel without mentioning at all the Palestinians all that would at some point increase the anger and they could be a Tipping Point and we have seen that in the past in a previous war just uh two years ago in 2021 when there was an eruption of intercommunal uh fighting between um Israelis and Palestinian Israelis so it is a very complicated situation and one and such attack like the one that happened now could be followed by a reprisal attack from settlers uh that live in also in occupied East Jerusalem and then that becomes a vicious circle okay thank you so much for that that is H abdalhamid for us in West Jerusalem
