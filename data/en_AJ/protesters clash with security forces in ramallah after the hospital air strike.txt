bashara senior political analyst for Al jazer we're going to try and cross to H Abdul Hamid who joins us from rala H we had to end our conversation with our colleague Charles statford because we heard gunshots you're also out of vision because of safety reasons where are you and what's happening well it's certainly a very tense situation here in Manara Square which is literally the heart of uh ramala City now we going to take you back to how it all started uh about an hour ago there was a large size of protesters who came to the square we believe that they were angered of the pictures they had seen coming out of Gaza of that hospital hit and that large number I can come back and vision I think at the moment uh large number of uh casualties there um then they were chanting at a certain point they were chanting that the people want the fall of the president referring to president Mahmud Abbas who at this moment is said to be returning from Aman where he he went ahead of the meeting with the US president uh tomorrow that seems it's not happening anymore um we don't know what happened but then all of a sudden we did hear stun grenades heavy tear gas and that's one of the reason I am out of vision is because the fumes are coming all the way up here and then we did hear some uh live fire we presume that it was up in the air um at the moment and we don't know who were who exactly uh was firing uh we as you can hear now this is another stun grenade and maybe our camera is showing you that the protesters have actually all dispersed to all the side roads that lead to this uh Manara Square it's certainly a very difficult moment but it's not surprising uh I've been here for a few days the the the tension was simmering was bubbling people were getting more and more angry at what they've seen happening in Gaza everybody glued to their tablets to their smartphones following very closely events in Gaza and also very angry at uh the Palestinian leadership president Mahmud Abbas having been uh more absent then present he has not appeared in public he has not spoken or addressed the pal Palestinian people all they heard from him is through press releases that came through the official news agency Waffa so certainly there was a lot of pent up frustration that frustration existed well before this escalation started uh people in the across the occupied West Bank being continuously targeted either by the uh Israeli soldiers uh coming under a lot of pressure from them also being being uh victim to uh settler violence more than 200 people had died across the occupied West Bank before all this started and it continues now we are hearing more gunfire I I cannot actually appear at the window to tell you what is happening but you might be hearing it uh on camera now and I'm told to come in it is quite intense at this point and you these flashes you see on camera we believe are St uh sound grenades but at this particular moment seems to be quite intense hter are you safe I am safe to continue from where I I am safe to continue from where I am uh away from the window but it's impossible for now to reach because it's literally happening below us at this particular point and this has been the Rhythm the whole for the past hour and a half of so you had moments of calm and then you have these outbursts um but it's very difficult for us from here to see what has happened we are also hearing that similar protests are happening in jine and in other uh cities and towns across the occupied West Bank the news is coming into US bits by bits so at the moment the situation the full picture is quite fluid to us um but we have to underline that the protest were not called by Hamas that is very important this is popular Palestinian anger frustration coming to the surface and exploding and we have to also underline that there are no Israeli soldiers here um so if it is an exchange of gunfire or just gunfire in the air at this point I cannot confirm to you uh this is Palestinian on Palestinian uh Israeli forces are not in the area here at all and they rarely come inside uh ramala if not for maybe nightly range or when they're after uh someone but certainly a very serious escalation adding more fuel to the fire in an already explosive situation all across the occupied West Bank hter can you explain the geography of where you are if it's a Central Square are there multiple streets that lead into the one location and how difficult is it to control the people inside if things are as tense as they are well it's I mean we have to realize that this was not a huge amount of protesters who had come to the square maybe a few hundred and this is something that has been happening uh quite regular the protests have been picking up momentus momentum over the past uh few days uh ramala is quite a busy City it's quite it's quite populated it's the largest city in uh the West Bank and really Manara is the Manara square is the heart of it you have all the businesses you have all the markets all around it it's where everything uh happens um now difficulty to reach it is not very difficult uh to come out of it at the moment uh as you can see I don't know if you can see from our camera you it's pointed towards one of the side streets uh we saw some protesters going to that area and then some protesters also going in all the different areas I do not have from my vantage point now a full vision of the square uh but I'm hearing uh quite loud noises and as you can hear also continuous uh sound grenades certainly a lot of tear gas that we can smell all the way up here um and we haven't actually heard from the Palestinian leadership in all of that if if not that president abas has uh refused now to meet with the US President Joe Biden uh that was because of what had happened in Gaza and that bombing of U the hospital there he had cut short that visit and should be on his way back uh we don't know whether that would be tonight or uh whether that would be tomorrow but certainly him coming back to uh the occupied West Bank at this particular time is also a matter of political survival uh for the president who has been under a lot of pressure not just now but uh for many years a lot of Palestinians being quite frustrated by the lack of improvement in their lives president Mahmud Abbas has been always been an advocate of the Oslo Accords for most of the population here in the West Bank the Osa course is something that happened well before they were born they haven't seen any fruit of it they don't know what peace means and they don't even believe in it so it was been very difficult for president abas uh to continue uh telling you know calling uh for I'm just checking now what is happening we see a bit of Chaos in that street our C our camera is pointing at at it uh maybe more protesters coming I mean the news is probably spreading all around grala and people can hear certainly the sound of continuous explosions and gunfire uh so it might very well be that we have a situation where people will be coming down to the streets in Anger uh maybe in Anger also at the Palestinian uh security forces and their stand many would tell you that the Palestinians Security Forces should be standing along with them and probably protesting along with them rather than being against them I was just speaking to uh one uh Palestinian uh person here a lady who told me that this was a very sad day that this not should not be happening especially at this particular moment that finding these divisions among Palestinian will only make a bad situation worse okay thank you very much well leave it they hter
