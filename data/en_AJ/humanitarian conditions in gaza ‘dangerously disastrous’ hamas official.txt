have repeatedly mentioned and we reiterate this today that alaa flood on the 7th of October in 2023 was a necessary step and a natural response to face and counter the conspiracies and plots to eliminate to eliminate the Palestinian cause launched by Netanyahu government with American Administration to take control over the land and to to Prevail their control over Al aam mosque and to continue their brutal and unjust Siege against the Gaza STP and therefore such an operation was necessary to put an end to all these in order to rid ourselves of the occupation and Revive Our Palestinian rights and attain to freedom and Independence just like other peoples of the world and to retain our right to selfdetermination and establish our fully sovereign country with Jerusalem as its capital with the continued aggression in Gaza and the West Bank and our people continue to fight and struggle for their freedom setting amazing examples in fortitude steadfastness against the brutal military and Zionist War Machine we have decided to offer our Palestinian people and to our the Arab Nations and Muslim nations and to the fre peoples of the world and those who support righteousness those who oppose oppression those Defenders of human dignity we have decided to submit a document entitled this is our story why alaa flood this document this document we are placing it before the Arab Muslim and international public opinion to explain the truth about what ensued in the 7th of October why this flood was conducted and what kind of context is related to the Palestinian cause and to refute these Zionist claims and to put the facts and present the facts as they are anyone who wishes can have access to this um document either by scanning the QR code or uh by visiting our page on um telegram next topic is about starvation and the femine experienced by the Gaza Strip with the increased number of displaced people and without the provision of any appropriate shelters and with the scarcity of food supplies and the lack of such supplies in many areas in Gaza more than half million of our peoples in the northern part of Gaza are perilous and they are risking starvation we are talking about 600,000 Palestinians including men women and children all these people are risking uh starvation and this is a fact it's not an exaggeration as they spend days and days without having any meals due to the lack of food supplies and all sorts of food including vegetables canned food Etc which is the minimum basic life requirements for any human being this serious catastrophic uh situation which no words can serve to describe neither in news or in any statements the repercussions of which can never be described against 2 million people due to the lack of supply of such Aid and supplies as the people of Northern Gaza they had to ground an animal stock F to consume so that they can sustain their lives stand before this exacerbating humanitarian situation which could lead to the increased number of people who die if not killed by the bombardments they would die of starvation thirst and due to their sickness and therefore we would like to confirm the following especially when the entire world is witnessing such a heinous crime without without um acting to such crimes we hold the Zionist government and the Biden and an Administration full responsibility of all these heinous and brutal crimes perpetrated against our people in Gaza especially the Northern parts of Gaza second we call upon the wh to take immediate action and announce Gaza as a femine or um a zone of femine and to take necessary measures to to stop the exacerbation of such humanitarian catastrophe we also call upon the on organization to to shoulder their responsibility and uh perform their duties to deliver all sorts of supplies and AIDS to all people in Gaza and this is the honor was legal and responsibility and their mandate as established by the United Nations we call upon them not to buckle or budge against the threats of the occupation we also call we call on an urgent call for Aid in coordination with relevant international organization and stress the need to allow Aid materials either by land by sea and by air and we call upon the ISL organization and the Arab League leaders and head states of our Arab and Muslim nations to intervene immediately to exercise pressure to allow the opening of corridors and to send um Caravans of Aid to prevent a real and true uh starvation uh of 2 million people in Gaza and I believe that we don't we don't need here to talk about righteousness and I would like to remind you that Arabs in the past they have rejected the blockade against the prophet Muhammad and his third the American position in regarding the Palestinian State over the past few days we have monitored and followed the positions and stance is as expressed by the war criminal Netanyahu and claiming that that the um that their security would have full control of the entire land and they stressed their rejection of a Palestinian State who have who have always denied and rejected the existence of our people and their legitimate rights we have also monitored and followed up the international reactions especially the United States Administration and President Joe Biden sending messages to reassuring those people who still um wager on political Solutions or normalization proposals with this Nazi entity by and I quote what Biden has just said that Netanyahu doesn't object all existing Solutions uh on the two State solution followed by netanyahu's office few hours later uh rejecting the statements by biding and reiterate the rejection of establishing a Palestinian State this confirms the wellestablished fact that no one no one standing before this terrorist and Nazi entity no party can ensure or guarantee a political Solution on the other hand such statements only express only express an American Ploy that allows the Israelis the time and they try to Varnish and bleach the image of the occupation and they seek to um integrate such an entity in the region through normalization projects and denying our people their rights our message here is very clear to Washington and to President Biden who who's who is an accomplice in the genocide committed against our people by the forces of the occupation with weapons and arm supplied every day through decisions of the president Biden they bear the responsibility of every Palestinian drop of blood be it that of young people women or um or men and their statements that pretend or claim to support the establishment of a Palestinian State such statement will continue to lack credibility unless the aggression stops IM immediately and unless the ordinance ammunition and weapons do not stop being supplied to the Israeli uh entity and unless such an entity is compelled and bound by an international resolution to stop the genocidal War and the bombardments of civilians Around the Clock in the Gaza step if they do not do such requirements they they confirm their lack of credibility we as Palestinians we have said over and over that we will never agree custodianship over our people and we will not accept we will not settle for less than an independent and Sovereign Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital and allowing Palestinian people who have been moved out of their towns and villages to return to their homes and proposals to circumvent the rights of our people without any content will never succeed so I advise these parties to spare a valueless effort fourth talking about the escalation in the region we hold the American Administration the responsibility for the escalation we are witnessing in the region by their continued support of the occup and their aggression and we would like to stress that re Reviving and reinstituting calm and peace in the region is conditional to ending the aggression against our people in Gaza and establish the independent and sovereign state of Palestine and they they try to escape their crisis by exporting their Cris es outside as they conduct assassination operations and they conduct aggressions against Lebanon who are supporting our cause they conduct aggressions against Syria threatening our security seeking the help of the Americans to expand the war in the region this criminal enemy are attempting to um to um to attack the sovereignty of countries our people and decision makers in the region they are required to think of the post Netanyahu era and after such a Nazi extreme government has fallen they need to work seriously on getting rid of such a government as a first step on the way to eliminating such an occupation in our land we we in Hamas we could condemn the American um CL classification of the hthi um group in Yemen as a terrorist group and we condemn the the British and the UK aggression against against Yemen and we consider this as a determination or American determination to militarize the Red Sea and in support of the Israeli occupation and it's a crime against our Arab and Muslim nation and we support our friends and brothers in Yemen Iraq and Lebanon and we pray for the um we pray for um their fallen soldiers and we commend their support our people defending the AA mosque and Jerusalem fighting a brutal and Nazi occupation that threatens the stability in our entire region it is a time now to to sever the hand of the occupation that conducts aggressions against our people and against the entire region we reiterate that we shall continue our steadfastness our struggle and our people who have always paved their path of struggle with um with Victory you've been listening to Osama hamdan senior representative of Hamas in Lebanon now he had several messages he justified hamas's October the 7th attack which killed 1200 people in Israel saying it was quote necessary to free ourselves and establish our right to self-determination he also warned about starvation in Gaza and the unfolding humanitarian crisis they're calling on the UN the World Health Organization to declare famine in Gaza he also called on the U noted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin netanyahu's recent and repeated rejection of Palestinian statehood
