a senior Hamas leader has hit back at Suggestions by Israel that it will take charge of security in Gaza after the fighting has stopped Usama hamdan says Palestinians in the strip will not accept being governed by Outsiders we say to the US Administration and to the leaders of the occupation Gaza will be ruled only by its people we are free people and we do not accept being under the custodianship of anyone our blood and our lives will the price for our freedom and for the Dignity of our steadfast and persevering people whose greatness and Grandeur words fail to describe so spare yourselves the trouble of thinking and think how the enemy should climb down from the tree before they burn down with the tree no one will ride your tanks to Gaza except for traitors and you won't find any of them who dares to do so well the Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas has said the Palestinian Authority could play a future role but the Palestine Liberation or organization's former legal adviser Diana Buu says that's not realistic right now what the US is trying to do is they're trying to put in a pseudo Palestinian government one that they like into the Gaza Strip and I can I can tell you that there's going to be no Palestinian leader that wants to be seen as entering the Gaza Strip on the back of an Israeli bulldozer on the back of an Israeli tank that's just simply not going to happen but more importantly this is the same Palestinian Authority that on October the 6 that the United States had been had been maligning that had they had effectively turned into persona non grada so it's like they pull out this puppet when they want it and then put it away when they don't want it this is where I mean what this is what I mean when I say it's up for Palestinians to decide we need to have our own internal elections we need to decide what shape and form it is of our freedom that it's going to look like but first and foremost the bombing needs to end and this apartheid system must come to an end let's not bring in our senior political analyst Marwan Bashar Marwan so you know comments being made about the the future of Gaza and who will control Gaza once uh this war is over Netanyahu said that he won't give up control over Security in Gaza under any circumstances and he's opposed to uh the Palestinian Authority um governing Gaza I mean what do you make of all these comments that are being said well first of all I'm not sure uh Netanyahu is going to survive much after this war so when he talks about uh Gaza is going to be under occupation under any circumstance there's one that circumstance where he's not going to be prime minister because he's certainly not a popular man in in Israel he's just moved from being a political criminal to being a a war criminal and I agree with much of what been said about Palestinians don't need a trustees ship and they certainly don't deserve to be occupied if anything uh the Palestinian people have proven once and again over the past 75 years not only that they are people because nowadays there are these campaigns that Palestinians are not numbers that they are people Palestinians are great people not just any people and they prove to be so if you look at the record if you look at like a record of literacy you look at as achievements you look at the the nature of the Palestinian society and its ability for steadfastness under 56 years of occupation if you look at the Palestinians in The Refuge uh in the various Arab count countries if you look at at the Palestinians expats in various Western countries the Palestinians are more than an able people the Palestinians have proved to be some of the brightest people in this region and in the world they are more than capable of ruling themselves the Palestinians however like other Arabs in fact like other people around the world they deserve better leadership I mean America deserves better leadership right certainly Israel deserves about the leadership the Palestinians have not been lucky with their leadership and I think what this crisis this this genocide has proven to the world that once the Palestinian people take their own story on their own when they recover their narrative and now we're hearing more and more from the thousands of Palestinians in Palestine and Beyond telling their own stories from their own words about who they are what they stand for what they want and what they are going through I think at last they are achieving something I think the world public opinion is responding to the Israeli uh to the Palestinian narrative to the Palestinian human story more than they are for a change to the Israeli propaganda and certainly more than they have in the past to the Palestinian propaganda that was basically a major failure but today the Palestinian are telling the human stories and they are watching those those incredible doctors and nurses this that Health Care Workforce education Workforce and other people in Gaza sacrificing their lives to saves their the others they are willing to stay under bombings in order to save the others their steadfastness have taught us all have taught the world a lesson in humanity those people need to be free those people need Justice now and how does this change that you refer to in sort of public opinion as well as all the protests that we've been seeing uh right around the world how does that translate into policy and have you do you think that it's going to translate into policy because we still haven't seen the United States call for a ceasefire we still haven't seen the United Kingdom call for a ceasefire those Western governments are still supporting Israel Believe It or Not also the Arab governments and the Palestinian government still not acting according accordingly to what we are seeing from the Palestinians I mean president Abbas should now allow for Palestinians to protest peacefully peacefully in the West Bank in solidarity with the people in Gaza they're not even allowed in in in Palestine to protest to demonstrate in solidarity but those who are able to demonstrate in the Arab and Muslim World in Western capitals the Palestinians are in the Forefront now in various Western capitals from Latin America to Europe to parts of Asia even Africa the Palestinians message the Palestinian narrative the Palestinian Story the Palestinian humanity is reaching out and that's why in the United States there's a majority of Americans now want a ceasefire in Europe a majority wants a ceasefire what so the public opinion is changing American public opinion is changing but American Congress is basically bought out by lobbies and it has not changed the American Administration is Blinded By Its support to Israel and it has not changed but we can see already some change for example the French President it is not a coincident that the French President an important superpower or at least a European power and we've seen others I mean just listening to the narratives coming out of Belgium Ireland Spain and other places we are seeing cracks in that solid pro-israeli line that we've seen in the earlier days how much does this work wor Israel do you think I think it worries Israel a lot actually if you listen to some of the Israelis talk among themselves they're almost admitting that they have they are losing the the the U the public opinion around the world as as you stated correctly there are some leaders now that remain stuck in the past as if you can continue with occupation uh open-endedly as if you can continue with a racist system or part continuously as if Europe can continue to treat Israel like it's a spoiled brat continuously without anyone paying a price at least in terms of their reputation and their International standing while Israel carries out its genocide now with the social media possibilities with the international media possibilities with cameras and and as I st and I could I can't state that you know more the importance the fact that the Palestinian people Palestinian Society Palestinian experts and refugees Palestinian citizens on occupation are telling their stories and they are reaching other people around the world and that's making a difference because once again it's not about per Being Human and people of course they are human and people they are great human great people for being able to be such a people after 56 years of occupation and 75 years of dispossession there remain to be some of the most literate people in the world today today like 99.5% of Palestinians are literate so many of their young have achieved higher education we see them in Western universities leading departments leading in sciences and social sciences and so on so forth that people that great people deserve Independence deserve sovereignty deserve justice and certainly deserve to take their own Affairs into their own hands no more trusteeship and certainly no more occupation look mad one of the stories and the narratives that we've been covering here in the past few hours certainly is coming out of alifa hospital where uh we're hearing it's practically run out of everything three newborn babies have already died uh the the director was telling us he does expect more unfortunately to die if they don't get fuel into the into the hospital and and one of the uh comments that the director made uh to us was he was saying that the ra Crossing needs to be open to be allowed to for a humanitarian Aid to be allowed in I mean for for some viewers who may think well why is the ra Crossing not being open by Egypt why is that and what what are Egypt's obligations here Egypt is failing its responsibility moral responsibility legal responsibility and political responsibility and I'm not talking Egypt as a country of course talking about the government in Egypt needs to move because president ce's speech was formidable at uh RI exactly at the Arab Muslim Summit but that speech need to be translated into reality now Egypt has the force of 57 countries behind it that do not accept the Israeli genocide and do not accept the pretext of right to self-defense and they want to change the status quo and they want to reach out and help the Palestinians so Egypt can start and should start to do so as soon as possible but I also think that the thing that you and I are talking about that that Egypt understands as others understand the inhumanity of the Israeli occupation the inhumanity of this War I mean the fact that it started by dehumanizing the Palestinians that's already should have been red flagged for everyone in the world especially the Biden administration because once you start dehumanizing people you call them all of them guilty and you call them all of them Human animals while you are the human animal while you are the actual walking animal in the way you carry war of genocide against an entire people destroying hospitals schools mosques residential buildings that's inhuman and that is what's going on today I think Egypt and the Egyptian Society the Arab Society we said public opinion is changing the problem is uh darina it's not changing fast enough because as you stated well babies are dying hospitals are running out of everything fuel food and and so on so forth the people in Gaza are still holding to one another I mean again hear the human story they are helping shelter one another you have a you have little Shacks of 60 square meters hosting 40 50 60 people people are taking care of one another they are withstanding this vicious war of genocide against the people they are ex they are expressing their atmost Humanity today those people deserve justice those people deserve Freedom they don't deserve a nanaho and Biden irresponsibly criminally continuing this war all right thank you so muchan bishar thank you we appreciate it
