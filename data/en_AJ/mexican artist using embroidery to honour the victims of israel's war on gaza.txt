I am Rosa Boras, I am a plastic artist and I embroider because I need to embroider cases of missing people in Mexico and also cases of murdered people and international cases that affect me and that I believe must be remembered through embroidery, there is this action of memory but also of demand for justice and to make the victims visible, the gas situation reaches me through social networks and the media and it makes me feel very desperate, very angry, very anguished and I feel that we must show solidarity. My way of expressing this solidarity is  through embroidery and it is specifically through the figure of Guel that impresses me a lot and has been a central figure. And so my way of approaching it has been to embroider with these embroideries that I am doing with the names of the children and the grandson and the wife and now hamsa de guel I am trying to build bridges emotional bridges bridges of solidarity I believe that more actions need to be done to make visible everything that is happening in gauze I believe that there is very partial information and it is very difficult obtain objective information I think it is important to go out into the streets I think it is important to do more solidarity actions in the streets
