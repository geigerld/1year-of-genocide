Excellency Dr rad mans will talk to you thank you my brother Muhammad and thank you for my colleagues the ambassadors of the Arab countries we decided yesterday in a meeting to have this pressor this uh press conference and as said by my brother Muhammad there are two topics that are of extremely importance first the indorsement of the security Council regarding the resolution which is mainly for or against the BR uh practices of the Israeli forces in Gaza in more than one paragraphs they call for stopping this aggression protection of the civilians protection of the humanitarian workers protection of the United Nations employees and to stop violence and genocide uh committed by the some Israeli officials and we need to respect the humanitarian international law the international law and all the elements mentioned in this resolution are quite important and we'd like to thank Switzerland and the other countries who uh supported this resolution from inside and outside the security Council uh voting was great 14 countries were for than absente against the resolution the resolution is another resolution that Israel must be committed to to protect the civilians the international workers and the humanitarian staff and to provide the necessity of life for our people in Gaza in sufficient amount very quickly on top of everything to stop uh fighting and to reach a ceas fire to protect the civilians and to save lives of innocent people in Gaza this is our first and top priority as an Arab group in the United Nations we have done that through the eight last months the other important topic that happened today the resolutions or the decisions orders of the international court of justice we welcome these uh uh decisions and we welcome the uh uh uh procedures that the icg has asked Israel to abide by on top of everything to stop military actions in RAF and we said that there are certain uh procedures by the icg that asked to stop every uh military uh aggression in Gaza against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and the opening of Rafa cross and allowing the humanitarian Aid to be provided to the people in needing Gaza with enough amount and to stop the transfer uh around 880,000 have been forced to leave RAF and this is not acceptable we welcome these uh decisions we welcome these procedures and uh we support the icg and we insist that the Israel authorities must be committed must be respected by Israel and by everyone who who are interested in stopping the genocide in Gaza Strip Israel has nothing to do but to commit itself to all these decisions on imposed by the I International court of justice and we would like to thank in this regard the the country of South Africa and every other country who supported the request of South Africa

importance happen today one in the security Council we are grateful for Switzerland and all those who co-sponsored that draft resolution and those who voted in favor of that resolution in which no single country voted against it that resolution is tailored to Gaza without necessarily mentioning Gaza by name with regard to the protections of civilians with regard to the protections of international Personnel including un personnel and specifically honor Personnel condemning the killing of hundreds of international Personnel in the human uh field uh uho uh condemning uh incitement by Israeli officials and killing large number of our people in Ence genocide against our people and uh calling for opening all Crossings uh providing humanitarian assistance to scale and accountability of those responsible for these crimes to face the justice that they uh should face and we are uh uh satisfied that the security Council adopted this resolution it would be greatly helpful in uh hopefully having a ceasefire definitely stopping this Onslaught and preventing the invasion of Rafa the other uh uh subject that uh we uh want to share with you is the provisional measures adopted by by the uh icj we are grateful for South Africa and those who supported them for going back to the icj asking them for additional provisional measures and we welcome these provisional measures including uh stopping you know the military operation in Rafa we believe that the provisional measures of the icj also previously asked for uh stopping all military operations in the Gaz a strip and stopping these crimes and potential crimes of uh genocide against our people in the Gaza Strip and uh we also uh welcome uh the fact that they called for the opening of Rafa Crossing for providing humanitarian assistance to scale and to uh continue fighting against the crime against humanity of mass transfer including the pushing of 800 th000 of Palestinians around Rafa to move to other parts of the Gaza Strip we will make everything possible in our capacity as a group with other groups the OIC Nam uh the African group and others to uh see the implementation of resolutions of the security Council the general assembly and the icj that calls among other things for an immediate fire to take place to save lives and to allow our people to start attending to the
