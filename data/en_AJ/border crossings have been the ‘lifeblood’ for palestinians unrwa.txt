the raah border crossing has now been closed on the Palestinian side by the Israelis and we'll cross over to raah and speak to Sam Rose who un's director of planning thank you for your time Mr Rose uh tell us what impact this border crossing has had the closure of the crossing I yeah the closure of the crossing since Sunday is having catastrophic impacts on on on everyone in Gaza since October this has been the main entry point for goods coming into Gaza there has only been a trickle of goods coming in and since Sunday The Crossing has been closed completely and this has devastating impacts for the people of Gaza who are already on the verge of famine so no Aid coming in means no Aid distributed after a couple of days and and and equally importantly Rafa K shom the only entry point for fuel in Gaza so without the fuel there's no ability for trucks to move around there's no ability for desalination plants to operate and provide Safe Water there's no electricity it cuts off everything Rafa K Shalom they're the lifeblood for the small amounts of guts that have been coming into Gaza since October so absolutely devastating so um um as unwa what would you say your biggest concern is right now with with all of this happening I mean it's very difficult to nail it down to one concern we have a major concern as I said about fuel because without fuel there is no water but we also have a major major concern and a deeply concerned about the humanitarian impacts of the operation which appears to be starting in eastern RAF and what that will mean for people who've already endured so much 100,000 people in the evacuation area itself but many more in the uh in the surrounding areas who are choosing to move so real real humanitarian consequences and real concerns about the continuity of our operations we have fuel for about half a day's worth of of operations that's the entire humanitarian Community inside Gaza so if the crossing is closed for any extended duration it will be it it will be devastating as I said what does uh the the closure uh mean for your teams in RAF will your teams be evacuating and how do you see unwa being able to continue its work no no we are staying where we are inside Rafa we have a small number of installations inside the the evacuation area but our main operations in Rafa are in tesan close to the beach we are staying exactly where we are we have teams across the Gaza Strip several thousand staff working on any given day we will stay where we are the issue is our ability to continue delivering in over any sustained duration of time if those Crossing points remain closed what are you calling for what's the message you want to send out to the International Community the message is that this has to come to an end that the ceasefire has to be agreed there has to be an unconditional Handover of of hostages it's seven months today we are marking of this horrific conflict it needs to come to an end now more immediately all steps need to be taken to secure passage of goods and passage of fuel through the Rafa K Shalom Crossings okay Sam Jones thank you so much for your time and thanks for speaking to us from Rafa thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
