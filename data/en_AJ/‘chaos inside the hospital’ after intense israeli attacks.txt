you're watching Al jazer live from Doha I'm Mariam namazi these are live pictures that we're bringing you from the alaka hospital in central Gaza where there is H quite a bit of chaos there we're continuing coverage of what is happening there of course Israel's assault on the Strip has continued uh we have seen attacks in refugee camps Al Bor maazi andat uh but then we have also seen uh civilians who have been uh killed in these attacks and there is quite a bit of chaos at the alaka hospital now in Central Gaza uh now remember that this is one of the few functioning hospitals in the strip because gaza's health system has been uh pretty much decimated by this war it's actually they've issued a number of urgent warnings about their inability to operate about the fact that they might completely break down uh they need thousands of liters of fuel to be able to operate so not only do they have a shortage of supplies going into the strip because the land Crossings have been closed that is suffocating the area they don't have enough medicines going in to be able to treat the patients fuel is also the critical thing and that has prevented the hospital from functioning not just from uh dealing with casualties not just from dealing with you know dozens in some cases hundreds of of of wounded Pat patients uh from these attacks but also in treating patients who have chronic illnesses patients that might require kidney treatment or dialysis and so there has been a sense of chaos at the alax hospital there uh where staff medical workers are struggling to treat patients many of them we've seen images of patients who are lying on the floor waiting for hours to receive treatment um because this hospital is simply over capacity but it is three times over capacity they've said but it is one of the few functioning facilities left in Gaza as we see an intensification of attacks in the Southernmost city of Gaza in Rafa has also been continuing uh activity air strikes uh shelling in Northern Gaza but we one thing we have seen over the past few days is a sharp rise in the number of attacks on on refugees camps for displaced people and we've been focusing particularly on Al maazi andat let's speak to hind alri she has been following developments in Gaza very closely for us now hind you are in Dar Al Bala what can you tell us about what is happening there and the strikes in central Gaza okay so I'm currently in alaka hospital where injuries did not stop coming inside of the hospital from a different areas we're talking about areas like camp andazi where this area has been under intense uh bombardment since the early hours of the morning we're talking about artillery handing we're talking about air strikes and we're also talking about uh live ammunition from uh the warships uh we saw a couple um of uh targets surrounding the alaka hospitals there was a massive air strike for on one of the houses very close uh to the Ala hospital where we're are right now and we're trapped and we can't leave because it's very dangerous um the ambulances did not stop transferring um injuries and not only ambulances we're talking about people donkey cars cars anyone trying to help as much as possible I talked to a lot of injuries some from comp and they said that they W woke up on intense ell reselling where uh the the shells fell on their houses and they got injured and it was a miracle how they evacuated and got got out of their houses because the Israeli tanks are stationed on alah road it's still intensifying we can still hear artillery shelling in the background and the hospitals are overwhelmed you can't imagine the people are on the floor Medics volunteers everyone is trying to help them um there's no no place for them they're even trying to put uh more injuries in in other departments in the hospital H the doctors are trying their best to rescue as much people are as possible but there are a lot of severe critical injuries right now and everyone is terrified people are terrified they think there's another attack on ala hospitals we're talking about an area that has been having hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced that evacuated from Raa the past couple of weeks and came here because the Israeli forces told them that the middle area is a designated safe area people came to this area fearing air strikes but again there's no safe place in Gaza and people are now homeless terrified horrified fearing another wave of violence and air strike and they don't know where to hide or where to go it is a desperate situation hen and I can hear I get a sense of what is happening there just from the kind of uh sound of your voice so I hope that you are in a place where you are uh able to uh report um obviously as you say there is no safe place in Gaza because of what is happening there and also we see on our screens just there in the Box you can see pictures of of smoke billowing into the air this is uh from Alat I believe we are looking at images of Alat this is in the northern part of Gaza of course we have seen attacks that have damaged homes that that have reduced infrastructure residential buildings civilian infrastructure residential buildings and hospitals to Rubble uh we know that uh the war has displaced most of the territory's population I mean 85 90% most of the territor pop ation have been displaced uh because of of shortages of food clean water in medicine but of course it doesn't seem to matter where people go um they will still face those shortages and they will face continuing attacks and so from H just to be absolutely clear about what is happening right now and what has been playing out the last few minutes we have seen residential buildings in these latest strikes targeted gunships are bombing the area near the fishing port and then also Israeli forces are targeting areas around alaka Hospital in der Al Bala which has been coming under massive amounts of strain in recent days and weeks is the hospital still able to function in some way can you repeat that yes tell me yes hen tell me I don't know if you are getting any information about the alaka hospital Israeli forces have been targeting areas around the alaka hospital in darl Bala can you do you have any information about whether the building itself has been targeted or just the area around it well one of the one there's a house that was targeted close to alaka hospital and we're talking about sidewalks streets T surrounding the place where where people were displaced to that area so it's not only targeting a house near the hospital is targeting displ Palestinians that thought that the middle area was safe but also one of the journalists received a call from the Israeli Army telling them that they will Target tents inside Al AA hospital and that's why everyone's horrified we're talking about a place alaka hospital is not only a hospital it's also a refuge and a shelter for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians that seek refuge in this hospital for months right now and now they got this a warning from one of the journalists who received a call from the isra the Army telling them that they were going to uh Target a couple of tents in the courtyard of the hospital we're seeing people running we're seeing people um looking for a safe place everyone is left the the hospital to uh the areas surrounding the hospital and and and people are literally can't find any place safe they do not not know where to go they're searching for a place uh they're trying to move west but again there are helicopters there are quadcopters people are fearing Liv ammunition they're fearing artillery selling and it's also not safe for them to evacuate from outside the hospital this is the scene right now and no one can understand anything because when escalating it started escalating in one hour all we heard is ambulances and just insence people crying children crying mothers looking for their children that's that's the thing right now and I want to make it absolutely clear what is happening right now obviously we can see some pictures uh from the alaka hospital and then also uh some other pictures from Dar Al Bala but what we are talking about in in recent days and weeks is a significant escalation a clear surge in Israeli attacks on areas that have been classified by the Israelis as safe zones so in other words we are seeing an increasing number of attacks in many parts of Gaza particularly the central areas B maazi refugee camps um and der Al Bala and these are areas that have been classified as safe zones so in other words the Israelis have said that if there is an escalation or a rise in attacks in one part of Gaza if people move to a different area that they will be safe but as hinda is explaining there we are seeing artillery shelling we are seeing air strikes and we are seeing live ammunition being fired into areas where you have thousands in some cases hundreds of thousands of civilians who are taking shelter because they've been displaced from their homes yes we're talking about more than 1 million Palestinians that evacuated from Rafa the western parts of Rafa in the Pascal Pak all of these people were squeezed into the middle area because there was no other place for them to go the hospital was one of the places that had a lot of Palestinians at displaced and more displaced Palestinians came into the hospital we're talking about the sidewalks we're talking about the coast about the agricultural areas we're talking about schools we're talking about every inch of the middle area and area was supposed to be safe people came from all the way from ra came here they thought this area was going to be away from the military uh uh Israeli military incursion the Israeli operation but here you go it's it you can't imagine the amount of injuries um every I saw children women girls ladies uh men all of these were civilians in the where the Israeli artillery shelling targeted their houses when they were sleeping very early in the morning talking to the medical crws they said that they had a lot of challenges and obstacles to go and to rescue these people because the Israeli tanks were everywhere the quad quads were everywhere live ammunition was everywhere but the medical crew said that they were unable to reach people till this point the amount of explosions we heard since the morning was massive every single minute you'd hear a lot of explosions either from our C shelling air strikes from the warship from all the sides from the south from the west from the north from the East and again the middle area was supposed to be a designated area as a safe Zone a safe place and here Palestinians are horrified they do not know where to go and all I see is little children asking me are they going to Target us where should we hide there's no place for us to go and this is true we are all trapped right now we have place to go No One Is Safe no place is safe and to be honest like everyone here is I'm I'm talking to you right now I'm in the entrance of the emergency in alaka hospital uh more injuries are coming and being transferred into a hallway that is already overwhelmed with patients with injuries uh Medics are horrified they're trying to uh rescue as much people as possible uh some people have been killed and and and and and transferred to the morg of the hospital right away um it's a very hard day for the people in and in the middle area and we still do not know what is currently happening in N where there has been intensive air strikes and artillery shelling in that area too yes it's very important to make to clarify that we see all corners of the Gaza Strip all corners of Gaza that are being attacked right now we have been speaking about a war that has we've been covered a war that has been going on for eight months now uh we have seen a surge in attacks with a a focus on particular refugee camps in Gaza bour maazi andat in recent days and weeks but it seems as though over the past few days there has been a clear surge a clear surge in these attacks where you have civilians and we're not just talking about civilian infrastructure residential buildings because a lot of that infrastructure has been reduced Rubble we are speaking about refugee camps for displaced people and so what we saw um the beginning the start of this war was a focus on Northern Gaza and as you explaining hind many people were told to flee to the South and so they made their way from northern Gaza into Central parts of Gaza heading into Khan Unis in the South and then even further and then into the south in in Raa and now uh in recent weeks we saw the Israelis escalating uh their operations their attacks in Rafa they said to root out Hamas Fighters there and so they were focusing on Rafa this has also been accompanied by a closure of the land Crossings so while you have a war going on you have people displaced you have many people wounded no one has access to any sort of treatment they're unable to get treatment when they go to the hospitals the hospitals can't treat them if they do get to the hospitals because they don't have the supplies to be able to to deal with the patients because the land Crossings are closed and because there is a Siege of the Gaza Strip and so with this escalation in activity in Rafa we then have seen many thousands of Palestinians move into the central part of Gaza and that's where we're at now at the alaka hospital where Israeli forces have launched Air Raids at the alaka hospital in Dar Al Bala we know that a number of people have been killed and wounded and I'm just looking at some other reports here yes some of the some of the scenes that we've been monitoring uh show that those who have died in this attack include children who would bring bought to the alaka hospital and hind this is one of the few remaining hospitals that is not just hospital as you say it is providing refuge and shelter to many Palestinians so we can only imagine the kind of the sense of of Terror they feel when they see the area around the hospital itself being targeted by air strikes do we have a rough idea about the number of people who might be in the hospital not just in terms of uh staff and medical workers but those who would be taking shelter well we have we have been trying to talk to the Medics and asking them about how many people are inside the hospital they say that they're at least a like there at least like they said approximately there's 8,000 people right now inside Al OA Hospital only injured and not only patients but also the families of those injured because they do not have any place and they're seeking Refuge inside there we're talking about one of the only hospitals still functioning and still having um kidney dialysis Department ICU department uh still operate surgeries uh in alaka hospital and it's they're having a couple of delegations from Muk from massap and from other International organizations to help uh uh give medical treatment to all of the Palestinians that in severe medical need and managemental intervene but there's a very important thing that for more than a month now since the RAF Crossing Clos and Israel started its military operation in R there has been no medicine uh that that was transferred to um Hospital Medics are saying that they're running on supplies and the amount of injuries that were received since the morning is massive we're we're trying to talk to uh the medical teams they said that most of um uh the injuries that that were were transferred to hospital uh were were were children were women and we told out this we witnessed this but another thing but most of the injuries were were also in critical injuries where most of their lower limbs were need utation and the hospital is over and they could not help to rescue um these uh injuries we're all talking about um the hospital is running out of anesthetic where they're trying to do they're trying to help all of these injures without any pain color any anesthetic how many people were killed how many uh people were transferred to the hospital and they said that they do not even have count from the huge amount the number of number of injured that were transferred to hospital area since the morning I'm talking to you as more umces are coming into the hospitals more civilians are hunting rescue the injured and I tell you the hospital is working three times of but unfortunately there is no medical and most of the do here thank you so much I'm sorry to interrupt you I'm so sorry to interrupt you hind but uh there were just the the line is not very clear and it's breaking up a little bit but we got a sense of what you were saying there some 8,000 people are inside the Alexa Hospital in der Al Bala in central Gaza Israeli forces have launched Air Raids in the area around the alak hospital as hind was explaining to us a number of people have been killed and wounded but she was describing a massive influx of patients who have had to who have arrived at the hospital as a result of these recent Israeli strikes and attacks on Gaza and hind was saying that the patients include women and children women and children are among the casualties there uh this is a hospital that is really one of the few perhaps even the only hospital that is actually functioning inside Gaza but it's not just a hospital that is there providing medical treatment the building itself is also a shelter is also uh housing many thousands of people because it's not just the number of people who've been injured that are being brought in the the families of those who've been injured are also taking shelter displaced people are also taking shelter inside this hospital because they have nowhere else to go uh and so that was hind hind alhi reporting there from Gaza and we will get back to her a little bit later on let's now speak to Imran Khan uh Imran Khan is reporting to us from Aman and Jordan have the isra Israeli government said anything Imran about these attacks well what we're hearing from the Israeli Army is a very short state saying they are going after terrorist infrastructure in Al nerat refugee camp but that is a statement that's very difficult to square with the pictures that we're seeing of women and children being rushed to the hospital of what um the horrific uh reporting that uh hind was describing there as well our colleague in Gaza also what we're hearing is from a trusted Israeli military reporters these are the people that the Israeli military trust they give them information that this is a operation by air Land and Sea it's a far bigger operation than we've seen perhaps in recent weeks uh but the Israeli military as I say issuing that very short statement saying they are going after terrorist infrastructure now remember just a a week ago they said that they'd hit terrorist infrastructure in Rafa but actually some 45 people civilians were actually killed and that they call that the Rafa Massacre we don't know uh how many injured how many people people are dead arriving at the alaxa hospital but that number does seem to be rising uh throughout the day and then just a few days ago uh we had another uh attack where Ham where the Israelis said they targeted key Hamas leaders well Hamas actually turned around and said well the the names you've given out actually aren't Hamas leaders at all in fact one of them doesn't even live in Gaza so once again we we've got this situation where the Israelis issue a statement saying they're going after terrorist infrastructure but the pictures that we see live on our air suggest uh that it's civilians once again caught in the middle yes there um as you say uh Imran this is something that has been continuing a sort of cycle where Israelis maybe don't issue these statements regularly who were saying that it's unusual but in this case they've said that they are targeting infrastructure in gaza's aat area and you know Imran we have seen a clear focus by the Israelis on areas that they themselves designated safe zones you know this includes the largest refugee camp in Gaza but also some of the the smaller ones bur and maazi but you know with the displacement crisis in Gaza now hind was saying a million people have been displaced probably even more because you know they've had to move from place to place multiple times these refugee camps uh will have swelled um you know to numbers that are pro you know very difficult for us for us to document but they've also been a clear focus on these uh refugee camps uh for displaced people in recent days haven't there well let's just get one thing absolutely clear about this I mean we keep saying this hin just said it there are no safe places in Gaza however the Israelis keep talking about safe zones because that's one of the things that the Americans have put pressure on them to do we just rewind back to the very beginning of this war there were supposed to be a number of areas that weren't going to be the Israelis issued a map uh they divided the areas into little squares and said if you go to that square you're going to be safe that map has gone completely out of the window now nowhere is safe in Gaza for any of these refugees Mill a million of them at least as you just pointed out there could well be more but this is a PR exercise for the Israelis and the Israelis have almost admitted this they keep saying uh that we have these safe zones these safe zones are there for the Palestinians to go to but the can change uh at the blink of an eye that's not the exact words that they use but that's what we're seeing in effect so the idea of safe zones is very much a public diplomacy exercise uh from the Israelis and it comes from American pressure thank you very much Imran appreciate it Imran Khan reporting to us from Aman in Jordan just a reminder that the reason we are there in Jordan is because the cabinet of the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has banned alaz from reporting inside Israel itself
