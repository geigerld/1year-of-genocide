now Marwan bishara is Al jazer senior political analyst he joins us from Paris Marwan when you're three days out from the ICC prosecutor requesting an arrest warrant for your some of your top officials when you're the day before the icj possibly ruling an end to your operations scenes like this of suffering in hospitals not the best PR exercise is it oh you don't know how right you are it's U it's it's just incredible uh what the Israelis are doing and are capable uh of doing but but you see this also become a habit and I think it's very difficult to give up this sort of a habit I think they're sort of addicted now to the kind of sadism that we've seen practice in Gaza over the past eight months especially against hospitals and schools and women and children and so on so forth you know Sammy they say uh truth is the first victim of War but looking at the past eight months looking at Israel's war on Gaza the unra genocide I would say the first victim of this war has been morality and the second victim is human decency never seen human decency uh disappear the way it has with such sadism practice against patients and doctors and nurses in hospitals and last but not least it is the truth but the truth here is not tactical what I mean is Netanyahu can do this as the ICC and the icj and the world community and the international human organizations are up in arms he can do that because he chose lying and deception as a strategy he strategizes just listening to him yesterday talked to an American Network the man just lies from his nose I mean he just you know none ending non-stopping lies and lies about what goes on and he thinks he can get away with it Maran as I mentioned it's the day before the icj might rule uh on the question of whether to order an end to the Israeli offensive in Rafa the ICC prosecutor did say that there may be further requests coming from him how is all of this continuation of these kinds of scenes likely to play out in some of these venues next steps well I tell you I mean uh clearly uh the Israelis are counting on the Americans to protect them from whatever might come out of the ICC and icj and clearly the Israelis have gone to the dark side and they really don't give a damn uh what the icj and ICC says I think Netanyahu basically has lost it he doesn't care I think he understands now that he's uh gone too far and he just needs to continue there's no way he can back off so I think he's going to probably become even more dangerous in the days months even years to come because judging from his National Security advisor sah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this might go on for years in Gaza believe it or not some Israeli media when you read them today they seem concerned that the icj might be about to order an end to the rough offensive do you think that might be the case tomorrow you know it's it's very possible because because of the scenes that are unraveling on TV screens everywhere but uh judging from uh Jake Sullivan's visit to Israel two things are evident the Americans are not going to stop the Israelis from going on Rafa Israelis are already in Rafa more than 700,000 people have been displaced once again out of the Rafa vicinity and clearly the Israelis are adamant and I hope uh that uh the international Court will take this seriously and at least at least take a symbolic gesture of taking a stand that will simply put an end to the Bloodshed to the genocide that are that continues to unravel in front of our Liv Maran bishara thanks so much make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
