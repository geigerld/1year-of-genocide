power generators have been shut down because of the lack of a fuel we're going to take you to the general surgery Department in the Opera floor where their electricity is quite vital but because of it there is a risk of losing lives inside this department as you can see lack of space is a major problem in the hospital particularly this department the general surgery where you see patients and injuries right at the corridor of the hospital here for quite some time simply because the hospital is lacking major space here it's a midsize health facility and unable to accommodate the large number the large number of injuries and patients inside the hospital there's no Treatment available no electricity basically nothing here the hospital is struggling with just the basics I've been here for over a month and a half after being shot in my leg and stomach you can see I've had surgery but beyond that there's only antibiotics I need more surgeries but they're not happening I'm told there's a long waiting list and I've had to wait another 15 days it's already been two months of waiting we are at the pediatric department for children at the alaka hospital and this is the first Department that is experiencing power outage right now and as you can see and and hear here at the floor of this this department uh it's lacking major space right now and we're seeing it children outside in the corridor of this department simply because the rooms inside are packed with patients and injuries as the bombing campaign continues to pound across the central area but right now with the power outage at this particular Department the risk of losing life the rest of it aggravating the ongoing medical problems across the hospital is increasing by the hours the pediatric department not the only one that is experiencing now power outage but also there is uh the surgery the generous surgery department on the Upper Floor that is also experiencing power outage is putting the risk of more lives inside the department at risk all right right now we are in the storehouse where the fuel is gifted for ala hospital here in the central area and right now what the workers are doing here they're trying to collect what is left in these barrels just to keep the generators running we're resorting to drawing fuel from the very depths of the reservoirs just to salvage any usable drops these are then stored in small containers to sustain the electrical generator although such practice is impacting the generator's functionality the hospital is a a very critical point right now and a couple hours or three hours are not far from completely shutting down all the services and risking the lives of everyone inside the hospital make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
