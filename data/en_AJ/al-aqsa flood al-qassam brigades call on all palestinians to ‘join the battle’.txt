all right now spokesman for the alasan Brigade that's the military wing of Hamas is making a statement the for our Fighters will continue to Shell the strongholds of the enemy covered by artillery and missile barrage the last of which was targeting D where enemy positions in the usurped lands were targeted with 100 missiles only in onedot under the AL AA typhoon operation we call on our fellow Palestinians to engage in the affair this will be recorded by Golden letters in history it is our journey as Martyrs and we will be rewarded with Victory well joining me now is Tam kmut a Gaza native and professor of public public policy at the Doha Institute for graduate studies thank you so much for coming in thank you Sam for those perhaps who are not familiar with the background of this explain to us the the background to this as long as you have root causes what the UN several un officials call root causes occupation Siege going on is it just only a question of time before we see these repeated cycles of conflict uh of course Sammy that's a very good question and I have to to emphasize that the root causes of this uh uh conflict remains and still it's the continuation of the Israeli military occupation and apart system in place in Palestine that's the key main uh root cause of course there are also another important factual U uh reasons for this uh among of which is that the dead and clinically dead and dysfunctional peace of process and the international community's absence from really getting it alive back on the stage but why now Tamar why we understand the background situation but why do we see this very massive unprecedented move by Hamas outside of Gaza so I I I think there are a couple of good reasons for this first of all Hamas is both a party in governance and also it's a resistance movement at the same time so it's it's taking care of of the livelihood of 2.2 million Palestinians is living under the ban isolated Gaza Strip so governance comes with resp responsibilities and and from the social economic perspective in the Gaza Strip things are very bad from all fronts uh secondly uh Hamas wants to remain uh or to send a message to um the International Community and also to Israel and the Arab world and especially normalizing countries that that I was going to say is this tied to the wave that was going on in our countries hey let's make peace explain so basically over the last particularly over the last year with this very right-wing fanatic government in isn't now there have been many attempts by the Israelis to fragment and divide the Palestinian movement especially the street the public movement correct uh the PA is very weak it's isolated from one side then you have Hamas watching and observing and Israel thinks that Hamas is there isolated in Gaza with its own troubles and its own challenges to govern but Hamas says no I'm still here I'm a key relevant party and you are not going to be able to isolate me and play this divide and conquer politics so this comes number one as one of the strategies for Hamas to say I am relevant I'm here secondly Hamas is sending a key strategic message to normalizing Arab states and also to normalization attempts with the PA as well being part of it more or less despite to be honest I mean the PA also has a clear position about normalization that normalization will not bring any security to Israel if Israel cannot protect itself as the key Hamas leader said yesterday he said normalization will not bring security if it's not if security if Israel cannot protect itself from Hamas how will it protect other Arab countries which are flocking for to Israel to normalize under the pretext of Israel will bring more security to the region and be able to defend us as a collective allies so is the message that Hamas is trying to send is there will be no peace without an end to the occupation and suffering of Palestinians and we are relevant party that represent that resistance and can ignore it as well is there something to talk about in terms of the Dynamics the internal Palestinian Dynamics here that Hamas is sending a message about that whether it's the the PA whether it's the rise of new groups like The Lion's Den yes yes of course Hamas is more or less laying the foundation of of of a new resistance approach post Oslo post Oso and it says that no matter what Israel can do I mean no matter how powerful is Israel with all its military Arnel and and its control of land and sea and air as long as Palestinians are there we will resist by all means and surprisingly the most impoverished isolated neglected area in the world Gaza Strip the fact that Hamas has managed to do this military operation or to initiate this war on Israel despite all the marginalization and the Embargo imposed on the Gaz it tells you a message this is a people Palestinians are people who want freedom they are at any cost willing to to die to offer whatever they have to live free and that's that's a big message for Israel also you cannot keep occupation
