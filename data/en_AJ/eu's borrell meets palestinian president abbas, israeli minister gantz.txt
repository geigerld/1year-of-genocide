okay let's look into this a bit closer with yasa Alaska who's an academic and specialist on Gaza and the Palestinian Israeli conflict who joins us live from Dublin in Ireland a warm welcome to you and the EU foreign policy Chief as we've been hearing has announced the eu's three Nos and three yeses framework I wonder if we could talk about the NOS to start off with Gaza cannot be leveled no reoccupation no Force displacement are we seeing in any way that being the direction of travel so far um well I mean um if we look um at what has been happening on the ground and the Israeli policy we see the opposite which is Israel is now in um almost um full occupation of Gaza almost um the southern part of Gaza will be occupied soon according to Israeli military leaders um secondly Force displacement of the Palestinians is Israel has done that already and it displaced um more than a million Palestinians from the north of Gaza into the south of Gaza without any access um to electricity to food um to basic uh medical supplies um um and in terms of um in terms of looking into the future um um in terms of security um what we're what we're seeing really is um Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli leader uh saying clearly um in recent days uh that they want to keep the security control of Gaza and they want to to to keep that uh control and they're not going to um change that situation um so that's what Israel uh wants so um when you look at it in terms of security control in terms of occupation in terms of force displacement all of that um has been happening um you know all of this has been happening and all of that we've seen it on the ground in right so so let me get this straight so regarding those three NOS all of those have already been massively violated well in that case let's talk about the three yeses the Palestinian Authority must return to Gaza meaning one single pa not several uh its terms must be defined by the UN Security Council and thirdly Arab countries and the EU must be involved in the construction of a Palestinian State presumably rather than simply Outsourcing it to the United States um do these suggestions address some of the failings to date in establishing a two-state solution um I mean it's very clear U that um that um the two-state solution hasn't been a possibility um for many decades now um and um and the and the EU position is reflecting that U because for years the EU has been talking about political progress in the Israeli Palestinian conflict but it hasn't taken any concrete or policy action to make this possible for example it continues to trade with with Israel um for example it continues to um support Israel at the international level it continues to have diplomatic and economic relations with Israel um so um the EU is reflecting uh you know this political failure on their side secondly there um there is a great of division within the EU countries around the future of the Palestinian issue um there are countries such as for example um Hungary and Germany who are um in full support of the Israeli policy uh in terms of its um attacks on Gaza in terms of its war against Gaza um other countries like France for example they've changed their position and now they're talking about a ceasefire um in terms of the uh the return of the Palestinian Authority um the EU has the EU leader has been talking about that um but really we have uh to put that into context which is the Israeli government hasn't been willing uh to talk about the return of the Palestinian Authority into Gaza um so we have seen really kind of um um a disconnection between what the international and Europeans and European leaders are saying and what the Israeli leaders are doing on the ground right if first Jose barell insists the EU and Arab states must play a key role uh in any future decision making how do you think Israel Israel will respond to that having previously relied solely on the opinions coming out of the White House I think one thing is very clear which is Israel is not interested in the return of the Palestinian Authority to the Gaza Strip not because in principle it's against the Palestinian Authority um I think I think the main reason behind that is because the return of the Palestinian Authority means the return of the political process the return of the Diplomatic process with the Palestinians and the Israeli right-wing government and Benjamin natany himself are not interested in that they're not interested in Palestinian political rights they're not interested in political discussions about the about the Palestinian issue and therefore um they um they have been consistent in saying we will stand against the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza and all of that of course begs the question where then do you make even a political start yes Alaska a very an awful lot of thanks to you for joining us on the news out thank you
