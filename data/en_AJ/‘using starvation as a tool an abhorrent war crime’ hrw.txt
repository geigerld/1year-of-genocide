a leading Rights group has accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza Human Rights Watch says Israel's deliberately denying Palestinian civilians access to food and water and that's a war crime under international law the group says public statements by high ranking Israeli officials such as defense minister yov Galant and national security minister idar benav on blocking food water and fuel are being carried out as policy by Israeli forces and reflects an intention to starve Civ civilians the UN says around more than 2 million Palestinians that's nearly the entire population of Gaza don't have enough food the UN says around half of all Palestinians in Gaza are starving hunger is so widespread that nine out of 10 people are not eating enough or at all every day in the South where most of the people have been forced to seek shelter more than half the internally displaced families have experienced severe levels of hunger starvation of civilians as a method of war is prohibited under the Geneva conventions families in Gaza are facing a dire humanitarian crisis and their desperation is growing by the day our correspondent ish aul has more from Gaza City we're in front of alifa complex which hosts the biggest number of displaced people everyone is asking how can families manage their livelihood while Under Siege and heavy bombing I'm cooking rice to sell to the hungry we need food and water we want to live without rice the people would starve to death we need to work we only have firewood for cooking we only have rice to eat and we have to pay so much more than before we need to feed our children we can't even find flour instead of paying less than a dollar for some flow we now have to pay about $8 that's if we're lucky enough to find the situation is very bad we have children and grandchildren everyone needs to eat there's nothing available except rice and pasta we can't have bread because we can't find flour if you find flower every other day it will never be enough God is my witness children here always cry because they're always hungry currently this situation is the worse compared to other Wars I've seen Wars since since 1967 and this time it's the worst everyone is trying to get some rice to feed their children rice is now the only food available for more than 60,000 displaced people we lost everything we can't find food even for the children I have six children this is the situation here in front of alifa complex people are trying to fire rides for their families and some other people inside the complex can't even do the same Omar Shakir is Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch he's joining me from Aman in Jordan thank you very much indeed for being with us we heard stories there of people who have only got rice uh to eat that they are unable to get things like flour access to water is limited but I want to ask you what evidence there is that it is a deliberate policy by Israel to to restrict these facilities look I think there are about five pieces of very damning evidence that led to this conclusion one is two plus months of uh blocking entry of of food and water second is the blocking of all but a trickle of humanitarian aid from entering into Gaza um these have been documented for for more than two months but then you add to it some of the additional evidence that we looked at one is the apparent raising of AG agricultural lands large percentages of the Agricultural green land in Gaza turned brown and desolate um fourth the report looks at the intentional destruction of objects necessary for survival so I'm talking about wheat Mills I'm talking about hospitals uh water and sanitation facilities um granaries these kinds of things that you need to survive and then you put together the last piece which is statements by Israeli officials spelling out in clear terms that their strategy or policy is to starve civilians as a tool of Leverage to achieve political outcomes whether it be release of hostages the destruction of Hamas putting it all together you reach the clear conclusion that the Israeli government is using starvation as a weapon of War which is an abhorent War crime so uh what do you uh require to be done with the report that you've pulled together I mean this is adding to the mountain of of evidence that Israeli forces are committing Graves grave violations of the laws of war um Human Rights Watch has documented Collective punishment as well of the civilian population which is a war crime deliberately blocking the entry of humanitarian Aid now starvation as a weapon of War we've documented apparently unlawful air strikes um there's also of course the risk of forceable displacement with 1.9 million people in Gazo have been displaced from their homes and I think ultimately there's a need for um action and accountability by the International Community there's a critical vote today at the UN Security Council for protecting civilians and Gaza this report should add to the impetus for States including the United States not to block and to support that initiative it's critical that the prosecutor at the international criminal court U move forward with the formal probe into serious crimes committed in or from Palestine it's critical that all states evaluate all forms of complicity in these grave abuses including um imposing an embargo on uh the sale of arms to the Israeli government given the real risk they'll be used for serious abuses we've been reporting in the last hour that the kamam Shalom uh kamam Abu Shalom Crossing uh the Israeli controlled Crossing into Gaza has been reopened and has been allowing some vehicles in we have seen Aid Vehicles being allowed through the Rafa Crossing it is obvious that that's not nearly enough but what would it take how much would it take to get food back and water back into uh Gaza that the people need I mean you need not just a significant increase because remember the issue is also distribution and some of the restrictions including around fuel as well as the ongoing inaccessibility parts of Gaza I mean northern Gaza is the is the worst hit I mean there you have nine of 10 people according to the world food program that that have gone a full day and night without food that's compared to 2third in all of Gaza but it's even more Stark I mean they're not receiving aid outside of parts of Southern Gaza so it's not just about increasing the quantity obviously it's about ensuring that there's enough sufficient security there is no safe place in Gaza today um so you need them to be able to reach all parts of Gaza and ultimately the aid itself is not going to matter if you continue to have hundreds of bodies of civilians of children piling up by the day so there needs to be an end to unlawful attacks and there needs to be a restoration of basic Services we've had a blackout in Gaza um as a result of destruction of infrastructure um we continue to be without electricity relying on fuel and generators this is not sustainable this is a death sentence for people it needs to end Shak we appreciate you being with us thank you very much indeed thank you
