so student protests in solidarity with Palestinians are continuing to gain momentum spreading across the United States and around the globe police in New York have removed students from a solidarity encampment at New York University similar operations at Columbia University and UCLA and other universities have seen more than 2,000 people arrested in Berlin Police blocked the entrance to humbl University arresting several people who were also protesting in solidarity with Palestinians in Paris now police removed at least 50 protesters occupying parts of CPO University six of the protesters had been on hunger strike and were staging a Sittin well we'll be hearing from our correspondents in both Paris and Berlin shortly let's start though in the United States Mike Hannah is at George Washington University John hendin is at the University of Michigan and Kristen salumi is at a police station near New York University so you're there Kristen because there have been arrests in New York absolutely the last two student encampments were cleared out early this morning much to the student surprise about 60 of them were arrested 14 uh 16 of them from New York University the rest from the new school and they were taken to the Police Plaza which is behind me uh to be processed you can see the police presid presence outside here and as you look around there's a whole support team here waiting for the students as they're released from being processed one by one they've been coming out there's a legal team here uh there are students with water students with medical supplies students with food uh to show their support and give them assistance when they come out of the police processing system and as those students come out they're being cheered uh by the students here and I should say faculty members as well we've seen a lot of Faculty coming and going there's at least 100 maybe 200 people uh around the corner offering that support uh the students I've been speaking to here say that it uh was an unexpected arrest that at NYU in particular just yesterday they were speaking with the administration and the administration told them they had no plans to clear the encampment they think uh the fact that a large dinner for Shabbat with Jewish students about 20 Jewish students was planned in the building right next to where they were set up for that evening may have been a trigger for the for the uh arrests that they didn't want to have any conflict or any uh any um interaction happening there the students say however that they are a peaceful organization uh many of the students that were in the encampment including some who were arrested are themselves Jewish and now they are planning their own Shabbat dinner outside of that one uh where the encampment was later today uh to continue the demonstrations to continue the protests they say if anything this has invigorated them more and they're not going to stop all right Kristen thank you very much that is how the encampment was dealt with at uh the site of the New York University let's go to John hendin who's at the University of Michigan in an Arbor Michigan John uh all right well I have Parton my answer because I see the tents behind you uh I know that there are graduation ceremonies taking place today I wonder whether that might also be a flash point because universities usually don't like their graduation ceremony to be disrupted that's right it seems that other universities have definitely cleared out these encampments before their graduation ceremonies which we we've seen in New York I don't know if that was part of the timing but I'll tell you we're probably two three football fields away from where a graduation is going on right now and yet this protest here continues uh as it has been for some time um and on Saturday one day from now uh 8,000 people will graduate in a massive ceremony with 63,000 people watching so apparently protests and graduations can coexist uh but I've got someone who can tell us a little more about this this is Salma hamami thank you for joining us Salma she's with students for justice in pales um if let me know if I've said that wrong um no you said it correctly so tell me like how is it with how is the protest coexisting with the graduations right now yeah so protests are always going to exists when our University remains complicit in the ongoing genocide in Gazza and has been directly and indirectly contributing financially to the military companies that are bombing RDA so we cannot operate as business as usual so the university is going to try their absolute best to do that however students are always going to be five steps ahead of them and they are going to plan and they are going to coordinate um students here are absolutely committed and dedicated which is why they are withholding themselves back from any and all celebratory actions to commit two actions for gazda and we will see that take place through every single graduation across the country and let me ask you've got a personal connection uh with with Palestine talk to me about that yeah so I am from nablas I also have members in Gazza about 14 of them were recently killed in an ongoing Israeli um attack um I'm sorry to hear that thank you I appreciate that um and not only myself but also several students here have lost hundreds of family members in Gazza um because Palestinians have been scattered all throughout the world so the resistance and the resilience continues to exist here within the confines of an arbor and Beyond so students here have personal connections and students here who also don't have personal connections are witnessing this and will stand up excellent and and just one quick question you are going to remain here after graduation correct yes despite myself myself graduating um I am from an arbor I will be here I will be wherever um the place is that is contributing to the genocide against my people we are going to continue to fight so students here are not backing down thank you s hamami from students for justice in Palestine thank you for joining us um so we're here at this encampment and they say that they're going to remain here after graduation right and I'm and I'm glad you asked that last question John because it is the end of the Academic Year typically students go back home so it does raise the question of the lasting power you know of these of these uh these protests I'll go to Mike now Mike Hannah is at George Washington University in Washington DC so we see every University deals with it differently where you are you know this triangle of law enforcement police um university leadership and the protesters seem to have found a way to coexist for these protests to continue peacefully where do you see this going well the key issue was the refusal of DC police to accept the call by University administrators to move in and remove the encampment uh when it began 9 days ago but another key issue here as well is the uh self-regulation of the demonstrators they hold a meeting at 11:00 they go through all the rules of the encampment uh only a chosen Representatives speak to police speak to the media so all is very tightly organized uh exams begin tomorrow the end of year exams the ones that were due to take place in buildings around University y this area had been moved to other buildings and then commencement graduation takes place on Sunday the 19th that's in uh just over 2 weeks time so the question of whether the students will remain there after commencement that is something uh that is open to speculation uh those we have spoken to are insistent that yes they are going to remain okay so you see this sorry let me rephrase um they say that they will remain that is yet to be seen sometime during the month of May usually is when students go home they say they're going to stay there um Mike as you take a broader look at this what's the impact of these protests been um you were telling us you know there are multiple ways to look at this there's the politics of it there's and there's there's how much these protests actually move the needle on the national stage which is always hard to assess yes it does move the needle on the national stage it is a reminder to Americans of what happened in the protests against the Vietnam War way back in the 60s uh those were heavily criticized but resulted to a degree in the end of the war so this is a point of discussion among the American public uh these protests are a point of dispute among many of the public some support them some don't uh but what is an undercurrent of discussion as well is the fact that while they remain lawful they have a right to exercise their voice now this is an American principle it's part of the Constitution and it is being exercised while no laws are contravened and just one extra word on that uh to understand why the students here are self regulating to this degree uh you just have to take a walk through the food court behind me here there are DC police but there are also Secret Service agents there are protection officers from the state department there are paramedics from the nearby hospital which is a presidential emergency hospital this square is at the epicenter of some of the nation's most secure and vulnerable and sensitive sites the security around them is unbelievable the demonstrators are well aware that security around them goes far beyond the local DC police it is layer upon layer upon layer and hence no red lines are crossed they are very careful to observe the law to its letter you're right that's a very good point that you made there's a lot less room there for unpredictability and disruption generally around these protests just due to where they are geographically so close to the White House and the state department thank you very much Mike Hannah make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alera
