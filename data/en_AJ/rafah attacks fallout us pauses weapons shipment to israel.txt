says that he will stop supplying weapons to Israel if it launches an assault on Rafa it comes after the US confirmed it had paused a weapon shipment to Israel Over concerns Israel isn't addressing the safety of civilians let's get more on this with Phyllis Bennis a fellow at The Institute for policy studies where she directs the new internationalism project joins us now from Washington DC miss Ben it's good to have you with us on Al jazer I'm just wondering how much pressure the US president has been under to make such a bold statement if I can just again just quote him saying to CNN civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers and he's talking about those 2,000 bombs that the US has sent Israel this is an incredibly important move uh first of all every bomb that is held back by Washington means fewer Palestinians will be killed we've seen 30 people k just in the last 24 hours uh in and around Raa uh this notion though this is not enough this notion that they will withhold more of the weapons artillery shells and others if Israel attacks Rafa does not take into account that Israel is already bombing Rafa so this is not the ceasefire that people all around the world and across the United States are demanding it is an important move it does show how the movement the demand for a ceasefire is having an impact on the White House they are desperate to get out from under this divide yeah I do apologize if I I didn't mean to interrupt there miss Bennis I'm just wondering sort of the political Fallout as well because obviously there's the social pressure that's happening across University campuses as we just mentioned uh now spreading to Amsterdam in the Netherlands uh but the in in the last 24 hours we've had this statement about as you say these weapons not being Del to Israel a pause perhaps or a cancellation it's a drop in the ocean to what's already gone and some might say it's just too little too late even it is to put pressure on an Israeli government that seems to be very single-minded about what it wants to do or what it wants to achieve that's absolutely right I think that we have to be clear that the demand for a ceasefire is not being met with these actions it is important because because it's never too little it might be one life saved with one bomb these 2,000lb bombs routinely kill dozen scores more than a hundred people at a time from just that one bomb and this one uh uh package that was being withheld apparently had more than 1,200 of those 2,000 PB bombs so that's not nothing but it is very far from what is required partly because as you say Israel has received an enormous amount of weapons from the United States already and more are underway Congress has just voted to send $26 billion worth of military aid uh and related support to Israel uh in in a in a situation in which there is no accountability there is no conditionality for the violations of international law under which these weapons are going to be used the weapons that are being withheld now aren't any part of that new package of 26 billion worth this was an old agreement from a long time ago from several years ago that only now they decided was a good time because Israel says they need more and they're holding it back which is good it's important and it is not enough do you think there's any co-incidence in the fact that the state department were to issue a report uh about whether their involvement in the war on Gaza and the support for Israel that they've given breaches humanitarian law that supposed to have been delivered I think it was 24 hours ago according to our correspondent Mike Hannah who's in in Washington to secretary blink that has not been released so there will be other calls for that that memorandum or report or however it's being presented to be released to government officials or to The Wider public do you think there is a a correlation between the two I think there are many factors that are correlating with this and one of them is certainly the report which is now as you say 24 hours late beyond the deadline but aside from the deadline the problem has been that an earlier report indicated that the state department was going to find that there were no violations in Gaza that there may have been a violation some other time some other place but the extraordinary level of violations of international humanitarian law the laws of war that were found by the international court of justice to be plausibly genocide there is no acknowledgement of that and if that report comes out now saying we don't find that there are any violations there will be hell to pay in the internal dynamics of the Biden Administration which is divided over this issue within the Democratic party as well as on the campuses across this country and around the world it's not only the Netherlands it's also Mexico Germany other countries around the world are seeing campuses erupting miss Ben sadly we have to leave it there I'm sure we'll be talking to you again about this I'm sure in the not too distant future always good to have you
