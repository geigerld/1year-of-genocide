the initial us response to the hummus attack 10 days ago was immediate condemnation but absent was the call for Israeli restraint that in the past would be part of us reaction over the past 24 hours as a US Secretary of State shuttled through the region there's been an apparent shift in the US position President Biden now advising Israel against any reoccupation of Gaza what happened in Gaza in my view is Hamas and the extreme elements of Hamas don't represent all the Palestinian people and uh I think that uh it would be a mistake to uh for Israel to occupy God again we but to going in and taking out the uh the extremist the uh Hezbollah is up north but Hamas down south is a necessary requirement do you believe that Hamas must be eliminated entirely yes I do but there needs to be a Palestinian Authority there needs to be a a path to a Palestinian State we work together to make sure that to the best of our ability this conflict is not spread a possible reason for the US shift may be a consequence of Anthony blink's discussions in his meeting with Egyptian president abdal fatah Eli anger at Israeli action was made public this is a huge crisis and I'm concerned that the Israeli reaction exceeded the right to self-defense and turned into a collective punishment of the Gaza Strip which has 2.3 million Palestinians in Doha the Iranian foreign minister met the Emir of Qatar tamim bin hammad Alani who maintains relations with all parties to the conflict in an interview with Al jazer Iran's top Diplomat said his country will not remain a bystander if Israel continues attacking Gaza if the measures aiming at immediately stopping the Israeli occupations attack that are killing children in the Palestinian territories namely in the Gaza Strip and in the deadlock it is highly probable that many other fronts will be opened this option is not ruled out and this has becoming increasingly more probable the Biden Administration appears increasingly concerned about a wider War a recommitment to a two-state solution along with increasing efforts in humanitarian relief may be part of a strategy to reassure Arab allies that the US can be a fair broker in the conflict Mike Hannah Al jazer Washington let's go live now to Heidi Joe Castro in Washington DC heidy it does appear there is this shift in the rhetoric coming from the US president when it comes to the Gaza War what do we make of it that's right MIM but it's notable that in this interview that President Biden gave he doesn't even come close to criticizing Israel rather this shift if you want to call it that it is that he's coming closer now to warning Israel uh into not to show some restraint and not occupying Gaza now he also expressed concern for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza uh saying that he believed Israel though would follow international law and minimi minimize civilian casualties he also said that he was quote confident that civilians in Gaza would not be prevented from having water food or medicine now this is an interview that was taped on Thursday it just aired in the United States but obviously from what we've been seeing that has not been the situation for gazin who are indeed uh running short on all of those humanitarian needs now as far as uh the president it goes now he is now weighing a potential visit to Israel having received an invitation from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu the White House not giving much information about this potential visit a lot of it depending on the security circumstances going forward when and if this happens and also asked more to expand on the two-state solution that Biden alluded to in this interview which of course has long been the US policy the president was asked whether now is the time for that two-state solution to be pursued his answer was no thank you for that Heidi Joe Castro there for us in Washington DC
