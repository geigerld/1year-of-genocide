welcome back as we continue our special coverage now hundreds of Palestinians in Gaza have been killed on the eighth day of Israeli air strikes at least 2,200 have been killed since Saturday let's bring in Professor Norman finlin now who's a specialist of the Israeli Palestinian conflict he's also the author of Gaza an inquest into its martyrdom he joins us from New York welcome to Al jazer let me ask you first then in your view can Israel's bombardment of Gaza be seen as anything other than Collective punishment on a vast scale well I think it's rather more than Collective punishment there are different gradations in international law one gradation would be Collective punishment a second level would be a war crime a third level would be a crime against humanity and the fourth level would be the crime of genocide I would say this particular particular operation is somewhere between a crime against somewhere between a crime against humanity and genocide under international law there are fine points but roughly I would locate it between those two categories given what you say I mean cutting off electricity food and water how can that be squared with the rules of War as it were and international conventions well it obviously can't be squared with uh the laws of what's called under International humanitarian law or the laws of war the cutting off of water cutting off of electricity Fuel and food uh to a civilian population if you bear in mind prime minister netanyahu's claim that this situation will go on for a protracted period of time if you connect those two facts protracted period of time no food no water no electricity then it's hard for anyone to conceive that being anything but the crime under international law but the crime of genocide in a historical sense should hamas's military operation be seen not just in isolation but in the context of the root cause of the conflict I think the more important question is not hamas's military operation but Israel's military operation uh I myself these past few days have been rereading my own book to refresh my memory about the various Israeli operations the most infamous of which were operation castled in 2008 to9 and an operation protective Edge in July August 2014 if you look closely of what unfolded during those two so-called operations really massacres uh they approximate roughly what Israel is doing now but Israel is now conducting itself on a more intense scale and probably it's fair to say on a qualitatively more intense scale but the actual tactics if you go back to those two other so-called operations the tactics don't differ what I think does differ this time is the objective in operation castet and operation uh protective Edge the goal was to terrorize the Palestinian population in Gaza as well as Regional actors into submission and a feeling of futility in this particular operation the goal has escalated and it seems to be an effort to ethnically cleanse the northern sector of Gaza and then declare it Israel's new security zone so given that new objective uh the intensity of the tactics that are common to all of Israel's major operations uh people forget and I will admit I myself forgot until I sat down and start to reread uh the history of those operations the tactics don't really differ the targeting of civilians the telling of civilians to flee when there's no place to flee the flattening of infrastructure civilian uh hospitals ambulances that's so to speak and I hate to use the expression but in the case of Israel's operations it's old hat that's how they've always conducted the operations and the fact of the matter is in my opinion and I can't say I can prove it it's simply based on my knowledge of the subject matter uh if in N if in 2009 or 2010 Israel had been even remotely held accountable for its criminal actions against the people of Gaza had there been any accountability it's forgotten that even in the Goldstone report by Richard Goldstone in the Goldstone report he described the blockade of Gaza as a possible crime against humanity now as I pointed out a few moment ago on the scale of crimes under international law crime of humanity Falls just below the crime of genocide it's a very serious crime okay let me just jump in there if I if I may you mentioned Regional actors there any War has unforeseen consequences how much danger is it that this could become a wider regional conflict in your view I think the danger is uh in my opinion the danger is quite High uh there has been a lot of talk as I'm sure you know this past week about Israel using this attack as a pretext or using the events of October 7th as a pretext for attacking Iran if Hezbollah enters in in a major way then the argument is going to be made that hesel is simply an armed uh unit or subdivision of Iran and therefore it would justify an attack on Iran and I do not believe but I have to enter the caveat I'm not a military expert but I do not believe Israel is capable of fighting a war on two fronts this is not 1967 it's a very different alignment lineup of regional actors I do not believe Israel's capable of fighting a war on two fronts if Hezbollah enters the war if Israel uses that as a pretext to launch what it's wanted to launch for a very long time now a preemptive strike on Iran I can't imagine it can do it in any other way except to use a tactical nuclear weapon and at that point all bets are off we leave it there Norman finlin we very much appreciate your insights here on aler thank you for joining us you're welcome
