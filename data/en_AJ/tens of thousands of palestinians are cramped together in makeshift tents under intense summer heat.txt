this is from gaza i'm still alive and i know that we are living in the hottest area in this world i mean it our world is melting due to the global warming and i know that this is a common thing i mean everyone in this  The world is suffering from the high temperature during this summer imagine living this extremely hot weather as a g in the gen imagine spending your summer in a plastic 24 hours days a week for months now or even when we get it, wait, what do we say in the morning that we will put medicine in it for agriculture?  So I go to garden after two o’clock. I tell you to take the medicine. I mean, put some toys in the mower. I put them between the blankets. You leave them. You want to show them our blankets. You sold us the refrigerator. The hot water. I put the bucket down and it is covered with dust so that the girls can bathe in it to heat it up in the sun. It’s okay. I make it all dirty and I said clean. There is nothing.  Oh, there are no shampoos or soaps, cleaning materials at all. A box of shampoo is 180 shekels, and we are not able to get it. I am 75 years old, so I cannot sit in the tents and the stove is on fire. We confirmed that we are not sitting in the middle of the tents. I mean, you see, I am sitting. It is a blanket with a mattress made of it. I come and sit here in the morning, and in the afternoon you break a shadow. I sit in the second apartment. Where are Safieh's utensils? Where are Safiyah's utensils from? I'm telling you, I left my house. I left my house with nothing but the demolition that is on me. There is neither summer nor winter. We came out like the demolition that is upon us. See what it means that you brought it up.  Shameful in all respects. There is nothing to put our bride through. What is Abdullah? I suffer from the ground of the soldier. From the heat of the tent. From the crack of the tent. From the sand they sit on. It is all polluted. Our lives, I mean, even the air is polluted. To the doctors. Abdullah advised. He advised the relationship. A refrigerator that keeps away from the grill and does not hold the sand and its cells. In a cold area, the hobbies of the world are always free and you know 7000 t of explosives the environments are catastrophic so so sorry like the heat be even make subscribe channel the latest from alera
