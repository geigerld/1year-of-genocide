is Israel in breach of the UN Court's ruling the international court of justice ordered its military to end acts of genocide as well as to prevent incitement to commit genocidal acts but with more Palestinians killed in Gaza every day who can force Israel to comply this is Inside hello welcome to the program I'm Adrien finegan the United Nations top court has ordered Israel to prevent and punish actions that could lead to or incite genocide in Gaza it also ordered much needed humanitarian Aid and basic Services be allowed into the strip the ruling was widely viewed as a step towards ending Israel's war but in the weeks that have followed troops have continued to act with impunity intensifying their indiscriminate killing of of Palestinians and now prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is threatening a possible military offensive in Rafa the southernmost point of the territory Palestinians are trapped with nowhere to go so what can be done to end Israel's brutality we have plenty to discuss with our guests but first this report on January the 26th the United Nations highest court determined there was plausible evidence of genocide in Gaza it was a historic moment for Palestinians the international court of justice then ordered Israel to take all measures within its power to prevent acts that violate the genocide convention but in the days that followed Israel seems to have ignored the ruling in fact according to un expert Franchesca albane appears to be in breach of the Court's orders in just over two weeks since the icj ruling the Army has killed more than 2 th000 Palestinians in Gaza bringing the death toll to more than 28,000 since October the 7th in the same period over 3,000 people were injured the health Ministry warns these numbers will only rise with victims found under the rubble every day Alban points to the continued demolition of infrastructure and the ongoing lack of medical supplies food and clean water as further examples of Israel's violation of the Court's orders it could get worse prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered his military to draw up plans for a ground offensive in Rafa in the southernmost tip of Gaza more than 1.4 million displaced Palestinians 2third of the population are Sheltering in the city un facilities there are operating at many times above capacity schools mosques churches and Halls have become play places of Refuge people are crammed into tents and makeshift shelters While others are sleeping on the streets this is would be disaster if they had launch an attack on ra U they will be the master of genocide uh criminal war criminal I could say while the icj ruling may be a legal victory for Palestinians many are asking how beneficial it is if Israel defies its orders in Gaza Veronica Pedroza Al jazer for inside story so let's bring in our guests for today's discussion from Rafa in southern Gaza we're joined by yusf hamash a Gaza resident and advocacy officer for the Norwegian Refugee Council here in Doha is Manan Rabani co-editor of Jalia an online news website he's also a non-resident fellow at the center for conflict in humanitarian studies and from London we're joined by Neeve Gordon a professor of international law and human rights at Queen Mary University Neeve is also a board member of the international State Crime initiative gentlemen welcome to you all let's start with you Yousef is there any sign there that Israel is complying with the icj's orders yeah unfortunately we didn't see any difference either between before the decision have been made by the icj or after there is not not the not tangible until now we are talking about the daily average for the trucks that allow to enter through ra Crossing and Shalom is 158 truck and the need is more than a thousand per day so I don't unfortunately the displaced families in Rafa didn't feel any tangible change with the amount of Aid that came into Gaza but and add to that the catastrophic situation in the northern part of Gaza and Gaza City which unfortunately until now our our hands are tight and we cannot we are not able to provide assistance to the northern part of Gaza because we don't have an access it was allowed previously to it was allowed to enter for a few amount of food items and after that unfortunately after the attack of one of the eight trucks that have been delivered by Ona and the coastal Road none of the tracks have been sent to the northern part of Gaza and currently the the population there more than 400,000 citizen are living through a famine a literal famine we used to call it we used to call and demand that we there is the situation in the north is on the verge of a faming currently we have a faming families there are eating animal food or looking for anything to feed their children and unfortunately they don't have any options in front of the need of their children in the northern part of Gaza to provide them anything it's a catastrophic situation in Gaza unfortunately the situation haven't been changed and youf people must be particularly worried about Israel's threat to launch a ground offensive there in Rafa uh where will people go and that's the question everyone's had the Raa families who are being displaced the Rafa have been displaced several times this is now they became kind of expert in displacement unfortunately all the options that we had before and personally I live in the northern part of Gaza in jabal I have been I have fled from a place to the other four or five times now I don't have any other options and all of us have been trapped in in Rafa and more than 60% of the housing unit in general of Gaza Strip have been destroyed the remaining housing units are in Rafa so even if they were pushed somewhere else from Rafa to be forced to flee again unfortunately there is no options we don't have any place to go the Gaza City and the northern part of Gaza is totally destroyed the middle area is under bombardment most of the time on a daily basis you're talking about loads of bombardment several areas and other areas now we are trapped between the Israeli tanks and the Egyptian border from the other side so even Rafa as as a city doesn't have the the capacity to manage the need of all of these amount of people whove been displaced in Rafa more than 1,500,000 C citizen in 55 sare km in ra currently without any option or solution or any hope in the Horizon for a solution for the situation Moen robani um what do you make of what you just heard there from from Yousef is Israel in breach of the UN Court's ruling well I would argue that it's more in breach of the ruling today than it was on the day that the ruling was issued um the the nature and intensity of the Israeli Onslaught on the Gaza Strip appears to be unchanged um what has changed is a geographical scope which as we've just heard has now extended um to ra and the southern Gaza Strip I think the other change is that time is a factor um as we've just heard what had been hunger and severe hunger a month ago is now an actual famine we've also seen that Israel continues um to block Aid continues to shoot up Aid convoys Snipes at um ambulances uh killing killing their staff and so on so I I really don't see anything any change in Israeli conduct except for the worse and with the additional Factor um of time there's absolutely no reason that any judgment that was valid last month would um not be at least equally valid today we'll leave the the legal argument to Eve in just a moment but politically what can be done to force Israel to comply well this is a decision really that is in the hands of Israel's Western sponsors particularly um the United States and the European Union um we had a statement today I believe from the White House um indicating that the United States does not want to see any combat in ra over the period of uh Ramadan which begins in um around uh March 10th because it's concerned about the regional repercussions but what that in effect does is give Israel a green light to continue and even intensify its campaign between now and um that day it's quite clear that if the United States wanted this to come to an end it would take no more than a phone call from the White House to the Israeli Prime Minister and it would end instantaneously they've made a choice they have made a decision they have an ideological commitment to Israel's campaign they are supporting it without qualification or reservations and the consequences are um what we're seeing on the ground and what um uh our guest in uh in ra just informed us about Neeve uh Neeve Gordon in London is is it possible from a from a legal standpoint to determined yet whether Israel is in breach of the orders issued by the icj requiring it to take steps to protect uh Palestinians rights and to cease all activities that could uh constitute genocide I think it is possible to claim that Israel is in breach but Israel is also we are seeing that Israel is also preparing a legal defense it's not as the two first speakers noted it's not changing really its strategy on the ground but it's actually instituting three notable uh interventions to create a defense first it's launching a series of Investigation into particular incidents where it says maybe war crimes uh were carried out we we know that from the past that these investigations usually Target soldiers and not commanders and surely not political leaders and if we look at 2014 after Israel killed over 2,000 Palestinians it only one investigation went through and in it two soldiers were found guilty of stealing 200 drugs so I don't think these investigations are serious but legally they're very important we also see how Israel's attack on the United Nation relief and work agency and the the idea behind this attack is also a legal idea first it wants to claim that many much of the evidence provided by the south Afric in the South African application I is not true it was given by un bodies and like the U like unra they too could could be some way aligned with quote unquote terrorist and therefore we should not believe this evidence and second it's using uh its allegations against unra to stop or to not totally stop but to kind of limit the humanitarian Aid that's coming into the Gaza Strip saying hey this is a terrorist organization we need to look closer into uh uh what what is being brought in and third uh we see that there's much less genocidal incitement in the Israeli media but it's important to to understand that the issue of intent is not only the utterance of the Israeli politicians and Israeli soldiers but it is also the kind of actions that Israel is taking and so there's also the question of circumstan intent namely if Israel attacks ra it will still be a a South Africa will still be able to claim that it is carrying out genocide with intent NE just just briefly if you can what legally then can be done at this stage to force Israel to comply I mean what are the implications here for the icj and and its Authority the there's a few questions here one is that the icj itself is only a Judicial arm it's not an executive arm and even if tomorrow morning the icj ruled on a seiz fire a rued that immediately much more humanitarian aid needs to come into Gaza the only arm that can make Israel do that within the United Nations framework is the security Council the the icj itself has no enforcement mechanism it's the security Council that has to rule and decide on enforcement mechanisms following an icj ruling uh the I the South Africa can uh uh uh uh apply again to the the icj and say listen the the situation is getting worse Israel's beginning Onslaught on the ra on RAF it's much more dangerous can you issue other measures such as a full suspension of hostilities although I would say that the first initial six measures the only way to comply by them is a suspension of hostilities namely a seiz fire okay uh Yousef hamash picking up on on what n was saying there you touched upon it in in your one of your first answers tell tell us more about the situation on Aid to Gaza Israel insists that it is enabling the entrance of humanitarian Aid into Gaza and is quote facilitating the transfer of any amount of Aid requested the scope of incoming Aid is only limited it says by the handling capabilities of the UN and other agencies in the Gaza Strip you're saying though that there's been no improvement in the delivery and availability of Aid right yeah and unfortunately if you look to the Egyptian side you can see how many trucks are waiting just to be allowed to be entering that there is a huge problem with the supply chain itself in terms of Aid we usually assist and do our assessment to clarify the needs that we should cover urgently and unfortunately within our the processing providing the aid into Gaza the needs usually Chang before we are we are we have the the a tangibles in our hand unfortunately if you go again to the Egyptian inside of the Border you will see that hundreds of trucks are waiting to be allowed to go into the process that it's taking really long the amount of trucks are not covering 10% of the need yet 150 truck is the average per day while we need to recover at least a th000 truck per day we as long we never we didn't reach that number of trucks of a trucks into Gaza we will still facing famine in the north another catastrophic situation in the middle area and another catastroph situation in Rafa because we cannot we are not able to do our role without having the aid the aid is waiting on the other side of the Border waiting to be allowed on a daily basis they have to be they have to the trucks need to be scanned from both side the Egyptian side and the Israeli side we were expecting that after opening Kum Shalom that the the number of a trucks will increase but unfortunately we didn't see any difference either before or after and it's I don't think that we need to look about the obligations related to to that we need to think about it from a humanitarian perspective there is a huge need there is a catastrophic crisis one of the most complicated crisis on the planet and I think without allowing 1,000 truck per day we are going to face what we are facing currently in the North and the another thing to be highlighted that the issue in Rafa are shading what's going on on the North unfortunately because we don't have access either for communication information there we cannot be on the ground to understand exactly what's going on but what we receive from relatives family members or friends from the north it's heartbreaking and our our hands are are tight in front of that because we cannot we don't have the ability to access to the northern part and Gaza City to provide assistance for families we we'll be talking in depth about about this whole Aid issue on our next in Side Story on uh on Monday uh moan Rabani um the icj's orders are a test not only of the the courts Authority but of other signatories to the genocide convention why the deafening Silence from from many of those Nations and and and what pressure if any does Israel's failure to comply with the Court's provisional orders put on the US and and other uh Israeli allies well the the Court's rulings are binding on all State parties to the genocide convention and that includes the United States and that includes each and every member state of the European Union what we've essentially seen since their initial ruling is business as usual you take for example the Netherlands where a number of Human Rights organizations have sued the Dutch government um seeking a court order to order the government to stop supplying spare parts for the isra really F35 jets that are um raising the Gaza Strip to the ground and the Court ruled in favor of the government um that its um uh reliability as a supplier and as a um uh as a commercial supplier trumped any other consideration such as um the government's obligations um under the genocide convention on Monday um there there will be an appeal of of this initial ruling and it will be very interesting to see if this time um the courts decide that yes um the genocide convention does apply not only um to adversaries and enemies of the west but to um Western governments um as well in terms of the United States I think we have to recognize How Deeply ideologically committed um President Biden and his most senior AIDS are to an Israeli Victory um their real issue with Israel is is not what Israel is doing to Palestinians but what Israel is not doing to Palestinians in other words Israel's failure to achieve a military Victory against the Palestinian armed organizations that is really the only significant difference um between Washington and the Israeli government and and as Professor Gordon said um the icj does not have enforcement mechanisms and what we've seen as Western governments essentially acting as if they're free to ignore um their obligations uh Visa V Israel and its genocidal campaign in the Gaza Strip Nave Gorton what does the law say about countries like the US who hold influence over Israel countries that are that are also signatories to the genocide convention what are their responsibilities under international law they certainly cannot be complicit with genocide and I think What mo showed and said is that there are several countri countries now that have been complicit with Israel's genocidal violence both by uh supplying weapons and money and by supplying political support and I I I know that there are several lawyers now preparing a case against the United States and the UK governments for complicity I know that the foreign office in in in the UK has uh expressed serious concerns about Israel's uh committing war crimes in the Gaza Strip at a time when the UK government continues to transfer weapons to Israel so I think these governments need to also be careful and these leaders need to be careful that history will not judge them as being as taking part in in in in one of the worst genocides in the 21st century Yousef hamash what would your your message to the world be right now on on this issue of whether or not Israel is complying with the icj's orders yeah is Israel not being applying to the icj put a new commitment to the world leaders and International Community to do their role unfortunately since the beginning of this war we didn't see a real action from the worldly as us as which represent itself as a country who is leading the world unfortunately we are not seeing a real effort towards stopping that's what's going on and what what's going what's taking place in Gaza is inhuman and we don't see a real action from the International Community and world leaders once again we are failing and the International Community is failing us as Palestinian here in Gaza we from the International Community to un the security Council the United Nation now the icj I think that no more effort can be done for Palestinians and that was the last step that could be done towards trying to save the lives of Palestinians in in Gaza under this madness and we don't see a real action and unfortunately they had to stand ahead their responsibilities because they will held responsible in front of us and the history itself What mo Rabani what are the implications then for the Israeli political establishment on on deciding whether to comply or not with the Court's provisional orders and and is Israel's military in lock step here with the government or is or is there some unease in the military I'm I'm sure there's um unease at the level of both the political and um military leadership unease about being put under scrutiny and I think unease at the tremendous moral and political loss that they've incurred by now being found to be plausibly committing genocide particularly given that Israel is so reliant on the Goodwill of Western public opinion and that much of that support comes from the image of Israel as being somehow reparations for the Nazi Holocaust um now Israel is associated with genocide as a perpetrator and not only as a victim so this will have severe um long-term consequences but I think in the present moment I think the Israeli leadership is isn't really looking at the fine points of the law it's not even looking at the he and Netanyahu was very clear that he won't be affected by anything coming out of the ha in terms of this military campaign he's looking at Washington and he's looking at Brussels those are his political and for that matter legal terms of reference um and it will be on the basis of what emanates from those two capitals that he will decide what he will and will not do next naeve do you want to pick up on on what was saying there Israel of course has a history of pushing the limits of international law right I I wonder to what extent Israel's government is is is circumventing its own domestic legal system to justify its its actions in Gaza well we have not seen a substantial increase in humanitarian as demanded by the court we have not seen a significant change in the repertoire of violence deployed is in Gaza and a decrease in the killing of civilians indeed I think uh we we're seeing the same level of Civilian death as we saw before the Court ruling so again it's a controversion of the court and we have not seen any indictments and even investigations of those inciting genocidal violence again as demanded by the court so the Israeli government I think has decided that in many ways it is going to ignore the code Court we do see the legal establishment as I pointed out earlier preparing a legal defense but I think we also have to remember that netan has an a personal interest to continue with this uh war on the Palestinian people because he knows that the minute he will stop this war then uh he will be under immense investigation and the Israeli public will demand his resignation so the only uh uh what is keeping netan actually in power is the war and therefore he he's saying as I think Moen Rabani said before that despite what the International Community said despite what the court said despite even what the president of the United States has said he's going on and and instructing the military to go into the into RAF and uh so I think there's now a kind of clash between a certain legal establishment within Israel that that still respects the idea of the icj and uh and the political and Military leadership in the country all right there gentlemen I'm afraid we're going to have to end it many thanks to you all Yousef hamash Moen Rabani and
