the Israeli military has been heavily targeting Central and Southern Gaza at least 16 people have been killed including nine children as Israeli forces hit Al maasi on Thursday it's a tiny strip of land in the west of Gaza that Israel has repeatedly said would be a safe Zone more than 22,400 Palestinians have been killed since the Hamas Le attack on October the 7th an mahmud's joining us live from Rafa in southern Gaza we're seeing more air strikes as you've been reporting for weeks now but including areas that the is IES had claimed were safe yes well the entire uh city of Rafa was designated as a safe area since the beginning of the war that's the first time evacuation orders began in the northern part of Gaza City where people were sharply ordered to move to the southern part uh mainly to rafah City here because it is a safe here but so far I mean the numbers of attacks on RAF City are quite uh similar to uh the numbers of attacks in in the northern part and and Gaza City and now particularly we're looking at something that is very devastating and misleading in terms of the narrative about evacuation Zone and safety zone by the Israeli uh military which is this small part of of of land small sliver of land in the western side of raah city that stretches from der balah passing through kanun and RAF City and ends at the Egyptian Gaza border this is Al maasi area where people are told constantly to move to because it is a safe area it's a largely uh it's an open uh largely sand area underdeveloped part of it is Farmland but it lacks the very basic necessities and it's not it's not suitable for people to shelter it because it's it has literally nothing uh to so people can protect themselves uh from what people are doing right now as the moment they arrive there they try to set up the tents where they can protect them s but again as of yesterday what happened this has been proven false and acccurate in terms of the narrative about safe uh zones the people were targeted in that area residential home was targeted and destroyed and this place to displ families inside the residential home were killed mainly women and children as well as all the the debris the rubbles fell on the nearby tents and injured many uh many people as overnight the uh central part of RAF we're talking about the the northern e the northern eastern side of RA City an area better known as where residential home was targeted an entire family buja family was killed and mainly we're looking again another pattern of killing more children so this pattern of mass killing of Palestinians continues despite the many narratives the many uh uh justifications by the Israeli military still going on and it it has not stopped not even for uh for a day if people do not die of the bombs they are likely to die of the terrible situations that are going on in the central area of the gas STP the uh the aerial bombardment campaign continu continues in a very intensive way uh as the Israeli military pushing deeper into one of the refugee camps Al maazi refugee camps where it's completely been encircled and bombed heavily by the Israeli military but here's one thing that we've noticing since the a pent of destruction of all means of life to the point making it very impossible for people to even go back and and and and and and live reside in the areas that being targeted we're talking about not only residential home but also anything that could help people survive and stay there has been destroyed we're talking about his schools for example Health Facilities Ona managed and operated the schools the vast majority have been uh destroyed which is is just something that people are frustrated about because this is what they think in terms of the US support into Ona to support education to build schools in one hand but on the other hand there is this uh fund that goes for the bombings of these very school that were created for refugees the children uh in the Palestinian uh territory so far the patterns is the same The Killing continues the massive Slaughter of Palestinians for 90 days hasn't stopped Hy thank you very much indeed Han mahm talking to us from in southern Gaza
