I want to take you back to our main story ongoing Israeli bombardment of Gaza we're joined Now by francisa albanesi she's the UN special reporter on the occupied Palestinian territory she's joining us now from Katana in Italy thank you very much indeed for being with us uh there are talks in the background about ceasefires there is of course the conflict in Northern Israel with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and yet the people of Gaza are still facing a crisis yes of course of course people in Gaza are facing a crisis people in Gaza have been facing a crisis since ever and worse than ever since october8 the people in Gaza are trapped in a Hell Without uh comparison and there is no way no way they can be saved in Gaza it's shocking to me that there is even a resolution of a un security counciling Security Council ordering a CIS fire and still is not in place there there is no other way to stop this Carnage in Gaza other than enforcing a ceas fire and given the fact that Israel doesn't seem willing to comply it is to be forced to do so there are no other ways we went uh from very recently to seeing uh Global protests on the streets of cities around the world in support of uh the Palestinian cause and and of course in support of Israel as well those seem to have quietened down the politics seems to have quietened down we have as I say the ceasefire negotiations possibly on one side Israel has its conflict with Hezbollah to the north is it true is it fair to say that things see everybody seems to be basically just waiting for the next thing to happen and in the meantime the people of Gaza are simply going through what you've described day after day after day well on a way in a way I agree with you that things seems to have sort of become quieter but this is not quite because the protests have been repressed in the street pretty much everywhere including in the west student protests have been have been cracked down often violently the encampments have been uh abruptly uh forced to shut down so I don't think that people are really quiet people are in distress because they are horrified about what's happening in in Gaza and they are horrified to see that politicians do not respond at the same time yes the the politics do not align with the street then of course the risk of normalizing this new law is there this is this is where we are and again it's equally shocking we're talking about the the Cesar uh negotiations that are sort of being held very quietly shall we say in the background there's not a lot of news coming out of uh out of that at the moment do you think that there's a risk that we're going to see an increase in the number of attacks that the Israeli military is carrying out as we move towards a situation where there might be a ceasefire whereas of course the Israeli government is anxious to have some sort of concrete resolution as it would see it to its conflict in Gaza I do see that the level of violence and tension is escalating it has escalated over over the past months and I do not see any any tangible signal that this is going to this is going to stop maybe the discussions for a for a sis fire are ongoing I don't know anything about that so I cannot M what I'm what I see though is that people continue to to die out of out of starvation there is famine in in Gaza there are again this is something that I've said it over and over the hospitals do not have capacity to treat Gaza patients there is nothing nothing decent and dignified left to the people in Gaza and these in itself should be addressed but also let's not forget the pal alans in the occupied pales the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem because as we speak in recent days both Israeli ministers uh have spoken of advancing the annexation of uh of the large weights of the West Bank and uh the policy has advanced in this sense this is the other New Normal that International Community seems to to be oblivious about this is not this is Gaza is not an isolated the case Israel seems to be at war with the Palestinians as a whole Franchesca Alban a un special repor on the occupied Palestinian territory we appreciate your time ma'am thank you very much indeed make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
