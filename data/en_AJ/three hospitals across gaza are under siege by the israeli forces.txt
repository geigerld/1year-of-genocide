the humanitarian crisis in southern Gaza the AL Amal hospital is under attack with Medical Teams trapped by heavy gunfire the Palestinian red crescent says one of its staff has been killed at Nasser Hospital also in the South Israeli troops have encircled the facility that's according to eyewitnesses St patients and displaced people seeking shelter are trapped inside since night time we have been carpet bombed by Israeli warplanes the entire area near Naser hospital was shaking as if it were an earthquake we took shelter in the building stairwell until the morning we assumed the Israeli soldiers would lay Siege to the area so we ran for our lives others took shelter in the hospital While others remain stranded Israeli snipers are shooting all those moving on the road at night the Israeli war planes kept shelling the area our home was hit and we all ran and took shelter in narad hospital we were besieged by Israeli tanks and snipers all around many were killed and are still lying on the road and in the north of the strip Israeli forces have been laying Siege to Alfa gaza's largest hospital for a week now Palestinians who fled the scene described seeing Israeli tanks running over dead bodies in the courtyard and crushing ambulance Vehicles while Al shazir hany Mahmud is live from Rafa honey what's the latest that you can bring us about these sieges on medical facilities I'm talking specifically about shifa in the north and Nasser in the central part of central to southern part of the Gaza Strip yes sir well uh so far just judging from the patterns of deliberate attacks on Health Facilities across the Gaza mainly in the city of hanun and the northern part and Gaza City uh one indication that Israeli military is at war with the health care System across the Gaza we're looking at hospitals for example in kanun right now two hospital hospital and Nas hospital where within the past 24 hours have been under military Siege as the Israeli military and it's military equ vehicle and tanks and attack drones are encircling these two facilities blocking the entrance with uh with a a pile of sand preventing medical staff patients and injuries inside the hospital from leaving safely and constantly failing to provide a safe Corridor for people and evacuates uh trapped inside the hospital what we're getting confirmed from Al hospital that not only it has been under constant bombing and tank Shields but also loud speakers are ordering people inside the hospital that includes medical staff injuries patients decid they have to evacuate immediately and to come out only with their underwear on and that has been confirmed by multiple sources and eyewitness on the ground those who managed to flee the harrowing situation inside the hospital here in in overcrowded ra the hospitals are are in dire need of medical supplies and and gradually they are running out of space running out of medical supplies running out of sufficient care to save lives and provide a a a proper inter medical intervention for people for people and injuries a shifa hospital is a completely horrifying story as not only has been stormed four times but it is has turned in the words of James Elder the spokesperson of Unicef who describ during his visit these hospitals as utter Devastation and have turned into graveyards for Palestinians right now Han in addition to the siege of these medical facilities that we've mentioned shifa Nas alal um the Israeli bombardment continues what and where have they been targeting [Music] yes what it's almost simulataneous and intense bombing campaign and a complete destruction of Health Facilities that appoint injuries don't have a place to go to but in overnight attacks in raah City two residential buildings in central ra the Central and the eastern part of it caused the death of 10 people mostly children and women people who were Sheltering inside these Residential Building within the past 24 hours in RAF alone 30 people have been killed in these Relentless attacks and multiple injuries all transferred either to Kuwait hospital or a naar hospital in the Central Area 18 people Sheltering in a residential home in

more relentlessly within the past weeks in Kanan Unice particularly around hammed City residential City where five more people reported killed as of the attacks by drones and by the tank shells it's
