Southern Gaza is where Israeli forces told Palestinians living in Northern Gaza to move for their own safety human Els reports from conun more homes destroyed more families ripped apart by Israeli bombs followed by the all too familiar cries for help at the overstretched hospital and the desperate fight to save lives the area was hit by a number of missiles many were killed and injured all of them were children all civilians the entire area was leveled as if it were an earthquake it is a genocide all those killed were children innocent children the entire neighborhood was reduced to dust the Gaza Health Ministry says several Palestinians were killed and injured in the strike kanun is in the southern Gaza and housing people forcibly displaced from the north Israel has told Palestinians to move South while it intensifies operations in the north then it bombs the South again and again I was coming with my horse I stopped the horse the aircraft came and fired something that looked like a belt in the sky the bombs rained down on us there was bombardment everywhere they were not Rockets they were like Barrel bombs so I kept looking at them I have two young daughters and this boy everything collapsed and I couldn't see anything survivors Salvage what they can in the hope they may rebuild their homes one day it's the first time I've seen such an air strike what is happening I asked God to take Vengeance on the United States they killed us inflicted a knar upon us I asked God to take Vengeance on the killers of our children children many Palestinians now say they rely only on God they have no faith in the rest of the world y Al jazer kanun in the southern Gaza Strip we're joining me now from Khan Unice in southern Gaza as manau showman a Palestinian who lives there menel thanks once again for joining us here on El jazer as we saw and heard in that story and uh before earlier from our correspondent in hanun we we know that there have been more bombardments overnight can you just give us an idea of what it's been like there in the last 24 hours yes uh I was walking in downtown hun yesterday and in front of me in benis h inun an air strike belt hit several houses adjacent to each other just 200 met in front of me I I later learned about the casualties that have come here into the hospital uh a couple of hours ago um residents close to the the main Cemetery where we bury our dead here inun told us that the the the cemetery itself was hit and the people who are dead uh even the people who are dead are are not are not are not at peace anymore uh I mean graveyards are are are now tumbled above the ground um since I've been here for the last five weeks we have not seen any Aid trucks that have supposed to have come in from ra uh the only time we've seen something is a few U uh pallets of of water bottles which people uh quickly uh took into the took uh within two minutes it was finished it was it was done uh yesterday um I had met a few doctors who had come from a sha and from the north who told us about the extremely devastating situation there they talked about that the Israeli Army whoever was walking down during the socalled humanitarian ceasefire and the so-called humanitarian Road were either taken into custody and used as human Shields during their land Invasion attemps or all of their belongings were stolen or they were humiliated or shot on many have arrived injured here I understand that you are a father and I just want to get a sense of what it is like for children who are living through all of this I mean I know it must be incredibly difficult as an adult but how do you describe what's going on to your children as a father as a husband um uh I mean my children there is no difference between how I feel towards what's happening with them as the 2.3 million other Palestinians here and all other pre members of this world who are going through hardships like why the the bad lines right now the bakeries 95% have closed whatever Bakery lines are left people stand for seven to eight hours waiting for the bread there is no clean water there is no fuel to run electrical generators there is no medical supply there is no replenishment of goods people here are living in uncertainty in fear and they are angry and they are feeling despair however they are channeling all their emotions into actions what sort of actions are you talking about so mothers try to take care of their children they try to think of okay what am I going to cook today if there are if there is any gas is there any water for me to shower my children um the men if they can work any kind of work they go out during their day they try to make a few shakles here and there to try to bring some supplies back to their families uh people like myself who has the ability to communicate to to channels like Al jazer to try to give the outside world what is actually happening to the human beings to the civilians here try to have people act politicians act to open the borders to have a ceasefire to to allow the people in Raza here to live a little bit of a normal life after 37 days of genocide and war crimes by the Zionist forces man so I know that you along with hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians have moved from the north to the South doing exactly what uh Israelis uh the Israeli military uh told you to do but you're still being bombed where you are now aren't you can you just explain what that is like to be displaced internally to somewhere that you've been told will be safe to go to but clearly it isn't um it is uh it is dis it is very very disappointing but we are not surprised anymore the Israeli Army have lied so many times over the past few weeks that no one here believes them uh as per the numbers reported by the by the Ministry of Health 48% of those killed or injured were in the middle or South Region which is called the safe areas designated by the Israeli forces continuously we hear the spy drones above us and every few hours where I am here in N hospital we hear ambulances come in carrying dead and injured people here do not feel safe people here do feel uncertainty all the time one of the positives that are happening here in Nas hospital is the behind me is the maternity W here and every couple of hours every hour we hear the good news of a new life a new baby coming into this world hopefully this generation the upcoming generation will live a better life than the generation that we are living right now Manel we we really do appreciate you describing what it is like there uh for for the everyday person uh M shman uh who is in carun at the moment thank you
