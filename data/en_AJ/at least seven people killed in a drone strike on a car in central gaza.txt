we begin in Gaza where despite growing pressure at home and abroad Israel's forces are carrying out continued attacks across the strip at least seven people have been killed in a drone strike on a car in central Gaza a child is among those who have died their bodies and others injured have been taken to the AL AXA hospital that facility has become increasingly overburdened and there is a dwindling amount of supplies since Israel is blocking relief from being brought in from key Crossings in the southern Gaza Strip there's no letup in Israeli strikes and shelling on Rafa tanks and troops are entering more parts of the southern city defying international calls to stop the offensive including from Israel's closest allies there are no longer any functioning hospitals in Rafa Palestinians in Northern Gaza have been told that the area they live in now is a disaster Zone including the jabalia refugee camp rescue workers in the camp have recovered more than 50 bodies after finally being able to reach the area that brings the number of bodies reportedly recovered since the end of Israel's 3-we operation there to 120 the Israeli military has destroyed 50,000 homes in the north let's bring in Al jazer hanim Mahmud for the latest on the situation in Gaza on the ground there he's joining us on De Bala in the center of the strip so new attacks honey on Central Gaza tell us about what's happened in the last hour or so yes what we're what we are in fact seeing is more of a surge in the attacks not only across the central area as just within the past few minutes the loud explosions could be heard uh very close to the eastern part of D B City and parts of a n refugee camps and we're still waiting for the reports of the nature of what happened but those explosions were quite loud they resulting from air attacks have being carried out by the attack jits and by the almost nonstop constant artillery Shilling of the Eastern area that is not only happening today but has been going on for the past months and since the initial weeks of this genocidal War as everybody started to realize this is part of Israeli strategies of building a buffer zone that is already shrinking the size of the Gaza street but just the past hour this site right here went to quite a quickly from pretty relatively quiet and calm into a side of chaos going on as a a drone struck a group of people uh and a car on one of the major roads in the Central Area the western part of zaa neighborhood all the people who brought to the hospital were in fact dead already pronounced dead on the way to the hospital just within the past few minutes the last body was taken to a burial site where remaining family members gathered here at the courtyard of the hospital six people pronounced were killed and were pronounced dead right at the spot including one child and still ambulance were dispatch and bringing more of these recent attacks yeah some very difficult images there from uh Central Gaza honey in the North in the jabalia refugee camp well Palestinian authorities have declared that area a disaster area what does that mean for the people who still live there well you know the past 20 days have been quite difficult we're not talking about that the 20 days were the Israeli military was operating aggressively they were the culmination of eight months of War and the Israeli military decided to go back to jabali refugee camp after it has relentlessly attacked it by land air and sea going one more time uh to jab destroying the remaining facilities including evacuation centers Health public health facilities and schools and infrastructure leaving the entire area with completely eroded uh social services and completely eliminating all means of life in the area people who are are able to get back to these area describing uh very dire situations right now with nothing left for them to sustain their life for the coming uh years we're talking about an area that turned from quite densely populated with all the necessary needs available into a wasteland right now including water wells public facilities infrastructure Health Facilities that are completely now out of service whatever is remain of these Health Facilities is nothing more than a standing skeleton nothing more a morg to receive bodies that are collected from the streets or removed from uh under the rubbles maybe the hardest part of what we seen it from the northern part is the many bodies that are removed from under the rubel completely deceased skeletons the calls of the children women and elderly collected it from sites and areas which was very difficult for the paramedics and the Civil defensive crew members on the ground to reach to but they are able right now there is a total of at least 70 of these bodies already collected but the the inability and the lack of equipment make it the job of civil defensive crew on the ground quite difficult there's still need more more efforts needed more time needed to remove these rubbles and remove more bodies we reports of entire families that have gone missing as well but the worst of it is the complete elimination of of Social Services on the ground
