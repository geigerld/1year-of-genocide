so then US President Joe Biden is threatening to stop the supply of weapons to Israel if it launches a large-scale attack on Rafa Washington has been pressuring Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for weeks not to send forces into the city in the south of Gaza where more than 1 and a half million displaced Palestinians have been Sheltering in his strongest comments to date Biden confirmed the US has already paused a shipment of weapons to Israel consisting of thousands of large bombs and admitted that Americans supplied weapons that are killing Palestinians civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers and it made it clear that if they go into Rafa they haven't gone into Rafa yet if they go into Rafa I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with rafin but some Israeli forces are on the ground in Rafer and they've been targeting residential areas and on Wednesday Israeli tanks forc the raff of border crossing to Egypt to close it's the main entry point for a trucks to get into Gaza John henin begins our coverage from Chicago the president has said he is not going to ship Munitions offensive Munitions into Israel he says he will continue to supply the uh defensive weapons such as the Iron Dome interceptors but because he's been specifically urging Israel not to go into Rafa at a time when a million people are Sheltering there and the US has expressed a concern about their safety said he does not want to send those offensive weapons the big bombs in there and Lloyd Austin the Secretary of Defense told members of Congress that that amounts to one shipment of Munitions now they haven't decided if that shipment will go forward in a in the future but because uh an invasion of R Rafa in a larger sense seems to be about to go forward uh the Biden Administration is saying it is going to draw the line and that's really the first time that we know of publicly that Biden has said no to Israel during this conflict he's long said that Israel has been too aggressive in this battle that too many civilians have died this is the first time we know of that he simply said no you may not have these well Doug Bando is a senior fellow at the Kato Institute and editor of the political magazine uh inquiry he's also a former Special Assistant to President Ronald Reagan joins us now from Washington DC Doug Welcome to our deser good to have you here with us uh so what to what extent do you think Biden's hand has been forced here is he speaking simply to appease potential voters I think he is dealing with very serious political problems he has a lot of progressive young progressives and as well as Arab Americans who've been very angry about his stand in Gaza and his support for Israel he's worried about losing those votes in November and the campus protests have intensified that he hoped that this crisis would go away but these protests have actually Amplified it made it more threatening to him so I believe this is an effort to show that he's heard them and that he is willing to uh you know put pressure on Israel for the first time in a way that we have never seen before you mentioned his support for Israel and given that steadfast support uh to date do you think that this would this decision would have come hard for him personally I think this is very difficult for him he has long said he's the most pro-israeli president ever earlier in the uh you Gaza operation he said that he would do nothing to interfere with Israel's right to defend itself so this is a major step forward to withhold some of those Munitions and bombs you know the Israelis have to pay attention to that and what about the protesters now do you think this will go any way to appease them my guess is that one one time is not enough they will look at this and tell themselves we need to protest more that we finally got the president's attention he finally responded but they want to ceasefire they want to end this conflict so I think they're going to go on with their protests and what about the other side of this what about for Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel and the Rafer offensive how do you think it's going to uh implicate that it's going to be a very real challenge if they lose access to these Munitions it's going to be harder for them to prosecute the war Yahoo's political future really depends on keeping the war going if there was an election tomorrow he'd almost certainly lose he's also going to be under extraordinary pressure from other Coalition Partners they want the war to continue they threatened to abandon him if he doesn't and uh you know it's going to be hard almost any Israeli is going to feel some frustration at being told by the US how it should run its campaign so I suspect they may go ahead and uh try a game of geopolitical chicken with the US how long a pause in the supply of weapons would there have to be uh to make a difference to Israel's ability to attack I mean you know how much what's their Arsenal like how much stock do they have well they certainly have a lot but this kind of campaign they've expended an awful lot what's important is if you launch a campaign is you want to know that your supplies are secure because at the moment you know it's conceivable the US would restart but then if the re us cuts off in the future the Israelis could be in a vulnerable position they might have started hostilities again engaged in a lot of activity and suddenly find themselves without necessary uh you know Munitions so it's hard to run a campaign if you're not certain that the resupply is coming in terms of uh talking of campaigns in terms of Joe Biden's political campaign uh also very difficult given the uncertainty of what could happen in Rafa and within the whole gazer issue exactly he's going to be criticized by Israel supporters in the US it's almost certain that Republicans on Capitol Hill as well as uh Donald Trump who uh you know is leading in a lot of polls are going to use this against the president they're going to play the pro-israel card so this is going to be a very difficult campaign for President Biden you know this is an issue he really did hope would disappear and what he's found is it won't and he's in D of antagonizing both sides now Doug Bando senior fellow at the Koo Institute thanks a lot thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
