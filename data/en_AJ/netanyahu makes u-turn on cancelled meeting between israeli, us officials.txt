Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin netanyahu's office has told the White House it wants to reschedule a cancelled meeting an Israeli delegation was due to visit Washington to discuss Israel's planned ground offensive in Rafa in southern Gaza Netanyahu cancelled the trip after the US refused to veto a un Security Council resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and what I can say on on Israel more broadly as you asked me about uh meetings that we that that were held here uh there were constructive discussions with Israel's defense minister over the last two days uh Rafa was one of the many topics discussed with Jake Sullivan Tony blinkin uh Lloyd Austin and Bill Burns uh the prime minister's office uh has agreed has agreed uh to reschedule the meeting dedicated to Rafa so we're we're uh now working uh with them to set to find a convenient date uh that's obviously going to work for both sides but he his office has agreed uh to uh to reschedule that meeting that would be dedicated to Rafa which is a good thing let's speak to Luciano zakara about this he's an associate professor at qat University's go study center good to have you with us on Al jazer so Israel now wants to meet the Americans over its plan to invade Rafa Netanyahu has said that with or without American support this plan was going to go ahead so why request this meeting over Rafa if they've already decided that they're going to go ahead with this planned Invasion well it seems that they want to make clear to everybody to the whole world even to the United States that they will move forward and they will not stop regardless of uh the United n resolution uh United uh Nation resoltion neither regardless also the the Biden's Administration pressure that they have been acerting since the very beginning of the conflict and regardless the very clear statement that Biden and linol have done regarding not entering into gasa in the way they that they expect so it's not that they're looking for a blessing from the Americans to go ahead with this not no I mean it seems that the Netanyahu is not interested in the in the the American blessing it is interested also in showing to his own uh population that he's tough that he's not negotiating and that he will pursue his objectives militarily in terms of defeating uh Hamas and in terms of uh recovering the hostage that seems that has been forgotten already by by by Netanyahu and the only way to do that is to claiming that they will go further without any restriction and without even being restricted by the United States right where where does that leave the US uh Israel relationship I mean there's a bit of tension obviously since the US abstained from voting uh in that on that un Security Council resolution is it just a glitch in the relationship or is it more serious this time around Biden made clear that there's no change in policy so regardless of what he says or what the United States voting in the in the UN says that they will not stop sending arms or financing uh Israel on the other hand the Republicans are very clearly St that saying that they will never uh sign any suspension of um of Aid to Israel in the in the senate or in the Congress and and that they support Israel whatever they do so considering that Biden most likely will lose next elections there is no possible uh change in the American foreign policy as far as Biden is not taking a serious measure that is changing his policy in order to not to lose votes so right now on the ground what you have is a status quo it's a ceasefire on paper only because Israeli air strikes continue on Gaza as we've seen what more do you think the International Community not just the Americans should be doing to to get Israel to respect the this un Security Council resolution not this one only but but previous resolutions which Israelis have flaunted especially countries in this region uh the Arab countries many of them have have largely stayed quiet about what's happening in Gaza haven't taken any actions against Israel unlike some Latin American countries for example which have cut off diplomatic ties have uh you know call recall their ambassadors from Israel and so on we've seen little action from some Arab countries why is that well nobody wants to harm the the already the the the achievement that they had in terms of the relation with Israel and the relations with the United States nobody wants to harm the long-term strategies and relations they they they have witnessing know they have enjoying ER making such a move that withdrawing Ambassador would harm really long-term expectations and as you said I mean the tougher policies that they have been uh um visible along this uh five months uh conflict are coming from Africa or Latin America not from the region which gives you an idea that nobody's really interested in actually helping the the Gaza population and the Palestinian population but they are more interested in their own interest and surviving as a political regimes and uh guaranteeing that they have their own situation regionalist situation solved without engaging in a more a longer conflict even the public opinion in most of the Arab countries are supportive of more tougher of course policies cutting diplomatic relation or even calling the recalling the Ambassador is something that they should have done long time ago H it's possible I mean the pressure have been growing in the in Europe in Europe but neither Europe has been doing anything I mean the discourses of camon and other people have been showing that they don't want the operation in gasa to to to take place they want and they are demanded that is far vocally but again the ambassadors are still there nobody sto any kind of agreement nobody stop Aid etc etc so there are still tools that that can be used by the international committee when we say International committee we we are mainly talking about the Western countries but also the global South can and they are actually doing more than the North in terms of uh diplomatic um pressure pressure yeah thank you very much Luciano zakara from Kat University for joining us on aler thank you for your time
