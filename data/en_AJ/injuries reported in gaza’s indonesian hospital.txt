well let's take you now to some of the latest pictures that we're getting from the Gaza Strip This is the northern part of the Gaza Strip in an area which is believed to be near the Indonesian hospital or or in the hospital there's been shelling very very nearby now we heard from the Gaza Health Ministry um just a few hours back that the Indonesian hospital was running so low on fuel that it was going to go entirely it was going to have to close all operations within 24 hours we we know the lights have gone out there before um and they managed to to get them turned back on several weeks back but they've been running with with very few suppliers for for days and days now you're watching injured people being moved around after this shelling that's taken place very close to that area we know this is this is all in Northern Gaza this is all in a part of the Gaza Strip which the Israeli military has asked people to leave from but obviously Hospital staff have said that they need to stay on to to do what they can to to help their communities and treat the wounded a lot of these hospitals in these areas have also become shelters for so many people who've been displaced families who've lost their homes these have become some of the only places that people have felt were vaguely safe at all so tens of thousands of people have been Sheltering in these areas they're run very low on everything and just to remind you what I was saying before the Gaza Health Ministry says this hospital will have to shut down entirely within 24 hours if it receives no more fuel and now just hours later we are getting reports of shelling very close to that medical facility that off the back of multiple hospitals being forced to shut down and multiple hospitals being damaged in air strikes well if you're just joining us now on the NewsHour on Al jazer let me remind you what you're watching this is the aftermath very latest pictures so pictures just in the last few minutes coming in of the aftermath of shelling so we're watching injured people now being moved around shelling has been taking place near the Indonesian Hospital in Northern Gaza and um we also know that this hospital is also running very low on everything including fuel we do expect that that will have to shut down within the next 24 hours that's according to the Gaza Health Ministry now just to recap what we've seen over the last 24 hours or so more than half of the hospitals in Gaza have already been forced to shut down we've heard that the alasa Children's Hospital in a different part of the Gaza Strip has also now been forced to shut down because it's it's sustained so much damage so let's now bring in Abdul Hamed CM who I was just discussing all of this with the dire humanitarian situation that the Gaza Strip finds itself in now Abdul Hamed I imagine this is coming as no surprise to you based on what we were just discussing a few minutes AG no I think Israel will es escalate in the next few days so much because they might come up to the point that they have to stop the war or at least a kind of truce for few days be imposed on them the there is a am mounting pressure on Israel and the United States to do that so they want to do as much as damage to the Palestinians the the society at large both both in Gaza and the West Bank before that moment comes I think there will be we will see more massacres this kind what happened today to the Children Hospital mhm do you think that particularly now what we're seeing up in in the north is this part of a um a kind of strategy to try to clear out the north obviously we've seen people tens of thousands of people moving south there's this idea now that there will be these pauses specifically to evacuate the north that that's what Israel and the US are saying to to get people out is that the whole idea bomb the north get people to leave and and then and then have no one left but they've been bombing the North and the South there is no safe place as we said in Gaza the people who are moving from uh from south to North or from north to south they've been bombed while they are walking the road the even the uh the ambulances which were taking injured people on the coastal Road also moving from north to south South they're being bombed and they were killed so there is no safe place people don't agree don't believe that moving from one place to the other that makes them safer that is across the board in Gaza there is no safe place in Gaza now they're trying to impose to impose or inflict so much damage on the Palestinian as a whole they want them to raise the White Flag as I said and I don't think they will do the Palestinian will never uh do that AB Hamid let me ask you because you yourself used to work for the United Nations where is the UN and all of this I mean ju just a few days ago I was speaking to the director the Gaza director of unra the UN Agency for Palestine refugees who was saying that they could no longer offer protection under the UN flag so what is the un's role now I mean presumably if if there are supposed to be humanitarian corridors broad evacuations and now these pauses with tens of thousands of people on the road is the UN supposed to play a part the humanitarian agencies are trying I mean they've been raising their voices I mean they attended every conference I mean the high the general Commissioner of Ona or the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees went in himself to Gaza and he visited some of those uh shelters they're trying but that is not the issue the issue is the with political organ of the United Nations that the one which take decision it's the security Council it has been paralyzed because of the United States they don't want to ra the idea of a Seas fire which is other countries are calling for and so far they veted two draft resolution and there is another one is floating it's going nowhere because of the US insisting on no ceasefire that is the issue and also they want in any draft resolution to impose another uh agenda item which right of Israel to defend itself now people don't believe that is the right to defend itself to kill 10,000 civilians or to kill children or to Target hospitals or to Target uh schools that is not called self-defense it is frankly it is war crimes it is collective punishment it is violation of international humanitarian uh law I want to ask you about some of the the terms that are being thrown around here ceasefire humanitarian pores tactical pores everyone has has a different take on it but they all really do mean different things what we're hearing about right now is is a pause so a daily 4our Pause by my understanding this is just in Northern Gaza in order to allow or or encourage people to leave but as you were just saying there are obviously bombardments continuing in the South that's what's also holding up Aid deliveries so just to be clear this is not the humanitarian pause or anything like a ceasefire that various different nations and various different agencies have been pushing for every agency now every humanitarian agen the human rights groups uh the Paris conference is calling for ceasefire quality humanitarian or not but that is ceasefire that means guns has to be silenced poses is not like that you could have a pose in one area and you continue the fighting in another so you could have a pose in the northern part of Gaza yet you are fighting in the South or the other way around so poses is different than ceasefire what is the UN calling what is the secretary General's calling what even president mcro today in his speech called for ceasefire ceasefire means there is no fire shot during this period so that is what Gaza is needed so they allow humanitarian it to come in big large volume and allow foreigners to leave and maybe some also hostages as we can see now there's the negotiations going so far to a final stage to allow some hostages to be released we're watching these pictures and I I want to draw our viewers attention to to the huge huge explosions we've been seeing there they've just been in the the top right of the screen now these are the latest pictures from the vicinity around the Indonesian hospital where we've learned that that massive shelling has been taking place and and Abid you and I were just talking earlier about intentionality and strategy here by the Israelis very interesting to see what their their their intentionality is now in doing this very very close to one of the OWN remaining health facilities in that area that are still functioning and may only continue to do so for the next few hours ABD thank you for joining me again well let's now speak to our correspondent on the ground TK Abu aom he's joining us again from KH yunes that's in the south of the Gaza Strip uh Tark can you bring us up to date about what you're hearing obviously we've we've seen very very heavy shelling in the north we know there's been this attack on Al NASA Children's Hospital are we seeing an intensified bombardment just in the last half hour or so yes during the last 10 uh minutes uh the Israeli massive bombardment has spiked in particular in the north of the Gaza Strip uh the attacks were very closed and around the vicinity of the Indonesian Hospital people who were residing in the yards of the hospital start to rush into uh the inside of the hospital to be protected from the Israeli Relentless bombardment uh this amount of air strikes is are unprecedent Ed during to the previous kind of targeting to the vicinity of the Indonesian Hospital also the attacks continued around the vicinity of the Sha hospital it seems that the main concentration during the last uh half hour uh were generally on the vicinity of Gaza main Central hospitals as they had previously today attacked the anas the anaser hospital which considered to be the main Central Hospital that provide medical care for young babies and youly poor kids T we've been hearing of obviously about about all of these bombs but we also know that as a result not only of the bombardment but also of the seege that so many Health Facilities have had to shut down what is the state of affairs in Northern Gaza at the moment who's still functioning is there anywhere that anyone can go for for medical attention now with the ongoing uh Relentless bombardment by the Israeli occupation Air Forces which uh is are combined by uh the ongoing uh fuel crisis with the shortage of food and even with the destruction of bakeries and main water sources the situation there is unparal people there are really are no longer be able to C with the situation on the ground in the north of the Gaza Strip uh literally the bombardment is in every single corner of the north of Gaza Strip people were evacuating to the southern areas on their foot and order to run away from that Hill that is taking place in the north of the Gaza Strip we are talking about hundreds of a strikes every night taking the lives of hundreds of Palestinians as well uh the hospitals there are witnessing massive deteriorations in terms of the medical uh conditions uh they are uh very running running low in terms of medical supplies as there is no any humanitarian Aid had been delivered to the north of the Gaza Strip and also these hospitals are overwhelmed and uh flooded with patients and even displaced people who are try to shelter inside these hospitals to be away from the Relentless bombardment now with the these ongoing air strikes in the vicinity of the Indonesian Hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip the Israeli occupation forces are trying to force citizens to leave the hospital and to evacuate to the southern areas of the Gaza Strip thus they have a clear flexibility in terms of carrying out and to expand more military operations on the ground TK Abu aom there with the latest for us a live report from Kan yunes in the southern Gaza Strip thank you TK
