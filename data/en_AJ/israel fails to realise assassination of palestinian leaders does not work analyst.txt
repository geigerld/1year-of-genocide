the armi Huli is a distinguished public policy fellow at American University of Beirut and he's joining us live from Boston Mr Huli always a pleasure to have you with us on alzer I want to start with the US Secretary of State Anthony blinken's comments that the ceasefire is now up to sinir this is something the US has maintained since the War Began they say that the ceasefire is up to Hamas but the US allowed its Ally Israel to assassinate the last leader of Hamas who was leading the ceasefire efforts on hamas's part well according to what we've been hearing for the last couple weeks it's basically the Israelis who are the obstacle to a ceasefire that the pamas has accepted all the conditions and the alterations that were made and the it's the Israelis that were holding out and kept changing the terms so it's it's not totally clear the Americans I think just out of tradition blame everything on the Arab side the Palestinian side the uh people with Iran uh but the reality I think is is much more clear that the uh obstacle to a ceasefire and exchange of prisoners and hostages probably is Benjamin Neto and we've heard the Israeli reaction to sina's appointment and they say this makes them even more of a Target do you think that they will increase their efforts to assassinate sinoa well they've they've always assassin ated senior leaders of Palestinian resistance movements whether it's the PLO or you know fet or some of the other movements pflp or the Hamas or Hezbollah the Lebanese uh so they yes they probably will try to assassinate more people but it doesn't do any good that it's bizarre that the Israelis don't see that when they assassinate somebody they get somebody more radical and this is just the what happened when Han was assassinated sinir took over sinars generally seem to be a little bit more Hardline whereas um um is U is generally seen to be a little bit more uh not flexible but pragmatic but the position of Hamas is not made by one person it's made by a collective leadership that chooses these people and they've clearly repeatedly uh ex made overtures towards Israel towards some kind of long-term truce before the October 7 attack and even since October 7 they've clearly agreed to go into uh ceasefire negotiations so really the the situation U is is one in which we need to have significant pressure on everybody uh whoever is the blame to accept these terms get the ceasefire done do the exchanges and move on to the next phase which is going to be even more complicated to govern Palestine and to possibly lead once the Israelis leave Gaza to lead to a a negotiation for a permanent resolution of the Palestine Israel conflict which is way more complex but we have to aim for that at some course yeah Mr codyy the ceasefire process has been faltering at best what impact do you think sinar's leadership will have on that process given he's seen as The Mastermind of the October 7th attack again we heard from our correspondent patty khaine just before you that it's very interesting that Anthony blinkin um didn't denigrate Sina in any way but what are you expecting from the Israelis that may or may not be significant U Lincoln is not a major player as far as we know but he's representing the American view in this right yeah he's the Secretary of State but uh but he's come to the Middle East times to tell everybody to cool it down and all that's happened after each visit is that the uh confrontations across the Middle East spread even further field and more people join the fight like the anad Yemen like the popular mobilization forces in Iraq and now you've got Iran directly fighting with uh with Israel so I wouldn't pay much attention to um to the Secretary of State statement but it's possible that they're being a little bit more careful now I think the real driver here is that um the American President Biden is desperate absolutely desperate to get the ceasefire done before he leaves office partly for his own legacy so that he's not forever known as genocide Joe and partly to help the uh C Kamala Harris who he expects to succeed him um to give her a chance to move on to the next stage of peacemaking uh in the Middle East so I think it's what Biden is trying to do that's the most significant Mr hurri thank you as always for your analysis Rami hurri in Boston make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
