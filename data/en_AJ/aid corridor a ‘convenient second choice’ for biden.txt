well Sultan Barakat joins us here in the studio he's a professor of public policy at H hammad bin Khalifa University thank you and good to see you we're talking about the maritime Corridor that's being opened up from Cypress to Gaza this peer that the US Navy is going to be building off Gaza to try and get much needed Aid in look the first question that strikes me is it's interesting that we're suddenly now focused on what's happening on a Mediterranean island in a port called lanica when we should be looking at what's happening at trucks full of Aid blocked at the Egyptian border is this in some sense a convenient distraction as has been alleged by the UN and others well I think it is I think it's one of the main purposes of making this announcement at this particular time the other one of course it serves uh domestically for President Biden uh given the pressure on him to say something something constructive related to Palestine particularly during the uh State of Union Address he had hoped to be able to present a ceasefire that wasn't happening so this is a convenient sort of second choice for something to that he can offer to the Americans and you can see from his Partners in this project I mean it's the EU and Ora uh what's her name ARA vond fion V Deion yes and and the United Arab Emirate uh and those are all sides that were very pro Israel and suddenly now they're trying to come up with an alternative well I can certainly see the convenience for all of them to line up behind this plan because frankly they've been unable to exercise any other plan I'm not sure I agree that this is useful for President Biden I know he made the announcement in the State of the Union Address but in a sense this is fuel to his critics who are then able to turn around and say look the only reason you're doing this is because because you weren't able or willing to exercise your influence to get the Israelis to allow Aid in through border crossings it is their legal obligation to provide humanitarian Aid in which they have been failing to do and the US has done nothing about it sure I think the ideal situation would be to Stop The Killing and uh within the UN circles they use something called feeding the dead it's a term that was developed during the Bosnia war in the early 1990s where you know 100% where the solution is the solution is in stopping the killing and in the case of the United States the supply of weapons uh the intelligence the political cover that he's been providing for Netanyahu all of this has led to where we are today so he knows that is the answer but in his I think internal domestic politics it's not all about actually achieving the right uh solution it's about The Vibes it's about the message that he's sending out there he's trying to present himself as sympathetic with with the Palestinian and try and win some of the American Arab American vots but when it comes to the practicality there has never been a problem in crossing the Mediterranean with aid aid has been coming to Alish Alish is a very is is a Egyptian Port very close to Gaza the problem is in crossing the boundaries of Gaza that's number one and number two is in distributing the aid with Israel having destroyed the infrastructure even if you were to uh to bring the aid to a point on the coast within Gaza you only going to create another bottleneck there is no way to redistribute this Aid as it should be across the the the the strip and of course this is what I think most Aid agency will be agencies will be thinking about it's not about getting it just in it's how do you get it to the individuals that need it most yeah and nobody's coming up with a plan for distribution that's I think it's a cynical attemp well well it it has that sort of slightly performative look about it doesn't it and the the other big issue of course that critics raise is the is the risk that this serves to in a sense legitimize the blockade because if you can open a successful pathway or Highway for food Aid across the sea why do you need a highway for food Aid across land look had this been done under a United Nations resolution I think would have been a positive step towards internationalizing the conflict in Gaza and maybe a one first step towards uh offering International protection to the Palestinians which says we the International Community are concerned therefore we have put a coalition to break this uh blockade against the Palestinians and we will whatever happens we will allow food in but unfortunately that's not what is going on what is going on and according to what Biden has just said in the morning he's going to look for Israel to a construct and B secure this floating Port whatever he's he's thinking about now that risks uh engaging the Israelis uh in a double uh occupation I mean already they are 1967 occupation of Gaza is there now literally they are occupying Gaza and it is their responsibility to provide for the people of Gaza so by allowing them again to undertake that responsibility he is enforcing their occupation of uh of the land at this moment legitimizing it or legitimizing it yes barad thanks for your thoughts thank you
