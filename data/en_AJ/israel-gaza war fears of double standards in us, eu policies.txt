well it's been nearly one week since the escalation in Gaza and Israel began as Israel's military action against Gaza continues to intensify as we have seen this evening some observers have raised concerns over the views world leaders have expressed on civilian safety AMA bin javeed reports world leaders have given different views on upholding international law to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure depending on the circumstances this is the German Chancellor Russian soldiers committed a massacre of Ukrainian civilians including children women and old people the murder of civilians is a war crime to be clear the perpetrators and those who gave the command must be held accountable our own history our responsibility That Grew From The Holocaust makes it our Eternal duty to stand up for Israel's existence and security this responsibility guides us our attachment to Israel today is also very direct on Tuesday European leaders stood for Israel while these images of Israeli strikes in Gaza were being broadcast live but last year the European commission president laid out the law about targeting civilian infrastructure The Intern National order is very clear these are war crimes targeted attacks on civilian infrastructure with a clear aim to cut off men women children of water electricity and heating with the winter coming these are acts of pure Terror and we have to call it as such that's not something Israel's prepared to hear its energy Minister said no electrical switch will be turned on no water hydrant will be open and no fuel truck will enter Gaza until the Israeli abductees are returned no one will preach morals to us us us us and while the US president has urged Israel to respect the rules of War his secretary of state said this I'm here quite simply uh with one message and that is the United States stands with Israel today tomorrow every day a message his Republican Rivals agree on we're in a religious War here I am with Israel do whatever the hell you have to do to defend yourself level the place and I'll say this to to prime minister Netanyahu finish them finish them Palestinians say the world has double standards when it comes to upholding international law which protects Al okay well Sultan badut joins us once again and I just first of all uh wanted to get your reaction to uh some of the world leaders there speaking out about what is happening in Gaza what what stood out for you there the genocidal language to be honest I mean get them finish them all that stuff um it's strange but it is understandable when you place it within the context of their own history their relationship with the Jewish people what they've been through the Holocaust Etc you can understand that uh they're under pressure uh it's a very soft spot as far as they're concerned they have to become more Israelis than the Israelis when the issue of Holocaust is is provoked uh but that is not the Palestinians problem I mean the Palestinian the state was created after the Holocaust Israel was imposed on the Palestinians and it is very important for those leaders to remember that the Palestinians in Gaza in particular almost 75% of them are refugees from towns and Villages that the Israelis have first occupied in 48 and then in ' 67 so they are already under International protection and have been for 75 years in that place fed and sheltered by the United Nations paid for by those same states to try and keep the Palestinians under the lid now uh they have layers and layers of international protection first as a refugee as a civilian children women Etc they the laws are endless and Israel has um piles of files in international courts that have really been dismissed over over the years and I fear that this kind of language will come back to ha those people uh the longer this conflict goes on the more images emerge as of from the victims and also if the Palestinians are pushed out of the Gaza Strip they will end up on on European uh Shores and then I think they will have they'll have to take a very different view on this yeah okay thank you so much uh Sultan we really do appreciate your time and your insight into this I just want to go back to the live pictures from Gaza now where we are seeing absolutely a huge uh bombardment of the Gaza Strip this evening uh as we have mentioned ,400 Palestinians have already been killed in Israeli air strikes almost 350,000 have been displaced and we Imagine by the end of this evening there in Gaza that those numbers are going to rise uh continue to rise as people try and take uh Shelter From the constant bombardment uh from the Israeli Air Force
