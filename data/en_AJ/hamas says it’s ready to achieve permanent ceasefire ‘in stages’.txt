Muhammad nazal joins us now sir you're a member of hamas's political Bureau what can you tell us about the offer that Hamas has received H actually today Hamas have received a proposal paper issued by Paris conference uh we told the mediators that Hamas will study the proposal in our political Bureau Which con consists uh from leadership inside and outside uh Palestinian territories and we will discuss this paper after our discussions with Egyptians and Karis in Cairo because we will travel as soon as possible after we end our discussions inside political of okay are you at this stage able to outline for us uh the the broad framework of this proposal actually it talks about uh ceasefire but we told mediators that permanent ceasefire is our goal we can't accept er a ceasefire pose for humanitarian reasons we want a permanent ceasefire H secondly we want withdraw Israeli withdrawal if from Gaza Strip without Israeli withdrawal we can't also accept this a new deal or a new proposal thirdly we want to allow the humanitarian aids to enter Gaza Strip because our people they are suffering from starving they are suffering from the shortage of petrols of water of electricity so these mean things what we want from uh the mediators to do it otherwise we can't accept this proposal now the Qatari prime minister who who's been in Washington uh has talked about the possibility of of a phased truce and that this is what would be put to Qatar so presumably this might be what you've received a phase truce meaning that this would go in stages and it would start with Hamas releasing women and children uh in exchange for increased humanitarian Aid is that something that Hamas might be willing to consider you know we don't uh reject any kind of uh stages uh but we want H from both sides to release all captives ER in Israeli prisoners and the captives who are with the resistance movement in Gaza Strip so we are looking uh to release all captives from both sides but of course it needs a negotiation uh to reach uh to this point so so this is a further demand then because you told me three points three demands this is a further one but my question is is more around would Hamas be willing to accept something in phases if everything that Hamas is asking for is not proposed and is is not available and is not on the table at this stage would Hamas be willing to accept something in stages so that perhaps um those goals can be achieved at a later stage we are we are ready uh to stop the fighting we are ready ER to release uh the prisoners I mean the Israeli prisoners who who who are with resistance movement but we need of course negotiations to implement this point the negotiation to implement this point this is very important point for both sides so this is what we are looking for it and this is what Israelis want from us they want their ER capitals and we are ready to release all of them I just want to make sure that I understand that clearly are you are you are you or are you not saying that Hamas could agree under certain conditions for a pause in the fighting rather than a permanent end to the fighting given the right uh circumstances and the right offer on the table you know we are looking for a permanent uh ceasefire but we can do it in the second stage in the third stage the very important point for us to reach to this permanent uh ceasefire otherwise it means the battle and the war between us and the Israeli troops will continue we want ceas fa permanent ceas fair and it is useful for both sides for Israelis and for the people of Palestine okay but it but that could be achieved in stages which I think is an important part of this conversation and just and and just Before I Let You Go sir the Qatari prime minister has described the negotiations as having made quote good progress would you agree with that assessment we yes yes we are ready to achieve this by stages okay all right thank you very much Muhammad nazal a member of hamas's political Bureau it's good to have you on the program thank you thank you
