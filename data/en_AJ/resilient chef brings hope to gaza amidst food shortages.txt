my name is Hamada this is the third time I have moved from Gaza City to the South I used to work at the biggest restaurant in Gaza the Thailand more than 170 people used to work there but it was completely destroyed since I love what I do to help my parents and siblings I decided to start a street food business many people encouraged me and advised me to start the small business despite the of resources and the unavailability of cooking gas flour and meat so we came to the nud area on ruer and with meager and simple equipment we created something out of nothing we made something simple that people liked and I started attracting more people my former restaurant was the source of our income our dreams and childhood I worked there for more than 18 years when we heard that it sustained partial destruction we thought we could go back and work with whatever remained in place but after a few days it was completely destroyed all our memories all our dreams today the Basic Essentials of Life are lacking people are not living we are not living we implore the whole world we just want to live but no matter how hard the conditions are we try to make our customers happy and we have many fans make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaaz
