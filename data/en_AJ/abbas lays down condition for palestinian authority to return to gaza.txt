a routine night in the occupied West Bank this time the target is a 20-year-old man suspected of being a fighter in a Palestinian armed group his body was taken away by this bulldozer Nabil habier was the 149th Palestinian killed in the West Bank since October the 7th a few hours later the funeral of another young man a routine day this is the Rhythm of Life here raid funeral repeat they're taking out their anger for October 7 on us the defenseless people here they want us to hate the resistance fighter but you know what that's not going to happen this is not the first time they've caused this destruction if they think they can force us out or weaken us they're mistaken every time they do this it makes us more determin to stay into this increasingly oppressive environment came Anthony blinkin the US Secretary of State told Mahmud Abbas that his administration should play a central role in what comes next in Gaza this to a president with little legitimacy in the eyes of most Palestinians 80% of them want him to resign according to the latest poll PA is unstable it's seen as a collaborationist regime and so president Mahmud Abbas would want to discuss with blinkin how to stabilize the situation for himself here because as many know he is running this part of Palestine in an authoritarian form of rule linkoln thanked abas for helping to maintain calm in the West Bank but what calm there is is fragile settler attacks have more than doubled since October the 7th violence already at a 15-year High has surged the Palestinian president told blinker that his administration would consider taking over Gaza only as part of a deal for the creation of a Palestinian state but for anyone in Gaza at the moment this sort of talk may seem irrelevant while the US refuses to back abbas's call for a ceasefire and Israel won't even consider the slightest pause in its bombing campaign Bernard Smith Al jazer rala
