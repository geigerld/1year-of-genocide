Gaza civil defense teams say they've recovered 17 more bodies from Mass Graves found on the grounds of NASA Hospital in kanun Witnesses say some of the victims were killed during the Israeli Siege on the hospital 310 bodies have been found so far Zena harun is spokeswoman for alhak that's an independent Palestinian rights organization based in the occupied West Bank and she joins us now from romala good to have you with us what first of all can tell us about these Mass Graves who is buried in them and when perhaps were they buried thank you very much for having me um the discovery the discovery of these Mass graves in Nar hospital and before that mass Graves which were discovered in Al Hospital are Stark evidence of war crimes and of course the genocide which has been perpetrated against the Palestinian people in Gaza by Israel a genocide which has now been ongoing for 200 days in inial reports from nared hospital uh shows that some of the bodies of the killed people had their hands tied behind their back and some of the bodies were women and uh Palestinian people who were elderly as well and the key thing uh from what you asked there is what can we tell you the issue that we have at the moment in Gaza is access to the site and not just for organizations like us Al uh other independent human rights organizations or people who should be investigated these Mass atrocities that we're seeing in instead we're mainly seeing families of the deceased or families desperately looking for other members of their families of their loved ones often using their bare hands to dig into these Mass Graves and try and find just a trace of those people so access is the key thing here um some of the testimonies that we did manage to gather from elif hospital not from nas Hospital uh showed that one family member was desperately trying to find just a trace of his uncle he said that he'd found his sandals but even if he could find a body part an arm or a leg that they could at least take that and bury him so they're able to sleep at night that's what he told us which shows how dire the situation is on the ground um most of the information that we're getting at the moment is from incredibly Brave Palestinian journalists who are reporting these horrific atrocities on the ground and they also being targeted by Israel but what we need and we're demanding for is a proper forensic investigation and we need a proper investigative mechanism whether that's the UN Commission of inquiry and of course in addition to the office for the prosec prosecutor of the international criminal court to have full and unrestricted access to the Gaza Strip as a whole and of course sites such as these Mass Graves that we've seen without such an independent investigation uh can the discovery of these Mass Graves be added in any way to the case of genocide against Israel of course as I said before these are star examples that a genocide is being committed and one of the key things that we need to address is that the alarm that genocide is being committed against the Palestinian people in Gaza has well and truly been sounded a long time ago by human rights experts by jde experts and in January the world Court the international court of justice said that gen side is plausibly being committed in Gaza this means that there are very clear and serious obligations on state to ratify the genocide convention to use every single means possible to prevent and protect the population from the crime of genocide unfortunately what we're seeing is the opposite we're seeing many third States including the UK Germany and of course the United States actually continue to supply Israel with arms as it commits these atro crimes what evidence is there that Israel was responsible for the deaths and the burying of these people that are being found in the mass graves right now the main thing that we can rely on is eyewitness testimonies at elifer a lot of people uh said that they saw the people who survived the siege ofer Hospital which lasted two weeks said that people were some were were executed during that Siege right now if we have that independent investigation if we actually have access to the site we can do a full investigation into what happened given that there is no access to Gaza at the moment what is the the the next thing that needs to happen right now right now we demand an immediate end to the ongoing genocide and Israel as the international court of justice uh ordered needs to unconditionally allow Aid Fuel and water and medical supplies into the site and there is enough evidence from what we're seeing on the ground from what's being documented by journalists and from eyewitness testimonies and enough evidence given and presented at the international court of justice for third States who ratified the genocide convention to stop their complicity to end their complicity in Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza and to stop providing Israel with arms and Military Support okay Z hanun from alhak that's an independent Palestinian rights organization many thanks for taking the time to join us here on Al jazer thank you very much make sure
