the US announces sanctions and visa restrictions on Israeli settlers involved in attacks on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank Maran bashara Al jazer senior political analyst with me on set and Maran one of the stories we've had in the bulletin and I want to pick up on it is this decision by the United States the state department to sanction essentially settlers by refusing them visas if they've been involved in violence on the West Bank and we know that there's an awful lot of that sort of going on the big question though is why what is the point because a lot of these people aren't dual Nationals they have US citizenship anyway it doesn't prevent most of them from visiting the United States it's a particularly kind of Toothless measure what's the point well Jonah I think we can all use a bit of comedy in the middle of this tragedy and this has been quite comical I I mean I actually laughed for the first time in a long time when I heard of the American measure to sanction uh those uh holigans uh in the West Bank to say Toothless and to say Hollow I mean it's really understatement I can't remember in in recent memory anything more stupid than this measure anything Siler anything more absurd than this measure and and uh and the Secretary of State anony blinkin you can say a lot of things about him but he's not funny this was funny I mean this was this was hilarious to be honest and you said that a lot of them are duer Nationals in fact the hup youth that these are the holigans that keep you know banging and hitting and destroying things Apparently one out of two of them have an American parent so they actually you know not only do they dual National they actually uh you know bred and and and fed and and ideologically and otherwise from their American Roots right so America is actually in some way responsible for them okay so there's that bit right the the comical bit but then the more serious stuff is the thing that America is not doing I'll give you one simple example hundreds of millions of dollars are streamed from the United States to the radical right and to the settler movement that support these kinds of activities these kinds of holam in the West Bank they come from the United States and they are tax deductible meaning an American can contribute money to these holigans and they will take it out of their taxes which means indirectly it's the American government that is subsidizing these holigans because when you deduct these things from your taxes what you're saying is that the American government is sanctioning the contributions to these holigans and to these illegal settlers now historically speaking America did recognize for a long time that these are illegal that the settlements are illegal in general not just the holigans among the settlers not just the far right not just the Fanatics the settlements are illegal now the United States went from totally illegal to unhelpful and so on so forth but under Biden Obama and under Biden these are illegal settlements so America can do far more if it wants to show a sign of moderation a sign of Humane diplomacy a sign that it does for the Palestinians it will not allow Israeli impunity in occupied territory it certainly can do more well again I I want to ask you what is the point because we talk about and we hear talk of American talk about reigning Israel in uh we hear calls for action there is a void of action into this void of action you put a meaningless bit of action what is the point deception the point is deception it is deflection it's redirection meaning the United States now stands accused of being complicit in war crimes the American public opinion in its majority according to the polls want a ceasefire a permanent ceasefire the majority of young Democrats want the United States to stop helping Israel's genocide in the Palestinian territories most Americans and this is very important please let's just take that in most Americans support two-state solution the real one not the ones that is that the Biden Administration is faking in order to cover up for Israel's genocide how can you be for two-state solution and support financially and otherwise the settlements that are cutting through the Palestinian territories what you end up with is not Swiss Federation you end up with Swiss cheese and that's what they're doing to the occupied Palestinian territories with some 750,000 illegal settlers in over 200 settlements what you are doing you are cutting the prospective Palestinian State into something like 200 band stands that's not the way to go if you're really for a two-state solution that's not the way to go if you are responsive to your own public opinion in the United States so to call for a Visa ban that's just a cheap shot that's just a deception Maan thank you down
