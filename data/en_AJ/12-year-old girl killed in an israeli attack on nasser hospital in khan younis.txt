a 12-year-old girl has been killed in an Israeli attack on NAS Hospital in KH yunes da Abu mahen died when a shell hit the Pediatric Ward where she and several other children were Sheltering she had already lost her family and her leg in a missile attack on their house and last month she told Al jazer about her hopes and dreams I hope to be a doctor to help people now my life is changing they have gone we are alone now without them I was connected to this life because I was very much connected to my mother father and siblings who died but I must continue despite the fact that I will never forget them well for children who are born in Gaza Israel occupation and Wars have been Relentless let's take a look at what an average 16-year-old has endured in their lifetime at Birth an Israeli Land Air and sea blockade has affected every aspect of his or her life from food to health and education at the age of two that child would have lived through 23 days of devastating air and ground attacks nearly 1,400 Palestinians were killed 320 were children in 2012 when the child was 5 years old they would have survived an 8-day assault that killed more than 80 people most of them women and children at age seven the child would have endured a 50-day Israeli onslaught at least 2,310 Palestinians were killed in 2014 551 were children as a young teenager he or she would have witnessed the aftermath of Israeli attacks that lasted 11 days 260 Palestinians were killed 67 were children and now there's another War more Fierce more brutal and more deadly more than 19,43 Palestinians have been killed over 7,000 729 of them are children we have with us Abes who's the director of the accountability program at defense for children International Palestine he's joining us from rala in the occupied West Bank thank you for time with us on Al jazer can we first speak about the 12-year-old girl in Gaza dun Abu mahen who now we understand has been killed at nasad hospital uh because of an Israeli strike after losing her family earlier on I know your teams on the ground were caring for her tell us what you know happened and what your teams are telling you uh basically I think that dun story summarized the ordal that all Palestinian children pass through during this time in Gaz the probability of being targeting twice during just one month or more it's very minimum but this is what happened with dunia at first they moved from the northern part of GZA to hun and um after being displaced from their home they were targeted in the relative Place uh the uh which resulted in the killing of two siblings and her parents in addition to uh lost one of her legs uh we met nura during the uh truce and she informed us that um what she is dreaming about is just to have or to install a prosthetic leg in order to be able to uh live like normal people uh the time that Palestinian children in Gaza are passing through uh impose on them in order to resize their dreams their Ambitions in order to fit with this devastating reality so uh we say always that there is no place safe place in gizza and this is another proof that uh there is no safe place nura was in the uh theoretically safest place which is a hospital that should be uh protected and respected but um uh Mr Abu that D was also asking uh to be evacuated as well that that wasn't possible was it tell us what your teams have told you about that H she told us that what she is dreaming of is just to travel abroad in order to install a prosthetic leg and for this war to end this is says uh or this was her dream dreams when we met us and we did a video where she told us about uh what she dreams for the uh future but unfortunately as a result of the continuing Israeli offenses against Gaza she was unable to bring her dreams to I mean as you're saying nowhere really highlights the threat to Children than this war on AA there are now more than 7,700 children who have been killed many more presumably still stuck under the rebel talk us through the threat to their lives I think it it doesn't affect just the lives of children who were killed it's it affects the future of children who pass through this experiences and the psychological ordeal that uh they are under in a place that under constant air strike tals so the psychological wellbeing of Palestinian children who experience this War I think it will be uh devastating uh during and I based my assumption on previous Wars that many Palestinians suffer from uh psychological problems after passing through these wars and uh this aggression uh is severer than previous ones because during this aggression uh Israel tries to cut off all the lines of life for Gaz STP whether it's food or water so how do organizations like yours sir how do organizations like yours the defense for children International in Palestine how how challenging is it to be able to protect the human rights of Palestinian children as your uh organization says that it does uh I think I think it's a challenge for not just theci Palestine it's a challenge for the world because despite all the players in order to put an end to uh uh this aggression against Palestinian children but Israel insisted on continuing uh its offensive and the problem that we believe that there is no U enough pressure from International Community in order to pressure Israel to stop its aggression against Palestinian people among them children and the contrary many countries are complicit in uh this crimes that Israel uh is committing providing it to diplom political and financial aid all right we'll leave it there we thank you so much for joining us from Raman the occupied West Bank AB thank you
