mediators are working to try to secure a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel this week the US president suggested an agreement was imminent but Hamas downplayed his optimism saying it had yet to receive a proposal the US state department however remains hopeful our goal is to achieve a deal to uh reach a humanitarian pause and the release of hostages as soon as possible certainly we' welcome getting one by this weekend um what I can say about the overall progress is that we made significant progress towards an agreement last week when uh we had uh officials from the United States government engaging in the region we continue to pursue further progress this week American officials across the government continue to be engaged on this question um we are trying to push this deal over the Finish Line we do think it's possible earlier my colleague Rob meths spoke to bessim name the head of political and international relations for Hamas he says Washington's words and actions are contradictory if the Americans are want to be really optimistic they have to end this double standard games they talk on one tongue for stopping the uh aggression or for the for achieving a seed fair and avoiding broadening the the conflict into the region but at the same time they are using the veto in the security Council to to reach a SE where they are approving 14 billion do for for Israel they are securing Israel with more ammunition I think uh more or less I can see that this optimism is not related to the reality on the ground and it is more part of the internal American politics in the year of the election um I know that Hamas has said that it has yet to receive any sort of proposal for a ceasefire there have of course been a lot of leaked details cently about some sort of ceasefire given what you know about the possibility of what might be out there is there anything that Hamas would be prepared to be flexible on Hamas have showed from the beginning great flexibility uh to achieve a seare because we know every added day to this Slaughter means 100 to 150 new civilians Palestinians killed people are in the northern part of Gaza Strip are dying because of starvation we know exactly what does it mean our families are still there in the Gaza City and in the northern part of the Gaz St but at the same time this flexibility cannot be at the cost of our main and strategic goals for example we are looking not for a a humanitarian pose or a humanitarian ceasefire we are looking for a final total comprehensive ceas we are looking for a total withdrawal of the Israeli Army Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip we are looking for allowing all Palestinian freely to move from the south to the north and vice versa we cannot accept keeping our people 1.5 million Palestinians in the southern part of Gaza kept hostages under the Israeli policy or Within part of the Israeli internal political games between the right and the left therefore this is the Baseline where we can build on okay let's bring in El jazer senior political analysts M Bashar now to help unpack a lot of this I mean it seems like Joe Biden is the only one that is confident that any deal is going to be done by next week do you think that Biden has jumped the gun here well let's call it a tactic it's even more than a tactic it's optimism that's strategic it's strategy by optimism right because when you are the superpower and you've been trying to mediate this thing for a while right and you come to a point where there are a a good number of factors one we are approaching Ramadan two we are approaching the end of the fifth month of War uh International Community is getting fed up uh there's a bit of a fatigue on both sides so once you launch into optimism whoever is not responding with you is the party pooper is responsible for suddenly turning this uh you know Christmas uh it's Christmas every day into hell in Gaza notably Hamas right but also Netanyahu and that's why I think Hamas was basically squeezed by that kind of a tactic on the part of the uh of the Trump White House whereby they say well it seems like the parties have agreed we probably could start on Monday let's go for it well if Haman says no wait a minute I didn't get anything new it sounds like it's the uh Outsider but this also puts pressure on Israel as well doesn't it it does and that also should give us a pause about the growing tension uh between Biden and Netanyahu not by Israel and the United States or by the United States and Israel but clearly Biden at least in private is getting fed up with Netanyahu because Netanyahu has been humiliating him like there's no tomorrow so I think both men are sort of in different calendars I think Netanyahu wants to run the clock on Biden so he can make whatever arrangements with his potential successor Trump he prefers Trump to Biden Biden would prefer to somehow directly or indirectly get rid of Netanyahu and get in someone like gun or or whoever that is more amenable to American ideas so this kind of a move right that could see us St go through after Ramadan with a with a ceasefire right this could lead to the implosion of the Israeli government and if such they definitely Netanyahu is out that's not necessarily to the disliking of Biden no can we just talk about the Optics of all this because when Biden was talking he was explaining all of this on a late night comedy talk show which is quite an unusual Place uh for these remarks to be to be put out there as well as we saw him eating an ice cream while he was talking about famine and the plight of the Palestinians what do you make of just the look The Optics of this we didn't really figure out what kind of ice cream it is right um but my sense is he's been doing that for a while instead of making sort of a grand State of the Union type statements where you know he SS behinds it and if didn't work out then he's totally embarrassed to do it on a casual on the stop I'm thr away comment isn't it yes yeah so if it doesn't work it doesn't sound like you know he got out of the Lim and made a major doctrinal speech of strategy of some sort he's basically on the go eating an ice cream while people are starving in Gaza but what the heck you know he is trying to end the humanitarian situation if it worked it's great if it doesn't work well it's another ice cream yeah indeed well we have to leave it there Mar but we'll be talking to you over the next few hours Maran Bashar our senior political analyst thank you
