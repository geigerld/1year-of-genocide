access to the internet is considered a basic human right it keeps us informed entertained allows us to connect with each other and the world and that connection is especially important during times of War I'm Analise boures and this is the [Music] stream we don't have Internet people can't call the ambulance and the bombings all around us Israel's war on Gaza has taken on a multitude of shapes the bombing and the raids are only part of the story another less talked about weapon is connectivity or lack thereof Israel controls most of the electricity as well as of telecommunications and internet access in Gaza first it turned off power lines which made hospitals and even sewage plants stop working later internet blackouts were registered across the strip which made a dire situation even worse we managed to connect with one resident afaf alar who is in the south of Gaza Strip AA thank you so much for joining us here on the stream today can I start by asking you after over a month of chaos and destruction all around you just how are you doing I have just been texting uh some of my friends on Instagram and WhatsApp my friends who are not in the Gaza Strip at the moment uh telling them that I almost forgot who I am and I almost forgot how my life used to be before uh the aggression on the Gaza Strip started I was just telling them that I don't want to reach to the point where I'm used to what's happening where where I wake up every day with with the the thought that oh this is never going to end um I think that I've been trying my best to stay well put together and and um you know keep my strength and my energy and everything but today especially today after everything that has been happening for for about a month now more than a month now and after seeing multiple members of my family getting killed in in the air strikes and after losing so many friends um I can really say that I'm I'm about to lose it honestly you said you you've been messaging friends outside of Gaza how important is it to keep that connection alive right now staying connected is is crucial it's very important when when when the connection was cut off uh from the Gaza STP was cut off twice uh completely Al let alone the fact that it's it's very weak right now but when it was cut off completely I remember uh that I felt like I was in an open air grave I swear to God it almost fell felt like someone has dug up a grave for me and told me to just stay there you know I felt like my hand were tied my mouth was shut and that there's nothing I can do anymore uh and I remember that after the internet came back that I read news that ambulances and firefighters were fighting people limbs on the streets that they couldn't get to because no one no one was able to call them to begin with no one was able to call the ambulances the hospitals tell them there is an attack in this specific area please come and pick up the people who died and pick up the injuries no one was able to do that AFA would you say this is perhaps another tool of War definitely they are trying to break the spirits of the Palestinians up more they saw that all of the bombing and all of the killing and all of the destruction still keep the Palestinian people's Faith even after all of that they are looking now for their ways first of which was cutting off uh the connection completely of the Palestinians in Gaza then they went on to bombing the solar panels that are on top of hospitals bakeries houses and and so much more so that people don't even have any electricity anymore whatsoever and then they started targeting water wheels they started targeting bakeries they started targeting shops they are they are trying to do anything they possibly can not only to cause as much destruction as possible and as much massacres as possible but to also break up the spirits of the Palestinians who are still in their homes resisting the ethnic cleansing and resisting the displacement of Palestinians of of the ga strip AA alar thank you so so much for taking the time to speak to us here on the stream let's now bring two more voices to very important voices into this conversation Alp toker is the executive director of net block a cyber security monitoring group he's joining us today from Istanbul and Mina El haabi he's a she's a journalist and author who initiated connecting Gaza to collect and send eims to people there she's joining us from Cairo thank you both so much for being here Mira we will talk about the incredible movement you started in in in just a moment but Al if I can start with you your organization has been monitoring these blackouts in Gaza and on October 27th you said that you observed a large single the largest single internet disruption in Gaza since the war started uh and we have a tweet that you put out uh a total or near blackout of the internet service um can you help us understand the graphic that you guys tweeted that day what exactly uh are we seeing over here yeah that's right on the 27th uh we tracked a very significant a major disruption to connectivity across the Gaza Strip uh now this was unprecedented in terms of what we've monitored uh both during this conflict and before if you take a look at the chart you can see uh the observable connectivity levels so what these represent are really uh an outside analysis in real time of connectivity in each of those regions and you can see that you know uh connectivity there at the beginning prior to the seventh is fairly stable and then you see over time at the very start of this conflict you see a decline in connectivity now we know that that decline is attributed to a couple of reasons one of them being uh the missile strikes from Israel and the other being uh the population flight as people leave the territory so you have those two factors but then on the 27th you can see a very significant a major disruption as connectivity just blacks out and this is linked with with um a major U military operation by Israel that coincides with that time so we know that these disruptions have been implemented during those times for a duration of some 36 hours between the 27th and the 29th of October this has had a very Major Impact on people's ability to communicate and it's really limited the world's ability to understand also what's going on within the territory so obviously a huge impact and I I know you guys have also observed other blackouts since then yeah that's right so this uh wasn't an isolated incident as we continue to monitor we tracked a further one of these interruptions on one November on the 1 November uh just a few days later uh which lasted some 9 and a half hours or so and in terms of the mechanism that was deployed there was very similar was identical to what happened on the 27th so we now know by the 1st of November that the same thing is happening exact same thing is happening again a second time and we can tell from the fingerprint of this Telemetry that it's impacted the exact same exchanges the same network and is having the same effect in terms of a total or near tootal blackout for the residents of the Gaza Strip and then again on the 5th of November we see that the same same thing happens for a third time uh this time for 15 hours so you know that we have these three major blackouts in effect and Al I mean the the fact that we see the these lines kind of coming back up again um it means that obviously some sort of connectivity was restored after these blackouts um in my understanding this correctly because if this was damaged to the infrastructure then that's it the internet is gone and it's gone forever but the fact that it comes back does it suggest that this is some kind of um I don't know uh a technical trigger uh is is Behind These blackouts right so we need to take a look at the main mechanisms of disruptions to understand what's going on here I mean there's really three main causes of what's uh the disruptions and we have the power outages we have the kinetic impact of the war of the fighting then we also have Israel's ability to uh connect or disconnect uh Gaza Strip at will this is because uh Gaza relies on Israeli connectivity as an upstream much as relies on Israeli power and on Israeli resources um due to the geography of the situation so there are many Hallmarks many indicators here that these have been technical mechanisms used to disrupt connectivity and what we know for certain is that the same thing has happened in each of these three incidents so in terms of a reason for this you know if it had been damaged to infrastructure it simply wouldn't have been possible to get repaired and statements from the providers also say that they don't know they didn't actually apply fixes that back the connectivity so there are very strong indicators that this connectivity has been disrupted from the outside with intent I mean you mentioned impact and if I can get Mina on this uh we talked about obviously the emotional toll of just feeling completely cut off from the world um but that has also very practical implications and I I imagine you have been hearing about these implications in your work as well Mira uh of course being isolated and being uh droning in uncertainty of not being able to communicate with the outside world or with your uh family members or your loved ones or even the hospitals and the ambulances is for me it's outrageous and definitely one of the war crimes committed in uh Gaza um I've been uh connecting people since October 20 or 29th um we've been we've been connected we have connected more than 20,000 uh asms um they are now activated in Gaza and we are fighting time to connect more people uh since uh yesterday and because there there is a possibility a huge possibility for the communication and the internet to go for a Total Blackout um due to lack of fuel in uh in Gaza uh many uh many um many Network providers like Ido and Joel the Palestinians um Network providers have published yesterday um official statements on their social media stating that they are going to be uh totally cut off from providing communication and internet access due to the lack of fuel so you you started this alone but you you now have a team I believe you have several people with you so you can keep this this service operating 24 hours a day yes we're a team of 11 people so far uh because it's hard to um to grow your team when when it comes to protection of privacy of the Don donor details and also uh being in direct contact with people in Gaza uh to protect their safety so so I have to be sure um 200% of each and every member in my team sure and and how how did this idea the idea of connecting Gaza this movement you started how did it come about um actually I was in um in in in Trials uh to connect the Palestinian red crescent in coordination with the Egyptian red crescent with starlinks um the the link the company of elen musk because he tweeted that he can provide internet access through his company to the official um Aid organization in Gaza but we failed to fill the request and later on El MK tweeted to one of the leaders in the occupation Army uh that he will not pro he will not provide internet access uh without the permission of USA and Israel which made me so angry and I was updating my my followers step by step through the um the requests of store link and one of my followers she's Egyptian Lebanese she suggested do what do you think of isims could it work and I was like whoa maybe we can so I told her to send me two isims as trials and I kept scrolling X to find any uh people from Gaza uh who are connected even with like we connections so we can try on the first two isms uh these two people are journalists Ahmed fromaz and hind Ki and I've have sent them the itms and it worked successfully and we've provided them with more asms to provide to their teams and people around them and then I um I posted like a spontaneous um call for donation e donations on my uh personal account uh and thousands of people uh around around the world kept sending me uh donations of uh QR codes and esm donations uh so I had to um to create an email an email address especially for uh receiving the uh donated asms and then and then the community just just grew and grew can can I ask you very briefly what what I mean e are are relatively uh new technology can you explain in just a few words how do they work uh so an an Asim is like an nonphysical SIM card that has an extension extension of your internet package and calls package uh through your um number so when uh when a person in Europe or USA or across the world buy an Asim so he buys like an extenstion to his internet package that can be used um for roaming interesting fascinating I imagine that you are going through quite a lot as you said uh you you you barely have time to sleep you have to bring other people in I would like to uh thank both of you very much for joining us today Alp and Mira for your time uh Mina because you are so busy we're going to let you go and we wish you best of luck ala you too of course and I would like to uh now turn to uh another guest a very uh important guest today as well to help us uh put this puzzle together uh dorham Abu Salim you joining us from DC you he's a writer and a communication specialist um and you have family inside Gaza right now um can you tell us about how you're getting by and and how are you managing to connect with your father and your mother in Gaza it's been very very difficult unfortunately you know uh since this uh the Israel gression has started against the Gaza Strip I've only managed to hear the voice of my parents and for them to hear my voice maybe three to four times uh which to me is unbearable I am someone who's always been in touch with his family calling my mother and my father almost in a daily basis uh so the situation has been very very difficult precisely because of the things that you know uh both speakers earlier have mentioned not only is it just a question of the internet connection ity and our inability to reach our families for those of us who are abroad via you know apps like WhatsApp Messenger or even text messaging over data plans but also landlines and mobile lines have been severely impacted by this to the point where it's very very difficult to make these kind of calls can you tell us a little bit about about your your mom and your dad we're seeing them uh in some photos right now right uh you know I'm my mother and father are both in the Gaza Strip with two of my siblings my mom is in her late 60s and she's a blind woman my father is in his 80 years old and he is paralyzed and along with them are two of my siblings a younger sister and an older brother in the Gaza Strip and currently in our household we are Sheltering three more families uh that have you know been forcibly displaced from Gaza City towards Southern cities and we are based in D which is right in the middle of the Gaza scrip uh the situation for the family last heard is incredibly unbearable inhumane and undignified you know the lack of water the lack of electricity the lack of food and with my parents specifically you know as elderly people who live with disabilities and chronic conditions unfortunately also the lack of medication is is quite threatening to their livelihood and their wellbe uh so needless to say I mean as it goes for everyone in the Gaza script uh it I mean the situation could be more so compounded for those living with disabilities but it really is just quite horrific and for someone like me at a distance but who has also endured and was there during for example the 2014 aggression of the Israeli occupation against the Gaza Strip I am just in in in horror and in absolute pain day in and day out thinking what they are enduring uh even at a distance and you know for for me the question of connectivity remains very very critical uh I've heard Mira talk about eims which I think have been very very useful I have you know managed to get eims to my sister in in the Gaza Strip although I must say I mean even installing those is quite an uous exercise it's quite difficult without a connection to begin with installing them can be difficult and even though it worked for some time it didn't work necessarily all the time uh so it really is just a bit of a hit and miss so far and it's all a byproduct I I I believe you know of how the Israeli control of the Gaza Strip uh is you know manifesting itself it's not just a question of the occupation and the blockade and and and all of the policies that we see in place but also there is such a thing as a digital occupation of all Palestinian territories and these are Technologies of occupation and enclosure because as Al had mentioned earlier in the Gaza Strip specifically there is no control of the information and Communications infrastructure whatsoever Israel completely controls that at well uh even its development even it's it's uh it's its management and all these things so it really is up to these radi occupation authorities how the connectivity is is available or not available in in the Gaza St and what we've seen with this particular situation you know with all of these blackouts that have happened uh isn't something new uh these have been tactics that have been used in Prior offenses that were committed against the Gaza Strip uh so it's it's quite uh you know predictable in a sense but it also confirms to us that these are practices that are as a matter of intent and policy and as we all know everything goes on on the ground is governed by international law and the laws of war and regulations of War so whe there is policy and intent you could establish violations and crimes and and of course according to the UN internet access is a human right and when that was interrupted in Gaza nobody was quite sure was actually happening so this was one of the uh only way residents got information a message that replaced the traditional call to prayer take a look dorham how powerful of a tool of War would you say this is uh it's an incredibly powerful tool for for for these occupation authorities to to be uh able to really uh manage the way people are communicating or even control it all together as you've seen you know people on the ground have tried to find Alternatives in powerful ways uh yet at the end of the day that the fact that the Israeli occupation authorities have that power to begin with is is truly telling in so far that you are truly controlling whether people are going to be saved from under the rubble for example and I'll share with you a very quick story I am here based in the United States on a WhatsApp group with some friends who are from the Gaz strip who are based here in the United States uh one of them their family's home a relative of their family's home was bomed during the Israeli assault so far on the Gaza Strip and he was texting our group of people here here in the US uh because we are spread out from different towns in the Gaza Strip originally asking us if we could spread the word about what happened to his family's uh relative home because they could not there spread the word about finding rescue missions to rescue people from underneath the rubble so I mean this this is supped to show the extent to which Israel's ability to control the way people communicate is actually very very powerful and very very impactful in a very negative way regarding people on the G STP so you're not necessarily able to communicate about developments you're not necessarily able to communicate about saving people people's lives you're not necessarily able to communicate about where it might be safe or where it might not be safe for people and all of these details so it really is is is it's quite difficult to to absolutely I'm so sorry to interrupt but we we have a very limited amount of time left less than a minute can I ask you if you have a message I don't know to your family to the International Community you you can deliver that message through us right now you know I I think first and foremost in everyone's mind mind it is imperative on everyone to uh you know ensure the safety and the livelihood and the wellbeing of Palestinians everywhere certainly in the Gaza Strip uh I know that there is a global consensus around a call for a ceasefire even though certain governments have failed to represent the calls of their own people uh in that respect uh we you know I remain hopeful and I pray for my family that they remain safe uh along with everyone else uh and where connectivity is concerned as you've mentioned it is a matter of Human Rights uh as has been mentioned and and endorsed by the UN Nations so when we look at this particular situation so always remember that any violation of it it could very well be a tent amount to war crimes committed by the Israel occupation dhan thank you so so much for joining us especially in this difficult time and special thanks to Mirna Al and of course AFA and thank you for watching don't forget that if you have a about our show you can talk to us on social media if you have an idea or a topic that you'd like to flag for us we welcome your suggestions
