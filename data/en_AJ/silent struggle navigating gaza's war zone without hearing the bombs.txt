Your name is Suleiman Zarb. Zarb is from Khan Yunis. He came as a displaced person, of course, from Khan Yunis. After the bombing, he fled from Khan Yunis to Rafah and carried his belongings on his bed. I mean, there is no one. I mean, there is no transportation. I hear the bombing and drink as a displaced person. I mean, he held the white flag and sat waving it, and the seat of the passer-by is safe until I tell you. Is there any flour in Rafah or any water? I suffer from it a lot. I have to walk a long distance when he comes to bring water to the house. There are six young children sitting there. There is nothing to eat, drink or anything. Praise be to God for every need from the Lord of His servants, and God willing, oh our Lord, this will be the case and we will go. On our homes, on our families, and we see our families. Funus now. Where are you now? Where are you located? A tent. It is there, but it is suffocating, but there is no food or drink for it. What does a tent mean to you? Why do you remember? What does this mean? It reminds you of what does the tent remind you of? Remind me of his suffering. In the suffering I lived through, and this is not.  In any case, in any case, the necessities of life are available to us. Rafah now has nothing. He does not eat or drink, nor does he eat meat or chicken. In the past, a man was advised, meaning he is in good health now. Praise be to God. I say to you, Lord of the Worlds, that the Jews saved us from the spraying, the bombing, and the openings. Praise be to God, even in work, meaning work.  There is no meaning, what do two people have to do with anything other than God, but you are in the tent at night. How is the pain falling? Falling in the night. It means goodness. There is no falling asleep. Three prohibited things are put on it. And ice is its birth. It means falling in the sense of falling. Even the unlawful things from here and there. I bring a blanket and bring a cover. I mean, I use it to cover it. What do you say to them? You say they are right. They brought us food. They brought us something and a reconciliation. And God willing, Lord, we pray to God. This will be reconciled and a reconciliation will be made. I mean, there will be coordination. Or we will see our turn. The person returns to his work and returns to his normal work and returns home very happy, but then nothing happens and everyone is even sad.  No food, no clothes, no bathing
