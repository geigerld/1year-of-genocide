well let's now speak to Gabriel Lando he joins me now from un headquarters in New York Gabe from yesterday to today to tomorrow we keep hearing about endless delays seemingly does this mean that given all the the negotiations behind closed doors that there is a desire to try to move to something particularly on the part of the us that it won't veto I think so I mean uh a lot of these negotiations are taking place behind closed doors so we can't get a clear sense of what's being discussed of course but one thing is very clear that it is the US that is holding this up and we're hearing now uh late on Tuesday it's now two issues we thought it was one now we think it's two the first one is this language about the cessation of hostilities uh that was the first language put in the first draft by the United Arab Emirates uh and then the US said we're not going to go for that because it seems like it's it's almost like a ceasefire language there the US will not go for that so they changed it of course to the suspension of hostilities it has a little bit more temporary framing to it we thought the US would go for that but apparently uh there are still some problems with that language as well Reuters is now reporting Tuesday evening and our sources at Al jazer are confirming our diplomatic sources that now there is a second issue as well and that comes down to a monitoring mechanism that is in this resolution it's calling for the United Nations to take control of monitoring the aid coming in and also monitoring its distribution as well and it appears that the US also has some issues with that as well oh very interesting well you talked there about Aid Gabe this is intended primarily as a humanitarian resolution tell us what the the current draft might include well it is humanitarian resolution first and foremost that's what all the diplomats that support this which are is the most the majority of the council says and we heard that from the ambassador to the UAE as well to the un uh it is calling for a huge scaling up of Aid by all means necessary particularly air air land and sea and again it's not only scaling up that Aid this monitoring mechanism is key as well because this resolution is saying we want this Aid going into Gaz and we want it going in Fast and efficiently but we're not just going to leave it up to Israel uh to monitor that this monitoring mechanism would then put the Honus on the United Nations to really uh uh check that Aid get it into the country uh quickly to those that need it the most so it's very multipronged approach here uh but clearly there are still some real issues here we are now hearing that the earliest that this resolution could go up up to a vote now would be Wednesday at 11:00 a.m. eastern time here in New York that's about 16 GMT bottom line is this ultimately the person that will be making the decision for the United States on this will be President Joe Biden he will ultimately make the call if he demands that his diplomats veto this resolution or not well we'll be watching that vote if it happens very very closely then indeed for now Gabriel Alando at the United Nations thank you Gabe well let's bring in Ry imay he is a professor of international law at Queens University he joins us from Ottawa RI all of these delays these repeated delays what do you think we should be reading into them I think it's very clear um yet again it's a failure um by the United Nations security Council to shoulder its burden to maintain International Peace and security and most importantly under threat of a US veto which continues to provide the occupying power with the space the time and indeed the weapons to bombard starve and ultimately ethnically cleanse the Palestinian people out of Gaza well do you think that there's potentially more pressure on the US right now and that's why this has gone on for so long behind closed doors in terms of negotiations rather than just coming to the council and then vetoing it there may very well be internal discussions happening with the United States I understand uh and this is speculation on my part um that there might be a difference of opinion between say the White House and certain elements in the state department and maybe even the US mission to the United Nations in New York but at bottom the reason why there's this why there may be a difference of opinion in the United States um is quite frankly because of the unhealthy relationship that they share with the occupying power which has put the United States and Israel and maybe a few other states out on on a limb Vis the rest of the International Community which is calling overwhelmingly for a ceasefire uh uh which is required by by all humanitarian means really and we saw that in the general assembly AI if a resolution with the current language that we're hearing does get passed in the security Council what do you make of the likelihood of implementation what are the legal requirements given that it's a security Council resolution well I mean any decision of the United Nations security Council which would come through a resolution would be binding under international law on all member states that would include the occupying power um and so we only have to wait and see what comes comes uh out of the security Council and that is why presumably the United States has been really reluctant to give anything um in any Security Council resolution of consequence uh because then that would bind the state of Israel I think one of the most important things your listeners need to be made aware of however is that to the extent that any resolution of the Council focuses on humanitarian Aid we need to understand that under international law the occupying power may never condition humanitarian Aid to the protected civilian population that it occupies and so the whole idea that there should be a quid proquo for instance I'd heard in your segment earlier that the prime minister or the president of Israel indicated that they want a humanitarian pause in order to allow for Aid to go through no no no no under international law the occupying power has to give that human itarian Aid facilitate that humanitarian aid unencumbered for the benefit of the civilian population subject to its bombardment and we have quite the opposite going on now are you've been very very clear there the resolution that we're talking about now is meant to be a humanitarian resolution but there have been multiple reports of the Israeli Army impeding Aid into the strip using starvation as a weapon of war is there any legal recourse there and would there be any legal recourse if a resolution was passed and not implemented well certainly in uh your your question covers a few areas so if a resolution is passed and the occupying power does not adhere to it then it's left to the security Council to follow up and impose measures against the occupying power which it may do and has authority to do uh uh under the UN Charter those measures can include arms embargos diplomatic uh sanctions even use of force if indeed you can get a decision out of the out of the security Council which of course is virtually impossible by virtue of the US position on the other hand there are still options available for the rest of the International Community the office of the prosecutor of the international criminal court for instance who has made a very important point to remind all parties to the conflict including the occupying power that humanitarian Aid must flow should take action and there's an investigation in the situation of Palestine which he's controlling and that action might include uh arrest warrants indictments and so on so there is there there are options available the only question is is there will on the part of those who have their fingers if you like on the levers of power to do anything about it um fingers crossed that over time well rather sooner rather than later there will be some action R IM say there professor of international law at Queens University always great to get your expertise with us here on aler thank you for joining us aie thank you anasia
