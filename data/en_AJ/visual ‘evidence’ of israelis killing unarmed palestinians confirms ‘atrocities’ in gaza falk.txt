Al jazer has obtained footage showing Israeli forces in Gaza shooting two unarmed Palestinians dead at close range one of the men repeatedly waves what appears to be a piece of white fabric to show they're not a threat this is an international symbol of surrender the bodies of the two Palestinians are then buried by an Israeli bulldozer T Abu AUM has more from Rafa in southern Gaza completely disturbing and distressing images that the video that the jazer has obtained shows how two unarmed Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli forces they have been completely disarmed they did not impose any significant threat on the Israeli forces as they were as they were completely aw with a distance from the Israeli forces who were taking a cover behind sand piles and that's absolutely terrifying as those Palestinians have been killed and we completely see how Israeli armored bulldozers have been buried them on the coastal uh line of the uh besieged enclave and from the video that has been obtained it's absolutely clear that the location where those two Palestinians have been killed and shot by Israeli forces was completely uh next to the recent peer that had been established by the world Central Kitchen in order to facilitate eight uh process a delivering process to the Gaza trip on the uh in Gaza City and that incident wasn't absolutely the first from its kind within the past few weeks we have been multiply seeing how the Israeli forces have been carrying out field executions against number of Palestinians in the Norther part of Gaza where their dead bodies have been remained alone and laying on the roads and sometimes being biled up uh uh with different kinds of garbage as what have been happening in another part of gazan B lahia town where the majority of those dead bodies have been decomposed without being rescued and that's absolutely terrifying it it's completely a new preach of the humanitarian of the international humanitarian LW that those Palestinians were completely unarmed they did not impose any significant threat let's bring in Richard fol now professor of international law at Princeton University and a former un special repur on Palestinian human rights he joins us live from Santa Barbara California thank you for joining us uh what do you make of this distressing video well it is a vivid confirmation of continuing Israeli at atrocities directed at uh innocent and vulnerable and unthreatening uh Palestinian civilians and it's shocking because it's made available in conv vincing evidence uh in real time and that that's been part of what has been so shocking throughout this entire Israeli Onslaught on Gaza that the eyes and ears of the world have been assaulted in real time uh by uh this form of genocidal behavior and it is a shocking reality that there has been no uh adverse reaction from the liberal democracies in the west it is a shameful moment in Western uh International moral Behavior what do you think this says about the Israeli military's approach when it comes to International standards and law well it's completely consistent with Israeli Defiance of international law unless it happens to coincide with their strategic interests which it rarely does uh during uh this period of prolonged occupation Israel pursues its own objectives which are inconsistent and contradict International humanitarian law and the genocide convention and uh numerous other uh sources of legal Authority it ref refuses to comply with the interim order of the international court of justice it refuses to alter Its Behavior in response to the recent ceasefire uh which is a weak resolution of the security Council nevertheless it's a legally binding uh document that uh constitutes a decision the violation of which is itself a criminal act how important do you think it is that incidents like this are documented when it comes to any future accountability I think it's very important not only for the formal legal proceedings that might occur in the future but to [Music] uh a conflict that should be subject to un Authority remember that Israel is an occupying power under special restrictions by the Geneva Convention and as such has a primary obligation to protect the civilian population that is occupied and from the beginning from 19 uh 67 Israel has ignored this fundamental source of legal constraint on its activity as the occupying power okay we'll have to leave it there Richard for we very much appreciate your time thank you thank you for having me
