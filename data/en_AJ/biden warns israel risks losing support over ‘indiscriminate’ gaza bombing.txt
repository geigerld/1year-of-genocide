and joining us live now from Minneapolis Minnesota is taher harala he is director of Outreach and Grassroots organizing at the American the organization American Muslims for Palestine um let's get into a number of the the news lines that we've been discussing over the last few minutes perhaps most interestingly given where you are this apparent increasing division perhaps that's putting it too strong but certainly criticism coming from the White House of at least elements of Israeli policy uh some it seems off camera of Benjamin Netanyahu by implication as well uh what do you make of that well it's very clear that internally uh the United States is very cognizant of the fact that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza uh and this uh these recent statements by the president of the United States Joe Biden indicate the internal conversations uh in the White House are uh very clearly um pointing to one thing and that Israel is committing crime CRI Against Humanity and that the United States is having a hard time digesting those crimes um and now the U the division between Benjamin Netanyahu and Joe Biden is becoming more evident um and the president's statement last night uh indicates that the appetite American Appetite uh for uh Israel's crimes in Gaza and so what do you make of the fact that I I think we may have lost the line to Ty are you still there can you hear us Mr herela I think we need to move on we've lost the sound I don't know if there's anything you can do at your end if you've muted by mistake no all right we'll try and come back to him later if this time but uh thank you very much T haala still ahead on Al jazer not just a piece of artart we have more on the famous sculpture destroyed by Israeli forces in Janine [Music] welcome back you're watching Al jazer a reminder of our top stories this hour new pictures from a school Sheltering displaced Palestinians in Northern Gaza show bodies piled up following an Israeli attack Witnesses say a number of people including women children and babies were killed execution Style by Israeli forces while they were Sheltering inside hundreds of thousands of Palestinian families are fighting for survival in Gaza as heavy rains bring extensive flooding large parts of informal camps are underwater amid Israeli attacks Aid agencies warn waterbor diseases could spread on a wide scale an Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank is continuing more than 24 hours nearly 48 hours after it started in the city of Janine seven people have been killed now let's hear from Martin Griffith he's the UN under secretary for humanitarian Affairs and emergency relief he told Al jazer that Hamas was among the Palestinian voices that needed to be heard when deciding the future of Palestine why aren't we asking the Palestinian people what they want to see and of course their ideas will be uh confused in many ways their views about starting a political process will be over ambitious no doubt their voice just as in Sudan the civilian voice the Civil Society the civilian voice The Voice equ also by the way of Hamas and other organizations um who've been involved in the Palestinian um or um Universe needs to be heard we need them to be given the opportunity to tell us their views about the future I'm a stranger I get no vote in Palestine but there are many who do and they have strong views much better informed than mine Martin Griffis there talking to our diplomatic editor to James Bay for talk to Al jazer uh you can see that uh on Friday December the 15th at 11:30 GMT now let's cross back to Minneapolis Minnesota and Ty hella thank you very much for your patience staying with us uh we were talking a couple of minutes ago you were talking about the nature of the apparent policy Division and discomfort within the US Administration now we have National Security adviser Jake Sullivan heading out to the region what you expect of him and and do you think he can be successful in pulling levers to potentially mediate and change Israeli policy yes I think the uh the statements by the president at a public gathering describing what Israel is doing as quote indiscriminate bombing uh is a reflection of the type of internal conversations that are being had in the white house um about what Israel is doing in Gaza and the the criticisms of the Biden Administration here in the United States are becoming louder and louder by the day uh where uh Congressional staff are now confronting uh their members of Congress their bosses essentially on Capitol Hill uh demanding a ceasefire and so as the pressure mounts on the Biden Administration uh we are starting to uh see uh that the Biden uh Camp is um uh more and more inclined towards uh discussing a ceasefire or more and more inclined towards uh moving in that direction at least uh but the problem is uh that the US Administration so far has uh maybe uh started to break ranks with with Israel as far as the narrative is concerned however um as far as us weapons Supply is concerned uh that flow or that um that faucet is still open and on and and unfortunately uh we saw this week uh the $105 million transfer of ammunition tank shells uh to Israel uh to continue its quote indiscriminate bombings uh that Joe Biden uh so um so rightfully uh described well yeah that there are some reports that there is a a ban on or at least a delay to the transfer of M16 tens of thousands of M16 rifles uh because of fears that they might be used in the occupied West Bank and the United States has been sort of pushing against settler attacks in the occupied West Bank but at the same time uh voting with Israel in the United Nations so it's a case of certainly more public facing uh discomfort and criticism uh while at the same time at the UN it very much is voting with Israel absolutely I think the United Nations General Assembly um made a very strong rebuke of Israel uh yesterday uh with more than 153 Nations demanding a ceasefire uh and only um a 23 Nations abstaining with 10 voting against and even if you look at the abstentions uh America's greatest allies uh UK France Germany Italy uh Spain uh refused to vote against the ceasefire despite American pressure to do so and that is an indication of the fact that uh even in Europe uh America's closest allies they cannot stomach yet another Massacre yet another invasion of a hospital uh and and the uh more images of the bodies of of Palestinian children um um decapitated uh due to Israeli bombardment and so uh this is a clear indication that despite us pressure and despite what the United States may be trying to do in building International consensus in support of Israel's invasion of Gaza its continued occupation of Gaza uh it's clear that that is an uphill battle that the United States cannot win and that's why we are seeing also the Biden Administration changing its tone um with regards to what is taking place and starting to send clear messages to Israel um that this uh that that moral Authority or the moral claim that Israel may have had on October 7th no longer stands as it continues its genocide in Gaza all right tala thank you for your time thank you for staying with us despite those uh technical glitches and and thanks for joining us from
