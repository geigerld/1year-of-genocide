[Music] a warm welcome to you we begin with a United Nations report that's condemned Israeli forces for killing and injuring children the UN Secretary General says he's appalled by the dramatic increase in unprecedented scale of violations against children in Palestine and Israel Antonio ceras is calling them brutal acts of Terror the UN verified 5,698 such violations by Israeli forces last year situations in the CAC report where substantial increase in grave violations were verified include a rise of over 155% violations over prior years in the conflict in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory notably in Israel the Gaza strep and the occupied West Bank Hamas and Islamic Jihad committed 137 violations against children that's according to the report it notes at least 43 Israeli children were killed during the October 7th attacks in central Gaza is T abuo who's outside the AL AXA hospital that's in De albala and Tarak of course the UN in this report focusing its attention on the suffering of children in this conflict this as the Israeli military pushes towards almasi home of course up until now at least to many [Applause] civilians well generally uh Palestinian children were generally affected from this ongoing military offensive across this threat they have been multiply and internally displaced from the houses they were forced in instead of getting education to line up for long hours in front of water stations in order to get some gallons of water to return back with to their families in order to survive and this is the Grim reality we're talking about thousands of Palestinian children being killed since October the 7th and there are still thousands right now being deprived from having education and similar rights as other children around the globe but this is absolutely the Grim reality in the strip now even in light of the Israeli ongoing attacks on Al moas area this place has been uh a general shelter for thousands of Palestinian children who Tred to follow the orders of the Israeli military to seek refuge in Rafa this area later that has t to be a battle zone between Hamas Fighters and the Israeli Army as gradually later the Israeli military tanks started to advance towards the al- masasi area launching wide series of Israeli air strikes targeting residential houses uh alongside with makeshift shs but from the Israeli side in official statement they denied carrying out air strikes in the humanitarian zones as people are terrified from this ongoing Israeli military offens of RA so far all right tck many thanks for that TK Abu inal all right let's go to the UN now Gabriel Lando's standing by and Gabe the UN of course very much the source of these extremely damning findings how are the details resonating there well Virginia Gamba the spe secretary General's special representative for children and armed conflict said that they are certainly disturbing numbers that's putting it mildly quite frankly there's a lot to unpack in this report it's more than 100 pages long it is jam-packed with all sorts of numbers but I just want to highlight a couple of key points here and that is uh the numbers cited in this report as bad and and horrific as they are on the number of Palestinian children uh uh killed uh by Israeli forces in Gaza the number in reality is much higher and that's a fact because the UN report only looks at cases uh that the UN can independently verify and access particularly to the Gaza Strip is incredibly difficult so they even say in the report the reality of the numbers is probably uh much higher than what they can actually even put in this report and there's a lot of detail in here as well for example just give you two very quick examples when it comes to the Israeli uh military and government and Israeli media sources saying that there was rape perpetrated by Hamas fighters on October 7th against Israeli uh uh uh civilians this report says they were not able to confirm that independently even verify that when it comes to human Shields which you've heard a lot from Israeli officials actually the report points out to examples in occupied West Bank where Israeli uh forces use Palestinian children as human shield in certain instances cited in this report so there's a lot to unpack here but again this is the first time ever that the Israeli military and security forces have ever been listed in this annual report that comes out of course every year by the UN on children in armed conflict certainly a lot to grasp a lot of reading here but the bottom line is is the number of Palestinian particular children uh uh killed maimed uh in conflict is certainly way up it certainly is way up indeed Gabriel alander the UN thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
