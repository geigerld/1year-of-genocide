jabalia this refugee camp which was struck by Israel in the last few hours is one of the refugee camps in Gaza many of them in fact but it's the biggest one and 70% of the residents of Gaza are refugees or descendants of those who were forcibly displaced by Israel Over Decades of its territorial expansion and occupation what Gaza is referred to as the world's largest open air prison and is one of the most densely populated areas on Earth Michael Apple gives us some context this is what Palestine looked like in 1917 that was before British forces conquered it ating the ottoman Turks on the 2nd of November of that year Britain's foreign secretary Arthur bfor issued the belf for declaration it was a pledge to establish a home for the Jewish people in Palestine without prejudicing the Civil or religious rights of existing Palestinian communities with the carving up of the Ottoman Empire at the end of the first world war the League of Nations handed Britain the Mandate over Palestine in 1922 the Jewish population there Grew From 6% in 1918 to 33% by 1947 by May the following year the British mandate expired marking the creation of Israel known by Palestinians as the nakba or catastrophe the establishment of isra in 1948 triggered the first Arab Israeli War Israeli forces captured 78% of historic Palestine 34 of a million Palestinians were expelled or forced from their homes the Palestinian territory was split in two its people being forced to settle in Gaza and the West Bank during the 6 day war in June 1967 Israel occupied all of historic Palestine and expelled a further 300,000 people its forces also captured the Golan Heights from Syria and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt in 1993 the Oslo Accords were signed in Washington DC they established the Palestinian Authority that would govern internal security administration and civilian Affairs for what was supposed to be an inim period that divided the West Bank into areas a b and c with each giving the newly created Authority limited degrees of control in 2005 Israel's policy of disengagement led to its withdrawal from Gaza and removal of thousands of Jewish settlers on the 12th of September that year the last Israeli forces left the Gaza Strip literally closing the gate on the territory and establishing a siege that has been maintained ever since Mike leppel El jazer joining us now on the phone is yri alul who is a Palestinian writer and a descendant of Palestinian refugees from 1948 he's on the line from gaza's Beach refugee camp in the north thank you so much uh for speaking to us uh we are talking uh about the jabala refugee camp which is the largest in Gaza of course but there are several other refugee camps can you tell us first what life is like for people who live in these camps yeah uh good evening just let me before to answer your question please I just want to tell you just a few minutes ago my my child is asking me if they killed us will I see you after death this is the question of a child because we are waiting as as a refugee camp we are staying residence in a refugee camp waiting our death our the Bloodshed which is comes from the Israeli occupation forces and my wife is crying until now what happened in jabalia Camp in the North Area happened just in just two hours ago in the middle of Gaza where the Israeli called the Palestinians refugees to leave and to go and to immigrate to that place to the southern area they targeted a tower killed many of the Palestinians so what happened in jabalia uh not just uh tens were killed maybe hundreds were killed and hundreds were injured severely injured a children uh women most of them are women how could you yeah could you imagine this is not a massacre it's it's not just a massacre it's a genocide it's it's really ethnic cleansing 25 days killing Palestinians Killing Children Killing uh women there are the air strikes every night we don't sleep we don't eat we don't find fuel we don't find electricity we can't go to the bathrooms we can't do anything we're just they said that we are animals and unfortunately they are treating with us like we are animals and the world is silent the world is is is giving the permission the legit legitimacy from the United States to the to the Israelis to do whatever they want of the Palestinians this is a collective punishment of the civilians who lives in Gaza under siege for about 17 years and under incubation for about 75 years um indeed and and um and it's uh you know hearing you talk about your daughter and her words to you is really heartbreaking and of course the fear is you see that what happened at jabalia could happen to any of the refugee camps inside the Gaza street because it's indiscriminate the bombing has been indiscriminate we've seen hospitals bombed uh refugee camps where civilians live bomb but the Israelis of course will say that they're targeting militants Who hide in these refugee camps uh who have arms hidden in these refugee camps can you tell us what what life is like these are areas where civilians actually live okay thank you just just to let you know today and also this is the story today uh just maybe before 3 hours my my son is is injured because he went to the our neighbors house because they left the area where we live to the sou area so we don't have War to drink can you imagine you don't have water you don't have water to drink so my my I asked my my my child my son to go through a to go to the neighbor's house and and and bring water because they left the house we don't have electricity we don't have food so situation and in the streets no fuel now just let me tell you today morning in the beach camp also there were a massacre uh maybe three uh 30 Palestinians were killed civilian Palestinians were killed and the people who carried these buddies carried the Buddies by horses and by bikes you don't have ambulances to take these buddies to the hospital they targeted last night the Catholic uh Cultural Center where we make the cultural uh uh issues and and activities and also just let me tell you something last night I went to my neighbors house because they targeted it and I saw a cat I saw a cat eating something so my neighbor is telling me that this is a p a a piece of budy because after the chillings they targeted the house the Buddies were cut and and and they collected it so the cat comes to a fresh body uh and try to eat it can you imagine so what you describ to us is absolutely horrifying what you describe to us is is horrifying yory and um it it's just unfathomable unbelievable to to to see this happening today uh the hospital we're looking at pictures of the Indonesian hospital near jabala refugee camp which was struck by Israel and as you've said there's no water to drink these hospitals are completely overstretched do people still have any hope where do they turn to for hope for to talk about hope we are under occupation for about 75 years we are talking that we need our rights it's until now recognize you resolutions where is the hope of an ethnic cleansing committed by the the latest occupation in the world supported by the European community supported by the the international community supported by the United States where I should be now in in in Iowa in Iowa University I got the opportunity from the state department to be a part of of international writing program and I should be in Iowa at this time but unfortunately because there were no airports no corts and no borders I couldn't leave my country to participate in such a program this but and and I think if just we have a a one person Palestinian we will seek our freedom and we call for freedom and really just I'm tell you in the the from the harm and harsh situation thank you for jazer because you really our voice you are a free people for a free Palestinians who seek the freedom seeks the dignity seeks you know just we need to just a shable

horrified and and so this is the situation jabalia is a jabalia camp Beach campat camp ra crushing RAF area where the South and the middle in the north everything is targeted civilians innocent ambulances Civ civil defense everything in Gaza is targeted by the Israelis and then I'm sorry just and and and then Netanyahu last night in his conference and saying that he's Ling he's saying that we are we we try we try to just concentrate on the militant groups there were no Militan in groups in Gaza we don't see them we are just innocent this is a collective punishment everywhere and everything in Gaza as you say is being targeted us three uh we've heard from many experts who've said that isra Israel's strategy right now is to cut the territory in two isolate the north from the south and there's also pressure on Egypt to take in people from Gaza uh to take them into the Sinai if you had if you had the opportunity to leave if you could leave Gaza today would you do it knowing that you couldn't come back you know we were now just uh talking with my my father and my uncle we go to the sou area of Gaza we can't because the Israeli cut Gaza and made many parts not only two parts two sides Israel now is is is it comes to into Gaza and they invaded Gaza and they are not only in two places in too many places so we can't leave we are just waiting our our death we are waiting the the our you know just how could you sleep and you imagine that a rocket comes from an Israeli strike or a war plane and comes into your house and demolish it this is what we are waiting for but if we finish if the war finishes if the people and the world want us to leave Gaza we would leave it we will go to anywhere we don't call the Israelis if they don't want give us our rights we
