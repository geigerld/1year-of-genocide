00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 align:start position:0%
again is something that you're trying to
 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.110 align:start position:0%
again is something that you're trying to

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 align:start position:0%
avoid if you fight an Insurgency so I
 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.469 align:start position:0%
avoid if you fight an Insurgency so I
