Muhammad al- masri joins me now he's professor of media studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies good to have you with us so last night I spoke with a doctor inside a nassa hospital who he recounted to me how he had tried to comply with the Israeli instructions they received yesterday to leave nassa hospital he left with some people who were inside the hospital reached an Israeli checkpoint and he was told that the medical staff should stay in the hospital so apparently the Israelis know there are medical staff there are patients inside and today we wake up to the news that this hospital has been shelled how do we make sense of that well I mean it's a new story but in in some ways it's the same story uh for 4 and a half months uh Israel has been seeking to make life unlivable for Palestinians and part of that operation has involved uh attacking uh attacking hospitals um this is uh has been made clear by human rights groups uh evidence on the ground and it's been mentioned by South Africa uh at the at the icj so this is consistent with with what Israel's been doing for four and a half months and now we're seeing even Israeli allies like Canada Australia New Zealand calling for a ceasefire any sign that Israel might be listening no no indication uh at all uh I would say that you know these calls are are are certainly good and and welcomed but uh at the end of the day uh the United States holds the cards and um at present and as has been the case for 4 and a half months the US is entirely in Israel's Corner uh they are not calling for a ceasefire they don't they don't desire a ceasefire they want Israel to to uh continue with its with its Mission which I think uh my interpretation of what they've been doing for 4 and a half months is that this is all part of their greater Israel plan they will not finish until they've uh ethnically cleansed uh Gaza is Israel observing the instructions of the icj's preliminary ruling no I think actually the they've become even more Brazen in some ways over the last uh several weeks I mean that was one of the questions that I that I had you know several weeks ago when I I sat up here uh on El jazer and asked uh whether Israel would sort of moderate Its Behavior in Gaza in light of what's Happening uh at the ha uh but they haven't they've continued to Target hospitals they've continued to Target civilian infrastructures we saw the we saw the rafah uh Massacre a few days ago they've continued to Target journalists two El jazer journalists killed uh this week and so in many ways they uh their operation in Gaza has become even more Brazen let let me present to you what I imagine some of the supporters of the Netanyahu Administration will say that they have issued instructions to the Army to to try and organize or prompt an evacuation of people in Rafa are we seeing that as we wake up to news of more strikes on hospitals no we're not seeing that and it's actually an impossibility because there's no safe place uh in Gaza every single uh independent Observer or expert uh especially people who are on the ground will tell you that there is no safe place to go in Gaza and in the past when there were at at least in theory some safe sites or safe zones Israel bombed those safe zones so really there is only one place for uh for uh gazans to go right now and that is outside of Gaza that is into Egypt Aid has been disrupted for about a week is this becoming a battle for survival for those Palestinians bottled up in a tiny part of Gaza oh there's no question I mean the the human rights organizations have been warning of uh Mass starvation now for for a couple of months so uh the situation is is dire uh more and more Palestinians are are dying of entirely preventable diseases related to malnutrition and it's only going to get worse as as this uh you know this crisis continues and just to put this in context we're talking about uh people who have endured Decades of occupation and what international human rights groups in including Israeli Human Rights group b Salam call apartheid right this is not a battle between two equal armies it's actually worse than apartheid I like what um nom Chomsky said when he was asked why don't you use the word apartheid to describe what what's happening to the Palestinians he said the reason I don't use the word aparti is because it's much worse than aparti and Desmond Tutu the former South African Archbishop uh who was obviously an expert in apartheid uh when he was asked this a similar question he said that that what the Palestinians have been enduring uh for decades is worse uh than uh apartheid South Africa so it's worse than apartheid and I think we shouldn't forget the situation in Gaza as has been the case for uh really for uh many many years it's been uh a concentration camp those are the words that have been used by Israeli experts like giora Island a top Israeli security official like uh baroo Kimberling a top Israeli a former uh sociologist at the Hebrew University Gaza is an a concentration camp has been for for for a long time and in that context the Palestinians now are subjected to uh a full-on uh genocide all right thank you so much for your analysis on that
