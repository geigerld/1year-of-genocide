let's bring in Maran bashara who Al Des senior political analyst of course joins us now from London and Maran uh talking of complexities for carela Harris I'd like to look at Gaza through the lens of the Democrat push to retain the presidency in November because there is this need for peace and what would it mean of course for millions of Palestinians but also for the election campaign of carela Harris well it seems that for Kamala Harris The best scenario is ambiguity it seems like this has been the strategy throughout this convention it is not coincident that uh none of the speakers address the question of Gaza not even uh coincidentally uh not even like a by the way kind of thing uh even when AOC spoke She only mentioned about how wonderful Kamala har is trying to bring about a ceasefire and that's was the end of that so when when when political circus like that uh is really managed kog graphed it is done in a way whereby a message has to come through and the message this year it's not that Israel our closest Ally and we support Israel unconditionally nor is it that Israel has done some terrible things in Gaza and we stand with the people of Gaza what we would call constructive ambiguity for the campaign is let's just avoid the subject even if it's the elephant elephant in the room better just keep it that way until the elections if possible this way we don't have to lose the progressives and we don't have to lose the pro zus crowd but is that possible can she remain ambiguous for that degree of time because it's you know it's still quite a long way off and uh you know it could make all the difference if there is any progress on a ceasefire well it's been a month Nick you know so another several weeks yes I mean certainly she would probably address it but in a way again that is ambiguous because let's all remember there is still a president in the White House and this President is staunchly blindly I don't know what else uh you know pro-israel uh basically parting the Israel lines and if you look at the at the convention or at the at the DNC at the at the Democratic party platform this year the one that Biden's people devised they still talk about the indispensable relationship with Israel because you know if you remember Kamal Harris basically inherited uh this DNC from Biden so I think she probably say some general things but leave the foreign policy to the president until November and those General things we've heard from her before there has to be a ceasefire and the humanitarian situation needs to improve for the people in Gaza and she'll probably leave it at that Mo and from what you know how different or otherwise is Cara Harris's position on foreign policy especially in the Middle East when compared to Joe Biden it's going to be quite different I think from Joe Biden but it will be very very different from a trump presidency or from a second Trump presidency you know there are uh there are uh two main National Security advisers for uh Kamal har for the past four years and both of them have wrote books back in 2020 one is called open World by Rebecca fredman and one is called losing the long game uh by Phil Gordon the latter is her National Security advisor and will probably be her future National Security adviser as president and he said basically that America overstretched and basically was foolish in its attempt at regime change in the Middle East in the greater Middle East from Afghanistan to Libya through Syria Iraq Iran and so on so forth over the past 70 years very critical reading of of past American foreign policy re freed in her open world basically America needs to stop being so overstretched it needs to stop with the overreach it needs to stop thinking of itself as some kind of a Messianic force of good or bad for that matter meaning geopolitical Imperial militaristic power it needs to be modest it needs to be pragmatic and it needs to be think thinking of the world as an open world not interventionist and not protectionist either so there's quite a Nuance with with Biden but also quite a nuance with a trump presidence all right marn thanks for that we'll leave it there for Mar Bashar speaking to us from London thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
