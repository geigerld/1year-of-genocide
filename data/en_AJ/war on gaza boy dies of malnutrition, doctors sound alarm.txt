the emaciated body of 5-year-old Muhammad al- Nar he was brought to Kamal adwan Hospital in Northern Gaza suffering from severe malnutrition doctors there couldn't save him he's the latest victim of food shortages caused by Israel's restrictions on a trucks into the strip at another hospital in Northern Gaza health workers say they're seeing many infants every day who are underweight for their age and are appealing for desperately needed supplies especially in intensive care units we received this case about an hour ago a malnutrition case we've become used to receiving cases like this every day this child is generally suffering from malnutrition because of lack of nutrients you can see her age doesn't match her weight doctors visiting Gaza from abroad say they've witnessed catastrophic scenes in hospitals as a result of Israel's bombardment and blockade Tanya Hajj Hassan is a Pediatric Intensive Care doctor from Jordan our team has been doing this for 5 days we're exhausted I can't imagine what thein team who's been here for 162 days doing this 247 162 days without resources is dealing with you asked me whether they had the resources to to deal with these cases no the team has been on a twoe visit to Central Gaza to see firsthand how the ruined Health Care system is coping only around 12 of its hospitals are even partially functioning the rest have run out of fuel and medicine or been damaged by fighting an Israeli raids those left are under intense pressure this hospital has 800 patients but only 160 beds seriously ill and injured people are forced to lie in corridors the few members of Staff left are working around the clock while often coping with their own grief these Medical Teams are working hard most of them have lost their children their wives or their parents but despite this their on with their work this shows the psychological pressure they're facing outbreaks of disease along with malnutrition are compounding the problems facing medics in Gaza increasing numbers of the sick and injured need medical help but these doctors have dwindling resources to treat them Victoria gonb Al jazer Dr Tanya Haj Hassan who's a pediatrician with Medical Aid for Palestinians and she is one of the doctors who was in gasa very recently Dr Tanya very good to have you with us again in Aleria on Aleria joining us from Aman we've spoken uh many times over the last few months uh talk to us about your experience your recent experience in Gaza and the situation in hospitals there was it as bad as you imagined it would be thank you fy um you know I think I think I've said this to you before in an interview this is not a humanitarian crisis uh and there's no humanitarian solution to what's going on right now and I think I'm I'm even more convinced of that now that I've returned uh we we really witness the worst of what humanity is capable of um it's one thing to watch it on television it's still devastating was very hard uh to witness through a screen but to see it in person to see entire lives shattered in an instant in person was was unbearable and you know in the emergency department when we receive a mass casualty I I remember one night having two fathers looking for their dead spouse and dead children um each of them had one daughter that was still alive each of those two daughters were uh critically uh injured burned and we were working on resuscitating them one of those fathers was walking around covered in soot and Rubble uh holding his back he was injured himself self and crying he was barefoot and he kept saying you know uh why what did we do to deserve this you know my children were innocent um yeah one of his daughters was actually a a seconde medical student and she was killed as well the the other father was lying on the ground bleeding injured himself had a a fractured leg and uh his eyes were filled with sand and Rubble so he couldn't open them but you just saw the tears running down the side of his face as he he just prayed over and over again um and I knew for a fact that uh the daughter we were trying to resuscitate was not very wasn't doing well um and he had already known that his wife and and the rest of his children had had been killed and that that was not an uncommon occurrence unfortunately um Dr T tell had children who were the only surv yeah because you went to just just for our viewers to understand you went to one of the few uh hospitals that is still functioning barely functioning in Gaza tell us a bit more about the location where you were and what the conditions were like in the hospital certainly so uh just for context the majority of the hospitals in in the Gaza Strip have been either uh directly targeted and besieged uh or indirectly put out of service through the destruction of Roads uh the bombardment in the very close proximity direct threats uh Al AA hospital is one of those hospitals that had been besieged had been uh targeted the the staff had fled many of the staff had now come back it's functioning again it's a smaller Hospital the two largest hospitals in Gaza are Al shifa Hospital in the north and an NAD Hospital who I'm sure many of you viewers have watched as both of those hospitals have been besieged and targeted uh so smaller hospitals like Al AA Hospital have had to take the role of these larger hospitals and are functioning as large referral facilities which they're not at all equipped to do Al AA hospital is working well above capacity it's packed with patients in the emergency department in the corridors on the stairwells um and it's also filled with internally displaced persons and so it's um a very busy hos relatively small very very busy uh we're caring for some of the sickest patients in the Gaza Strip uh when there's a mass casualty nearby ala hospitals in so we receive a lot of the mass casualties from that from that area from kanun um and when a mass casualty arrives we we don't have the space the human uh or the physical resources to care for the patients so they're they're cared for often on the floor uh with uh resources that are not sterile because we don't have sterile kits and and many of the sterile tools that we need um and they're cared for in a very chotic overwhelmed fashion because there is no mass casualty protocol in the world that is equipped or prepared to deal with this type of of mass casualty that let me ask you briefly because we we were just reporting on on the latest uh child death in Gaza because of malnutrition and and you were there recently talk to us about the children of Gaza right now and and what they're experiencing we've had 30 people die of malnutrition in in recent weeks what what is it like for children what did you see what did the children tell you while you were there yeah um so we spent the full two weeks in the hospital so I I did not make it to the north of Gaza I know the situation is much more dire thereal is just south of Gaza City so it's uh you know more in the central area of Gaza um we had multiple children in the hospital who had lost their entire family um some some of them lost their family while we were physically there and one child whose face had been the side of his face and neck had been blown off he was in the hospital um he he arrived as um one of the casualties in in in one of the mass casualties um and when he arrived his sister was on the stretcher next to him 96% of her body had been burned both of their parents and all of their siblings had been killed and he kept asking for his family while we were uh trying to stop the bleeding and care for him because the the area that had been blown is where a lot of your vital uh vessels are and uh uh he could see his sister in the bed next to him but he didn't know it was his sister because he couldn't recognize her she was so badly disfigured and burnt yeah she ultimately died 2 days later he he uh whispered to me the following day when I went to visit him I have a feeling my whole family has um Gone to Heaven I wish I had died too and gone with them I have nobody left on this Earth that I that uh I love and um obviously a very difficult thing yeah to hear from anybody but certainly a child and this is not an exception there there's a child in the hospital who uh is living in the hospital with a fractured leg and external fixators and um his family were killed uh when they were trying to flee the north he's being cared for by strangers and and he lives in the hospital I don't know what's going to happen to him unimaginable tragedy you know in a week it's it's it's uh just listening to you described there what what you saw and and you know that the stories of these children is is absolutely heartbreaking Dr Tanya thank you as always it's so good to talk to you and and thank you for the work you're doing in Gaza Tanya Haj Hassan a pediatrician with Medical Aid for Palestinians joining us there from Aman thank you very much thank you for having me
