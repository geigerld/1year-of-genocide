hello it's good to have you with us I'm sirel vaner you're watching counting the cost on Alia Zer that's your weekly look at the world of business and economics this week Israeli reservists have left their offices many businesses have ground to a halt Israel's government moves to stabilize its economy hit by the war on Gaza also this week hotels emptied and flights cancelled we look at the cost for the tourism industry in Israel in Palestine and the whole Middle East and the global economy is at a dangerous juncture the World Bank warns of the serious economic impact of geopolitical [Music] tensions known as the nation for startups Israel's almost $500 billion economy is one of the most developed in the Middle East in spite of its decades long conflict with the Palestinians the country has low debt a current account Surplus and high foreign exchange reserves now as Israel's military offensive escalates the war on Gaza is hitting the economy hard and putting its resilience to the test here's how the economy has been affected so far the currency has lost value against the dollar almost every day hitting an 8-year low and bonds tumbled economic sectors such as construction and agriculture are at a standstill a record call up of military reservists has left businesses short staffed the tech industry which accounts for 18% of Israel's GDP and half of all exports is particularly hard hit consumer spending its way down Israelis are spending much less except on food and tax revenues are falling operations at several Israeli ports close to Gaza have been disrupted and production at a major offshore gas field has stopped us oil giant Chevron estimates that the Tamar field provides 70% of Israel's energy needs for power generation and the Bank of Israel says that even if the war remains contained to Gaza economic growth which was forecast to hit 3% this year will slow to 2.3% in 2023 now the central bank has held interest rates at 4 75% for the third straight time in order to support a weakening currency it has previously said that it would sell up to $30 billion of reserves to shore up the shekele the governor says that the bank's policy is focused on stabilizing markets and reducing uncertainty let's talk about all of this I'm joined now from London by Danielle biani Danielle you are associate professor of Finance at Queen Mary University of London thank you for your time today how bad is this for the Israeli economy me uh thanks for having me um just yesterday the Finance Minister uh put up some some estimates of direct cost of the war so far and the estimates are roughly 250 million per day these are just direct costs that are all sorts of indirect cost that come up from from the uh coll up of reservist obviously how bad do you expect it might get because we were just making the point that consumers aren't spending right now except for food consumption on food is up um but consumption is half of the Israeli economy domestic consumption do you think a recession might happen that's a very good point in fact consumption is about a half of the economic activity and it all depends on how long it lasts and what is going to be the repercussions for households and firms uh it's it's complicated to give a precise estimate I'm not expecting a recession but it all depends on how long it lasts what are the major indicators that you're watching well certainly uh labor Supply uh exchange rates uh interest rates all of those things are interl uh provided that the conflict remains uh confined to you know Israel Gaza and doesn't one spread to other regions or to the Israel uh territory uh proper right and that's a big if what's the risk to the shekel the Israeli currency well we've seen as you said a large depreciation of the shekel that basically spells inflation which is one of the reasons why interest rates have kept constant uh is a is is a small open economy Israel so it's it's highly depending how the sheele fluctuates Vis A for instance the US dollar or the Euro so it could be problematic if the uh if the sheer keeps keeps depreciating in in the coming days and weeks and months do you expect that the central bank is going to have to sell more reserves to shore up the currency I wouldn't be surprised again it depends on how long it lasts uh uh so if the if the conflict drags for for months uh hopefully not not years then we should we should probably expect some intervention in terms of selling reserves uh if they if they want to keep uh the exchange rates under control about government intervention Danielle I want to ask you about that the government is rolling out a massive wartime stimulus program to support people and businesses in Israel that includes grants state-backed loans to companies and financial assistance for workers Banks and credit card companies are allowing uh repayment deferrals but all this extra spending is going to increase the budget deficit and ultimately public debt uh three credit rating agencies warned that Israel's creditworthiness could be downgraded okay Danielle back to you perhaps since since we just mentioned that the uh the downgrading of the uh of the of Israel's creditworthiness a standard and pores uh downgraded Israel now the Finance Minister says that's alarmist and he has blown this off um how significant do you think that is should Israel care about that well Israel is in relatively healthy situation when it comes to the depth to GDP ratio which stands as roughly 60% but it's a matter of Outlook it's not necessarily the stock of the debt but how how the finances we we deteriorates coming forward moving forward so again it all depends on how widespread widespread is the conflict and uh uh it's it's hard to say what is going to be the effect on the budget in the short term is significant but in the long term could be even more significant hence the the downgrade of the Outlook from rating agencies and the government stimulus package which by the way is estimated to be bigger more important than what the government had to do during the pandemic to shore up the economy do you think that's enough to mitigate the dangers to the economy well there's certainly a psychological effect on households and firms uh which cut spending there is certainly the uh uh productivity effect due to uh calling up reservice so there is lots of things that are Interlink it's hard to sa the stimulus is enough but obviously they have to do something to kind of calm down uh uh come down households and firms and markets but it's hard to safe is going to be enough again it all depends on how uh wi spread the conflict will be uh if any in in the coming months hopefully hopefully not talk to us about the scenarios for Israel's economy um Israel has said that there is no limit to how much it is going to spend you know on its war effort but what does that mean obviously obviously the answers are going to differ on how long this all lasts absolutely uh well I mean there is always a limit on how much you could spend uh and as I said uh God forbid but suppose that the conflict widespread to the rest of the Israeli territory then there's going to be effect on infrastructure people playing you know there's going to be several effects several layers of effect depending on how bad the situation will evolve uh as I said hopefully not but it's hard to say uh if the stimulus will be enough it all depends on the trajectory that is going to take the conflict if it remains like circumscript to the to the Israel Gaza uh setting then it might it might be enough but it's hard to say at the moment and and what if it doesn't remain in Gaza uh as you just as you just said what if the war escalates to other parts of the Middle East then what well we've been we've been these things throughout the history if you look back at the 70s uh there's been huge supply shock in terms of oil and that creates inflation uh Israel inflation back in the 70s was like you know above 100% uh so certainly if the conflict widespread to major oil suppliers such as Iran for instance uh that could be really problematic not just for Israel but in fact the global economy at large all right Daniel bian associate professor of Finance at Queen Mary University of London thank you so much for joining us today now at this stage we do want to note that the economic situation for Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank is much worse Gaza is running out of food water medicine and fuel due to a total blockade by Israel hospitals are struggling to keep generators running and power life-saving medical equipment small Aid convoys have started delivering supplies from Egypt excluding fuel but the un's relief agency is calling for a massive increase in assistance to Gaza Israel's military offensive has destroyed entire neighborhoods in the enclave and displaced around half of Gaza more than 2 million Palestinians to know more about this do watch our previous edition of counting the cost where we detailed the crippling cost of the war for Gaza and its residence earlier this month landmarks in Jerusalem and Bethlehem as well as beaches in Tel Aviv were bustling with tourists so was the UNESCO heritage site in Jericho a city in the occupied West Bank but ever since the fighting between Israel and Hamas started governments scrambled to get their citizens back home and issued Travel warnings to the affected areas new visitors are now reconsidering their plans here's a Roundup on tourism and how that's affecting the region many companies have canceled tours to Israel and the Palestinian territories until the end of the year cruise ship ship avoided Israel's Shores and major airlines have stopped flying to and from Israel hotels across Israel have either shut down or their housing Israelis who left their homes near the Gaza Strip while those in the occupied West Bank suffered from a sharp drop in occupancy rates many historic sites national parks nature reserves restaurants are closed and Aviation experts warn that the war on Gaza could affect travel in other Middle Eastern countries including Egypt and Jordan Swiss International National Airlines and Germany's Lanza have already suspended flights to Lebanon meanwhile lebanon's national airline has reduced its flights by half as tensions along the border with Israel intensify the iranian-backed Hezbollah armed group has exchanged fire with the Israeli Army since the war on Gaza started the Middle East Airlines decision came after insurance companies reduced the war risk coverage okay I am joined now uh in our studio here in Doha by Alex macheras Alex you're an aviation analyst and you're a consultant let's start there with this issue of insurance because you were just explaining to me moments ago that you know that that's the top of the pyramid and everything trickles down from there exactly so what we're seeing is just like when conflict pops up anywhere on the earth Aviation insurers tend to call the shots so they are currently forbidding most Airlines from operating either to Israel Egypt Jordan and Syria but also to other parts of the region in light of the escalations and in what is in what is happening when airlines are in a position that they are ultimately unable to go to those destinations because there will be no insurance cover what we then see is mass Exodus of the carriers and we saw this with Afghanistan we saw it with Sudan we saw it in Ukraine and we are seeing it now the airlines are simply in a position where even if they were able to determine and outline their own risks and make their own assessments as to how long they would be on the ground perhaps they would go with the same crew there and back if there is no insurance cover that's a journey they cannot make how big do you think the damage could be to tour to Israel's tourism industry and then I'll ask you the same question to the tourism industry in the occupied West Bank but let's start with Israel sure so of course Israel relies heavily on tourism much like most areas of that region and travel is plummeting we have new stats released overnight that show that on the whole the entire region is suffering when you zoom into that region you have countries that are not specifically at the heart of the escalation Nations like Jordan for example and Lebanon Lebanon seeing a 70% fall in travel demand over this period Jordan 50% and these are typically areas across including with Tel Aviv and other key destinations that in Winter they would specifically benefit from those higher tourism numbers because they benefit from the warmer weather that they can offer to Europeans and other Travelers what about the arupa West Bank it's the same the same dire situation ultimately the Middle East and this particular area of the Middle East is now suffering in that fall in demand as a whole these areas rely on air travel to bring in tourists to bring in those that are visiting friends and relatives and so on and without air travel as as we just mentioned with the insurance being pull it's going to have a KnockOn effect immediately and that's what we're seeing now there is no stakeholder in the whole travel ecosystem that is able to have confidence in what is going on and Aviation is inherently exposed to just about everything but this level of uncertainty is just too much for for business as usual how quickly can things pick up because right now we have a tendency to be prisoners of the moment and right now you know our viewers will everybody can intuitively understand why flights are down airports are shut people are obviously not going on the holiday to destinations that are in or near a war zone how quickly could it pick back up how lasting could the damage be well the the unfortunate part is that and we see this with other areas of conflict uh around the world it takes a while we really have to have a period of stability that continues on for for much longer than perhaps people imagine before that confidence resumes when you have Airlines for example Global carriers that passengers are booked with to then be passed on to hotels already stating that they will not be operating to the region for a minimum of 6 months we know that unfortunately this part of turbulence for this area of the Middle East in terms of the financial stability for travel and Aviation is here for the the mid to Long Haul Alex beeres thank you very much for all all that Insight thank you the war on Gaza is not just threatening the areas where it is unfolding rich countries and the international monetary fund and the World Bank warned that a prolonged War could compound The Fallout from the war in Ukraine and there are real risks to the global economy the Middle East is an important energy supplier plus a vital shipping route for goods among the major concerns is oil prices which are sensitive to geopolitical tensions now look at the oil prices the price of the global Benchmark that is Brent crude oil Rose above $90 a barrel in the past two weeks it has eased somewhat since then after a diplomatic push to contain the War uh price the price hit more than $120 a barrel in March last year after Russia's invasion of Ukraine it fell back down to just above $70 a barrel in May but then Rose steadily because major producers cut out output at the time observers say that if other countries like Iran for instance are directly involved in the war then that could drive up the price of oil to $150 a barrel joining us from Brussels is hosuk Lee makiyama you're the director of the European Center for international political economy thank you for joining us talk to us about the volatility here because we just don't really know where this is going in terms of oil prices and oil supplies well indeed um the truth is um you are really pointing to the um the real issue here which is actually about the oil prices rather than the the impact of the conflict itself because Israel is actually a very remote part of the global and even the regional economy and so they actually the first order implication of the war is quite muted and it is very easy to draw recollection on the 1973 war that quadruple the oil price crisis we still have the Ukraine crisis fresh in mind but so far there is no embargo that we saw in 1973 and the fact is that the political incentives for OPEC looks very very different now than it did back 50 years ago so what we have seen is basically Energy prices have not really soared with relatively modest increases about 5% since the conflict began and actually the bigger driver on um the prices actually uh seem to be the poor economic Outlook in Europe with suppressed demand for oil so um so far so good so far so good but what are the scenarios that you're looking at what are the possible realistic scenarios the realistic scenarios as uh are tend to be quite unrealistic when it comes to this region and uh or at least quite surreal and you would look at uh implications that involve for example a major producer like Iran and in order to see those effects that we have been we have been heard in the introduction around increase up to 150 or $250 and even under these circumstances we have to remember actually that the the impact on global macro will be much less on the on the Today Than in the 1970s simply is because of the fact that the global dependency of oil has actually haved in the last 50 years and also the um the the cartel OPC and OPEC plus is actually quite split in terms of how you are responding to this crisis and if you for example look at Qatar that has t really taken up and open up the Taps since the The War Began in Ukraine and and now we are also hearing from the United States that it might actually open up its strategic reserves so diversification over the last five decades seem to have actually done a little bit of the trick at least and we are looking at a very difference scenario if we are looking at potentially Lebanon and even Iran getting involved and uh there are a lot of conversations going on bilaterally uh between the different parties that don't seem very United at the moment okay H hosac hold on because I need to give our viewers a quick reminder of why we talk about the oil prices so much why are they so important because when the price of oil goes up the cost of almost everything transport consumer goods food not to mention energy bills the price of all those things goes up for the past 18 months central banks have been trying to rein in inflation and keep prices contained at the US Federal Reserve has been leading that effort and in its latest report on financial stability the FED said escalation of these conflicts or a worsening in other geopolitical tensions could reduce economic activity and boost inflation worldwide uh particularly in the event of prolonged disruptions to supply chains and interruptions in production ruction the US fed has recently paused interest rate hikes as inflation was showing signs of cooling major central banks are worried that high rates could significantly slow economic activity and tip economies into a recession the IMF warned of weak Global growth at 3% in 2023 and slightly less in 2024 that is well below the historical average and the World Trade Organization says that a widening War would have a big impact on fragile global commercial flows hosac back to you there's a massive question here around inflation Global prices cost of living you know it's something we've been covering a lot of course cost of living which which rose sharply uh after the war in Ukraine started and a lot of our viewers will be listening to this conversation and thinking well could we see something like that happen again as a as a ripple effect of the Gaza War well that's that's my point the um the importance of oil has as as a part of the global energy supply has actually haved and given the diversity of other sources that has come up since the 1970s uh yes indeed we are already in a recession uh but if we start in the end of trade Israel is actually quite remote part of the global economic system and there are quite few supply chain well there are only few supply chain dependencies we are looking at when it comes to Israel and um for example things like diamond there are some semiconductors in Israel as well but that's Mo mostly in design rather than fabrication so the supply chain effect is actually quite limited and this comes back to the point that unless you see a regionalization of this conflict with other players getting involved this is economically a containable problem we don't have a dependency for example for food production that we had for example in the case of Ukraine that supplied a lot of the world food program who also major exporter of grains and iron ore and uh and therefore uh we are exclusively looking at disruption on supplies of um uh oil first and foremost and here I come back to the point that OPEC has been actually trying to unilaterally suppress production and had an agreement to actually reduce the production up to 1 million Barrel per year per day um and simply because of the fact that we um the price is actually not increasing in the amount that it would like to be and I remind also the viewers that op in in the op constellation there's also an configuration that involes more players for example like Russia uh which is called opic plus who has been rather unsatisfied with the price um the the global prices uh over the last 12 months and who has actually agreed to unilaterally suppress uh suppress production already in the summer so what we are seeing now is actually relatively minor Corrections or movements in the prices it is indeed true that the 2024 is going to be a very very difficult year and not least given the US elections coming up and we have we have a uh let's say sensitivity around increasing prices but so far especially compared to the Ukraine crisis this has been something that can be kept on track and hasn't actually spilled over to the other parts of the regions and how much does all of that analysis change if then the conflict does escalate well then we are looking at a completely different game alt together of course and that's um that's um that's something that I guess that a lot of people are looking into whether hisbah actually have an incentive to get involved and if they do uh does Iran actually have the incentive to continue support to the extent that it would actually tamper with the oil and now I remind everyone that Iran and the US are in the midst of negotiation for releasing hostages against Frozen funds that Iran has in South Korea and as a former government negotiator myself I mean I I tend to think that to keep talking about some kind of a trade of like hostages on funds has the best deescalation effect uh on any kind of War and the fact that people are actually negotiating bilaterally on um even in a completely unrelated areas makes a completely different image and sorry a completely different picture in ter of what we looking to and one final Point here that we need to look at one of the biggest bu is actually China and that basically means that a lot of these flows may actually continue even in the case that there would be an embargo against the West so there is a price stabilization effect if the trade between the gulf and China actually continues to happen hosok Le makama director of the European Center for international political economy thank you so much for joining us on the program today thank you and that is our show
