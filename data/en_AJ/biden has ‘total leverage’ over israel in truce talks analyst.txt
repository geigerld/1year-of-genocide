well diplomatic efforts to reach a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas are ramping up Hamas delegations in Cairo to meet with mediators from Egypt and Qatar the CIA director William Burns is also there the Israelis are yet to send their delegation and it's not clear when that will happen sticking points remain as Hamas demands Israel end the war in Gaza permanently and that's something prime minister Benyamin netanyahu's government is refusing to do in Ramy kurri he's a distinguished public policy fellow at the American University of Beirut he joined has live from Boston Ramy always good to have you with us so look I mean there's still some cautious optimism that a ceasefire deal can be reached in Cairo but we've been down this road before haven't we so how far apart are both sides do you think well they're still uh far apart but but less far apart than they were a week or two ago there clearly there's movement you know one signal that you can always assume means something is going on and know when Bill Burns the CIA director joins the talks it means that there's something serious is happening the U the the reports you just had from your correspondents um clearly indicate that everybody is under pressure the Israelis the um Hamas the Americans are under intense pressure here the American government with all these student uprisings so people really everybody wants a deal but nobody wants to make a deal where he has to make more concessions than the other person and and that's an interesting point you make Ramy let's just talk about Hamas is position because earlier a spokesman for Hamas said you know the group needs a guarantee from the US that Israeli forces won't launch an offensive on Rafa and that Hamas won't agree to a truce that doesn't end the war but let me ask you Ramy I mean will Hamas need to therefore as you say concede on what it sees as its red line to move this deal forward everybody will concede a little bit if they get what they really want everybody in every negotiation has ever happened in the world uh if somebody doesn't totally defeat the other side and they start negotiating they're going to make uh some mutual concessions the U the problem that Hamas has is that it it's not clear what public opinion like in uh is like in Gaza now after all the tremendous suffering that the people have H have experienced and this is we can't tell because public opinion polling is is not so easy to do and a lot of people are scared to speak openly okay um in a so so so let's just talk about the Israelis and I mean they haven't even sent a delegation to Cairo yet and and they've insisted that Deal or No Deal the raffer offensive will go ahead but with domestic and US pressure mounting on Netanyahu how much wiggle room does he actually have briefly he has a little he always has a little bit of wiggle room and he tries to expand that by sending different messages to different audiences one of the problems in a situation like this is that whatever whatever anybody says it could be factual it could be wishful thinking it could be for domestic political advantage and it could be to hold off Foreign pressures so uh probably about 30 40% of what people say like officials Israeli or American or Hamas is probably totally accurate Hamas doesn't say much in public because they're um very concerned about giving away information but so yeah he he does he he's in is in great stress nyaho and and it's increasing Grammy just a final thought to you on the US position I mean the Biden Administration as you said is facing mounting political pressure particularly at home plus it's an election year in the US so what real leverage does Biden have over Israel to move this deal forward on paper Biden has total leverage if he wants to uh exercise and we've seen this in the past I mean you know going way back in the past when Bean was attacking Lebanon and and and the president of the US got him out and when uh the the the S operation 1956 Eisenhower called the Israelis and they got out so yeah they have total leverage because Israel can't do anything militarily without the United States uh and without the protection of the US diplomatic but the US the president is hesitant to use that power what we've seen from the US is a lot of verbal uh pressuring and and threatening and cooling without carrying through for instance blinkin made 75 trips whatever Seven Trips I think to uh increase humanitarian Aid to Gaza saying the Israelis have promised to do it and it's increased maybe 10% or 15% it's it's nominal all right Ramy Curry always good to get your thoughts and Analysis Ramy thank you very much indeed for talking to us make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
