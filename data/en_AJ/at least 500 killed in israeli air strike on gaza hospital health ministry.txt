lines of people trying to buy bread and sometimes people wait for at least six hours to buy a packet of of of of bread uh water is is is has become a scarce thing here in in in the south of Gava it's it's sorry to interrupt you m sorry to interrupt you m I apologize um I really do hope that you and your family stay safe I do want to bring in now what we're hearing is is a Gaza civil defense spokesperson speaking um through translation let's let's hear what he has to say a massacre it is a pogram this is genocide it is really Indescribable painful scene this is unprecedented throughout the history of the Israel Palestinian conflict conflict this is nothing of pgam men women and children with their heads totally severed where are the Arab people where are the Muslim people may God punish you all where are you why are you speaking of the medical Crews they left the victims now they are trying to put out fire they are trying to enter the building to save whatever medical supplies left at the same time they are searching for survivors or other victims the entire compound has turned into Flames scenes are horrible horrifying it is Indescribable heartwrenching painful scenes I cannot put this to well if you're just joining us let's remind you what you are watching you are watching live pictures now from a hospital the Ali Arab Hospital in central Gaza where it has been confirmed by the Gaza Health Ministry the death toll in the aftermath of an Israeli what's believed to be an Israeli air strike that caused a blast at that hospital more than 500 people are now dead this is the aftermath of what's believed to be an Israeli air strike on the Ali Arab hospital and the Gaza Health Ministry it says at least 500 people have been killed but we can now Peter Hassan kalaf he is the medical director of the alwafa hospital in Gaza he's also a former deputy Health Minister Hassan thank you so much for joining us on Al jazer I understand that your hospital is is not very far away from the Ali Arab hospital about a kilometer away can you tell us what you've been seeing and hearing one km 1 km hour and um you know I send my ambulances ambulance team to help you know evacuating and helping the people there um just to remind you and your audiences that this this is what we call the Post hospital letan hospital aging 100 years and you know we consider it places in Gaza so this to be no bombarded intentially and hitting hitting mean rocket and you know gets to the to to bombard hospital and kill these two or 300s of people and you know injured hundreds of people who are staying in the hospital this is a war crime which is unbelievable you know you know still the hospital is still burning and we don't know what Madness is that Hassan just to be clear for our viewers is it your understanding that any kind of warning was given any kind of evacuation order was given to either that hospital or your hospital given that you in in such a close vicinity did anyone receive any warning that a strike was going to happen well I'm not aware of there is warning but but this warning is not not not accepted completely you know we are in a small town where to go and how to evacuate hospitals and where to evacuate hospitals so the the biggest Hospital in Gaza you know is a shifa and there is no place to and shifa and other hospitals they are we are full with victim and full with injures when injured people so to say no warning this is not this is you know mindless World know in Gaza where to go Gaza is very heavy population and very small town so and you know the the the number of injured people and killed people now thousands and thousands where to go and you know well just you been warning why warning was there you know Alan people there no absolutely no so they are hitting the the civilians intentionally they want to do massacr and massacr and massacres in Gaza Hassan kalaf there the medical that's just about a away from the hospital that we've been showing you pictures of Hassan thank you so much for joining us on out and we wish you really all the best to you and your staff on this very difficult night
