well on Tuesday night Israeli forces carried out strikes on the southern city of Rafa where more than 1.5 million displaced Palestinians have sought short sought shelter the Army targeted a residential building killing at least eight people another 12 were injured in central Gaza an air strike air strike targeted the crowded Al narat refugee camp killing at least 12 Palestinians children are amongst those dead people were left to dig through the rubble with their bare hands to try to find survivors and the wounded were taken to nearby hospitals which are already overwhelmed with patients and running out of basic medical supplies only a handful of health facilities are still functioning in Gaza and only barely let's bring in Hanny mwood he's live for us now in Rafa in southern Gaza so hany yet more deadly strikes on the residents of Gaza tell us about what happened overnight that yes almost a few hours after un Security Council calling for a seized fire failed to pass the Israeli military intensified its aial attacks and ground Invasion across the central area and the southern part of the Gaza Strip in the Central Area more residential homes being targeted and more public facilities completely destroyed or severely damaged in the overcrowded n refugee camp in the city of Dar that's very close to the only remaining operational Hospital in the central area but so far we're looking at large number of people have been killed and other numbers of injuries who rushed to the hospital and already overwhelmed exhausted Health Facilities unable to treat this large numbers of injuries in khun is particularly the western part of the city Al maasi evacuation Zone it's important to point out our viewer that this particular area was designated and described larg by the Israeli milit for people to evacuate to because it is safe it came under heavy bombardment almost 30 tanks supported by bulldozer and heavy aial coveraged by attack drones and taken over the coastal Road ordering people to evacuate it from it one more time targeting an area that is used by an international organization Doctors Without Borders causing further civilian casualties and level of Destruction in ra a residential home was targeted we're looking at five members of One family were killed inside the residential home in a massive air strikes in overnight and hany the world food program has paused deliveries of food give us an idea of the impact that that has is having on already desperate people especially in the north of Gaza gu will the suspension came right after assessment made on the ground so far the ongoing bombings and the conditions created on the ground just just happened very difficult or made it very difficult for international organization including the United Nations different agencies to deliver Aid uh to the northern part that there is an actual famine going on people are desperate for food for basic necessities uh if we look at the numbers of of trucks that been allowed to the northern part just less than a trickle amount have delivered just within the past two days there was a video circulating on the internet showing how people were surrounding a truck filled with the flowers bag of flowers and just thousand of people literally thousand of people reaching to get a bag of flowers so they could sustain themselves the situations in the northern part of very desperate very dire condition we're talking about 600,000 people at the risk of losing their life at the risk because of famine and because of the ongoing starvation that is used by the Israeli military as a weapon to kill more people so people are not only dying of the ongoing unpredictable bombs and the ground Vision but now there's a risk of dying because of the ongoing famine that is caused by this war yes and hone as you're speaking there we're watching pictures of people scooping flour out of the mud from burst bags and putting it in their pockets or anything they can carry to take it home hany mmud brings the latest there in Gaza thank you well let's turn now to the occupied West Bank where an Israeli raid on the Janine refugee camp has killed at least one Palestinian soldiers set fire to a car as they withdrew in the early hours of Wednesday Israeli forces also stormed ascar refugee camp in the city of nablas and raided towns near tubas and CIA Israel has increased the frequency and intensity of its raids since October the 7th Z mravi joins us now from nablas in the occupied West Bank Z tell us about these latest raids there overnight well we've seen yet again another night of raids across the occupied West Bank but what we saw in Janine specifically is different far more intense than raids we've seen in recent memory in these occupied territories Israeli Special Forces conducting an 8 to n-h hour operation throughout the night to get to one man a Palestinian a young Palestinian resistance fighter named Arif kadum a man in his 20s suspected to have been behind the death of an Israeli soldier near Nablus uh last year in September now the Israeli forces used uh air strikes they had dozens of men armored vehicles on the ground to go after one house to go after this one individual unconfirmed reports of Israeli injuries really the intensity of this night time raid specifically the one last night in Janine really does illustrate how much of a threat Israel's government Israel's military sees these young armed Fighters people they consider terrorists but in their communities these young men who see picking up arms as the only solution to the ongoing occupation resistance armed resistance the only solution to the Daily problems of Israeli oppression that they face to the for for their communities these men are considered not terrorists as the Israeli government would label them but as Leaders as Community organizers as true Freedom Fighters and simply seeing the int it with which Israel carried out this campaign we we we notice how much of a threat they represent but when we go into these camps and we've spoken to the people there some of them who live in some of the worst circumstances uh some of the worst humanitarian conditions the ongoing rhetoric of defiance that comes from these people would suggest that it will be far easier for the Israeli government for the military to kill the man than it will be to kill the idea of resistance and zan with these raids happening daily in different parts across the occupied West Bank how are people managing to cope with this continual disruption to their lives you're exactly right continued disruption and it's not just in Janine we've seen it all over the occupied West Bank we were just in tarim just a few days ago and there was another raid that killed yet another armed fighter a man in his 30s we spoke to people there and in tarim so far this year refugee camps in the city of tilam not far from us here in nablas just about a 20-minute Drive way the Israeli military in these raids has destroyed more houses and buildings so far this year in tulam than anywhere else in the occupied West Bank Palestinians living there describe the government the military raids there routinely turning their streets into veritable War zones and they worry they know that what's happening in Gaza is far worse but they feel they're getting a taste of it here in the occupied West Bank and they worry that it could get worse in the coming future one of the patterns of Israel's decades long occupation a core component of psychological warfare being waged against Palestinians
