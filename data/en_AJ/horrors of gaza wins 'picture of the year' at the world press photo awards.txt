the Netherlands based World Press photo competition has announced its winners for the best visual journalism of the past year the winners captured some of the most powerful snapshots photographer lanai's story Val Baba one for Story of the Year her portraits show people with dementia and the family members who care for them in Madagascar where the disease is little public awareness Alejandro seara documented migrants at the northern border of Mexico for six years Julia cova's photographs of ukrainians living through two years of war with Russia won the open format award but it was the work of reuter's photojournalist in Gaza Muhammad Salam which was awarded photo of the Year His Image taken just 10 days into Israel's war on Gaza shows a woman named inas Abu mamar cradling the body of her niece Sally the little girl was killed by an Israeli missile attack on her home in Khan J zi is executive director at the World Press photo Foundation she says photojournalism is a vital part of documenting conflicts around the world good to have you with us every conflict usually has an iconic photo is it fair to say though that in this conflict in Gaza we've seen more iconic photos than usual I don't know if you can say that we've seen more iconic photos than usual ual but um we definitely have seen a lot of photos and a lot of photos I think what is different is that we've seen a lot of photos coming from Palestinian photographers especially from photographers who are from Kazu and I think that is what makes them different this time because of course there has been so much pressure on um on press to be able to go and have access to Gaza and that is why these images are so important today to be shown and to be to be shown all over the world and related to that those who do have access Palestinian journalists in particular they're paying an unprecedented price in this conflict for us just to see these pictures right yes I mean um there has been 97 as of yesterday there have been 97 journalists who have been killed in only this Gaza Israel uh War more than there has ever been in any other War actually at this point and of course most of them are Palestinians and they don't only pay with their lives but they also pay with their health and their mental health and uh it is really really devastating there is pressure on press Freedom all over the world but r at this point is really a big case study of this pressure that exists around the world on press Freedom can they take comfort in the thought that it hasn't been in vain have the photos and the videos been the key one of the key elements if not the key element that has really shaped public opinion more than ever in this Gaza in this round of Gaza conflict absolutely today photojournalists especially photojournalists really act as witnesses to what is happening around the world especially and in Gaza specifically today and when when I spoke to Muhammad salm telling him that he had one worldpress photo he told me that you know it was totally schizophrenic uh experience because he was of course you know we needed to find a place where he had internet he was in a shelter um he was in ra at that point in time he hadn't eaten in a couple of days and um and he was like I just go out and I'm in a war zone and here I am you know with having my dream come true which is to become the photo of the year of worldpress photo but um he was very humbled by the fact that his image was going to be able to be seen by billions of people around the world and that is the essence of the work that we do at worldpress photo is to be able to give a new leg to give a new life and increase that visibility to as many people as possible in order to be able to bring discussions to be able to bring some kind of solution and especially to be able to bring empathy and I think that is what's so special about this photo of the world this year uh of the World Press photo is that it is not you know a violent image it isn't a violent in the sense that there's blood it's a very um individual image it's a very zoomed in image on this one woman with her niece um whose faces you can't even see but with whom you relate immediately on an emotional level too and so it's not only today it's G but it's not only G this is the human impact and the human suffering that happens on Wars and conflicts around the world you know the advert of Television radio may have taken or raised some question about the future of still photography or its impact in power has social media revived some of that power now well in a way I guess it has but in a different way in another way I think that today you react to images in a very different way than the way that you used to today I was reading someplace other day that um on social media people just spent not even a second three qus of a second looking at an image and you know even less time reacting to it so basically this immediate immediacy this urgency of people to feel to react Etc um kind of work in polarizing U people don't about this and uh so it it it has a double it has a double s all right thank you so much for your thoughts on this thank you
