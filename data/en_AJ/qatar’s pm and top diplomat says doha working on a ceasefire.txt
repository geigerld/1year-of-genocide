okay let's go to Doha now where the qari Prime Minister and US Secretary of State are speaking let's listen in Anthony blink the US Secretary of State I welcome you here in Doha we meet today within critical circumstances with the escalation in the occupied Israeli Palestinian territories and in Israel we had conversation in this regard and we discussed the political humanitarian complications of this situation we have reiterated K situation regarding hitting and targeting the civilians women and children and the collective punishment that is not acceptable under any circumstances and these condemnation must be go must go to anyone who is involved in these matters we need to work hard in order to reach a sort of a c fire in order to stop the Bloodshed and to avoid a circle of violence that the people of the region will pay the price High the priorities of Q within the Diplomatic approach is to seek a seized fire protect the civilians release the captives and to work hard in order not to spread violence in the region because this will have bad consequences we also exchange our viewpoints regarding humanitarian corridors to keep the uh assistances and Aid reaching the Palestinians particularly within the deterioration of the situation in Gaza Strip it is a disaster what we can see in in Gaza Strip and shortage of basic needs no electricity because of the bombardment and we all understand that the situation is very tough and we all have to exert all possible efforts with our alliance and partners particularly the United States of America in order to calm the situation and to not to uh uh increase the more casualties within civilians the only way to reach a peaceful solution is to open all contact Channels with all partners and concerned Partners through cooperation we appreciate the Regional International efforts being made to deescalate the situation Q deeply believes that mediation dialogue are very important and this is part of our foreign policy and K has made a lot of successes through dialogue with other parties and qat is now having uh a great position as a partner in achieving and bringing peace qat is committed to be a partner in the peace process in making peace and we need not anything that will hit the good reputation of qat through other parties we confirm that the lack of a last and fair solution will have bad consequences and the International Community must press towards the fair solution of the Palestinian cause within the Arab initiative that insisted on a Palestinian State on the borders of 1967 with East Jerusalem as the capital of the state and the Palestinian must get their legitimate right we look forward to working more and more with our partners with the Us and other partners in order to discal the situation in the Palestinian territories and in Israel for the peace and Security in the region and peace be upon you well good evening um let me start by expressing my gratitude to the Amir and to the Prime Minister my friend Muhammad for uh as always very productive discussions uh cutter has been a very close partner to the United States on broad range of issues that are crucial to both of our countries and to this region from working together on evacuating Americans Afghans and others from Afghanistan to cooperating very closely uh in responding to humanitarian emergencies like the devastating earthquakes in Tura and in Syria um we're meeting today at what is a difficult but also consequential time for the region in the wake of hamas's appalling attack killed more than 1300 Israelis at least 27 American citizens and people from more than 30 countries United States and cter share the goal of preventing this conflict from spreading uh we discussed in detail our efforts to prevent any active state or non-state we're creating a new front uh in this conflict we're also working intensively together to secure the release of hostages including American citizens being held by Hamas and Gaza I'm grateful for the urgency that cter is bringing to this effort I had an opportunity to meet yesterday with the families of some of those being held hostage by Havas their anguish is profound they're desperate to bring their loved ones home and we are working urgently on that effort we're doing that with cutter and we're doing that with allies and partners across the region as Israel continues to respond to hamas's devastating attacks the United States will ensure that it has what it needs to defend its people Secretary of Defense Austin was in Israel today doing just that working closely with the Israelis to make sure that we're providing them what they need and we'll be able to do that on an ongoing basis at the same time we're in constant communication with Israeli officials and with multilateral International organizations humanitarian organizations including the United Nations agencies including the icrc to get Aid to civilians in Gaza as I said yesterday in Tel Aviv Israel has the right indeed it has the obligation to defend its people and to try to ensure that Hamas can never repeat what it's done we continue to discuss with Israel the importance of taking every possible precaution to avoid harming civilian we recognize that many Palestinian families in Gaza are suffering through no fault of their own and the Palestinian civilians have lost their lives we mourn the loss of every innocent life Israeli Palestinian Jew Christian Muslim as well as civilians of every faith and every nationality who've been killed let's not lose sight of why this is happening Israel is conducting operations in Gaza because AAS carried out terrorist attacks that killed in the most horrific ways 1300 of its people a m terrorist slaughtered raped mutilated tortured burned innocent civilians from babies to the elderly men women boys and girls now efforts to get humanitarian Aid into Gaza are complicated ated by the fact thatas continues to use innocent civilians as human Shields and is reportedly blocking roads to prevent Palestinians from moving to Southern Gaza out of Harm's Way we know the humanitarian situation is urgent we're actively engaged with Partners including cutter to get Aid to those who need it your Excellency thank you again for today's very very good discussions and for all the work that our countries have done together thank you a question from the journalist first question to the K prime minister media reports talk about an agreement that has been agreed to freeze around six billion dollars run here in Qatar a question to Mr blink have you heard you and the American Administration that the numbers of casualties in Gaza are more than 1,500 third of these casualties and victims are children according to reports and according to the UNICEF my question is clear to you what will the United States do being uh a democracy advocate in the world what will you do in order not to kill another child in Gaza regarding the media reports about freezing Iranian funds in qat the state of qat is always committed to any agreement and uh every steps must be done through consultations with other partners the fund the money here in not be used unless all the conditions of the agreement are fulfilled and we should focus on our prior Focus to redu T the priorities ofal and put an end to the current war waged against our brothers in Gaza and reach not to do anything that will escalate the situation in the region thank you for the question few things as I said uh just a moment ago I'll repeat it Israel has both the right and even the obligation to defend his people and to do everything it can to ensure that what happened last Saturday never happens again uh same time the way Israel does this matters uh the way any democracy deal with such a situation matters and to that end we discussed with the Israelis urge the Israelis to use every possible precaution to avoid armed civilians um it's also important to remember the fundamental issue that makes this so complicated as I said again a moment ago Hamas uses civilians as human Shields it puts them in places where they will be in danger puts them in places where they're used in effect to try to protect uh Hamas officials or their equipment or infrastructure civilians of course should not be the target of military operations they are not the target of Israeli operations they are very deliberately the target of hamasa action um I mentioned as well that we're very actively engaged with un relief agencies with the icrc with others to address the acute humanitarian needs of people in Gaza to protect them from harm uh and uh make sure that they have uh the ability uh to get what they need uh we need to ensure for example that there are safe areas in Gaza uh for civilians we're working through the details on that uh and uh more to be said in the days ahead but that's a priority for us uh we're discussing this with the Israeli government we're discussing it with others in the region the question is related to the core of the contacts recent contacts since the crisis in Gaza we have seen that qat is doing well in this regard contacted so many countries Iran the United States Jordan France and other countries what is the core of the recent contacts and what are these context based crisis His Highness the Amir of qat made a lot of contacts and I also had contacts with some of my counterparts we need to listen the escalation and we need to stop this war and we need to find the corridors for the aid and assistances to reach uh Gaza and uh to see the uh cause of the civilian captives we work with our partners and we hope they will go back to their families the contact and consultations of Qatar are based on finding solution to this crisis and not to escalate the crisis and not to spread the conflicts and not to find other fronts being involved the priorities are to stop the war and to deliver the assistances and Aid to the needy people and the captives to be returned to their Reuters um she Muhammad given the condemnation from the world on Hamas attack is Qatar considering shutting down Hamas Bureau are you prepared to ask the leadership to leave if your Western allies demand you to do so and Mr secretary have you asked Qatar to shut down the Hamas office and if I may Mr secretary yesterday and just now you said Israel has a right to defend itself but you added that how it does that mattered and you talked about a standard that democracies should strive for even when it's difficult to do so today Israel ordered residents of Gaza City to leave and move South something un Palestinian Envoy just called the crime against humanity um we the translation wasn't great so the gentleman before me might have asked something similar but let me push you a little bit more on this how does that square how does that order square with that standard you mentioned and also international law does the United States support this relocation and since you had a conversation with prime minister Netanyahu did you give your blessing for this move thank [Applause] you it's uh thank you please well uh regarding your question about Hamas political office uh in do right now uh actually this office since it's started it's being used as a way of communicating and communicating and bringing peace and calm to the region uh uh not to instigate anymore and this is the purpose of of that office as long as we are keeping the communication open right now and focusing on putting an end for this conflict and this is useful that's that will remain our main focus uh these days uh uh actually uh now our key uh our key Focus for us in the state of qar and I believe the United States sharing with us this objective is how to put an end for this conflict how to deescalate how to create a humanitarian Corridor and how uh get the hostes back safe Amara first U the first part of your question uh let me start by saying and I mentioned this before but I want to repeat it um I really thank cutter for the work that they're doing to try to help secure the release of uh poses um this is something that we deeply appreciate I know that other countries do as well and it's something that we're actively pursuing um I've also been making a clear in all of my conversations uh throughout this trip that there can be no more business as usual with a moss murdering babies burning families to death taking little children as hostages these are unconscionable acts of brutality every country in our judgment needs to condemn these actions needs to hold them accountable and we will continue to make that clear when it comes to providing for civilians in uh in Gaza both um ensuring that they can be out of Harm's Way and that they can have access to the uh support that they need the humanitarian assistance the food the medicine the water our Focus now is on helping to create safe zones and we're doing that with the uh leading international organizations we're doing that uh engaged with Israel and we're working with other countries to the to that end so that's where our focus is we think this is the best way to make sure that um civilians who are caught in a crossfire of Hamas is making can be um safe and receive the assistance they need Bloomberg Mr secretary I know the situation in Israel is highly charged and very fluid but are you worried about the medium and long long-term consequences of what's unfolding in Gaza are you worried that Israel may be simply retaliating in a fury because of the horrendous nature of these attacks and might not have a medium or long-term plan and secondly I'm wondering how worried are you about a second front in this war Iran and Hezbollah have already made threats of opening this new front if attacks on civilians and the or an Israeli blockade of Gaza continues um what would the US response be if Hezbollah ramps up its own attacks for instance in response to a ground Invasion uh and shik Muhammad the US and Israel are both struggling with this tragic and fluid hostage situation that that the secretary was talking about and have looked for cutter to help uh navigate it can you tell us about your engagements with Hamas and are you optimistic about getting these people back alive given reports that some of them may have already died in Israeli strikes on Gaza and secondly there have been rising criticism and protests across the Arab world uh as isra as as Israel's retaliation continues what's your view of how Israel is conducting its military response and are you worried about the potential are you also worried about the potential for medium and long-term consequences of what's Happening thank you um Ian thank you very much first part of the question uh no country no country can tolerate having terrorist group come in Slaughter its people in the most unconscionable ways and live like that what Israel is doing is not retaliation what Israel is doing is defending the lives of its people and as I said trying to make sure that this cannot happen again and I think any country faced with what Israel has uh has suffered uh would likely do the same thing imagine if this had happened in the United States so that's what is happening of course you're uh it's important to think about uh as one might put it uh the day after and where this goes and I believe that is very much a part of uh Israel's thinking as well as our own and the thinking of many other countries in the region because one thing is for sure uh we can't go back back to the status quo that allowed this to happen in the first place so that has to be part of the the thinking and and and it is but the immediate Focus again is on making sure that uh Israelis are protected defended and that again this um can't be allowed to be repeated with regard to uh a second front you put it yes this is something that's that we're very focused on we have been from day one we want to make sure that um no other country or entity TR to take advantage of the situation president's been very very clear about that um he uh said very starkly that any state or non-state actor considering that should not don't do it and he's backed that up in a number of ways including as I've mentioned the other day and is is known deploying our largest aircraft carrier battle group uh to the Eastern Mediterranean um so that's clearly designed to help ensure that uh anyone contemplating getting engaged uh doesn't do it uh but beyond that a big part of my own conversations here throughout this trip uh including today uh following up the next couple of days is working with other countries to make sure that they're using their own contacts their own um influence their own relationship to make that case that uh no one else should be um uh taking this moment choose to create more trouble uh in some other place I should mention as well that that earlier today I uh had a very good conversation with uh president abas and the Palestinian Authority and among other things the Palestinian Authority is um acting effectively to um try to ensure that there is security and stability in the way Bank uh something that is very much appreciated and uh they are uh working as they've done in the past with Israel to that effect so in in each of these areas yes this is a this is a focus and it's very important that this not expand to other places regarding uh your question about uh the progress on on the host is actually it's very early to judge uh with the intensity of the of the war right now how how hopeful we are but we we have we always hopeful in order to get those hostages back I think that uh uh the progress will be determined in the next few days hopefully and we will see if there will be a positive Prospect for that but we are doing our best our partners are doing their best in order to get them released uh safy on our views on uh uh the Israeli response uh in Gaza we see we have seen the amount of Devastation that's uh Gaza which almost now half of it been distracted and the number of people who been killed uh uh throughout this uh operation is significant and we believe that human being are human being everywhere whether they are in Israel or Palestinians uh they have the same value and uh uh this is deeply painful for all of us and we would like to see uh uh international law applied here and uh also the same standards that we apply to uh any War being applied in in that we are trying our best in keeping the communication open in order to ensure that uh uh the humanitarian suffering doesn't continue and moving ahead uh with the humanitarian passages uh uh for for the aid to be provided to them we cannot uh deprive uh the people in Gaza from electricity water and uh medicine and like all the means uh of Life uh we believe that the situation is very dangerous on the future uh Prospect of this the entire situation is very worrying for the entire region and we believe in the absence of any political Horizon and hope for the Palestinians we this issue will keep uh Ono unfortunately so that's why we need to focus on how the day after will be dealt with and how we can create a political Horizon and hope for the Palestinian
