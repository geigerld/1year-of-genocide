DSA Jabari joins us live from tan dorsa Iran is being accused of helping plan hamas's surprise attack on Saturday we've since heard from the Iranian foreign Ministry and it had some strong words talk us through it yes uh during his weekly uh press briefing the spokesperson uh nasar Kanani uh dismissed the allegations uh and he said that the Palestinian people have the will the capability and the determination to defend themselves and any allegations that are coming towards Iran are politically motivated and they are aimed at diverting public opinion to justify any possible actions on Iran in the future he also said if there were to be any um actions taken against Iran when it comes to their um the allegations that they had a possible role in planning and and um assisting the attacks that were carried out on Saturday and continue to this day in Palestine and Israel the that Iran will respond harshly and that this is not something that um is even uh remotely possible in the minds of the establishment here that what happened in Palestine had to do with years of uh occupation and oppression and that was the result of um not only Israeli policy but also what many here believe to be Western policies towards the Palestinian people explain to our International audience the historical context of all of this why Iran is in some ways a major player uh in this region well Iran since the revolution of 1979 has uh really seen itself as a Shia minority um in the Middle East it is a Shia majority country so there was a number of steps taken by the founder of the Revolution aah K to ensure that Iran's position maintains uh secure one of them was to align itself with other resistance groups um not just Shia resistance group like Hezbollah but also like Hamas and Islamic Jihad to ensure their own uh existence down the line and the existence of Israel has always been a point of contention for Iran they believe that they don't believe Israel has a right to exist as a nation as a country and they've never acknowledged uh that uh to be the case they say Palestine is um a country that has been oppressed so there's a lot of different factors at play at the core of it of course it's the their own existence the Iran's own security and existence down the line in the Middle East and the role that they have played and they believe that that the Palestinian issue has always been an important one for them because it also not only um serves the Palestinian people and the nation but also their own purpose as well in terms of their own existence down the line so there's been a lot of different groups and elements that Iran has aligned itself with to serve that purpose appreciate you breaking all down for us Dosa Jabari in tyan Muhammad Mandi who is a political analyst and a professor at the University of tyan he joins us from the Iranian Capital thanks so much for being on the program explain to our International audience the relationship between Iran and Israel and why tan is being accused of having quote tentacles all over this attack by hamus Iran's support for the Palestinian people uh is linked to uh the revolution itself During the Revolution there were two causes that the Iranians were very much f focused on one was supporting the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa and the second was supporting the dispossessed Palestinian people across Palestine and uh at that time Western countries were supporting both the apid regime in South Africa and the Israeli regime and Nelson Mandela thec and others were all terrorist organizations in Western capitals so Iran support for H the Islamic Jihad and other resistance groups is because they have a legitimate cause they've been dispossessed they've been colonized they've been ethnically cleansed and the people who are trapped in Gaza in this ghetto uh they have been dispossessed from their land okay uh across Southern Palestine I guess I want to look at the broader context of this and what it means in terms of Hezbollah and Hamas um the Lebanese militant group being involved in the broader implications regionally could we see this conflict now spilling out uh further in the region it is quite possible because we are seeing the genocidal Tendencies of the Israeli regime playing out as they indiscriminately bomb homes and murder women and children across Gaza and Western media they all all are justifying it because they've all been justifying the actions of the apartheid settler regime for decades and uh as we speak people are being massacred last night they were being massacred Powers have been raised to the ground and constantly Western media Outlets have been trying to justify all this because they side with the Israeli regime it is the responsibility of Iran and Iranians and people across the region and across the globe to stand up for the dispossessed and not to be fooled by these Western narratives Hezbollah supports Hamas because they are victims Hezbollah supports the Palestinian people because these are victims and heah is much stronger than Hamas by the way it is not surrounded so I just want to sir I just want to interrupt you there for a moment sorry I'm just getting word that um we've heard from from the the Iran foreign Ministry sorry the the information is just flowing in as I speak to the Iran foreign Ministry has said any foolish Israeli action against Iran will be met with a devastating response we're already facing a war between Gaza and Israel and now we're getting threats like that your response well the Americans or American officials have been threatening Iran as well and I think that the Americans know quite well that they've already bitten off more than they can to in Ukraine in East Asia with China the United States and its allies are on the decline they they're not the powers that they were 30 40 years ago the Israeli regime is in no position to threaten Iran because the Israeli regime cannot even destroy the Palestinian people but the United States if it does something foolish then it will be expelled from the region the United States is very vulnerable and the price of fuel will go through the roof it will destroy the Western economies and then you'll be seeing the violence across Europe and North America sorry we just have to cut it short there we're running um short of time that was Muhammad Mandi the a professor rather from the University of tyan
