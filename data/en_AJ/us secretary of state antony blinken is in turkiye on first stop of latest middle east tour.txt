Israel's war on Gaza has created uh okay we're going to go to some live pictures right now of us SEC State Anthony Alliance the tremendous solidarity that we have and continue to have uh in supporting Ukraine against uh the Russian aggression uh we talked a little bit about steps to prepare for the NATO Summit that will take place in Washington uh early this summer uh and uh we also focused on what both countries have done through the leadership of uh president erdan and prime minister mitsakis to bring Greece and Turkey closer together including the summit meeting that both leaders had uh just last month in uh turkey we also focused uh extensively on uh what turkey can do using its influence using its ties to help prevent the conflict in the Middle East uh from spreading uh and we also talked about the role that turkey can play both in the day after for Gaza in terms of uh uh the challenging questions of governance Palestinian life governance uh security rebuilding as well as the work that it can do with others to try to produce more lasting durable peace and security uh in the region in uh and of course in in Turkey we also talked about the final steps uh in the process to ratify Sweden's accession to Nato in the coming weeks in uh Greece here in uh suda Bay first I just want to really express my appreciation to prime minister Mr tacis for welcoming us into his home uh that was very uh very meaningful um Greece the United States I've been doing this for 30 years I can't think of a time when the partnership the friendship between our countries has been stronger and we see that manifested in all sorts of ways every single day one way that's being manifested right now is Greece's participation in operation Prosperity Guardian to try to ensure that we have freedom of navigation freedom of Commerce in the Red Sea which is being challenged almost daily by the houthis uh Greece is playing a vital role in that along with uh many other countries uh and we had uh discussions about that uh as well as the remarkable work that's done here at sud Bay to make sure that we continue to have a strong platform uh for ensuring that we can as necessary deter aggression uh around the world leaving uh leaving GRE tonight we're now heading back to the Middle East this is um the fourth time since October 7th that I'll be in the region and uh we'll be there at what remains an incredibly difficult time for the region uh in the wake of the October 7th attacks uh on Israel as we've said from day one uh we have an intense focus on preventing this conflict from spreading uh and a big part of the conversations we'll be having over the coming days with all of our allies and partners is looking at the steps that they can take using the influence and ties that they have uh to do just that to make sure that this conflict doesn't spread second uh we'll be looking at what we can do to maximize the protection for civilians maximize humanitarian assistance getting into them uh and also to get hostages out of Gaza uh the situation for men women and children uh in Gaza remains dire far too many Palestinians have been killed especially children far too many uh remain incredibly challenged in in terms of their access to food to water to medicine to the essentials of life so it's imperative that we see a substantial and sustained increase in the assistance that's getting to them as well as to the protection of uh civilians in general third uh we will focus on the steps that remain to make sure that October 7th never happens again uh and that we get on a path to a sustainable uh peaceful secure future for everyone uh that starts with the work that's going to be necessary in Gaza itself uh to uh to rebuild uh to have security uh to have Palestinian L governance and it goes to the longer path the broader path uh toward durable peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians alike uh which for us uh as has been the case from the day one of this Administration uh has to include the realization of Palestinian political rights and notably a Palestinian state with security assurances for Israel um we'll talk about what the United States can and will do in all of these areas to advance both uh what needs to happen in Gaza and more broadly what has to happen to build durable peace and security we'll also be talking about what all of our allies and partners can do what are they prepared to do to assist in this process um these are not necessarily easy conversations there are different perspectives different needs different requirements but it is vital that we engage in this diplomacy now both for uh the sake of the future of Gaza itself and more broadly the sake of the future for Israelis and Palestinians and for the region as a whole there clearly a strong desire among the majority of people in the region for a future that is one a piece of security of deescalation of conflicts of integration of countries and that's one path that's one future the other future is an endless cycle of violence a repetition of the horrific events that we've seen um and lives of uh insecurity uh and Conflict for people in the region which is what virtually no one wants so the work that needs to be done to get on that first path the steps that need to be taken the commitments that countries need to make this is what we'll be talking about in the days ahead have Tak any questions me I guess yes you thank you um Mr secary in terms of today what specifically did you ask or did you explore with the Turks as it relates to one preventing the spread the escalation of the conflict one would you like to see them do and then SEC and then in terms of the day after and especially on the security and Reconstruction did you get any kind of commitment from the Turks that they're at least willing to consider even if they didn't come out and say that they would definitely do something would would they do those and then the same thing with the Greeks or was that less of an issue with with with the Greeks so now what I can tell you is this I think from our conversations today it's clear that turkey's prepared to play a positive produ role in work that needs to happen the day after the uh the conflict ends and as well more broadly in trying to find a path to sustainable peace and security uh we had uh conversations about about that I can't go into any any details except to say again they're they're clearly prepared to play a productive role um I think they're also prepared as they as they happen to use the the ties the influence they have the relationships they have with some of the critical players and some of the critical countries in the region to um do everything possible to deescalate and to prevent uh the conflict from spreading uh turkey can play a really vital role in doing that uh that was a big part of our conversation today they clearly have a shared interest with us in doing just that and I'm confident from these conversations that they're going to make every every possible effort in terms of the Greeks and in terms of the Greeks we were very focused on um a couple of things but particularly the challenge that's being posed right now by the booies to um uh to shipping I mean keep this in mind 90% of global Commerce every single day is done uh via shipping and when you have a threat that we have now to shipping in the Red Sea by the houthis a threat that's being posed not to any one country but quite literally to dozens of countries who are affected and in some ways to the entire International Community because this has a big effect when shipping is made more difficult uh when ships have to re-root to avoid danger when insurance rates go up when the cost of shipping goes up that means that people are going to be paying more for heating uh it's going to be they're going to be paying more for food uh we're going to have disrupted Supply chains this is a challenge to countries around the world and that was reflected in the fact that we had more than 40 countries sign a clear condemnation of what the who these are doing Greece is playing a critical role and of course it's one of the leading shipping countries in the world so it has a real incentive to uphold this International Norm protecting freedom of navigation protecting freedom of shipping it's participating in operation Prosperity Guardian it's dedicated a frigate uh to that and that was one of the focuses of our conversation today Mr secretary uh you talked about preventing this conflict from spreading today Hezbollah launched dozens maybe even as many as 60 missiles into Northern Israel Israel responded with air strikes on hisbah Targets in southern Lebanon is this exactly the kind of expansion escalation that you're talking about and how is the United States going to respond to this and talk to us allies to handle this we'll be talking to all of our partners including of course Israel about this but we've from day one as I said we've been working to make sure the conflict doesn't spread one of the areas of real concern is the border between um Israel and Lebanon uh and we want to do everything possible to make sure that we don't see escalation there uh but it's very important that Israelis have uh have Security in the north uh tens of thousands of people have been forced from their homes in uh in Northern Israel because of the threat posed by Hezbollah we are looking at ways diplomatically uh to try to diffuse that uh that challenge that tension so that people can return to their homes uh that they can live in peace and security uh and this is something that we're very actively working on it's going to be part of the discussions we have over the coming days not just in Israel with some of the other countries concerned talk about today's attacks in your meetings with the Turkish leaders uh not not in any detail but uh we were focused on a whole series of challenges that we have to uh to stability to peace and security and again the role that turkey can play in trying to make sure that we don't see escalation uh that we prevent the the conflict and spreading that other fronts are are not open and I think it's clearly in the interests of virtually all of the countries in the region to make sure that that doesn't happen uh and we want to make sure that countries who feel that way are also using their ties using their influence using their relationships with some of the actors that might be involved to keep a lid on things to make sure that we're not seeing uh the spread of conflict escalation it's clearly a strongly shared interest and again one we're really going to focus on over the coming days is inevitable after the attack in Beirut Andrea isn't it an inevitable reaction to the attack in Beirut and the assassination nothing's inevitable because uh countries are always going to calculate what their interest are and I think again from the uh perspective of Israel it's clearly not interested does not want uh escalation that's been made clear uh again from the start uh but they also are have to be fully prepared to defend themselves and defend the rights of their people to live uh in uh in their own country uh in their own homes but we know that this is not what Israel wants or seeks it's not what we want or seek I know from lebanon's perspective uh it's not in the interest of Lebanon to see any escalation so the question is um in large part Hasa and what actions uh it will take and how countries that have a relationship with h that may have some influence can use those relationships use that influence to try to keep things uh in check and meanwhile for us to use our own diplomacy to see if we can find a way to uh produce some more sustained Cal uh in Northern Israel and Southern Lebanon thanks thanks everyone US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin there speaking to reporters uh in on the Greek island of uh Greece on the Greek island of cre sorry uh on a short stop stop over before he begins what he says is his uh fourth tour of the Middle East uh since October uh 7th he just come from uh turkey where he hadd been meeting with leaders there uh to discuss a number of issues including finding a solution to the conflict in Gaza he talked about uh preventing the conflict from escalating Beyond Gaza and maximizing um assistance uh to U civilians in Gaza and and improving the humanitarian situation mahj zi is director of the golf studies Center at Kar University joins me now in the studio talk more about this so first of all your uh thoughts on what you just heard there from the US Secretary of State you know has um I I commented on for uh visit of of blinkin to the region that is the first time I saw him um and I I hear him so um showing empathy with the Palestinian in Gaza that's that's the first time the second thing uh he's the first time he talks about rebuild uh and rebuilding Gaza um and to me it seems he has educated himself a little bit about the conflict taking to consideration 90 days of the conflict the third Point um it's it's very interesting that uh it took uh secretary 90 days of the conflict and seeing all of this killing to admit that um Israel has no interest to escalation and and uh and he knows that what Israel is doing already um I think uh this this kind of statement um he of course he has interest to show that the America American Administration is uh you know willing to provide some support for uh peace but in reality uh they are facing many many challenges uh one of them is actually their direct support to the Israelis so far and the perception in the region and the lack of trust and I think they have to deal with all of that together so they can convince the people even the politician that they are sincere on solving the problem if we talk about the uh the situation on the ground for for Palestinians in Gaza which as we've been reporting for for weeks now is increasingly dire he talked there about uh what he said was you know maximizing uh the assistance to people there and getting the humanitarian Aid what every what virtually every uh a agency representative that we have spoken to has said is that the only way uh to get uh humanitarian Aid into Gaza safely is through a ceasefire that is virtually impossible any other way right so I mean I guess my question is you know the words are welcomed but it's yeah there's no there's no action hasm I mean it everyone knows that if there if the American wanted they could put more pressure on the Israelis to facilitate having more food and water and medicines into Gaza they they could do that they could put put pressure on on the Israeli government but they are not doing it and because they gave the green line to Israelis to do whatever they want on Gaza assuming that they will have their own security they would achieve their goals and they they will be more secure but they know and I think the Biden Administration should understand from the history that uh security cannot be achieved by achieved by crushing the other nations they they saw it in Iraq they saw it in Afghanistan they saw it in Vietnam everyone knows this and and I'm I'm I'm there is there is an Israeli journalist wrote a a piece today in one of the Israelis newspaper he told he talked about the uh stupidity in Israeli politics and it seems to me the stupidity that cross the globe today it's obvious that they need to put more pressure so they can at least uh reduce the the pre the reduce the the procedure uh time they it took them many many weeks just to examine each item want to go to Gazza and at is everything everything has been claimed that is double use or double uh you know uh it may be used for other purposes and that complicated the whole thing and I think today they talk about reusing some of the medical M material because they don't have or they cannot replace it from uh from outside so I think what happened in in Gaza it's a genocide because in in in in the absence of International Community and with with with with no pressure on Israel I think the suffer of the Palestinian will will be uh uh uh uh basically doubled and increased rapidly with all of this uh uh um attacks from the Israelis good to get your perspective on this wor thank you
