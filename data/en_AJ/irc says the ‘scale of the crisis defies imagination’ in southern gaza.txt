the scale of the crisis defies imagination that's the Stark warning from the International Rescue committee as Israeli forces intensify their assault in the south of Gaza 600,000 Palestinians have being forced to flee the Southernmost city of Rafa in just 10 days now this is an aerial shot of Northwest Rafa on the 4th of May two days before that Israeli action began and this week as you can see most of the tents and shelters have been removed but where have they gone well this is one of the places in carun North from Rafa on the 4th of May there was not a tent to be seen but this is Wednesday as you can see the number of tents has increased dramatically so let's bring in our correspondent TK Abu aom who's in deab Bala in central Gaza for us again and Tark people do continue to leave Rafa even as the Israelis attack as we've already heard in the north because they're fighting Hamas apparently but definitely where you are well the new reality in fact so is that the people there have been forced to flee Rafa under Mass Israeli bombardment they have been carrying out wide military campaign in the Eastern portion of the city using lethal Force destroying residential houses of schools clinics and everything that could be suitable for human habitation where Palestinians have been receiving more controversial evacuation orders to flee from the central areas of Rafa now the Israel military is mobilizing more brigades in order to fight in rafaad it seems that it reflects the Israeli intentions to expand and to broaden the military operations to reach to the middle area and despite the Israeli description of the operation to be precisely and limited now people are fleeing from Rafa to the al- maasi area in the northern part of kanun in the western part of kanun alongside to derl bah which is now the most densely populated area people have ended up right now living in drastic humanitarian situation where they are forced to live in makeshift tents that completely have no sign of a hygiene facilities and Amed the growing grubbed increase of the infectuous diseases spread among Palestinians who are right now experiencing more challenges in terms of getting food water new places of evacuation where some families have fled from the houses for the uh sixth or the seventh time right now since the beginning of the conflict where as we have been talking to a number of locals they have been saying that we are completely exhausted from being displaced and we thought that when we evacuated to Raa it would be our last trip of evacuation but now it sounds to be like safety for us is a cleat trap being used by the Israeli military to keep destroying what left from the Gaza Strip and at the same time we have no hope that this this ongoing battles on the ground can witness that kind of end within the coming days T there for us inala thanks very much for the update we'll be keeping in touch with tarck throughout the day make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
