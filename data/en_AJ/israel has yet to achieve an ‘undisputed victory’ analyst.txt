now Egypt is proposing a new ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza that would be implemented in three stages it's been widely reported indirect negotiations would be held in Egypt with mediation by Qatar and the US the first phase would see a humanitarian pause of 7 to 10 days Hamas would release all civilian captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails in the second phase Hamas would free all female soldiers over another 7 days as well as releasing bodies it still holds of Israelis killed since October the 7th all the remaining captives would be released during another month-long ceasefire while Israel would free more Palestinian inmates under the proposal Israel would also withdraw troops from Gaza and stop its aerial bombardment of the strip let's bring in Tamar kmut he's a specialist on conflict resolution and humanitarian Aid he's also an assistant professor of public policy at The delha Institute of Graduate Studies good to have you with us Tam so first of all let's start with the Egyptian president since I was just talking about that what do we know about this proposal to end the war is it getting traction so Sami obviously it is getting traction because we see uh I mean from who so the Hamas leadership uh senior leadership and the Jad islami senior ship uh senior leadership are in Cairo they were invited in Cairo a couple of days ago and they're still there discussing the initiative or this proposal and this proposal uh it's a multiphase approach so the first phase of it involves or focuses on uh on on on a humanitarian ceasefire and they're exchanging prisoners and captives from the two sides but there are other components to it and this comes in phase two and three which talks about uh it proposes a technocrat government government running Gaza than preparing for elections more or less uniting the Palestinian house to prepare for a political process post post war Administration can that technocrat government that understanding between Palestinian factions be achieved unless the US changes its position its objection to Palestinian reconciliation particularly between fat and Hamas so I mean that's that's the big question uh because we know I mean when Hamas won the elections it was not recognized by the US by Israel by mainly Western countries as a legit Palestinian party and then it was sanctioned and isolated and then there has been like several attempts to reconcile fat and Hamas the last of which was in Algeria and before there was in Cairo and even Qatar hosted round of internal Palestinian internal reconcilation but they were all they all failed mainly because of the American V2 because fat was always threatened that if it it reconciles with Hamas it will be also sanctions as well so if the Americans if this if this reconciliation um for for it to has any chance of success the Americans have to remove this V so what does that mean effectively this talk about Hamas entering the PLO cannot happen until the withdrawal as you put it of the US veto yes of course I mean uh it's it's Hamas is a mainstream political party does that mean ultimately stuck then in this unless scenario where if the the Palestinians can't reconcile there's not going to be a post Palestinian post-war government right that's reconciled so what there just continuation of chaos so the picture is very complicated because the Israelis what they want is they want to Topp down Hamas they don't to see they want they don't want to see any governing rule for Hamas in Gaza but realistically that's not possible because Hamas is there it cannot be bypassed at the same time for any Recon ilation efforts and for any reconstruction and political process to be reinitiated you need Hamas you have to engage with Hamas it's there it's the elephant in the room so the Americans have to realize this they have to recognize this and for anything to succeed on this front if their veto is still there I mean the success so the suffering would then continue and if if we you know unless that happens if we take a step back for a second Tam and look then at the situation the global situation that we have celebrations in the West on Christmas Day occupation Siege bodies piling up starvation as others you know sit down for their Christmas meal we've got starvation further east in Gaza an embodiment of the complete disconnect that's going on in the world right now s sadly true Sammy I mean Humanity has failed Palestinians I mean nowadays especially in this time of the year I mean uh you see even in beim in in Old Palestinian cities uh instead of like you know the Christmas tree the festive moods the displays of baby Jesus and ravels uh you know the big problem is the the theological justification of this word I mean the phrases even we been hearing from Netanyahu like you using the sons of Lights versus sons of of Darkness I I mean forget what AMC did you quoting the first book of Samuel chap 15 in the Bible and and this this ignores the fact that you know Muslims Christians Jews they're an authentic indigenous part of this region and they have coexisted peaceful for a long time the problem is with Zionism with Colonial settler ideologies with occupation that's the problem so we are at a at a very dark station in in in history when it comes to to the behavior of humanity the International Community uh towards Palestinians per se and and and and towards ending any Prospect to end occupation thank you very much Tamar kmo for coming in
