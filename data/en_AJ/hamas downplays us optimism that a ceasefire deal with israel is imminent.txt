Hamas has downplayed optimism by the US president that a ceasefire deal with Israel is imminent a senior member of the group's political Wing bosam Naim told Al jazer Hamas is still waiting for an official proposal the US state department however remains optimistic that an agreement can be reached our goal is to achieve a deal to uh reach a humanitarian pause and the release of hostages as soon as possible certainly we'd welcome getting one by this weekend um what I can say about the overall progress is that we made significant progress towards an agreement last week when uh we had uh officials from the United States government engaging in the region we continue to pursue further progress this week uh American officials across the government continue to be engaged on this question um we are trying to push this deal over the Finish Line we do think it's possible ven Mar's joining us now from occupied East Jerusalem so the US state department being fairly upbeat about some sort of uh deal being reached Hamas however downplaying it what what is Hamas response to all of this Rob I just got off the phone with Dr Nim again in Istanbul telling me that there is still no formal proposal on the table around a deal so what he's saying is going on at the moment and still has been going on for several days is that mediators from the US from Qatar from Egypt are still talking to the Israeli side to come up with formal details that will be presented to Hamas for them to then respond to in a formal manner their red lines remain the same he says those are an end to fighting a withdrawal of Israeli troops to outside of Gaza a massive increase in Aid support for rebuilding and of course what's so key here is that the details around what that Aid will look like the level of support has not yet been clarified another element of any deal will be a swap of prisoners we've got at least 40 captives inside Gaza from the Israeli side that would be released under any deal potentially those are women children older men and those with medical conditions and the details around who on the Palestinian side prisoners inside Israeli detention who would be released that is still seemingly an open question some of the most high-profile people held in Israeli detention are those that Hamas would like to see released and of course that will be politically complicated for Netanyahu at the very center of this though Rob is the idea that there will be an overall ENT to the war something Hamas would like to see or just a cessation a temporary ceasefire from the Israeli perspective they would like to have the option to continue the military operation at the end of this prisoner swap period and move into Rafa where Hamas maintains military operations to some extent villm thank you very much indeed villm marks talking to us from occupied East Jerusalem
