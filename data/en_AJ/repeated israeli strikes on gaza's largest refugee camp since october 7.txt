let's speak to yumna elad she's in Khan yunas on the ground there in the southern part of the Gaza Strip yumna tell us a little bit more about the latest strikes that we've been seeing because we know those bombardments have not stopped well that's true Anastasia the bombardments haven't stopped starting from last night all through the hours of the night and all through the hours of this day in the northern part many uh Target targeting have happened bombardments in the northern part where tanks have shelled on the homes of residents in the northern part of the strip while a huge air strike took place in the duala refugee camp where dozens of people were killed and dozens others were injured in that very dly populated refugee camp While others are still under the rubble uh civilians with very uh primitive and uh almost with their bare hands were trying to bring out the people from under the reubel in that air strike in jabalia which wiped out by the way an entire uh neighborhood over eight homes were completely destroyed in the jabalia uh targeting other homes also in the northern part and in Gaza City in a subra neighborhood a home was targeted other homes were also bombarded in Gaza City and uh a a school a public school was also uh targeted in Gaza City Y I want to ask you a little bit more about that school the alala school I understand thousands of people were Sheltering there and it's emerged that a very large number of dead and wounded are still potentially trapped there under the rubble well yes that's true and and the the the biggest crisis with the targeting of alah school in zun neighborhood in Gaza City is the disconnection of communications Nastasia now according to Witnesses and local sources we have learned that this school was targeted in the early dwn hours of this day and uh no one knew anything about the targeting or bombardment of this school because of the disconnection of communications until some of the survivors in the school were able to reach somewhere else in order to tell other uh people and the Indonesian hospital that there has been a major targeting in the school until now we have learned about over 70 people killed in that school and a great number of injuries from those people who were Sheltering in that school thousands of them have been Sheltering in this school after their homes in Gaza City have been completely bombarded humna elide there with the latest for us from the ground in kanun and the southern part of the Gaza Strip thank you yumna please stay safe
