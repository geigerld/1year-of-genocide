Israel is pushing ahead with its indiscriminate bombardment of Southern Gaza at least four Palestinians have been killed in attacks on Kan yunes the attacks come just hours after the international court of justice ordered Israel to take measures to stop genocidal actions in the strip more than 170 Palestinians were killed in the 24 hours after the ruling was handed down Israel has killed more than 26,200 Palestinians since October the 7th meanwhile Israeli soldiers have set up checkpoints in canun screening and detaining Palestinians who are trying to flee the destruction and fighting those who've been released tell of days of humiliation as is Abu Omar reports people are moving across this checkpoint that was set up near al- AXA University towards the Western areas Israeli forces set up this checkpoint 2 days ago and they've been arresting numerous people as they pass through this checkpoint they took my boys earlier and they've just released them moments ago they took them last night they've just released them my boys didn't do anything wrong I'm freezing to death they stopped and detained Us near the tank they fired rounds near our feet they detained and Sear us they humiliated us and fired at us there was no water and they detained us overnight then they told us to return to the schools today in the morning they fired at us again when they left yesterday we thought we would not see them again but thank God we found them here it rained on us and it was very tough we had to throw away all our belongings we couldn't even eat whenever we tried to open up bags they would open fire in US occupation forces have been opening fire in the direction of the displaced people people reported large numbers of injured at kanun camp and at al- Amal neighborhood and there are a number of people killed and their dead bodies on the ground meanwhile many displaced people have taken refuge in the schools near NASA Hospital people continue to move towards the Far Western part of can Yunis and they have no clue where they could be heading next under the ongoing escalation of Israel's offensive we can go now to hanni Mahmud he joins us from Rafa in southern Gaza hany firstly tell me about what has happening at these checkpoints in canun that Israeli forces have set up yes well more confirmed reports emerging from Khan UNF the one yet again one uh uh the scenario that we' seen in the northern part and Gaza City is repeating itself in the city of hanun now where uh hundreds of thousand of Palestinians were trapped inside their residential homes and the evacuation centers and as the Israeli military uh kept uh militarily surrounding those areas it started to uh allow people to uh go through go out of the city of kanun but not at a free cost they just what it's doing right now to set up these checkpoints and these are exactly how they are described they are they are a a surveillance cameras as well as very narrow tunnel shape corridors uh for people to walk through in one by one and the purpose of it is to is to SI through the population as the Israeli military stated and uh what it looks like on the ground is more of a setting up a campaign of arrest and humiliation because it takes hours for people to Quee in line of that security check that has been set up uh people are asked to uh to do uh acts that are not in accordance with uh with the uh the practices that are known for people it just putting more pressure they're asked the questions about what's going on in the city of kanun they are faced with a list of names and pictures of certain people that the Israeli military is after it just using using people particularly women and children as a pressure on on the men particularly parents if they have any lead information into uh some of the uh the figures they are looking after so far the the situations are very very difficult and people who have been through these checkpoints are describing a horror humiliation as well as the the the repetition of that you Palestinians have brought this onto yourself and and we are just making your wish Real by conducting these uh security uh clearance and these setting up these checkpoints and hany what is the situation where you are in Rafa we're hearing reports the area is becoming increasingly overcrowded yes well it's not only a the the bombing campaign continues but the area is becoming increasingly over crowded ra within the past weeks already ran out of space and ran out of the uh basic supplies and essential survival item to commodate and really displace it traumatized large population uh it's it is continuing to get worse by the day particularly at this time of the year it's very cold there is rain and possible flood can can can occur in evacuation zones like Al Maas has been very difficult for people within the past two days as the the temperature drop down people have no suitable clothing have no blankets or anything to warm themselves on top of that the lack of of in in of food supplies and medical supply just make the experience much more awful for them and and this is contrary to what people have experienced in the past they like when they like the rain but not at this particular difficult time where they lack everything essential to help them survive the the brutal condition right now thank you for that hany
