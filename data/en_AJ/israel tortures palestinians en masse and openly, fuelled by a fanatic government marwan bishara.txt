okay let's talk about this further with Maran bashara Al jazer senior political analyst he's in London for us and um Maran I mean let's focus on what's been happening at Israel's St Taman prison that's a military installation as we said in the neev desert in southern Israel where there have been all of these allegations of severe abuse one detainee uh allegedly raped with an iron bar I mean how difficult is it to shine a light on what's going on inside these specifically military facilities well so certainly getting more and more difficult and even when it wasn't difficult it didn't lead to much as we know from the you know recent and not so recent history that whatever investigations or commissions are conducted nothing much comes out of them Israel tortures Israel tortures Israel has long tortured Palestinians for over six decades Israel has has been torturing except today it's kind of a gun of the Rails now it tortures in mess and it tortures in a more sistic and in a more cheap way there are no more rational reasons for the way it tortures it tortures now to hurt it tortures because the torturers are so sadistic so tribal so vengeful so out of order that they basically can do whatever they want and as we've seen from the images they think they can just get away with it without even the appearance of an investigation Israel was once upon a time a country that kept up the appearances of being a country of Institutions especially the military it was supposedly a military with a state but even today the military has been infiltrated by so many radical Fanatics and extremists including among its high ranking generals that it's very difficult with fanatic government and a ftic military to see any justice um served for the Palestinians now talking about you suggest a degree of impunity there for the for the Israeli military I mean Israeli military police we know have detained at least nine military reservists from that specific Camp they did that on Monday as a result of these allegations I mean what does that say to you Maran about Israel's ability to police itself at the moment Israel cannot police itself it won't police itself not when you have a fanatic government not when you have a security minister that's already been accused of terrorism that's already been accused of uh so much extremism that they would he wouldn't even be allowed to serve in the Israeli milit when you have that kind of a minister you have Sovereign ministers in this government that are so Fanatics that some of their own parliamentarians in KES yesterday they were justifying the the sodomy and the torture of of the most ugly forms against Palestinian but this is this is while terribly shocking is hardly surprising this we have a state that's being indicted on genocide we have Israeli leaders who who are pursued or will be pursued by the international criminal court we have a country and a government and a society that is in total violation of international law according to the international court of justice for its violations every day of those under occupation of annexing land of stealing land of stealing water of torture and torture is probably the worst of it because well it's not wor of it but it's sort of the most I don't know just listening to N you know with that report because you know that all of these things are happening but as the world continues to talk about uh you know 10 dozen Israeli captives and hostages in Gaza for every one of those captives and hostages now there are a 100 in Israeli prisons being tortured or being forced into So-Cal enforced disappearance what is that it's kidnapping for God's sakes kidnapping doctors lawyers students young people old people's spouses yeah basically any kind of relatives it's just being runed up taken to prison without telling their loved ones where they are why they're there and they don't stand trial and many of them are getting tortured and few dozens killed so this is the situation where you have thousands upon thousands of Palestinian kidnapped hostages held in Israeli prisons in force disappearance no one in the world talks about them and you have 10 dozen Israelis in Hamas captivity and we don't stop listening or hearing about them this is the Injustice this is the asymmetry it's terrible that there are 10 dozens of Israeli especially civilians there's no doubt about that but tens of thousands of Palestinians and certainly some of them serving uh um you know uh sentences of what 10 20 30 40 years in Israeli prisons many of them as I said tortured a lot of them not even being on trial not even facing any charges this is not a city of law this is not a country of laws this is a rogue State all right Maran many thanks always good to hear your thoughts Mar Bashar I'll just there a senior political analyst there make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
