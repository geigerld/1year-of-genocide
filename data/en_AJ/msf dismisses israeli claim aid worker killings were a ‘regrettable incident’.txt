starving Palestinians in Gaza fear food shortages will worsen following the latest attacks on Aid workers the head of world Central Kitchen is now demanding the Biden Administration call for an independent investigation into Israeli air strikes on Aid workers in Gaza well Christopher laier is Secretary General of Doctors Without Borders and he's joining us live from Geneva Christopher thank you very much making time to be on the program as you know multiple Aid groups are suspending their operations in Gaza either in indefinitely Or temporarily as they assess the security situation what are you doing mine and our condolences to the fs friends families and colleagues of the victims from uh World Central Kitchen and that horrific accident that happened a couple of days ago we ourselves have been victims of multiple uh attacks in in Gaza we've lost five staff members and the humanitarian Community as a whole is now at the horrific figure of having 200 of our colleagues killed providing assistance uh in Gaza at the moment is a really critical objective of ours the the needs that we are seeing particularly the medical needs are atrocious um we are seeing badly wounded patients we are seeing raising rights of Mal raising rates of malnutrition and yes we want to stay in Gaza but but since the start of this uh conflict we have been assessing the risks to our teams on a daily basis this is an incredibly dangerous and difficult place to work and there are no guarantees there we want to stay there are many many patients who need assistance but the risks are extremely high so I suppose the question becomes what can you do to keep your staff alive as you said 200 Aid workers across groups have been killed since October for this figure this awful figure of of two 200 and which is of course just a tiny fraction of the total number of people killed in Gaza as who were just reporting that figure has now ticked across to the the horrific 33,000 Mark and what I would say is that there's been discussions clearly what has happened in terms of these 200 humanitarian workers killed is a complete failure in terms of coordination with uh Israeli forces we are used to working in Conflict areas we work in Conflict areas every day around the around the the world um and what what has been a complete failure here is that we don't have contact uh on the ground with the IDF troops but more than that for me this is a signal of a lack of willingness to change how the conflict is being fought and the respect given to humanitarian workers protection of humanitarian workers is a is uh enshrined in humanitarian International humanitarian law clearly that is uh being not being adhered to and so what we need is more than better coordination we've been talking about the need for that to be improved for months now but we need the political will to change uh the the risks towards humanitarian workers and for the population as as a whole because this conflict cannot continue in this fashion ultimately there needs to be an immediate and sustained ceasefire you said Doctors Without Borders doesn't have contacts with uh on the ground with troops do does your organization have any kind of communication lines of communication with the Israeli military and also the Israeli military announced in the aftermath of the world Central Kitchen attack that they were now going to open up what they're calling a situation Rune right to coordinate movement of humanitarian uh workers on the ground have you heard anything concrete about that well yes the Situation Room has existed already as far as I'm aware I mean we have a we're part of a coordination room um uh as it as it stands so uh as far as I know this is nothing new and is part of the system that has already um been uh failing so but yes and you can tell from answer we do have contact um uh with the Israeli military through the the the branch that is called Kat which is responsible for our Safety and Security as well as that for Palestinians in Gaza and the and and the the West Bank and so we do communicate with them in terms of our movements where we uh we Mark our vehicles where we're living where our facilities are and despite that um we have as well as a number of others been uh victims of some trag tragic attacks okay I have to ask you and you're well aware of this that uh given the recent report by the IPC which is this uh this collection of Aid groups on food security uh given the recent report that famine is a very real risk across the Gaza Strip I know obviously Doctors Without Borders is primarily concerned with health care and and Medical Care um but if people aren't eating I'm assuming that your teams on the ground are seeing that what is the impact of the food insecurity that that you're seeing yeah AB absolutely I mean malnutrition is a is a medical um condition and we are seeing Rising rates of malnutrition um in all of our um facilities just uh a couple of weeks ago I was in the alaxa hospital in the middle area of the Gaza Strip and in that hospital Medics were faced with the impossible choice of giving beds to trauma patients for people who needed their wounds dressing and to go into surgery versus uh children um who needed those big beds for treatment of malnutrition and what I would say is that really shouldn't be a surprise to anybody you don't have to be an aid worker you don't have to be nutritionist or a data specialist to expect that if you have a population that is under siege a population that is in a Siege within a Siege uh as we have in the north of Gaza and they are then they have been bombed indiscriminately in many cases as they has been they're going to start suffering from malnutrition pretty quickly yeah Christopher lock you're a Secretary General of Doctors Without Borders thank you very much for coming on the program thank okay
