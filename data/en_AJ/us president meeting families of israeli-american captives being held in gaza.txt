president uh Joe Biden is meeting families of American captives held in Gaza at the White House eight us Nationals are believed to still be held there Hamas freed four Americans last month during a ceasefire broken by Qatar and by Egypt well our White House correspondent Kimberly hit is standing by Kimberly what can you tell us about this meeting and what they're saying both the president and the families of the captives yeah we've just heard from the families in fact they just wrapped up that meeting and about 250 meters from where I'm standing the family members walked out and spoke to reporters uh there what we know about those eight captives is that there are seven uh men and one women woman that are still being held and uh what their family members are saying is that the meeting that was held with President Biden and the Secretary of State Anthony blankin was very encouraging what the president told them is that in in fact he is personally guaranteeing that he will continue and his administration will continue to uh look for their loved ones that this is something that they are dedicated to they will not lose sight of this and they won't stop trying to bring them home uh so this was something that they say that since October 7th they have been in close coordination with members of the administration whether it has been virtually or in person uh and that there has been a lot of transparent communication uh one of the family members said they are hoping for a Christmas miracle and they also said that they hope that the media will continue to remember that these are individuals they're real people not numbers and that what was most striking about this was uh given the fact that the previous uh captives were released during a ceasefire when asked by reporters if they were hopeful there would be another temporary ceasefire that might encourage the release of their own family members they were refused to answer that question saying they wanted to keep those parts of the conversation with President Biden private Kimber I'd like to ask you about another meeting uh it's taking place tomorrow the US National Security adviser Jake Sullivan is going to Israel tomorrow I wonder how that meeting is going to go and what message he's bringing in light of the criticism that we heard um from the US President Joe Biden just yesterday and in light of the the you know the the responses they were defiant we just talked about it with hamda in Jerusalem the response is from the Israeli government probably not as uh cordial if you will given the fact that the US president used some pretty strong language some would even argue accused Israel of war crimes given the fact that he used the term indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians when he spoke on Tuesday of the targeting by the Israeli military of Palestinian civilians now the Biden Administration has since walked back those comments the latest being from the National Security spokesperson John Kirby when he has since said that uh the results are not commensurate with efforts to minimize civilian casualties it appears that the B Administration and Jake Sullivan in those meetings on Thursday and Friday with the uh Israeli War cabinet with the Prime Minister as well as the president is likely to be an extension of that cleanup uh what the other message will be though is that once again the United States is encouraging Israel to be more precise and more targeted in their military campaign but make no mistake they're not asking them in any way to move towards a ceasefire because they believe that this would allow Hamas to retrofit and even allow for future attacks a message we should point out that the Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will reiterate when he visits Israel on Monday Kimberly hit reporting from the White House there thank you very much Kimberly
