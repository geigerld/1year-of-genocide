let's bring in Palestinian journalist Han Abu isba who joins us live now from hunis first things first are there still bombardments ongoing as we speak yes we are still reporting from Naser Hospital the second largest public health facility in the city of Han unas and uh to confirm to what you said there is a still ongoing bombardment Mass bombard of the city of hanun and you would be able to hear the sound of explosion as they are nearby the health facility I'm standing in within the past two hours there has been multiple massive air strikes across the Gaza Strip uh let me start from where where I'm at right now so the past two hours a residential homes was was targeted by an air strike and completely destroyed uh seven people were pronounced it right at the spot spot and 40 other were seriously injured according according to an eyewitness the house accommodates the owner of the house and the vast majority of the people were evacuated from different parts of the Gaza City within the vicinity of the of a shifa hospital complex another residential homes was destroyed was targeted and completely destroyed and according to our resources 70 people were within that residential building and there are reports about many of them were dead other are still under durables and a large number of casualties two other densely populated areas were also targeted by air strikes of the uh shik rwan neighborhood such a densely populated area and again the target seems to be a residential homes another area was at tatini Street another densely populated area in Gaza City and my guess those are the people who were not able to evacuate their homes and found refuge in their homes hany tell us about the scene if you're able to at alahi Baptist Hospital that was uh targeted yesterday killing at least 500 Palestinians um is any part of that operation that hospital still operational that's question number one and are there still search and rescue operations for possible survivors at the scene of the strike or is that now over uh let me let me first start by by by telling you that the hospital within the past 3 days turn into a shelter for many people who evacuated their homes from the northern part of Gaza and Gaza governorate people thought it's a Baptist Hospital belongs to the church and it might be safe to seek shelter to keep to seek shelter and refuge in it unfortunately the many hundreds of people who just took the ground and and set up small tent to protect their families were not safe after all of that the city was was already running at the lowest capabilities possible we have a serious problem with with the fuel serious shortage of a fuel to keeps electricity running let alone running the uh the the the generators to run electric to generate electricity as well as the lack of medical basic supplies made it all possible for the hospital to sustain itself right after the air strikes uh um as far as I know there is a still a rescue going on uh it started all last night and be given the intensity of of the air strikes and the many casualties we're talking about uh body parts human bones and flesh spread everywhere uh everybody was was capable to rescue get involved in order to help out it was a very very tragic scene where did were the wounded taken and where are they being treated now okay M some of the the the wounded we rush to a shifa hospital and and just to uh uh give you an idea what the hos what the shifa hospital looks like now it it's mainly running Beyond its capacity it's five times Beyond its capacity with with shortage of fuel and and and shortage of medical supply it's hard to sustain the hospital for the next a few days we spoke with with some medical uh with some medical personnel from a shifa hospital and other people are involved with the admin work of the hospital and they talk about that the hospital is at the brink of of collapse given all the the shortage of a fuel and medical supplies and they're looking into uh within within couple days the the hospital might might might shut down all of its services and it will it will run out of any any capabilities. accommodate more more injured or more more casualties the rest of the casualties were unfortunately we'll have to undergo some uh initial intervention on their way to the hospitals some of them was very critical to transport them from alah Baptist uh hospital to Al shifa hospital so we're getting the treatment right on the ground that was not even sufficient that that gives you uh the reason that explains the reason for the large number of casualties uh people in these cases uh need immediate immediate and and very very Swift intervention to save their lives but unfortunately uh given all the dangers involved in movement especially the air strikes took place right after 7:00 6:30 7:00 that's for many Palestinians in the Gaza Strip that's a Red Zone that's a red T red Zone timeline I'm going to step away from the ambulance yes but uh as you can see there are the an air strike that we just heard as we were preparing for this life uh they're rushing casualties into the hospital we are not sure how many people have been killed in this air strike we're going to get our uh information from the emergency department but as you can see it creates every time there is an air strike it creates chaotic situation and a Mayhem across the hospital one thing that I want to point out about this Hospital not only it accommodates hone pause for a second honey pause for a second can you look around you and tell us what's happening please look around you tell us what's happening I see movements of ambulance what's going on yeah there okay all right all right all right so as you can see these are
