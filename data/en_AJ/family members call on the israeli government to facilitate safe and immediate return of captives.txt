while dozens of people in West Jerusalem have rallied outside the Israeli president's residence calling for the return of family members being held by Hamas Israeli president Isaac herzo met some of the families on Sunday they're demanding that the government facilitate the safe and immediate return of their relatives 222 people were taken captive by Hamas Fighters during the group's offensive inside Southern Israel more than two weeks ago well one of them was Tel haimi and I'm now joined by udig goren his cousin he joins me from paos in Cyprus today Udi thank you so much for your time with us here on Al jazer let me start by asking if you've had any news of your cousin I I know his mobile phone signal was tracked in Gaza at one point have you heard about how he is anything over the last few days first of all thank you Nastasia for letting me speak out on behalf of those who can't sadly we haven't heard anything from tal and right now he's declared a hostage and and missing so nothing is officially confirmed since he his body hasn't been recovered he's not in any of the Israeli hospitals so and his throne was traced to Gaza then we can only assume that uh that he is being held hostage and hopefully still alive UD I understand that tal has three children is that right how are they and the family they holding that's they're devastated they're devastated I mean the it's the general sentiment I've heard the previous reporter and I think she she pronounced very well the sentiment in Israel people are this is the darkest hour Israel has had since its foundation and of course you know every family impacted including H's family are just horrified anxious um you know his three kids don't understand where their dad is gone his wife is is you know worried sick that we don't know and we're not even sure what's What's the progress on bringing the hostages back we keep hearing about the ground Invasion but we don't hear about the progress of how are they going to get the hostages back safely udy I have to ask you because we've seen I've seen sitting in this chair a lot of children who've been killed in Gaza over the last couple of weeks do you have an understanding of how Tal's family is talking about what's happening there how they're talking about it with their children I'm sorry do I understand how they're mitigating the situation to the children oh how how they're talking about what's happening in Gaza right now we we've seen so much violence in Gala Gaza over the last 17 days how is the family talking about it with the children I don't believe that the the families are talking about the complexity of the situation in general people are trying to keep the children as you know as safe as possible because aside from the trauma they've heard they don't need to hear about the capacity of this war they're not telling them about what's happening in Israel either I can tell you that among the adult family members there is a consensus that the war must stop it doesn't matter if the people who are being killed are gazan civilians or they're Israeli civilians the loss is equal the tragedy is equal and the fact that both are not serving neither us nor the Palestinians it is only escalating the conflict and definitely not leading to any resolution not one single rocket fired from Gaza onto Israeli hospitals or Israeli Villages is going to advance the resolution of this conflict and I don't believe that any bombing of Gaza killing any Palestinian civilian is is is furthering the resolution of this situation I think that the war must end this should be the call on everybody's lips it doesn't matter if your position is that you support gazan civilians or you support Kamas or if your position is that you support Israel but if your interest if People's interest is truly to save gin's lives then the call should be equal should be stop the war stop the missile launchers from Gaza stop the Israeli bombing and get immediate aid to Gaza release the hostages because if gazan civilians don't need to pay for the atrocious crimes that Kamas committed so don't Israeli civilians need to pay for whatever crimes the uh Israeli government has committed or whatever claims there are about The Siege and about the conflict and I you know I have been a peace activist my entire life I don't think there's any difference between the value of a gazin civilian and my own but if the calling out goes only to free Gaza and end the bombardment and you don't take into account my pain and my safety and the safety of my cousin who is a civilian being held hostage right now by the hands of Hamas then I believe the this position is hurting the conflict it's not helping Palestinians it's actually hurting the cause and I think that we could get together the people who are truly truly interested in stopping this conflict who don't want to see any more deaths because right now in Gaza there's a person con concerned about their cousin just as much as I am I'm sure and rightfully so and their pain is no less than mine very very well said udy goren there the cousin of talimi who is currently being held captive by Hamas calling for an end to this conflict calling for an end to this war thank you for joining us here on aler S and for taking the time thank you for having me
