is with the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies Mr masy I know that you were listening to the news conference from the Israeli War cabinet what did you make of what you heard from from the three men about the ceasefire agreement and their plans well first of all there was something uh that was striking um and Marwan spoke to it a few minutes ago and that is that Netanyahu tried to claim uh um that the only reason that he was able to achieve this victory that the only reason he was able to get these hos back is because he's had the proverbial knife to uh uh hamas's neck right that he's been um you know overwhelming them with military force this is simply not uh the case the reality is that Hamas from day one actually wanted to give these uh civilian you know the elderly people and the children back to Israel and Israel was was refusing these offers so it's actually Israel that's been forced kind of to to take this deal that's the first thing the second thing now in terms of their their end game here it was also striking to hear all three men talk about the need to continue this war yeah exactly they say that you know prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu he even said that he hopes that the ceas fire can be extended But ultimately the fighting has resumed because their goal is to defeat Hamas right which is as many people have noted is it's kind of an unwinable uh um you know uh War right because uh Hamas is more of an idea than than it is anything else but uh even if we take them at their word that they're trying to eliminate Hamas what we see is that the endgame here is about greater Israel right this is something that is deeply embedded within Zionist ideology it's been written about by many Israeli Scholars the idea is that uh what happened in the the catastrophe the NECA in 1948 and then subsequently with with occupations of Palestinian land uh was just the beginning and that UL ultimately the land needs to be purified uh of Arabs or from Arabs uh and that it needs to be purely Jewish from the river to the sea that is uh the the dominant ideology uh inside of Israel that's the dominant Zionist uh uh thought on all of this and what we're seeing take place in Gaza is an attempt to implement sort of another phase of that they want to get all the Palestinians out of Gaza and sadly they're they're succeeding on on some fronts and they've said that the Palestinians who have fled the fighting in the north and gone to South Gaza that they will not allow them to return to the north there are something like 1.5 million people in Gaza who are internally displaced I mean what happens to these people right so first of all we have to point out that this kind of uh uh Force to displacement is a war crime uh and under international law this has been pointed out by numerous International humanitarian law Scholars so there are already numerous war war crimes being being carried out but um as you noted they're they're destroying uh the north of Gaza they're trying to get everybody out of the north of Gaza they destroying much of the South well right they they've they've taken people to the South and I think um the the the goal now is to make life so miserable uh and make the conditions so bad that people have no choice but ultimately to leave Gaza altogether but where do they go well the Israeli government has been very open they've been saying things like why don't the Egyptians take the the the the gazin in why don't the jordanians take the gazin in the gazin in the Israeli government has been very transparent about what it wants to do um and that's this is one of the reasons why Palestinians many of them are so adamant about about staying put they're saying they don't want to go to Egypt they don't want to go to uh uh Jordan or anywhere else and the US has you know many people have said that the US has not used The Leverage that it has with Israel but one thing that the US has been quite outspoken about is whenever prime minister Netanyahu has spoken about the plans for Gaza you know whenever the fighting ends the US has said that there cannot be a forced displacement of people in Gaza there cannot be Israeli control over Gaza in many ways this is this is rhetoric that the Biden Administration has to maintain they can't come out and say they're aiding and abetting um you know war crimes and and likely genocide many scholars have come out and said this they're not shy about saying that they don't agree with the ceasefire correct but you know I mean we don't want to necessarily go all the way down the road of of internal American politics but the bottom line is that uh the Israeli Lobby in the United States uh uh exerts considerable uh sway all of these mainstream politicians in both the Democratic and Republican parties uh receive many millions of dollars from uh from the Israel uh Lobby so there there has to be a certain level of support for Israel for American politics uh uh to function that's just the unfortunate reality and that's why the United States uh is effectively In Cahoots with with Israel uh and facilitating and aiding and abetting everything that they're doing uh in Gaza right now Mr masri thank you very much for your analysis we do appreciate it that is Muhammad Al masri from The theha Institute for Graduate Studies
