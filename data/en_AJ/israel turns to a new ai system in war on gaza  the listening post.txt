eight weeks now into the war on Gaza we're looking at multiple angles of this story and the way it's been covered starting with artificial intelligence as an Israeli weapon of War and the real life and death consequences for Palestinians Israeli hostages released by Hamas are telling stories that are proving very inconvenient for the Israeli government and the West Bank what should be a safer space is racked with violence and under constant Israeli surveillance more than 2 months of Israeli bombing have turned the Gaza Strip into a hellscape entire neighborhoods have been wiped out made uninhabitable with more than 16,000 Palestinians killed it is a population on the run an unfolding genocide and we now know that the unprecedented killing of Gins is being powered at least in part by Ai and is Israeli artificial intelligence system that generates new targets at a rate we have never seen before one former Israeli intelligence officer Likens the AI system to a mass assassination Factory reports about that technology have now been published by two Israeli news outlets 972 and local call for years the Israeli military has been milking the country's Tech sector to find more and more ways of managing its occupation of Palestinians and AI is just the latest high-tech weapon in what has turned into a barbaric Israeli War on Gaza one bombing after another the mass killing and displacement of Palestinian civilians the Gaza Strip has been a testing ground for Israel's surveillance Technologies for AI powered lethal weapons technology that you see in sci-fi films or in some dystopian horror movies but it is the reality of of many Palestinians on the ground and it is where the biblical meets the dystopian the gospel that's what the Israeli military calls the artificial intelligence system it has deployed in Gaza the AI does not issue commands or push buttons that is done by a human it just gener Ates the targets more than ever before the latest Revelations about the gospel were provided by two Israeli news outlets 972 magazine and local call they have unmasked how the Israeli military has loosened its already permissive constraints on the killing of Palestinian civilians as one source told 972 nothing happens by accident when a 3-year-old girl is killed in a home in Gaza it's because someone in the Army decided it wasn't a big deal for her to be killed everything is intentional we know exactly how much collateral damage there is in every home when the gospel system was ruled out it was said to be one of the state-of-the-art AI systems that would allow the military to pinpoint targets quickly and accurately it's allowed the Army to essentially Target at a mass scale what what soldiers have described as a mass assassination machine which means that they're not just pinpointing military infrastructure they're bombing civilian homes we have three AI systems which operate in concert we have The Alchemist system which collects information we have the second layer of this AI system which is called the fire Factory which analyzes the data and the gospel system which produces possible military targets it must be stressed that every military Target which is attacked from the air by the IDF goes through an analysis of both Intelligence Officers and legal advisers so while AI systems produce potential targets at the end of the day these are human beings which are authorizing them this is not the first we've heard of the Israeli military harnessing AI technology in 2021 it called its bombing campaign in Gaza the world's first AI War 1 month into this war the mil AR released a statement about its AI powered Target Factory and its ability to produce reams of Hamas targets rapidly the language in that statement the talk of precise attacks and minimal harm on civilians has been decimated by 972 journalism with the help of its sources current and former Israeli intelligence officials one told 972 the emphasis is on quantity and not quality others talked of the significance expansion of targets Beyond military ones the term the Israelis now use is power targets meaning public buildings universities schools hospitals libraries mass destruction that Israeli forces in Gaza have been proudly posting online prior to this war power targets were were were not so Central to military Doctrine and strategy the emphasis was really on Precision bombing but we're seeing those kinds of of limits on civilian deaths kind of go out the window with this new tactic of causing as much destruction and as much horror as possible to put pressure on Hamas what this means for gazin is that nowhere is actually safe from Israeli targeting and it goes to show how this current war is really shaped by a desire for revenge and retribution we have seen agonizing videos of fathers and mothers holding the dead bodies of their children and babies showing the rest of the world what Israel's Bank of targets look like the system um spits out hundreds of targets under the premise that those are Hamas or Islamic Jihad targets many of those so-called targets are just basic uh innocent civilian infrastructure to the family they were not doing anything suddenly air strike started targeting their houses this is so violent and so aggressive of what we're witnessing every single day in the go and what Israel considers military targets are used to according to the testimonies from Israeli officers instill shock and suffering on Palestinians in order to turn against Hamas to inflict as much violence and destruction uh among civilians and their infrastructure uh in order to weaken and eliminate uh the fabric of society the Israeli government from the defense minister to the prime minister minister to many other senior officials have said in plain terms that they hold the entire population of Gaza responsible for the October 7th attacks it's an entire nation out there that is responsible it's not true this rhetoric about civilians not not aware not involved it's absolutely not true and their action indicates that they are punishing that entire 2.2 million U population of Gaza for the actions of Hamas that is collective punishment that is a textbook War crime so this report does shed new light into what's taking place but it is in line with the actions and words of the Israeli government officials which have articulated a criminal intent to commit Mass atrocities having long developed the means to track and locate Gins Israel has been dropping leaflets on them ordering them in Arabic to leave their homes for so-called safe zones in the South which Israel has also repeatedly bombed one of the latest leaflets comes with a QR code that takes Palestinians to a map of Gaza carved up into numbered squares some safe some not one Aid worker likened it to a macabra game of battleships in which terrified civilians will be left guessing which Square will save their life the Israeli government has issued a QR code in a more detailed map that it says is aimed at uh facilitating the evacuations of civilians in Gaza but to provide a QR code to a population that's been under Relentless bombardment for two months that has had their access to to internet um to um electricity charge their phones cut is a sick joke the international humanitarian law is clear that state parties must take feasible precautions to protect civilians including issuing warnings but issuing a warning when there is no safe place to go in Gaza is not an effective warning and is not in compliance with International humanitarian law so the the the general purpose of this map is actually to avoid civilian harm and try to help them to move into s areas and I think that the way that this map is being perceived in some Outlets is missing the point it is about saving Palestinian lives because the IDF would have had a much easier life of Simply attacking that's coming from a former legal adviser to the Israeli military and the ministry of justice but it fails to square with reality the evidence on the ground the indefensibly high civilian death tolls the appalling number of children killed it is modern-day Israeli mythology like the line about Israel somehow having the most moral army in the world what Israel does have is the technology to enforce a system of domination over Palestinians what Amnesty International calls automated apartheid that includes artificial intelligence systems that Israel is using to help bomb Gaza back to the Stone Age while insisting that it helps save the lives of innocent Palestinians rather than making it easier to take them the Israeli government with or without um automation is carrying out grave abuses against um Palestinians they have systematically unlawfully killed Palestinians um in situations that go beyond what international humanitarian law authorizes they're increasingly not even going through the motions of showing why their actions comply uh with international law these are not accidents automating an approach that um authoriz IES unlawful killings certainly presents heightened risk of harm to civilians the Gaza Strip and the occupied Palestinian territories have become a testing laboratory in every sense of the word there is just simply no limitations to the extent that Israel can test these Technologies against Palestinians I think the objective is clear and that is the annihilation of of Palestinian in the Gaza Strip and making Gaza uninhabitable these technologies that are used now in Gaza we should probably upgrade the term from automated operti to automated [Music] genocide the release of Israeli hostages taken by Hamas and held captive since October 7th has created some challenges for the Netanyahu government in its messaging the Israeli media have gone wall to- wall with their coverage of this story story and minak shiravi is here with more Richard during the 7-Day pause in fighting late last month Hamas and Israel exchanged hostages the story has dominated Israeli headlines they released Israelis among them teenagers women and some elderly they've said that they were subjected to physical violence including beatings and degradation in Hamas captivity however some of the most explosive headlines have been their criticisms of the Israeli government leaked audio from a closed door meeting between the released hostages and prime minister Netanyahu and his cabinet showed just how acrimonious the encounter was Palestinian hostages many of them just young boys in their teens when they were taken in have also emerged with stories of life in Israeli prisons jailed without charges many have spoken about how they were deprived of basics such as food and warmth and repeatedly shocked humiliated and degraded by their Israeli captors going back to how the hostage narrative is unfolding in Israel until this past week the Netanyahu government had sought to control media interactions with abductees vetting people before they would go on air briefing them on talking points however the number of hostages released now has made them harder to control and with each testimony each pointed criticism this story has become harder to contain thanks MAA throughout this war Israel has said that its goal in Gaza is to destroy Hamas but Israeli attacks on Palestinians have also escalated on the West Bank where Hamas has no Authority or military presence that violence is usually provoked by Israeli settlers prior to October 7th almost 200 Palestinians had been killed on the West Bank in the past 10 months that number has more than doubled since Mariam baruti is a Palestinian journalist based in ramala she's been interviewed by multiple media Outlets about what's happening on the West Bank and in the war on Gaza and some of those exchanges like this one with the UK Channel Sky News have been tested dozens of Palestinians are killed we call it a Slaughter we have called it a Massac time yeah no no I'm talking about individual but could you just answered yeah if you would like to talk as a joural at least come with me with the right information please maram baru joins us now from rala Ms baruti that exchange that we just saw on Sky News in the interviews that you've done and the ones that you've seen on this topic since October 7th how typical was that that exchange that moment the way International journalists attempt to Trope Palestinians and delegitimize as well as deny the crimes against them has has not only become vicious in in the way that journalists are framing it like that interview but it has increased and become lethal in a way that it is a complete Pro genocidal stance by journalists that claim to be um objective that claim to be nonpartisan that claim to be supporting um the truth to support accurate accuracy for their audiences but it's not just common it is being encouraged by editors and policy makers whether directly or indirectly so you don't see that as someone not fully understanding the context and bringing the context to the interview you see that more as an intention absolutely as journalists it is our job to do our due diligence prior to bringing in anyone who is giving a testimony um so to claim ignorance requires you to quit your job and go and learn let's talk about the West Bank where you live it's always been heavily surveilled Hebron is often described as exhibit a in the modeling for automated Israeli apartheid what have you seen in the way of surveillance and NES escalation on the West Bank since October 7th of course we have seen an escalation of surveillance across the West Bank as well as for Palestinians with Israeli citizenship which we tend to negate from The Narrative of the ethnic cleansing happening but the surveillance within uh the West Bank is not just invasive it is at levels of being lethal first you collect the data you insert cameras on every single Street where you have five cameras on every corner keeping track of Palestinians you gather carplate numbers in a big database of every single Palestinian driving which car um to know the movement as we have seen many of the assassinations being carried out by the Israeli military are happening in people's cars what we are seeing now is just an escalation intensification and an embolden to carry out step number two of Israel's surveillance operation and that is kill who we find and this is all under the claim of having information for Palestinian Terror activities when in fact it's just Israel trying to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Palestinian will to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Palestinian morale in that it forego um the claim to Liberation the demands to be free and the end of the Israeli occupation since October 7th uh journalists from around the world have flown into the into the region a lot of them are still based in Israel some of them have embedded with the Israeli military to get into Gaza how difficult is it for journalists to get into the West Bank and for those who haven't been to the West Bank to cover the story what are they missing it's relatively difficult for journalists to enter the West Bank only in comparison to previous times but Israel is placing restrictions and is assigning things like minders to different Bureau Chiefs and international reporters in the region and that is someone that responds and operates under the command of the Israeli military to attempt and worse manipulate um as well as pressure journalists to cover in a certain angle or to deny information from audiences but nonetheless journalists still have the capacity to challenge this and come into the West Bank the persons that they are bringing on to speak on the situation are the very people that are committing the crimes against Palestinians that is Israeli military spokespersons um that is Israeli policy makers and settlers and at the same time negating the Palestinian testimony and if they do speak with Palestinians it is always an attempt to frame a two- Sidis but there is no two sides to this not just because it's a false equivalence between colonizer and colonized but because journalists are only showing one side and that is the Israeli side and unfortunately what we have seen more than that is a negation and a denial of the information and news that local journalists have as though that is inferior rather than recognizing that local journalists are the experts on this situation even though their lives are at increased risk um from Israeli repression as we have seen in their targeting and so these layers contribute to the misinformation these layers contribute to allowing Global complicity persist and sustain um what we are seeing in Palestine many Western and international media Outlets simply brand this as a war between Israel and Hamas how accurate is that framing given every everything that we've been hearing from Israeli officials on the record targeting civilians in Gaza how accurate is the framing how dangerous is it it is so dangerous to take what is happening to Palestinians and reduce it to the title of an Hamas Israel war this is not a war between Hamas and Israel this is a war against Palestinians so to frame it as that is a reductionist approach and it is an attempt to continue the illustration of Palestinians as terrorists because of the the association that was made of what Hass is we see the Israeli military they closed down a printing shop downtown ramala just this morning and the flyer on the door that they plastered was Hamas equals Isis so it goes to show you how manipulative that narrative is and then there's no mention of G being besieged for close to two decades there's no mention of the same thing happening in GDA right now has happened before at a smaller scale because what we have seeing is transcending all trends of violence that we Palestinians have witnessed or we have witnessed in the region since 1948 so to claim that it is a Hamas and Israel war is either an inability to actually do the due diligence and look into the context and explain that to your audience or it is intentional and that means you are being complicit in general S one last question for you we've seen some amazing journalism coming out of Gaza Palestinians too many of whom have paid with their lives uh making a name for themselves getting the recognition that they deserve can you give us a few names of some good follows of Palestinian journalists on the West Bank people whose work is worthy of our following you okay um do you need another moment take your time yeah just one sec take your time it's so difficult to speak about journalists here tell about it considering just the targeting yeah it's heartache and and as a reporter you know I think we forget that these are our peers and it also you know we're not advocating just for the protection of journalists but as reporters and journalists we're advocating for ourselves um to to remain safe but in terms of coverage I think there are multiple reporters and news organizations that are actually going against the grain and going against the restrictions that are being imposed by editorial policies abroad at least Al jazer has been doing incredible coverage um of what's been happening all across pales not just Les and the West Bank but in its entire context we there are organizations such as mise which has also been reporting excellent um imprint uh on the West Bank we have Middle East ey that has also been showcasing excellent reporting on the West Bank as well as highlighting and covering the disinformation and mistranslation that has been happening within International media organizations but I mean in in terms of individuals you can see the works of people like fat andan uh you can see the works of Muhammad although he is not here but he is able to amplify a lot of the coverage that is being sent from local journalists abroad but yeah I'm sorry I don't have maybe two specific names that's fine that's fine Mariam baruti thank you for joining us today here at the listening post thank you for having me one final note now on two Wars both still ongoing and the different way the players are portrayed in the mainstream news media at the end of 2022 Time Magazine revealed its person of the year Ukrainian
