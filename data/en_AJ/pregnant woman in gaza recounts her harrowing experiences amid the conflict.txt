I am afraid of the father as well.  The eighth or last, I tell you, O Lord, the next is on the ninth, God willing. God will keep you safe from us. But where do I want to go? I hope that I will return to my home. Me and my children are also a home that suffered in the war. When it first started, they burned it, they burned it all. After that, they gave it away.
