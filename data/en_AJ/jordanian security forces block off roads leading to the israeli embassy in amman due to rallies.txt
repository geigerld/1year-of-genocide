there have been protests around the world in support of the Palestinian people and some of the largest have been in Jordan's capital Osama bin Javed is in the Jordanian Capital Aman Osama what's the latest on the protest that we can see behind you well we're a few hundred meters away from the Israeli Embassy today what is different is that Jordanian authorities have uh blocked all roads that go towards the Israeli Embassy as in the last 48 hours you've seen these protests grow and grow and grow after that hospital attack in Gaza now they're being told to protest in the Square near one of the most popular mosques here and people have been coming here in numbers let me just move out of the shot so you can actually feel the energy of this crowd which was a few dozen people and now has grown to a couple of hundred people and more people are coming there's a large police presence here and as we've been witnessing in the last few days people are angry uh and this has become a an Avenue of expression for a lot of people that it becomes a Mourning space for them where they come and mourn their dead it becomes a concert at times where they play their music and then it also becomes an area where they show solidarity with the people of Gaza uh these many of these people more than 2 million refugees here in the Jordanian Capital uh have been displaced from the Palestinian territory so they have we spoke to one man who's lost multiple members of his family he stopped working because he said there is this cannot go on and he cannot function like this anymore so this is the atmosphere here in the Jordanian capital on the Diplomatic backdrop of the Jordanian King traveling to the City of Cairo meeting the Egyptian president and then also the German uh foreign minister here in the Jordanian Capital as well so a lot of effort from Arab countries who try and move uh the Israelis to seize uh the attacks on what they call civilian population to allow in Aid and that seems to be a difference between Western diplomatic push where the focus is on releasing prisoners and making sure that Hamas does not carry out any further attacks Al jair is AMA bin Javed live reporting on the protest that's behind you in the Jordanian capital I can bring you another uh Pro Palestinian protest live this is coming from the French capital in Paris where people are demonstrating you can see the uh you can see law enforcement in front of them that are blocking their way now several uh Pro Palestinian protests that were planned and that were scheduled have been cancelled by French authorities since the beginning of the Gaza War
