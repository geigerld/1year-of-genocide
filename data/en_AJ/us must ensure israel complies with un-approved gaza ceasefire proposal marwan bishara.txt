Jordan is hosting an emergency conference to coordinate the humanitarian response to Israel's war on Gaza US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is expected to attend and he's likely to hold talks with several Regional leaders including Jordan and Egypt un Secretary General Antonio geles says more humanitarian aid needs to be allowed in all available routs into Gaza must be operational and the land routs are absolutely crucial I also welcome all coordinated efforts to fully operationalize the mechanism to facilitate Aid into Gaza as mandated by Security Council resolution 2720 the international humanitarian response in RDA has been severely lacking with the delivery of Aid facing obstacles at every level humanitarian access cannot wait for a ceasefire and cannot be subject to the political agendas of any party you're watching oo we're bringing you live coverage of uh the conference that's being held in Jordan it's an emergency International Conference working on the humanitarian response to Israel's war on Gaza that was a round of applause that was just following a statement that had been made by US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin he said that the most important element of uh most important stage to be reached next was an immediate and uh com comprehensive ceasefire he was outlining the phases of the ceasefire that had been put forward by US President Biden and subsequently agreed on by the United Nations security Council he said however that one thing stands in the way of this deal happening it is Hamas he then called on all the members gathered around the uh the tables there to get Hamas to take uh to take the deal he then went on to say there was going to be a further $44 million that was going to be pledged by the United States to help Palestinians in Gaza and he outlined some uh stories of three children uh in Gaza who had been injured and had lost family members as a result uh of the Israeli action in Gaza now we can go to Maran bashara he's Al jazer senior political analyst he's joining us from Paris Maran I don't know how much of uh um Anthony blink's statement you were able to hear but I actually want to take you back to something that was said by King Abdullah of Jordan Jordan of course one of the hosts of this conference right at the start of this conference he said the people of Gaza are not looking for us to us for platitudes and speeches they need action and in many ways that sums up exactly the problem that this conference is going to face there's a lot of good intention if you like making it happen is going to be very difficult yes I think he is correct but nonetheless that's what we have a whole bunch of speeches and of course a bit too little and a bit too late for the people of Gaza most of those who are there in Aman of course have uh done not that much for the people of Gaza certainly they didn't do enough to stop the War uh on Gaza uh but he's also correct to say that uh humanitarian Aid should not be conditional to a ceasefire that uh in his words Aid should start flowing in medical and other humanitarian Aid regardless of what date uh the actual official ceasefire is reached so in a sense the necessity to end the war the necessity to uh save uh the millions in Gaza from the um breath of Israeli War is um you know never more important than today yes I did hear Rob I did hear the Secretary of State of course as usual rolling my eyes endlessly I'm worried about my eyes as I roll them endlessly listening to Blink there's something surrealistic about listening to an American president uh recounting the disaster that Gaza has become the destruction of hospitals and schools the death of people entire families uh as if they were not killed by American ammunition as if the United States did not block every attempt at an immediate and permanent ceasefire the past eight months but be that as it may now we all learned the lesson once again that when it comes to America it's either America's way or the highway that in as far as America is concerned America might is right and everything else is wrong and hence until America pass its own resolution taking in consideration a good number of um points by other countries including the algerians and apparently the Russians and the Chinese the resolution has passed and Hamas has welcomed it and yet the Secretary of State continues to emphasize that now it's only up to Hamas and that everyone needs to pressure Hamas to accept a ceasefire when in fact in fact not according to my opinion Hamas and others in Gaza have died for a ceasefire they have always been for the past eight months dying for a ceasefire to take place so if anything the people in Gaza including Hamas want a ceasefire more than anyone else including the United States and Israel the response that from Israel to the ruling by the UN Security Council was significantly muted compared to what we've seen in the past uh previous uh occasions Israel has been very very strongly worded uh in in its response to the way that uh some of those resolutions have been put forward before they've been uh voted on and only two of them have passed of course um given the fact that this is a more muted response is that a reflection of the fact that this is sponsored by the US does that kind of slightly box in the Israeli government when it comes to the way that it is going to be able to deal with uh or respond to this resolution well now that the proposal of a ceasefire uh leading eventually to a permanent ceasefire in the words blink has been adopted by the security Council enshrined uh in international law the Israelis have uh less wiggle room than before and the Americans have indeed succeeded in boxing their Ally uh into a bit of a corner now having said that being a student of the history of this conflict and of Israel's American attitude towards it we know that the Israelis have once and again rejected uh or somehow bypassed International including un Security Council resolutions in the past and I think they will probably try to do that again it will be up to the Americans to discipline them but judging from blinken's per usual excuses for Israel he is once again putting the omness on Hamas not on Israel when the Israelis wouldn't even come publicly and embrace the American proposal and the UN Security Council resolution and they haven't done so because they actually don't like it they certainly as our correspondent said um they don't like at least the third phase of it which actually calls for total withdrawals of Israel from the the uh occupied territories of Gaza and uh for eventually the establishment of two states with a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza these things are not to the liking of this Israeli government I think we will face um some major turbulences within the Israeli Poli in the days and weeks to come m as always thank you very much M Bashar Al jair's senior political analyst make sure to
