and let's remind you of our top story the Israeli Army is raiding gaza's largest hospital with thousands of civilians are Sheltering it says its forces are conducting an operation within specific areas of the shiffer compound earlier Hospital officials said Israel warned them that it would raid the facility within minutes air strikes have bombarded the area for days and tanks have now surrounded the hospital let's stay with us we're joined Now by r m a professor of international law at Queens University and he's also a former un official who served in Gaza thank you very much for your time what do you make of the statement from Hamas that the US government has essentially given Israel the green light to go into shiffer hospital because just hours before they did we heard from the US National Security spokesperson John Kirby who said that the US had its own evidence that Hamas operates from hospitals from alefa hospital despite not providing any evidence um but that air strikes on the hospital are not okay well look uh if the Israelis and the Americans have specific evidence uh to demonstrate that a civilian object in this case a shifa hospital has been converted into a military one it's incumbent upon them to produce that evidence and they have yet to do so and so when the attacking party in this case the Israelis claim something they have to produce the evidence and failure to do so results in one conclusion that the civilian character of the hospital is to be presumed under international law and therefore immune from Attack based on the information that I've been hearing over the course of this segment of your report the fact that the Israelis are physically in the hospital means that we're in a really sensitive time with thousands of people in the hospital uh civilians that is um and uh that means that it's only a matter of time that these Israelis will have an opportunity to produce this evidence um Israel's repeated claims that its military intelligence has evidence to substantiate um uh the fact that it's claims that the this hospital is being used as as a military uh base uh um have yet to be demonstrated and so absent that uh there's not going to be much to go on and Mr imai as we've been reporting Israel has never provided any evidence that Hamas uses hospitals to carry out operations and they haven't been verified by a third party but even if that was the case is there anything that justifies and we've been hearing from Human Rights Watch earlier in this program and they were saying that that nothing justifies the kind of attacks that we've seen on hospitals are we seeing war crimes unfolding in front of our eyes well we certainly have seen war crimes unfolding before our eyes over the course of this month um in respect of what's happening in shifa right now uh it's hard to say uh what we can say is that the object being a hospital is a civilian object and until such time as the Israelis provide proof that it has been converted into a military object that as I said earlier uh uh that civilian nature of the object does not change now the obvious thing to do of course is to allow a third party into the territory into the hospital the Israelis if they've got it surrounded by tanks have controlled the area and given the heightened sensitivities of their claim that this Hospital's been used by and abused by par Palestinian paramilitaries they should I I think reasonably invite third parties in there are third parties available the international Committee of the red cross the United Nations Commission of inquiry on Israel Palestine I'm certain that they would stand ready yeah um to enter the hospital to to corroborate any claims the Israelis make um but given the historical record of Israeli claims of this sort never having been proved uh by the Israelis or ex postao see the Goldstone report for instance of 2009 as an example or even most recently the the raid of the Israelis on the rentis hospital where film footage which I watched earlier today reports to show a list of Palestinian terrorists uh and so on all one needs to do is read that list in the Arabic language and you would see that it only shows the days the days of the week listed yeah yeah I mean so the claims really aren't substantiated and again as I say there's a major credibility problem for the Israelis they they claim their Military Intelligence demonstrates that this hospital has been used and is being used but as we speak even though as a basis of Palestinian paramilitary AC action and this is the same military intelligence that failed to identify or or anticipate the October 7th on it despite the credibility problem the there's also a great accountability problem is there not because this is not the first time that Israel has attacked hospitals and I'm not talking about um the first time since October 7th I mean Israel has been attacking hospitals for years has it ever being held accountable for that well the short answer is no it's not ever been held accountable because the International Community has not um uh uh made Israel and held Israel to account for it um as an occupying power Israel has an obligation to ensure the protection of the civilian population subject to its military occupation not to persecute it not to Target it it must treat it humanely and so on and we've seen the exact opposite take place over the course of the past month um while Israel may have had an obligation to protect its citizens from the attacks of 7 October it's gone well beyond anything proportionate or necessary to repel those attacks since October the 7th and for the past month has killed thousands over 11,000 Palestinians 45 over 4,500 Palestinian civilians and so on and yeah 4500 Palestinian children Mr Miz I'm so sorry to interrupt but we have run out of time but we thank you so much for being with us and sharing your expertise on the subject we really appreciate it
