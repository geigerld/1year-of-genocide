we've also heard from the UN Secretary General Antonio gutterz he condemned the attack on the hospital he's calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire I am horrified by the hundreds of people killed at alhi hospital this same day in Gaza by a strike that I strongly condemned earlier today I call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to provide sufficient time and space to help realize my St appeals and to Wi the Epic human suffering we are witnessing diplomatic editor James baze is now here on set good to have you with us back again James so is this attack on the hospital going to speed up the security council's issuing finally to issue a resolution I think we're going to have a resolution voted on in the coming hours It's Brazil That's come up with this resolution we had the 12 24 hours ago from Russia uh which was uh not supported by the majority of the security Council and the US were V were lobbying very strongly against that one this one has been significantly watered down because of us pressure and pressure from the US's close allies the UK and France it it originally called for an immediate ceasefire it's now changed that wording to humanitarian pauses now what I'm understanding is do that mean exactly then if we're not we heard the secretary General's call there for a Seas fire if the wording comes out for a human humanitarian pause what does well also the secretary General's wording was a humanitarian Ceasar again maybe not that probably means a non-permanent Ceasar what I think they mean by humanitarian pauses is a stop to allow some Aid to get into Gaza that's what has been the deal that's the UN have been working for and actually secretary blinkin has been working for some for for some days the US Secretary of State has been working on a basic deal which would be to try and get the Americans and other duel Nationals we think there're about 5 to 600 people who have American passports in Gaza they're all waiting at Rafa to get Rafa open to get them out and then to get some Aid particularly water into Gaza this is this this is the sort of um basis of the deal that that has been discussed uh and if there was a security Council resolution senior un officials tell me that they hope would be the final thing that could push this deal through why has it not happened so far it's because the Israelis say they are very concerned about what might come into Gaza with the aid they're concerned there might be weapons there might be ammunition uh and on the other side uh the Egyptians are very concerned about who actually would leave Gaza would the would the gates be stormed at Rafa would lots of people try and get out and they the Egyptians certainly do not want a mass displacement of people from Gaza into Egypt of course a lot of concern in this part of the world about once you get foreign Nationals out where does that leave the people but we'll leave that maybe for another discussion for now thanks so much James baz for coming in and chatting with us
