well gersan Baskin is Middle East director with the international communities organization he joins us live now from West jeruslem why go into Rafa at all well there there are two things that are may be going on right now this might be the launch of the Israeli incursion into Rafa that the Israeli government and army have been speaking about now for several months where they believe that in order to defeat Hamas finally they need to eliminate the four Hamas brigades that between kanun and Rafa and it is also believed by Israel that this is where the majority of the Israeli hostages 132 of them may be found um but it might not be the full incursion right now it might just be a response to the launching Yesterday by Hamas of mortars and Rockets from a humanitarian Zone into Israel in which three Israeli soldiers were killed and 10 others were wounded several of them in critical condition so I mean Netanyahu has said I mean he has said that he's going into Rafa because he needs to destroy the four remaining Hamas battalions that are there um he has indicated that there's no way uh that they need to go there to access Hamas but I suppose um saying that in itself acknowledges that uh the last seven or eight months has been something of a failure because they've not destroyed Hamas and they've not provided any of the sort of assassinations of high level figures within the group so suppose that the worry is that uh military operation being a complete failure up to now will simply cause more uh humanitarian suffering in in Rafa right there there is no military victory in in a war like this and Israel needs to understand this um Hamas is an idea and an ideology that cannot be destroyed by military there have to be political solutions to deal with the reality of Hamas and the reality of Gaza and this is not being done but I would also say to Hamas that if they want to prevent the Israeli incursion into Gaza more death and destruction unnecessarily death and destruction hamash should accept the deal that's on the table now even if it doesn't meet all of their demands because it will bring about a ceasefire and a halt to the war for weeks maybe months and certainly ham Hamas did indicate that it would forgive me Hamas did indicate that they would agree to the Egyptian proposal and move ahead with the first stage but they were relying on guarantees that the war would end and then there would not be an invasion of Hamas which of course Netanyahu said would happen regardless of whether or not there's a deal right but I I think that there won't be guarantees no one can provide those guarantees and Hamas wants Israel to declare that it will end the war and that's not going to happen so we're in a deadlock situation where Israel is is continuing on with the war and the military incursion into Gaza into Rafa and this should be avoided if Hamas just said yes now they will get Palestinian prisoners freed there will be a ceasefire there will be free movement for displaced people in Gaza to move from the south to the North and the Egyptians and the qataris have all said that they will work hard together with the Americans and others to ensure that the war will not be renewed there's no guarantee there's no re the best chance there's no reason to believe that Palestinians would be released and they would displaced people would be able to return I mean you've seen the incredible apocalyptic destruction of this tiny strip of land where now a population of a couple of hundred thousand in Rafa has become one and a half million because of people who've haded to shelter there an invasion would ultimately push those people South towards Egypt you know they could try to return as you're say I guess you're saying they could try to return to Central or Northern Gaza but of course you know that they would face more attacks by the Israeli military which has been attacking so-called safe zones they they kill everyone everywhere well I I think that as I said the best way to prevent this from happening and to end the war is to begin with a ceas fire that will release Israeli hostages and release Palestinian prisoners and allow people free movement there is no guarantee that would that would be the end of the war and there would be no more provocations not from Hamas and not from Israel but the best way to move forward at this point is to accept the Egyptian deal that's on the table even if it's less than perfect get a ceasefire and allow people the freedom to move a little bit to breathe a little bit to get food and medical supplies that they need again there are no guarantees here we're in the midst of a very very evil War but this needs to come to an end Israel is not willing to surrender Hamas is not willing to surrender there is a ceasefire offer on the table I suggest we all accept it and try to figure out how to end this war as soon as possible Goan Basin thank you for joining us on the newsour thank
