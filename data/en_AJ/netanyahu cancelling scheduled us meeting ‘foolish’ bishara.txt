she's in occupied East Jerusalem for us hamda so how did we hear that Israel had changed its mind on this initially Anonymous American officials had spoken to Israeli media saying that indeed Israel's prime minister's office had reached out to the White House to reschedule this visit by an Israeli delegation when elz reached out to the prime minister's office they said they had no comment on the matter however the White House press secretary Karen jeanpierre confirming this afternoon in a briefing with press saying that the Israeli Prime Minister's office did reach out to the White House and they are looking at a date that is convenient for both parties and when that date is reached there will be an announcement from the White House but it's interesting because earlier on Wednesday the Israeli Prime Minister had essentially boasted about cancelling this meeting not only because the US didn't use their veto power in the UN security Council when there was a measure calling for a ceasefire in Gaza that was both lasting and sustainable but the Israeli Prime Minister also said it was a message to Hamas that in the face of international pressure Israel is not going to Cave even if it's from pressure from Israel's biggest Ally like the United States now the Americans were quite upset about the cancellation of this visit in fact the National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby spoke to Israeli media tonight and said that the Americans were hoping to hear from Israel counterparts on how exactly they plan to invade gaza's Southernmost city of raah and what exactly they plan to do when it comes to evacuating nearly one and a half million Palestinians who were asked to go there by the Israeli Army as the rest of the Palestinian territory was being besieged the Israeli Prime Minister has said that with or without American support this invasion in raah is going to happen but it shows you the changing Dynamics between the two allies and how the United States has spoken quite publicly about being against this ground invasion in TFA saying that it would clearly be a mistake but the Israelis remain adamant that it is simply going to happen so this meeting with the Israeli delegation as requested by the American President Joe Biden will take place at a future date okay thank you for that update ham salute there for us in occupied East Jerusalem let's return to Al jaz's senior political analyst Maran bashara what do you read into what's going on here Netanyahu now reversing course and wanting to reschedule the meeting with the United States I think he understands that he made a mistake it was foolish stupid shortsighted on his part and in fact some of his own uh Coalition Partners like uh Gans called him out on it he said this was wrong what You' done we cannot uh give up on and we cannot turn our back to and we cannot humiliate our uh patrons our partners our protectors our Bankers right in Washington the Biden Administration and I think uh Nan realized that and he wants to uh reverse uh what he has done but instead of doing it diplomatically as he should have honestly as he's not capable of by saying I made a mistake he instead lied as usual you know birds fly snakes bite nanahu lies it's his nature he's a liar pathological liar everyone knows him to be a liar his own Partners it's not my words his own Partners call him Liars one of his ministers smri called him the liar of all liars so he resorts to lies now for long he believes America is stupid he thinks America stupid and he tells the Israeli public openly that only I can have America I know how to he actually said that I know how to manage America winking at Israeli settlers that he knows how to do it and in fact America did act numerous countless times stupidly when it comes to Israel I don't know for some reason American officials go Gaga when it comes to Israel and at any things are stupid but at this point five months into an unraveling genocide on TV screens in the United States and elsewhere the Biden admistration decided that it's time to wind down the war to D to down to tone down that genocide so they actually abstained for for a United Nation resolution where the entire International Community came and said the war must stop so Netanyahu was angry at that because Netanyahu thinks Biden takes orders from him he thinks America takes orders from Israel the little Rog State that's dependent on the United States has been giving the Biden admistration orders the past five months what to do what not to do how to behave how much money they should send how much arms they should how they need to vote which bases they should build in the Middle East and not and so on so forth well the Biden Administration has got bit tired of this genocide of getting the bad WAP for it terrible standing in the world and in the region and so on so forth so now n is trying to fix it right by Lying by deceiving by meeting with Republican Senators like Scott uh Rick Scott that he was talking to about that that this was a message to Hamas I don't think M Hamas got the message because they didn't think it was for them I don't think anyone in the United States believed that not sending two invoice to Washington was a message to Hamas everyone understood it was a message to Biden Netanyahu knew it was a message to Biden guns who told him you shouldn't do that knew it was a m so by so natan's lying about it again he fixes a lie with another lie with another lie thinking that he can always deceive a world that has basically look the other way as Israel carried on with this genocide we will see if the Biden Administration keeps it cool does not receive these two envoys and decides to slap Israel with sanctions but then you know that's probably wishful too well we'll have to see thank you for that alera senior it's GL this Maran bashara there
