speak to Al jazer senior political analyst Marwan bishar Marwan is joining us from Paris let's first talk about the meeting with Trump and Netanyahu Maran what are netanyahu's political calculations as he meets with the Democratic Leadership as we've seen and he's now expected to meet with the Republican presidential candidate I think he would like to play on their differences and try to get in as much as possible from either party I think clearly he's for the time being has to uh hedge his he doesn't know who's going to win in 3 months and so he's going to have to appease both parties as he did in his speech to Congress by speaking so kindly to uh Biden's uh support for his war crimes and speaking so kindly to Trump's uh violation of international law by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel capital and the Golden Heights as Annex Israeli territory so he's trying his best to appease both parties so he wouldn't be accused once again as he was in 2015 when he spoke then to Congress of being a very divisive figure and taking the Republican side he's trying this time to be a bit more clever his problem is that all three that he's met or will be meeting also Trump meaning camea Harris Joe Biden and Donald Trump are telling him to finish up and in Florida he's going to be hearing that from Trump finish up except that my guess is that Trump will probably try to sell it as it's his idea he will say it quite loud in public and once there is a ceasefire he will claim to be his own achievement yeah Marana and speaking of I mean finishing up we also heard comments from Harris who said that she will not be silent on the suffering in Gaza and it was time to end the war but then also reiterated her commitment to Israel and out of is Israel there's been some Furious reaction to her comments I'm accusing her of showing gaps between the positions of the US and Israel is there any reason to believe in your opinion that policy towards Israel under a haris presidency will change I think there will be a bit of a Nuance look uh what what Biden has done the past 10 months it's really almost unprecedented I mean the foolishness the Folly and the farce of his support unconditionally for a genocide the way he did that's really unprecedented I'm not sure even even a Trump would do it I'm not sure a Harris would do it I'm not sure anyone will or should be doing it because he really went out of his way in every possible way not to support Israel and here is the Nuance the Nuance is not just about the supporting Israel it's about supporting a fascist fanatic government that's involved in war crimes and is on trial for genocide at the international court of justice so so the issue here for CA Harris is can she show support for Israel as traditionally is the case in America from everywhere you know from Obama back to Reagan but at the same time show enough um Independence and rationality to be able to criticize the Israeli government and that's where her phrase but I won't be silent I will support Israel but I won't be silent about the policies the war crimes Etc of its government and I think this Nuance is important and she probably would be capable or is capable of doing that because she's not again she's not as ideological as Biden she's not as Zionist as Biden and she's not as interventionist terms of Middle East and elsewhere as Biden she's far more pragmatic I would say right and when it comes to the UK mwan is it now going up against the US when we've heard this announcement just earlier this hour the UK saying that it will not pursue its objection anymore to the international criminal court who's issuing arrest warrants for the Israeli leaders and how significant is this you know I'm GNA tell you uh my educated guest based on my instinct more than any specific information but just judging from uh K stammer talking to Biden and where Biden is today in terms of his relationship with Nan and what I just told you in terms of distinguishing between supporting Israel and and supporting Netanyahu I would say the labor government in Britain is just simply doing something that is just basic right meaning un stupid the stupid policy of sunak by getting involved in something that is absolutely none of UK's uh business I mean the IC will decide what the icc's business is it doesn't need London or the sunna government to tell it what its business is and that's what the labor government is saying and I think in this case the labor in the UK like the Democrats in Washington whether it's Canada hris or Biden understand that supporting Israel is not the same as supporting this Reckless war criminal called Nel and and slowly but surely they are learning the lesson that you can support Israel if you want but don't tie your political future and certainly don't tie your credibility and standing in the Middle East and in the rest of the world by coupling your policies to that of a war criminal called Benjamin n all right thank you so much Bish joining us from Paris thank you
