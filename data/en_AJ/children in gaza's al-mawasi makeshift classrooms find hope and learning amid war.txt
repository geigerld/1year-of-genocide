class is underway in Alma wasi refugee camp on Southern gaza's Coastline these young minds have witnessed Untold Horrors but for a couple of hours a day their attention is focused on their teacher and their classmates I came here to study and to learn coming here will help me achieve my dreams I I'm here to learn and be more active I like going to school very much there's no shortage of eager students and the simplest thing like learning how to draw can transport a child's imagination far beyond the walls of a tent yesterday the teacher taught me maths in Arabic I also learned how to draw a fruit basket because I like fruit so much I haven't had any fruit for 3 a radan is a teacher at hop maker school where pen and paper are scarce but enthusiasm and dedication are in abundance our conditions here are very difficult there is no Blackboard we try to help children in the simplest ways we will not let them down alasi is a narrow strip of land just a kilometer wide and 14 km long there's no running water electricity or sanitation not ideal conditions in which to live or learn but teachers like these are determined to make a difference we focus on three study areas psychological care values and principles and education and skills despite all the difficulties and the lack of almost every we have managed to teach 480 children in 41 The Familiar Buzz of Israeli drones in the sky above is drowned out ever so slightly by a physical education class for a moment it's children being children again and the devastation and grief of the war seems far away mik lle Al jaer joining us now is Ricardo Perez he's a spokesman for the un's children's agency unan joins us live now from the Jordanian capital and man good to have you with us Mr Perez on the program just to clarify are there any working schools in Gaza at all thanks for having me no not at all since seven months now nearly eight children have had no continuous access to education or schools schools have become shelters in fact and sometimes have been under attack so no there is no education system right now functioning in Gaza and we're doing our best as it was shown in the segment which is uh very hopeful to see uh to keep children safe um and continuously learning a little bit uh bit by bit but there is no safety for them to do that and no infrastructure and no right conditions sure I mean how is the ability then to teach youngsters obviously has become more and more difficult since October the because you've got a lack of facilities on one side a shifting of the educational um parameters you might say because of safe zones or evacuation zones however the Israelis want to describe them and then I presume a lack of teachers because as time has gone on there have been some I'm sure that have been killed injured or escaped yeah absolutely before October 7th we had 22,000 teachers in average working in the Gaza Strip uh to help those 625 thousand students to learn and Thrive hopefully looking at their Futures but right now lacking infrastructure and indeed the safety to to do so uh became became a huge uh huge impediment for us we were trying to get 50 tents through into Rafa before the incursion to start a a very sort of formal basic education space for children in average 150 per turn but then we had to hold those plans because the military offensive started and again hundreds of thousands of people had to evacuate again to alasi an area where it's basically sand dunes and very hard to set up such an infrastructure so education is again at he which jeopardizes their present and their future and I suppose the infrastructure for Education comes down the priority list doesn't it when food water and Medicine are high up on the agenda for Aid agencies like the UN to try and get food to get those sort of supplies into the region so one wonders how teaching itself has had to change to make sure that children of all ages get some sort of I suppose sense of normality and that they get the education they need for their age bracket I mean there are so many moving parts and so many things to consider when a child comes in front of you and one is 15 and the other one is three absolutely and it's a sad reality one that we're trying to manage day after day but right now we're worried about their safety for first and foremost and as you mentioned to make sure that they have enough food water medicines and Health Care um and psychosocial support as well because we can say safely that every single child in the Gaza Strip today is traumatized after seven nearly eight months of horror so we're trying again to create these safe spes spaces to give them that the psychosocial support that they so desperately need but it's it's very difficult under the circumstances now when multiple displacement displacements keep happening and safety again is is a big issue so this is not only a war on children on their present but on their future no schools are functioning all universities have been destroyed so what are they going to look forward to and we're trying to make sure that at least that very basic formal education of numeracy and literacy can continue and that they feel safe to be children again you very conveniently came to my next question which is about the trauma because you can't ignore the environment these children are in so one presumes that those teachers that are still surviving so to speak have become social workers too they need that support as well don't they from agencies like yourself because they're not just teachers anymore now they've most probably come the nearest thing to a parent for some of those children who we do know have become orphans as well absolutely they've become survivors like every other child in the Gaza Strip who are struggling to live day after day and not knowing what tomorrow would look like they thought in Rafa they would have the allegedly safe space to to wait until there's a ceasefire and and this horror ends but again they were forced out into alasi D balak and the rubbles and and the remains of KH units and every single teacher is now indeed a social worker a parent to Children who've been separated from their parents or who've lost their parents and we know many thousands have so it it's a completely different scenario for them education now has become an activity that goes Way Beyond books and maths and numbers and history but moreover it psychos social support is making sure that children feel safe and that they can still hope and dream of a future which right now seems uh very very far away well I hope we'll be able to invite you back um to talk about how things have improved as and when they do uh in the not too distant future Ricardo perz from the un's children's agency UNICEF thank you sir thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
