an unprecedented sight Israeli police raid El jaz's workspace in occupied East Jerusalem after prime minister Benjamin netanyahu's cabinet voted to shut down the Network's operations the government order which was unanimously agreed upon includes confiscating its broadcast equipment preventing the Network's broadcast and blocking its websites government has now unanimously ordered the closure of the incitement mouthpiece of Hamas in Israel Al jazer Al jaz's broadcast was taken off Israel's main cable provider in the hours after the order the emergency measure will last for 45 days with the possibility of an extension for an additional 45 days in a statement Al jaaz media Network condemned the measure saying in part Israel's ongoing suprem of the Free Press seen as an effort to conceal its actions in the Gaza Strip stands in contravention of international and humanitarian law Israel's direct targeting and killing of journalists arrests intimidation and threats will not deter Al jazer from its commitment to cover whilst more than 140 Palestinian journalists have been killed since the beginning of the war on Gaza the network vehemently rejects the allegations presented by Israeli authorities suggesting professional media standards have been violated last month the White House said Israel's plans to close the network were quote concerning a move like this is concerning we believe in the freedom of the press it is critical it is critically important and the United States supports the critically important work journalists around the world do and so and that includes those who were reporting in uh in the conflict in Gaza the widely criticized move was also condemned by the Foreign Press Association which urged the Israeli government to reverse what it called a harmful step adding that this was a dark day for the media and a dark day for democracy ham salut Al jaaz ha matar is executive director of plus 972 magazine which provides independent commentary and news from Israel and Palestine uh sir you're joining us from Tel Aviv thank you for your time today your thoughts first on this decision by the Israeli government to shut down alaz in Israel I think first of all it's clearly a a criminal and very dangerous decision an attack on free speech and the freedom of press um it's also an attack mostly on Israeli citizens because I think the two main things that are going to happen alongside the attack on Al jaer journalists which are also of course victims of this will be one that while Al will be able to continue reporting around the world they will not be able to do reporting within Israel so the voices of Israeli uh Society um will be heard Less on Al zero because of this so this is one harm to the Israel Society the other is uh making it more difficult to hear different voices um we have very limited access to information coming out of Gaza in Israeli media Outlets and I think it's essential for Israelis to have other media Outlets to go to and and check and read and see and view uh to get information that is not there in Israeli sources but big picture what's this going to change I mean granted our teams in Israel you know Tel Aviv Jerusalem they can't work um but we're still here we're still going to report the news uh the rest of the world can still see us outside of Israel so what's the point I think there are two points one is uh to make it more difficult for Israelis to see uh which I think is more important for for the government than um what the rest of the world sees the other is basically serving the base we have this issue that netan and his party In the far right um have been failing this war this is you know fact I'm not even talking about the massacre of tens of thousands of Palestinians the ethnic Ling the destruction all of that um but even even from an Israeli perspective after 7 months people are saying the hostages most of them aren't back many of them are dying U it doesn't seem like there's a victory at hand so doing something like this is a way to appease the base to say look we're doing something to fight our enemies and let's pin all our failures on Al jazer just like we would on um students in US campuses do you see them at some point reversing this decision because interestingly the law the way the the law is structured um this decision is applicable for 45 days but then they would have to renew it if they want to keep um Banning Al jazer from Israel in a month and a half yes and and it is subject to um Court supervision so it'll be very interesting to see what happens when we go to the courts I'm not putting a lot of faith in that process I don't see them reversing this measure in the near future uh unless this is uh some sort of uh aoy within negotiations and what the government may think is a tool to pressure the Qatari government um in the negotiations for the release of hostages if that's the case maybe they will reverse it as part of the deal for ceasefire but um I have to say I'm very pessimistic about the degree to which the Israeli government is interested in such a deal and therefore I'm also not very optimistic about reversing this decision okay hagay matar executive director of Plus 972 magazine thank you very much for your time today thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaaz
