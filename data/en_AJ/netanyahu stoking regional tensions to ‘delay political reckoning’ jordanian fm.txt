I'm pleased to say joining us from Aman is Jordan's Minister of Foreign Affairs Ian Safi foreign minister welcome to aler it's good to have you with us first of all I'd like to start with both those attacks in Iraq and in Syria given the ongoing very high tensions in the region and attacks going from the Red Sea all the way to the border with Lebanon what's your view about what's going on the dangers of this spilling over into something more fundamental well sir from from the very beginning we warned that this aggression on Gaza carries the very serious risk of spilling over into the rest of the region added to that now that the Israeli Prime Minister might be uh consciously provoking uh confrontations on other fronts particularly with Lebanon and other parts of the region to delay the political Reckoning that he will have to face and also to navigate around the differences that we're seeing emerging with the United States and others in terms of what the vision for the future is so to uh belittle the impact of that difference with the US and others and to delay the political Reckoning prime minister Netanyahu might be uh working towards uh provoking other fronts uh to which he would drag the west and then uh we'll be looking at a very uh very very serious uh escalation of indeed so so foreign minister what is Jordan what are Arab states doing to try and prevent that spill over and frankly is it enough well I mean we're doing everything we can but ultimately it is the Israeli government it's Israel that is defying not just the will of the Arabs but the will of the whole International Community when it continues with ag with the its aggression and I think we're working with all our partners the day after tomorrow I'll be uh visiting with all European foreign ministers along with the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia and Egypt uh to try again and rally support not only for ending the aggression but to make sure that uh we all come together for behind a plan that would uh end occupation and put the uh the region on an irreversible path towards peace uh here we're faced with an Israeli government that is defying the inter the International Community that continues with its violation of international law that continues to uh push the region towards the abys of regional war and uh we have an International Community that yet uh to come and demand unequivocally an end of of Israel Wars and ultimately we'll have to face the very difficult question which is if the whole world including the United States is saying that the only path forward is a path that would fulfill the rights of the Palestinians to freedoms and statehood on the basis of the two-state solution and the Israeli government is saying no and is defying them then what what is going to be to the response is it more service to the two-state solution or is it a a real plan supported by a real will where is that where with respect where is that plan coming from where is that plan coming from I mean many would say that the Arab State should be doing a lot more to try and make that happen uh we are uh in consultation with a lot of our brethren in the region uh we have the ideas we're articulating our plans and basically what we want is uh the a plan that would start from the end game I.E it starts by recognizing the independent Palestinian State on the basis of June 4 1967 lines with occupied Jerusalem as capital and then with the rest of the internation Community we walk back on measures that would take us there we cannot engage in another open-ended process because we've seen what that has done in the past so we and the Arab world to do our share now we're looking and we're talking to uh our friends in the International Community particular particularly to the United States uh to come and Lead an effort that would take us down okay and on the United States the Biden Administration has been forthright in the need for a two State solution publicly at least something that the Israeli Prime Minister said could never happen yet after a phone conversation between Biden Netanyahu yesterday uh Joe Biden said the creation of an independent Palestinian State uh was still possible while Benjamin Netanyahu is still in office do you think that is the case I think it's very clear that prime minister n who never wanted a two-state solution even before yesterday he said he's proud he had prevented the establishment of the Palestinian State earlier he said he had suffocated the aspirations of of Palestinians for Freedom so we're dealing with a with a prime minister who now tactically delaying the war to prolong his term in office but but is acting on an agenda that does not want to see the two-state solution and and that's a challenge that the whole world is going to face either we allow uh this government with its radical racist extremist agenda to Doom the future of the region to more conflict or war or we all come together and say we will not allow Netanyahu to uh determine the future of this region just as he doomed the past of the region to more conflict and if I may just another issue that we should not lose sight of is that as we talk about the future we need to remember that the Israeli aggression on Gaza is continuing the killing of Palestinians is continuing the destruction of of the whole infrastructure of Gaza including the he Health infrastructure is continuing and only two two days ago on Wednesday Israel attacked our own field Hospital one of very very few hospitals that are offering services to the Palestinians even though Israel knows the coordinates of the hospital it knows that this is a hospital Man by Jordanian uh uh medical staff uh and and and yet it went ahead and directly targeted the hospital so that speaks to a systematic Israeli policy of trying to make life impossible for people in Gaza and then ultimately fulfill its declared objective of many of its ministers to push gazans out so as we so given that given that foreign minister given your position and given the position the state of position of Arab states why is it that it came down to South Africa to uh take Israel to court over genocide uh to the international court of justice over genocide and and not say Jordan or other Arab states we're we we've come very clearly supporting the case that Africa took to the icj I think it's very important with the symbolism that South Africa has that the case was presented by South Africa and uh the court has its own procedures and at the right time uh when uh the time comes for uh member states to make their interventions we will make that but I think again it's extremely symbolic extremely important extremely powerful that the state that the case was uh was was raised by by South Africa and all of us in the Arab and Muslim world when we met in Saudi Arabia in the joint Arab and Muslim Summit we've entrusted the both secretariats of both the league and the o to prepare all the legal documents that we will use going forward so I I think uh we have a plan here and we're acting in accordance with it and if the Court decides for uh provisional measures uh and then goes forward to examine the case then uh all of us I believe and I can speak for Jordan now uh will be doing what we to do and and submit uh uh uh cases could you expand on what doing what you need to do means and and what uh the result of your talks with Palestinian Authority and the Egyptians and and further talks that you're going to have that you've talked about and how you would collectively respond to the concept of Israeli control a total Israeli control west of the Jordan River I mean we we've always rejected that uh we always said that this would only mean War so any Israeli propositions particularly by this government uh to maintain control over the occupied Palestinian territories including Gaza and East Jerusalem is something that we've always stood against and we'll continue to stand against and we'll continue to Rally public opinion to see to understand the danger inherent of allowing nanaho to proceed with his policies uh as I said we're all working to put forward proposals we're alreadying consultation it's not a question of plans to be honest it's a question of will the will of Israel to reengage in a serious negotiations to achieve peace and the will of the International Community to take action against Israel if it continues to deny this region uh the the the the peace that it deserves on the court S as I said uh we support the case that South Africa have have made uh we will submit when the time for submissions of the legal arguments comes and we the court procedures on that all right for a minister one more question uh Israel has so far ruled out calls for to allow the international recognize Palestinian Authority to govern both gazra and the occupied West Bank that is apparently Washington's preferred option where do Jordan stand we stand I mean as we said from the very beginning uh Gaza is part and partially of the occupied Palestinian territory any discussion of Gaza and the day after has to be part and parcel of a broader approach that would include the occupied W bank and occupied Jerusalem and we do not accept any Israeli presence in Gaza nor do we accept any Israeli control of any parts of Gaza this has been the argument that we've made from the very beginning this is the position that we're rallying support for and let me just add one thing and and this is something that for for for the world to recognize even the US which is providing Israel with support says Israel has to conduct the aggression in accordance with international law it's not it says the Israel has to allow sufficient humanitarian supplies into Gaza it is not it says the only path forward is a two-state solution that would realize a Palestinian state the Palestinian government is saying no it will not allow that so I think it should be clear to the whole world now which party is responsible for the terror that has been engulfing our part of the world which party is responsible for denying our region the peace it deserves and which party is driving this conflict further into abys and we've got to remember as Israel continues with its aggression on Gaza it is also conducting a quieter war in the West Bank where it is suffocating the Palestinians economically it's denying them the right to free worship both Muslims and Christians it is killing Palestinians arresting Palestinians and we have to remember that Ramadan is around the corner and that's a month where where we always have worked against the flare up of violence but in this kind of condition I think the W the West Bank was boiling and and if the West Bank explodes under the pressure from Israeli aggressive policies then I think we'll be talking about a much much much dangerous scenario which would even have POS the more serious threat of dragging us all into a regional expansion of the of this world all right Jordan's Minister of Foreign Affairs I Minister fi thank you thank you sir
