all right let's get more on the uh Al's Hospital situation in Gaza we can speak now to nabal fak who's a spokesperson for the Palestine red crescent Society joins us live now from rala uh Nebel thank you for joining us here on aler I know things are very busy to say the least um so we have the situation where Israel tells effectively 14,000 people taking shelter at the hospital to evacuate plus hundreds of patients plus all the staff and doctors and so forth uh we understand that they have stayed put uh meanwhile we've just been watching pictures of huge flares uh erupting and lighting up the night sky above the hospital there's been constant bombardment around the hospital what are your thoughts at this moment so since the morning the Palestine red crescent has received serious threat from Israeli occupation forces demanding immediate evacuation for ALDS Hospital H because it is going to be bombarded uh we have inside the hospital around 500 patients many of them are in the Intensive Care Unit connected to life support machines as well as oxygen there is a babies and incubators and there is absolutely no way to evacuate them safely we have around 14,000 civilians most of them are children and women who have suit Refugee inside the the hospital because simply they don't have anywhere uh to go after Israel forced them to evacuate their homes because of this intense bombardment that is taking place all over Gaza and the north that's why they sought Refugee inside the hospital thinking that they would be in a safe place unfortunately this is not the case now we're talking about at least 100 medical staff as well as 500 patients uh many of them are in critical conditions all the Intensive Care Unit now now have children who have been bombarded inside their homes and they are in critical injuries uh this is along with 14,000 Palestinian civilians inside the hospital all of them under the threat of being bombed at any second due to this Israeli threats Israel occupation forces and not only say that it also said either you're going to evacuate or then the Palestine red present will hold responsible for the lives of people inside the hospital right and just to clarify evacuation we'll come on to that SEC but just to just to clarify so we've got 100 medical staff 500 patients and many of them on uh life supports in intensive care units for babies on incubators and so forth 14,000 civilians mostly women and children all there and can we just confirm that all those people are still in the confines of the hospital yes 14,000 civilians are inside the hospital they don't have anywhere to go many of them have already lost their homes during this intense bombardment many others they simply don't know where to go since there is no safe place in gazda they were unable to evacuate themselves to the South due to this intense bombardment that is taking place all over Gaza and around the clock they BAS basically don't have transportation there is no Transportation there is as well complete destruction of the roads and infrastructure that's why they only sought Refugee to the nearest hospital that what what there was able to do so they thought they will be in a safey place but unfortunately this is not the case because in Gaza there is no protection for anything although according to the international humanitarian law civilians medical facilities and medical personnel should be protected according to the international humanitarian law as we have seen due to this Israeli threats this is not the case it seems Israel is above the international humanitarian law it's also above all International laws that's why we call on the International Community to intervene immediately to stop the evacuation order against alud hospital and against all other hospitals in Gaza Strip you should stand for a he Humanity thousands of lives is at rest urgent action should be taken to ensure the protection of civilians medical personnel and Medical Teams as well as all medical facilities according to the international humanitarian law let me just come in there a second let me just come in there a second if a crime happened it would not be only the crime of Israel I I can't imagine let me just jum let me just come in there for a second and continue threatening our hospitals no I understand the situation and I can't at least from AF far but I can't imagine how it must be for all those people 14,000 people 500 patients mostly women and children there how it is for them not knowing what is about to happen with the potential for a direct targeting of the hospital have you managed to speak to your people at the hospital and if so what have they said to you absolutely many of them they have said we're going to stay with you because simply we don't have any other place to go to could you imagine 14,000 people civilians most of them children and women along with elderly people people with disabilities only lying on the corridors of the hospital with nothing they simply have nothing they are lacking very basic humanitarian need whether food water or or even anything they simply share with us the same facility the same everything trying just to so um safe shelter for them for themselves and for children but unfortunately they are also now under the threat of being bombed due to Israeli occupation forces threatening of bombing alud hospital this is simply should be not acceptable this is a war crime hospitals medical personnel uh civilians should be protected according to the international humanitarian law and this International Community should intervene immediately and save Al's hospital we appeal to the International Community we appeal to the world leaders to stop the evacuation order against al hospital and all hospitals in Gaza and save lives of thousands of civilians who are now under the threat of being bombed at any second we know this is not only threats we have witnessed and warned earlier that Israel is is is going to do the this threats it happened earlier with alah hospital we don't want another Max Maser to be happened at Al hospital please stop another Max masery to happened in Al Hospital Nebel we appreciate your time thank you so much for talking to us Nebel far from the Palestine red crescent media and communication officer there uh we're monitoring the situation very very closely of course and uh bring you updates as when we get it no in the meantime thanks a lot
