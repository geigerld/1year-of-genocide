more than two dozen Palestinian journalists have called for fellow journalists to boycott the White House correspondence association dinner they say the Biden Administration is complicit in Israel's systematic killing of Palestinian journalists since Israel's war on Gaza began last October the Israeli military has killed 142 media workers and journalists 40 Palestinian journalists have been arrested by the Israeli military and the committee to protect journalists says that 2023 was the deadliest year for journalists in a decade 34 of the journalists killed worldwide were Palestinians reporting on the war in Gaza now to Al jazer is hinari hin you're joining us over the phone from Daryl Bala in central Gaza you're one of the signatories of the letter that has called on the white house uh the US White House correspondence to boycott tonight's dinner I don't know whether you were able to hear that interview with shihab I'm going to keep it simple you have um been through something that in covering this war since day one that very few journalists on earth have ever experienced and that includes War correspondence why don't you tell us what it's been like for you to cover this war well I don't know if I have the words to describe what I have been going through since October 7 this is not something that has been ending it have been continuous every single day for more than days we have been killed displaced homeless and we're not only reporting on this but we're also living it with every single detail we're living this war in all aspects of life we have not been seen our families as journalists we have not been able to eat well we have been dehydrated um we have been not having offices we have been reporting in one of the most harsh conditions like any repure could go through and we still reporting despite losing a lot of colleagues and it hurts our our souls and our hearts every single day um we have been a Target we have been constantly targeted by the Israeli air strikes and Israeli shelling um a week ago Sami shata our colleague was um targeted with an artillery shelling he got uh his leg amputated in the same exact moment the the tanks fired at him he lost his leg he has been calling um to leave the goel STP but there has been no response because he needs medical treatment all of these daily things we have been living in as journalists are are overwhelming are exhausting us but we still continue because there has been at least 100 Palestinian journalists who I personally know that have been killed killed since October 7 and if they were here today with us they would be reporting and they would be um raising the voice of the voiceless Palestinians living under genocide for more than 200 days if you count journalists and media workers the number is 142 killed since the beginning of the war hind is there any way whether it's for you or any other journalist in Gaza at the moment to do your job without taking an extraordinary risk is there any way to do this in a way that is safe where you don't think in the morning I don't know if I'm coming back home tonight I don't know if I can I can I will continue this call with you it's the to this extent I don't know if I I'm going to hang up this call and go and sleep and wake up in the morning there's no guarantee that a Palestinian journalist a Palestinian media worker or any other Palestinian currently living in the Gaza Strip won't be targeted we have been constantly being targeted we are risking Our Lives we're risking Our Lives to report the world what's currently happening everyone has been relying on pal on Palestinian journalists for videos for photos uh where we've been also being killed and like everyone is neglecting the fact that Palestinian reporting on the ground are are are are are humans like literally neglecting the fact that we are humans we have stories to tell we have personal lives we have families um byting the White House Correspondence Dinner is a no-brainer I can't believe like after seven months of this genocide we are still convincing people that they should boycott this um dinner like uh the root of all of this has been like a press instit tions that need to contend the fact that they are making money from reporting on the death of Palestinians and they refuse the name like they they literally are refusing uh to name like the killers and and like and and like they're currently dehumanizing Palestinians and dehumanizing Palestinian stories every single day okay and and this is like really hurting Palestinians and also Palestinian media workers and hin just so you know um as you say this and as we listen to your words we're also seeing the pictures the live shot right now of this protest outside the the Hilton Hotel in Washington where Biden is set to address journalists at this dinner uh a few hours from now and now I believe um so that so that that it's interesting your words are interesting and they're playing out over these pictures of protesters who basically agree with your point hin thank you so much for uh staying up for us I know it's very late where you are almost 1:30 a.m. and thanks for your work since the beginning of this war Ahmed shihab Elin is a journalist also a signatur of the open letter calling on colleagues to boycott the White House correspondence association dinner you're joining us live uh from vien the letter says Ahmed that for journalists to rub shoulders with the president is whitewashing the administra administration's role in genocide talk to us about that well serel it's been 6 months of mass murder every day it's really at this point in my mind unacceptable to stay silent out of fear or you know professional concern while we're seeing journalists in Gaza continue to be not just killed but detained tortured and even their families killed uh we know President Biden will be speaking at the White House correspondent dinner tonight we know he'll likely mention threats to journalists around the world I do wonder and I wonder if our colleagues at you know my former colleagues at Al jazer yourself included will he mentioned Israel's murder of Shireen abak and the more than 142 as you mentioned Palestinian journalists and media workers who've been killed uh so you know for me the White House correspondence dinner maybe some of your viewers might not know it's really an embodiment of a big problem with us media the trading of journalistic ethics for access and to attend in my mind is to normalize as you said to sanitize quoting the the letter and to whitewash the administration's role I mean principal journalists should boycott the White House correspondent's annual dinner in solidarity uh you know journalism is at its core its most powerful purpose is to hold the powerful to account it's about afflicting the comfortable and com comforting The Afflicted Ahmed just a word since you mentioned Shireen something I should say in the interest of full disclosure um we're at aljazera directly impacted of course by this story Shireen abakay was one of our veteran reporters she was killed in the occupied West Bank it was well before this war at the time Israel had said it wasn't them the investigation ended up showing as we've said from the beginning that it was indeed an Israeli sniper uh bullet that killed her and there have been multiple Alero journalists who have been either killed or wounded in Gaza since the beginning of this war um so we are directly impacted by this story going back to you now the letter says Western media has played an integral role in manufacturing consent for Israel explain that I mean just to provide context to that truth if you drose the Western media's belligerently biased in my opinion coverage of Gaza I mean it's not been discret it's been deliberate and disgraceful especially the regurgitating of talking points uh you know the framing the lack of context the passive voice as we've heard from some of your other guests tonight uh but to explain it more simply I mean how can I put it um uh more children Sur Real as you know were killed by Israel and Gaza in just 165 days then were killed in all other Global conflicts over the past four years most of those conflicts where journalists were allowed you know International journalists I should say were allowed to cover it I mean the Western media has explicitly and repeatedly framed October 7th as a terrorist attack yet they've portrayed the dozens and dozens of October 7th that Israel has been unleashing on Gaza for more than 6 months now killing tens of thousands of of civilians I mean the overwhelming majority we know of those killed by Israel are children and women so you know when I appear in interviews like this in the west maybe this can also provide some explanation I mean I'm always expected to condemn the killing of Israelis October 7th but western or Israeli guests are rarely if ever asked on those same broadcast Outlets to condemn Israel's killing of innocent civilians in Gaza so I think that tells you all you need to know so so in light of that just before I let you go Ahmed real quick since you would like to see the White House Correspondents boycott this dinner and there's no indication that they were boycotting in fact we're seeing them enter the room we're seeing the live footage now if you were a White House correspondent imagine you had access to the US president you were interviewing him what would you ask Joe Biden I don't know if he'd be able to handle a simple question but why don't Palestinians deserve the same rights as any other human being including Israelis all right okay Ahmed shihab Palestinian America
