everywhere Israel's attacks have destroyed every aspect of life after 47 days of bombardment Palestinians are about to get 4 days of spite in the ruins of their homes and make shift tense out in the cold we want many humanitarian ceasefires we want a full ceasefire there are children Elders women still under the rubble if we want to take them out from under the rubble we need a great deal of time at least a month no food drinking water electricity or medicine Palestinians have none of the basics needed to survive before the war 850 trucks would enter the Gaza Strip every day through the Karam Abu Salam Crossing with Israel and the Rafa Crossing with Egypt that ended with the total blockade Israel imposed on October the 7th 2 weeks into the war the first humanitarian a trucks were allowed into Gaza since October the 21st the UN says only more than 1,400 trucks carrying Aid and fuel have entered the strip a trickle compared to the number of trucks Before the War under the temporary ceasefire 300 humanitarian a trucks per day carrying supplies and fuel will be allowed into Gaza during the 4-day PA and fighting but it's not clear if they will reach the north where Healthcare Services have completely collapsed up to this moment no information regarding the entry of a fuel for hospitals and ambulances the only information is a limited amount of fuel will be allowed to get into Gaza Strip during those four days of a humanitarian ceasefire those fuel will be used for the water and sanitation under the deal Israel will not allow the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled to Southern Gaza to return to their homes in the north a little bit pessimistic when it comes to the inability to move freely across Salah Road I'm originally from Gaza City I wish to go back home during the ceasefire but it seems that's not going to happen raising fear of permanent displacement in the absence of a permanent ceasefire pranka Gupta alaz Philip lazarini is the commissioner general of the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees speaking from Khan Yunis he's welcomed the temporary truce describing the situation in Gaza as impossible we all heard about a truth four five 6 days it is definitely welcome I really hope that through this we will be able to better reach everyone in Gaza streets including people who are still in the north and that during these days we will be able to scale up our response but beyond that I really hope that from this four or five days we can build an extended ceasefire on humanitarian ground basically this is what everyone is asking for
