Israel's Siege and destruction of Gaza is a humanitarian catastrophe for its 2.3 million people those are the United Nations words as it warns that cutting off water food Fuel and electricity is a war crime so what can stop such Collective punishment this is Inside Story [Music] hello and welcome to the program I'm Tom McCrae it's been likened to a medieval Siege a total blockade of one of the most densely populated areas in the world while bombing entire neighborhoods to Rubble Israel has also cut off supplies no fuel means no power for generators threatening the lives of the young old and critically ill who have managed to make it to hospital under under Israeli bombardment desination plants not working effectively means drinking water is running out and water mains are damaged food is also running out and many are suffering hunger Israel is Accused by the United Nations and human rights officials of carrying out a war crime through its Siege but Israel continues regardless supported by the United States and many European Union Nations so what can stop this Collective punishment of 2.3 million people We'll be asking this and more of our guests in just a few moments but first Hy mmud describes the impact of Israel's Siege from inside Gaza people are now hungry or as The Honorable commissioner has stated the residents of the Gaza Strip are expected to face utter disaster in the coming days caught and trapped in a war zone the residents of this small territory are expected to face an unimaginable suffering as the humanitarian situation ations are worsening in each passing Day ad group stated that water supply sanitation and hygiene facilities have already been disrupted services to more than 700 people evacuating from the northern part Gaza City to the southern part of the Gaza Strip well joining me now are our guests in KH Unice in Gaza is Mansour shman a resident of Gaza in rala is Bushra khi policy lead in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel for Oxfam and in Bethlehem is raham Jafari a Communications and advocacy coordinator for the occupied Palestinian territory for Action a thank you all very much for joining us here on Inside Story mono if I can begin with you you are obviously living this humanitarian crisis day and day out there in Gaza we've heard from the the UN Secretary General who who's just reiterated that the situation is getting worse and worse each and every hour can you just explain exactly where you are right now and and what the situation is like in Gaza as it stands thank you for having the program and hello to your guests um I'm now located in N Hospital inun in the south of the Gaza Strip um as the UN Secretary General said I mean I'm wondering how it can get better right now we have over 8,000 killed 20,000 injured borders are still closed um until now 50 to 60 trucks have come in since the last 23 days normally we expect 400 trucks a day during non war time chemical attacks on the residents of Gaza white phosphorus on my family mosques have been bombed down churches have been brought to Rubble hospitals hundreds killed in them while being treated together with hundreds of refugees Israel has has not only not only shut off the water taps and electricity TAPS in addition to not allowing any food coming in but they've also tried to stop Communication in Gaza inside and to the outside world the situation is getting worse and out of hand Rah I want to talk a little bit about uh the Looting that we have seen uh recently for the very first time since the war broke out we've seen people so desperate that they have been forced to go to un uh depos and and fend for themselves find the food take it home to feed their their families how big of a concern is it that that this is now happening um thanks and uh so this is um a very difficult situation and a very catastrophic situation and and so um Gaza um is under total blockade and seeds denying the injury of basic food items and Fuel and medical supplies and uh there is no electricity and the people do not have any safer place to to go and even the hospitals that under continuous threat of pumping and uh evacuation the people do not uh uh know where to go and there is a humanitarian catastrophe it is unprecented level of targeting civilians it is humanitarian catastrophe is also it cannot describe the whole situation in Gaza H so this situation put a a a more huge pressure on the work and operation of a humanitarian organization that cannot ER work or continue its work under this situation um where there is no electricity where is there is no enough Aid entering Gaza um it around 87 of the humanitarian Aid truck that entered Gaza for 2.3 million people this is not sufficient this is not fair ER and there is no safe access for humanitarian uh corridors to enter and to allow people to to to to reach their basic needs I mean the water is polluted and um the hospitals cannot uh treat with all the injured and with the wounded people H they receive from the continuous pumping that Target Church Smoke houses uh children women uh so I I cannot catch all the words to describe the situation that people our people in Gaza pass through and so there is an urgent call and an immediate call to reach an immediate ceasefire and immediate pause for this uh for this huge ER violence against people against civilian against children in Gaza R you're not the only one uh not finding the words to describe what is happening in Gaza at this point in time buer the UN warned that civil order uh was dissolving inside Gaza because of the pressure that the 2.3 million people there are under is that what we are seeing here now I mean if people are having to I mean you know you have to understand people Gaza before uh the 7th of October is a place where there's no homeless people despite a humanitarian crisis and living under siege for 16 years there's no crime in Gaza uh that's not existence so for people to be looting unwa uh and people that are dependent on Aiden have always been dependent on this this is not anything new for Gins they've been living on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe in the way that we've seen it in the last few weeks for years because of the illegal Israeli blockade imposed on Gaza cutting off Gaza from many basic supplies um for people to be looting flour and rice I mean the situation must be very desperate um and must be you know and I know from my from myself and we we've heard our colleagues that's in um saying that on his own family he's he's been impacted by the bombardments I have my own family as well in Gaza they were sharing cans of tuna so as a Mom myself I would probably also uh get any my hands on any type of flow or food to be able to to feed my children uh it's a very natural I think and human uh thing to do uh there's been also very conflicted reports about this looting and why that happened um I had Direct witness testimonies about this saying that actually it was bombarded um right after people had looted it and had been asked to be evacuated so there are different reports on that I know that it's not clear because we're unable to contact anybody because connection lines have been completely disrupted so we're not even able to speak to our colleagues or speak to to our family to really understand what is going on uh as the minutes go by um it's it's terrifying yeah it certainly it certainly is in that lack of communication between officials but also between family members and Friends living in Gaza monso must also be extremely difficult uh at this time we've heard over the last couple of days that uh this is the first time that people inside Gaza are really going hungry that starvation is going to become a bigger and bigger issue is that how it feels there now Menor as your guest mentioned even during the blockade before this war R is a very safe place I mean very rarely do you hear of any kind of um criminal activity happening even a small scale looting so the fact that the people had to go to the Strategic storage in the Ona to uh take flour and rice to feed their own children and their own extended families shows you how much uh of a massive umme in terms of food and nutrition we are reaching the sense I getting from the people living across of my across of where I am in the four different schools around 20,000 refugees is that the the the rations that they are getting are getting smaller uh the people that need to be fed are getting larger in numbers and that even if people have a little bit of cash on their side they can't find and buy the food they need so there's a problem of quality there's a problem of quantity however even with all these challenges the people here in Gazza are trying to keep High morale they are trying to be practice steadfastness practice patience and help each other out as much as they can but we need the help of the International Community to open the borders unequivocally for both sides and all kinds of Aid to come in as soon as possible because by today we should have had count of 23 days times 400 trucks at least 9,000 containers of Aid which should have replenished whatever the refugees ate and drank over the last 23 days remarkable uh that soar light has gotten in over the last three weeks raham do you think that the humanitarian crisis that's unfolding inside Gaza do you think that's a deliberate tactic of Israel or or simply a consequence of War um so I think that uh if the humanitarian corridors is not uh opened and if the uh an immediate Seas fa is not reached I think the humanitarian situation and the humanitarian catastrophe will be separated uh during the up coming days and uh uh we will lose many people we many lives will be lost uh even the patient people who could who couldn't reach and receive the medical care they want I think there is an urgent call to International Community to the world leader to all the people to reach h a Seas fire to practice the pressure on Israel to adhere to the International Community and also in this regard I want to emphasize one point and the main point that the people in Gaza as your gust said all the time keep a high moral and a high adherence to a social cohesion and respect to the law some families host more than 50 members of their relatives and and their friends in one house and they share everything so and uh the main problem the main thing that we want to focus on now is to reach a Seas fire to open humanitarian Corridor to allow a humanitarian Aid to in Gaza and also especially the fuel which is needed to H for hospitals which is needed to generate electricity to to to produce clear water to produce food item for the people Bakers cannot work because it can't produce bread which is a main component for food in Gaza and in the Middle East so H that the most priority that we focus on is a humanitarian and an immediate ceasefire I think yeah and you are not the only one so who have been calling for that and those calls have been growing louder and louder as the days go on but still we have yet to see anything along those lines Bush you work for Oxfam and they have called uh that the starvation that has happening in Gaza now is being used as a weapon of war is this a war crime it may amount indeed to a war crime we and I think the International Community has been very clear about Israel's duties and obligations under international law uh Israel uh block illegally blockades is uh Gaza has been for the last 16 years we've been under mil milary occupation here in the West Bank for 57 years um and it has obligations under international law to protect civilian population and that means provide them with basic needs including water fuel electricity and food and medical supplies when these essential food items like flour and oil and sugar are prevented from entering the Gaza Strip because the borders have been closed or and or bombed um you know the the you know it's it's it's clear that um starvation as a method of warfare has been used and it's strictly prohibited by International humanitarian law and as the occupying Force Israel has an obligation to ensure the needs of uh and protection of gaza's population and that is not currently the case and not to mention the collective punishment uh as well manso I want to talk a little bit about fuel because that is also one of the biggest problems that is facing everyone in Gaza at the moment I mean Israel still refuses uh to let any into the strip can you just explain how that affects almost every part of life there yes um the problem right now is that Israel has cut the main electrical grids off from G strip since 23 days so people rely on uh other ways to generate electricity for for their main function in life however there are some main units within razza like hospitals like clinics like um uh rescue centers fire departments uh ambulances Etc which rely very heavily to have electricity and to have things charged up through electrical generators that are fed by Fuel so without fuel hospitals will stop working people will die directly as a result of that without fuel uh there will be no more internet connections there will be no more ways to communicate within each other and within the outside world without fuel uh the the the limited amount of power generation from solar cell panels and um other methods is like very very very small and it is not enough to to to give uh enough power to the people here fuel here is now equal to life it is more important than food and water and if they are worried that an entity like Hamas will be controlling this fuel then I urge them to ensure that it it is being directed uh properly as uh through organizations such as the red crescent Red Cross the Ona Etc in order for them to direct it to where they believe is the right place uh the fuel needs to enter as soon as possible or we are committing 2.3 million residents to death raham Aid uh action Aid obviously works extensively right throughout Gaza I mean eight agencies there are now having to make extremely difficult calls about the limited amount of fuel that they have and where the priorities lie whether it should go to ambulances to to to get the injured back to hospital whether to keep incubators uh or generators running whether to send it to Bakery so food can be made to feed people how difficult is that for someone that works for an aid agency just having to make those types of calls as your guest mentioned that fuel is important for everything it's a life saving it's similar to water and food H without fuel we cannot produce water we cannot clear water H for human consumtion without fuel we cannot work ambulances we cannot move also ER if fuel is needed if if fuel is not uh available I think our work will be embeded and also we try as much as we can with limited capacities on the ground to H to try to help the people that there but uh under the also the lack of safety The Continuous pumping and the severe shortage of fuel uh our work is embeded uh our movement is embeded uh also so H fuel is is essentially needed and is essentially needed to enter now Gaz and now mean yes it's not just about Aid getting through the rougher Crossing though is it but can you just help explain to people that might not fully understand it that how Israel controls uh Power and Water and to Gaza that that doesn't necessarily have to come in on trucks does it no I mean it doesn't and also I mean it's important to say you asked a very important question like how do we make that call well actually we wouldn't have to make that call if parties were abiding by their duties and obligations under international law both parties by the way um uh uh on the on the on the blockade on Gaza and and and what gazin have had to endure for the last 16 years uh the block was deemed illegal by the international court of justice a few years ago in an advisory opinion um uh Israel of course control the Israeli borders there's only 1% of gazans before the 7th of October that could come in and out of Gaza um and humanitarian Aid and workers of course but you know also on top of this blockade um there were six escalations in the last 10 years and every time there has been an escalation in Gaza the borders were Force forcefully closed so um clearly there is that type of control um from Israel uh it claims to not have control over the Border but that's incorrect because it gets to close and open the Border whenever it chooses to um and it also bombarded ra I mean in the few the first few days of of of this this current escalation and hosti um in terms of water and electricity actually Gaza buys most of its water or at least half of it uh by from a Israeli company that provides water for it same thing it buys electricity from the Israeli grids and uh and you know uh compensates with solar uh with solar panels and fuel um uh from the for the power plant so uh they are dependent on these Resources by Israel and the fact that these can be shut off uh each time isn't I mean is you know it is a serious violation of interational Law and may well uh amount to a war crime yes indeed Mano I'm not too sure if you've been able to see uh from within Gaza over the the last week or so rallies uh shows of solidarity with Palestinians have been growing larger and larger right around the world then there were more than a million people turned out in Istanbul hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people in London uh turned out to to walk uh along the streets there protesting what is happening inside inside Gaza how important is it I mean I know it doesn't actually change the situation but how important is it for people to put pressure especially on the western governments that have sided with Israel here how important is it from someone sitting inside Gaza to see that and I guess for people to keep that up um honestly uh whenever the people here have access to social media and they see the demonstrations all around the world trying to support the cause of the Palestinian people here in Gaza trying to put pressure on their governments to help ease the pressure on us here their Spirits get lifted on behalf of the 2.3 million people here living in razza I want to thank each and every one of you who goes to these demonstrations who writes letters to the government officials who puts pressure in different ways in peaceful manners to try to apply the basic human rights that are imprint in the UN on the civilians here inaz that have been going through escalating hell over the last 23 days raham we began this uh program by asking uh one question one that's very difficult to answer because no one seemingly has been able to come up with one what do you think is actually going to stop this Collective punishment what is happening with the siege in Gaza what will stop this Collective punish punishment you mean yes I think there will be there should be a a strong political will among the political leader in the world and a huge pressure on Israel from the International Community from the UN bodies and from the political leaders as mentioned and from the the the peoples of the world to continue raising their voices and demonstrating uh to protest against this escalation against targeting this civilian to uh to uh to force Israel to adhere to International uh to international law there should be a collective work a collective action uh from all governments around the world uh to uh work together to come together H to reach uh a SE fire an immediate SE fire for the people who are being killed for uh uh for more than 23 days busher do you have any hope at this point in time that at the very least we're going to see a humanitarian ceasefire uh put in place before you know more and more people die in Gaza you know um organizations like Oxfam have been raising the alarm bells for years on the situation of Gaza and what we've been calling for is not only an end to the siege um and of course an immediate ceasefire that goes without saying but an end to the siege and for the International Community to deal with the root causes of this issue towards and work towards an a a real time bound plan um with key accountability mechanisms for each point of that plan um uh for a uh towards you know the Justice um and this towards this Injustice to resolve this Injustice and to resolve this violence and we have been calling that for for years now um and and and that is also my call and I I I urge also people to support the call that came out a couple uh weeks ago by more than 600 organizations globally including big International organizations of one is which one is alpam uh calling for an immediate ceasefire but also an entire ceasefire proposal is part of that open call and it's garnered now more than half a million signatures in about a week um we urge people to continue making that call for an immediate ceas fire as you said we have seen it globally uh the street has spoken and now leaders need to um to represent their constituents uh they were uh they represent constituents they represent these people and they have to address it it's it's their responsibility as elected leaders um so you know we enough of the persistent failure of the international Community it is now time and now there's a window to take real action Manel we have about one minute left in the program I just want to ask you uh briefly how angry are people there about the lack of action from the International Community uh people here are channeling all their emotions into action it's like a beehive everyone is trying to help uh to reduce the impact of what is happening in a in a and and and give in a positive manner in whatever way they can to relieve the pressure of the people here yes people are angry however they believe that all they can do at this point is to try and help people around them to live a better life thank you so much uh Mansour we uh we really appreciate it and really uh hope for
