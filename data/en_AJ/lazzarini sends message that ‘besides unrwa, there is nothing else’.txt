uh the council that un's operation space in Gaza is shrinking he said uh the agency is facing a quot deliberate and concerted campaign to undermine its operations in Gaza at a time when its crucial services are most needed let's bring in alzer's Gabriel elizando at un headquarters in New York who's been listening in a strong statement there from Philip lazarini Gabe with a very dire warning about the situation in Gaza yeah there were several things that really struck me here but as he went into this uh security council meeting he briefly told reporters going in that he wanted to uh set the stage for how important unra is and what the ramifications would be if it is dismantled like he said and like we've heard from Israeli officials uh that they want to dismantle it uh fipe lazarin basically giving a little bit of a history lesson to the council reminding them that unra was set up 75 years ago as a temporary solution until there was a political process in place a political solution lazarina is saying there hasn't been a political solution so that is why we are still in Palestine particularly in Gaza providing services such as health care education safety uh uh Aid he said and that is why we're there and if we were to be dismantled like like he is giving indications that is actually happening right now due to Israeli targeting he said who would provide all of that until there's a political solution essentially no one can provide that until there's a final political solution but even in a transition to a political Solution that's potentially years before uh some other body or some other entity could provide what unra provides so I mean that was very striking there laid it out very clearly that there's no other uh besides unra there's nothing else basically and in January of course we'll recall uh Gabe that um Israel's government presented uh the United Nations with information um accusing unra employees of of taking part in the um October 7th terror attack attacks but they didn't provide any evidence of that right what's the latest on the investigation into that well there's two number one is there's an internal investigation uh by the United Nations that's done behind closed doors privately uh that's an in investigation that was ordered by the Secretary General we do not know when they will be issuing their findings but they are looking specifically at the allegations that Israel has leveled against uh 12 unre employees that's number one we don't know when that will be uh uh completed and or if it'll be made public we think it'll be made public but it doesn't have have to be but the UN has said that they probably will the second investigation it's more of a not so much an investigation but it's it's it's more of a looking into if uh unra is being impartial in their in their work and that is being led by the former foreign minister of France uh and that is concluded and that will be released publicly in the next few days not so much an investigation there but more of just taking an assessment if unra is uh acting and in their practices is impartial uh if you will I should point out that Israel has not given any evidence to their claims uh that any unre employees were involved in October 7th to the United Nations directly to this day okay Gabe thank you very much for that that's Al jazer is Gab Londo reporting their live from the United Nations we will check in with you throughout the evening to find out uh the latest there uh at the security Council as it here's a briefing uh about the situation in uh Gaza make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
