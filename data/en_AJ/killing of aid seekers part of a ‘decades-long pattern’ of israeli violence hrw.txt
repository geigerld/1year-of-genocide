we begin in Gaza where Palestinians waiting for Aid have again come under Israeli fire as Supply convoys [Applause] arrived several Palestinians have been injured by Israeli forces whilst waiting for much needed supplies at the alati roundabout in Gaza City only a few people were able to get some boxes that included water flour and other items the trucks left carrying some of those injured by the Israeli gunfire let's bring in now Omar Shakir he's the Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch and joins us live from Chicago so here we have Israeli forces again firing on people waiting for Aid the second such attack since yesterday and after more than a hundred people of course were killed in a similar situation last week this seems to now be happening with some alarming regularity what do you make of it look I mean let's start with the clear clear responsibility here of the Israeli government they are starving the Palestinians of Gaza they are using starvation of civilians as a weapon of War which is a war crime as the occupying power the Israeli government has the duty not only to ensure the humanitarian needs of the occupied population are met but they have to provide for the welfare of that population and they have to restore public order and safety they're failing to do so they're creating the catastrophic conditions that are leading to these sorts of situations and moreover the Israeli government has a long track record of using unlawful excessive force against Palestinians not only in the context of air strikes but also in normal policing situations whether it was the protests during the march of return in 2018 or 19 or the routine killings of Palestinians in the West Bank there is a decades long pattern of these abuses taking place with impunity this does seem to be particularly poignant though given that they're bringing in a very tiny amount of Aid and then firing on people who are so desperately trying to get hold of it absolutely I mean people are in Gaza facing incessant bombardment they are being starved they lack access to basic resources they have been displaced multiple times over most of their MO for most of them their homes um their hospitals their Community institutions their schools have been damaged or destroyed and they're left every day just trying to survive and the idea that people are being killed as they scaven for meager rations of food is just appalling and is a reminder why there must be International immediate action to prevent further Mass atrocities this is a sign of just how desperate and catastrophic can conditions are six months into this nightmare which began of course not in a vacuum but in a reality of years of closure of unlawful uh killings of Abus of occupation of apartheid and persecution denial of rer return there's a larger context but we've seen an unprecedented scale of killings and repression I we've got the the US vice president Kam Harris calling for more Aid into Gaza somewhat belatedly also calling for a ceasefire us has also been involved in an aid drop what sort of message does this send when we know that the US is Israel's number one backer and without the weapons that it provides Israel wouldn't be able to carry on this war look I mean people have been warning about this very scenario for days weeks and months and the United States has failed to use its leverage to put action behind its words and those words have been Meek words but any sort of action in order to prevent this sort of situation the United States unquestionably has the leverage but the United States has simply been unwilling to um stop providing arms to the Israeli government to be much more strong in their condemnation to support action around accountability and and to complicity and to actually put teeth behind and pushing the Israeli government it is an embarrassment to you the US's role in the world that it is doing this Aid drop look I mean for some families this Aid could provide critical Aid we shouldn't in a situation of starvation look past that but at the same time the United States can and should be doing so much more um and it's failed to do so but lives still hang in the balance and we and there's still time to act uh people are not bargaining chips humanitarian Aid should not be um something that can be Bartered and bargained away they should be provided immediately just as hostage civilian self hostage should be immediately and unconditionally released the un's top Court the the international court of justice has ordered that uh Israel does not commit acts that could be called genocidal Israel had to produce a report uh a week or so ago to say how it was meeting that commitment what's your view on it well it's not complying that is Crystal Clear uh the Israeli government was ordered to ensure basic services and humanitarian Aid this was a binding order from the world's court and they failed to do so the amount of uh I mean they did not turn on the tap of water um you know we have destruction of water infrastructure they did not turn flip the switch on electricity and not only that but the amount of trucks entering Gaza shockingly even decreased as compared in the weeks before uh you have a reality in which you went from about 147 trucks a day to under 100 to even around 50 in the middle and end of February in addition almost no trucks are going Beyond Rafa and Southern Gaza so Northern Gaza remains facing the most catastrophic scenario as we've discussed Aid convoys have been struck humanitarian organizations have stopped being able to provide many of them services in Northern Gaza uh in addition we've seen continued attacks on hospitals scores of Palestinian bodies piling up by the day the Israeli government is not complying with this order and states must use all forms of lever including sanctions and embargos to press the Israeli government to comply this is a test of the rules-based international order and the world is failing and we've got the head of HRA Filipe lazarini saying that Israel is trying to eliminate that Aid organization just give us an idea of how essential unro is to the Palestinian people and how perilous is its survival H is indispensable it is the largest uh provider of humanitarian Services humanitarian organizations that operate in Gaza have said we cannot replace unoa Ena is unique in its ability to provide services again um in a situation in which there's a looming famine people are starving uh it is appalling that states have cut funding to anura these are serious obviously allegations that anura is facing um but Human Rights Watch has reviewed the evidence there is uh you know no uh evidence actually to back up these claims but that's not really the issue here the issue here is that you know this is an agency providing services to Palestinians who have nothing to do uh with those implicated Aid must be restored um and part of what the Israeli government has done to not comply with the icj order has been its efforts to dismantle unoa which is part of a yearslong effort to liquidate the Palestinian refugee cause it cannot be liquidated these are basic rights to return turn under international law and it's critical that Ono be allowed to to fulfill its essential Duty now it's more important maybe than ever Omar Shakir with Human Rights Watch thanks very much taking the time to talk to us on Al jazer thank you
