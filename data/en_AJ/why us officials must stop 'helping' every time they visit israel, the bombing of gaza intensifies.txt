the remaining population the area gets to be displaced and and this is the uh the tragedy of every air strike causing more problem and forcing more Palestinian to displacement which can of course Mount the pressure uh on on Health Care Facility as well as evacuation Zone as we're we're getting [Applause] into yes sir oh my god did you hear that oh my god oh that's the hospital that's the hospital that's the hospital oh my God are you guys hearing this are you guys hearing this all the debris oh my god so let's bring in Maran bishar aer's senior political analyst who's been watching this with me that was the scene uh just about almost half an hour ago now when we were reporting uh live with hany hany Mahmud in in Rafa and several explosions were going on there behind him as he was uh talking to us uh we saw and heard these explosions we heard drones buzzing constantly we heard the sound of of sirens going by people screaming and running this is this is daily life in so much in Gaza now it seems and it's not we we were focused at that point in time on RAF but it seemed at the same time today there were more of the same bombings in uh east of kanun and in jabalia and more of the same directed against civilian infrastructure and these are the ones that we just know about and report on in fact there's already a report we cannot verify it but there's already a report that there were journalists in the Kuwaiti H in the vicinity of the Kuwaiti hospitals you know hopefully no one is hurt badly but this is the kind of a daily exercise it's a daily exercise and genocide it's almost experimental genocide that the Israelis are trying on the Palestinian uh people and it's been going on for um more than 10 weeks now if you remember two months ago around this time when the American president visited Israel he pleaded with them you know whether uh sincerely or otherwise to minimize civilian casualties and since then with each and American official arriving in Israel including yesterday the Secretary of Defense we see intensification of the bombings of Civilian areas in Gaza it is as if you want to plead with the Americans please don't come anymore and please don't ask the Israelis to to minimize the civilian casualties because every time you do the Palestinians get even more hit than before you've come to the region and I think the Israeli government has a plan and the plan is either to demolish decimate Gaza in an act of Revenge or in an act to turn the population against Hamas or as an act to put pressure on Hamas to NE neate the release of the captives which makes it a massive Act of Terror why do we call it a Max a massive Act of Terror because you are discriminately bombing entire civilian structures including hospitals and schools targeting civilians in order to put political pressures on their leaders in this case Hamas this is a massive Act of Terror Israel should be tried for a massive not just the normal everyday War crime that we know about because now we are talking in the context of some negotiations going on behind the scene about releasing prisoners and captives and so forth so this is unraveling in front of our eyes and it's unraveling in the entire part of Gaza and then is this another theory now because this is happening in the southern tip of Gaza ra there's making it really no place safe for anyone and destroying more and more of the same such as hospitals this is definitely definitely the strategy to push people out of Gaza this is part and parcel of a 10 we strategy to try to thin out as they call it in Israel to thin out the population of Gaza if you cannot decimate them if you cannot kill them you make life unlivable in Gaza you attack everywhere with no exception and you try more and more to push them out of Gaza the scenes the last few days of children barefooted pleading for food just goes a long way to tell you that not only is there starvation now being used as a weapon the weaponization of hunger not only there is no place for people to seek shelter no place for people to seek medical treatment no place for people to seek away away from the diseases and the bombings that are definitely inflicting huge suffering in Gaza that there is the sadistic ongoing war that really is meant to decimate or to push people out of the a colleague just reminded me that perhaps we should start calling this war for operation Sinai that perhaps this is all about trying to push people out of their Homeland the just to just to pick up on that um to in the southern uh Gaza border is Egypt but you know the Egyptians have made it clear at this point that they are not going to allow that to happen because of the effect that it would have uh inside Egypt so given that it it just seems like the Palestinians are are are squeezed In from from all sides here absolutely for the time being this is like uh this is like shooting in a battle for the time being they are all cooped up say for the time being you're saying that could change absolutely absolutely for the time being they're all cooped up in even more and more densely populated areas right we used to talk about the open air prison called Gaza one of the most densely if probably the most densely populated area with some 70 80% refugees now they've been squeezed into even smaller more densely populated areas and they are still being bombed like we've just seen in front of our eyes in plain sight Israel bombing even a more densely populated RAF right now eventually in few days as the Israelis are hoping eventually in few weeks what are you going to do when there's absolutely impossible to live anymore in Gaza so I can imagine already people rushing dashing barefooted to the border to try to seek some kind some kind of resite from the ongoing bombing and starvation and disease and so on so forth we're going to enter if you're a Palestinian you would know that we're now entering the two tough winter months January and February this is going to be absolutely miserable and now already there are reports about spread diseases this is because of lack of Sanitation and lack of access to absolutely basic things yeah absolutely so all in all I mean the Egyptians have made it a red line that they don't want to this issue to be resolved at the expense of Egyptian whatever it is National Security right but already also the Americans and the Israelis are trying to convince the Egyptians and the jordanians to open their countries their borders to Palestinians guess what in return for more American assistance to Egypt and Jordan and other countries who would receive Palestinian refugees so now while these countries are saying we don't want this and this and the war needs to stop America and Israel want the war to continue and if there's going to be another Refugee nakba catastrophe they're asking neighboring countries to shoulder the responsibility of more refugees in return for money money in return for American Aid to Egypt Jordan other countries this is the American Israeli proposition now so while these countries have red lines but you know there are no more red lines anymore I mean is this where is the red line here where are the where is international law the thing that you learn that we learn as we cover geopolitical issues as we cover Wars that the standards change with war the standards of January of October 6th are no longer the the same standards of the end of December the standards have changed the values have changed and what is permissible what is not permissible has changed in fact so I can see any scenario to be a probable scenario considering the sadism and the aggressivity and the impunity with which the Israelis are acting and the kind of support they continue to get from the United States Marwan Bashar aler senior political analyst
