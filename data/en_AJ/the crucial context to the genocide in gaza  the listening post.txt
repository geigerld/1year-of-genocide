after 3 months of Devastation displacement and the killing of Palestinians we're taking a deep dive into the way the story of Gaza has been covered a journalist an expert on human rights and another on digital rights on what has taken place the humanitarian catastrophe and the way the media through their news coverage have helped pave the way to a genocide [Music] since the attacks on October 7th the listening post has interviewed a range of experts on the news coverage what's missing in it and how it has helped enable the crimes being waged on Palestinians in Gaza in this special edition we have compiled three interviews starting with the United Nations special raor on the occupied Palestinian territories Francesca Alban Alban is an Italian trained in international law she's been highlighting the duty of journalists to remember and include the context of this story as well as what international law says about the rights and responsibilities of the occupier and the occupied long before October 7th she was the target of smear campaigns calls for her dismissal from the UN not one to be silenced she has gone in the other direction chastising journalists around the world for their biases and the UN for its inaction I started out by asking Al V to tell us about some of the interactions she has had with reporters on this story and what those exchanges have revealed uh hi Richard uh it's uneven because I have to say that there are there have been a few journalists who have really tried to do um good job good coverage asking me sort of neutral questions to appreciate the facts but mostly I've had um a difficult experience with uh mainstream media in the west because I found I found myself in the uncomfortable position of being challenged on how I would call things or how I would report on things no it's not a Trope it's really real so it seems not to understand what I'm saying there is an apartheid regime no I'm serious there is an apartheid regime it's domination this is not a Trope this is international law I mean it was not my intention to challenge journalists but it seems that they really wanted to to to to challenge my way of looking at things which I found disturbing because again excuse me but I'm I'm here to report on on things that I've analyzed verified triangulated and yeah I found it a bit surprising that relates to something that you've said about today's political landscape you say it's marked by historical Amnesia traditional media plays a critical role in that and that many people are living in an alternative reality what do you mean exactly by that yes yes Richard because this is not just a conflict and calling calling it just a conflict is a is a Mis Noma because this is an occupation that has been ongoing for 56 years so very limited uh consideration for that but also Al very limited consideration for the enduring trauma that also the Palestinians have in themselves because um while there is recognition for the the the tragedy that the Jewish people have lived through and through across centuries that culminated in the horror of the Holocaust there is very little recognition of what the Palestinians has had endured as a people since 1947 since the and and through the creation of the state of Israel they were never allowed to come to a closure and again this is not about Hamas this is really the Palestinian as a people as they try to resist a violent occupation in the occupied pal Palestinian territory there is no Hamas military presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem and still over 200 people have been killed by soldiers and armed the settlers do you see any connection to it in in mainstream media Palestinians have heard the calls as we have from Israeli officials and voices in the Israeli media for what amounts to ethnic cleansing of Gaza as a lawyer are you surprised by the evidence that they are willingly providing of what appears to be the intent to commit what are in fact war crimes there seems to be this sense of impunity over their words it's surprising yes because the Israelis have never been so explicit in admitting respons responsibility for specific incidents one of the things that were absolutely shocking was the the bombing of the jabalia refugee camp because the Israeli Army knew that there were about 400 civilians Palestinian civilians including hostages and nonetheless the camp was bombed heavily and hundreds of Palestinians were killed hundreds were injured and the number of hostages was reportedly killed in that case so yeah theyve been quite outspoken about their intention including calling for the Erasure of Gaza the flattening of Gaza we have seen before what happens to people when this this Fury becomes becomes popular and this genocidal call that we have heard from politicians and and military leaders in Israel is also Amplified in various groups in the Israeli Society so in the face of this madness as someone who has seen genocidal horror happening in other parts of the world I say it's clear that this has this has is taking the Israel Society to a very dark place and this is why I say in the interest of the pales both Palestinians and the Israelis This Must Be Stopped you've faced a lot of criticism um for some of the things that you've said and you faced some of that criticism prior to October 7th some cases you've been defamed pressure groups have been on your case to resign what kind of things are they saying about you are they succeeding M Alban in making your job more difficult look this group groups and they I mean they're all connected one way or another because they say exactly the same things that are repeated exactly in the same way sometime sometimes in the same sequence over and over and the accusations against me are that I'm an anti-semite that I am Pro Hamas and I support terrorism Franchesca Alban is someone who pretends to be neutral uh neither her position nor her own background have anything to do with impartiality is it succeeding I don't think so because eventually more and more people keep on asking me to to speak and to speak out wherever I go uh speaking to governments or speaking to the media off record people know people tell me or let me understand that the situation is better known that it would seem in the public debate but there is a lot of censorship and self-censorship because people don't want to be confronted with the allegations I I have to face on a daily basis which in my case don't distract me I keep focused on what I have to do but I think that it's necessary to tackle this issue at the global level because it's uh it's now also the weaponization of anti-Semitism and the level of smear against anyone who UTS a word of criticism against Israel and everyone who utters a word of solidarity with the Palestinians face such a huge and evil um campaign I mean I also spoke with you know human rights defenders in the Pacific Islands where they say well you we Face even arrest and detention if we come out and protest in solidarity with the Palestinian people against what's happening in the Gaza Strip so there is a crashing of freedom of assembly a crashing of freedom of of expression and of the right to protest that it's absolutely unprecedented at this Global level and of this scale Franchesca albanesa un special raor for the occupied Palestinian territories you're up against it uh we understand you're very busy we're very grateful for the time that you've made for us today thank you Richard the blockade of the Gaza Strip is both physical and digital Israel has forced periodic Communications blackouts on Gaza it has the power to do that and social media a key information source is now brimming with disinformation and hate speech big Tech has been taking down content and its sensitivities on this story seem to reflect Israel's Palestinian voices have often been muted that is where we began with marwa fataa of the digital Rights group access now on the information siege that Israelis have imposed on God AA uh Palestinians in Gaza are under a Complete Siege and there is of course a near complete information Blackout um during Israel's uh bombardment campaign of the Gaza Strip um two of the three main telecommunications lines or companies in the Gaza Strip have been bombarded um people are relying currently on only one line of communications with internet and Telecommunications disruptions um that means that people in Gaza are not able to access information not able to check on their loved ones they're not able to seek life saving information and they're cut off from the world um they have fewer and fewer opportunities to share and tell their stories and to document human rights abuses and and war crimes internet shutdowns provide a convenient cover for perpetrators of atrocities of Human Rights abuses uh to commit those in in the dark uh to cover the betrayals of their crimes uh and to um impede or hinder any future possibility of accountability and and Justice in the first half of this program we examine some of the genocidal rhetoric that's been coming from Israeli officials and other Israeli figures how much of that language are you seeing being mirrored online the calls for violence the unverified claims there is a barage of um hate speech incitement to violence content that is uh dehumanizing of Palestinians islamophobic content um anti-semitic content and that is all circulating unfortunately uh with little moderation uh from social media companies there are of course many utterances from Israeli officials on social media um that shows their clear intent on committing genocide including for instance most recently uh by prime minister Netanyahu on X formerly known as Twitter that this fight and this war is a war between children of lightness and Children Of Darkness between humanity and the law of uh of of jungle and it raises a question about to what extent social media companies are complicit in entertaining and housing and amplifying uh these genocidal um rhetorics that are clearly in violation of international humanitarian law and international law in General on that point since hamas's attack on October 7th we've seen the Israeli government flood social media with ads with graphic and provocative imagery what are you seeing there on that side of things and how willingly have these online platforms played host to Israeli government messaging since hamas's attack on on Israel on October 7th um the Israeli government has launched a social media campaign I would say an aggressive iive social media campaign to um shape the narrative and the conversation online um we've seen for example the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs had run up to 86 ads on YouTube uh some of which shows indeed graphic content um equating Hamas to Isis and also showing the the impact of of the attacks and it's clear that you know paid targeted advertisement uh has become a weapon of War governments that have the resources and the capacity to produce uh such material can use these Platforms in order to spread War propaganda and in this context to justify the collective punishment of Palestinians and um war crimes and work you know crimes against humanity that we see unfolding before before our eyes Palestinians are also saying that social media companies have been taking down their content threatening to close their accounts some say they're being sh Shadow band outright tell us what examples you're seeing and are these acts of censorship on these various platforms affecting voices on both sides we've seen users accounts being shut down including very notable users and journalists whose voices are very important there's also been AR arbitary decisions um made and when when it comes to removing content one major concern that is repeatedly being reported is the so-called Shadow Banning and whereas company don't really use that term um I've witnessed it myself uh and I've seen many users reporting it that you know their their content is being uh demoted uh down ranked the engagement with this content is is significantly reduced in comparison to other content not related to Palestine unfortunately we thought that in 2021 we've settled matters as in it was clear um that this systematic and discriminatory approach to moderating Palestinian content has been exposed um there's no way for platforms to G gasl light users or Civil Society organizations that this is uh just a result of a technical glitch which surprisingly we don't see in other crisis like when Russia invaded uh Ukraine we have seen actually proactive uh statements from different companies uh uh stating their unwavering commitment to upholding ukrainians right to freedom of expression such commitment to human rights have not been extended to Palestinians despite of what companies claim the users experience and the reality of what we've uh documenting uh States otherwise Mara of access now thank you for speaking with us today here at the listening post thank you Israel has said that its goal in Gaza is to destroy Hamas but its attacks on Palestinians have also escalated on the West Bank where Hamas has no Authority or military presence that violence is usually provoked by Israeli settlers prior to October 7th almost 200 Palestinians had been killed on the West Bank in the previous 10 months that number has more than doubled since Mariam baruti is a Palestinian journalist based in ramala on the West Bank she's been interviewed by multiple media outlets and some of those exchanges like this one with the UK Channel Sky News have been heated dozens of pal Ians are killed we call it a Slaughter we have called it a Massac this time because yeah no no I'm talking about individual but could you just answer if you would like to talk atast come with me with the right information please I began by asking Mariam baruti about what she's seen in the western media's coverage of this story The Way International journalists attempt to tro Palestinians and delegitimize as well as deny the crimes against them has has not only become vicious in in the way that journalists are framing it like that interview but it has increased and become lethal in a way that it is a complete pro- genocidal stance by journalists that claim to be um objective that claim to be nonpartisan that claim to be supporting um the truth to support accurate accuracy for their audiences but but it's not just common it is being encouraged by editors and policy makers whether directly or indirectly so you don't see that as someone not fully understanding the context and bringing the context to the interview you see that more as an intention absolutely as journalists it is our job to do our due diligence prior to bringing in anyone who is giving a testimony um so to claim ignorance requires you to quit your job and go and learn since October 7th uh journalists from around the world have flown into the into the region a lot of them are still based in Israel some of them have embedded with the Israeli military to get into Gaza how difficult is it for journalists to get into the West Bank and for those who haven't been to the West Bank to cover the story what are they missing It's relatively difficult ult for journalists to enter the West Bank only in comparison to previous times but Israel is placing restrictions and is assigning things like minders to different Bureau Chiefs and international reporters in the region and that is someone that responds and operates under the command of the Israeli military to attempt and coer manipulate um as well as pressure journalists to cover in a certain angle or to deny information from audiences but nonetheless journalists still have the capacity to challenge this and come into the West Bank the persons that they are bringing on to speak on the situation are the very people that are committing the crimes against Palestinians that is Israeli military spokespersons um that is Israeli policy makers and settlers and at the same time negating the Palestinian testimony and if they do speak with Palestinians it is always an attempt to frame a two- Sidis but there is no two sides to this not just because it's a false equivalent between colonized or and colonized but because journalists are only showing one side and that is the Israeli side and unfortunately what we have seen more than that is a negation and a denial of the information and news that local journalists have as though that is inferior rather than recognizing that local journalists are the experts on this situation even though their lives are at increased risk um from Israeli repression as we have seen in their targeting in many Western and international media Med Outlet simply brand this as a war between Israel and Hamas how accurate is that framing given everything that we've been hearing from Israeli officials on the record targeting civilians in Gaza how accurate is the framing how dangerous is it it is so dangerous to take what is happening to Palestinians and reduce it to the title of an Hamas Israel war this is not a war between Hamas and Israel this is a war against Palestinians in all um geographical locations within Palestine as well as outside of Palestine reminding that 50% of the population is in forced Exile um or our refugees abroad so to frame it as that is a reductionist approach and it is an attempt to continue the illustration of Palestinians as terrorists because of the the association that was made of what Hamas is we see the isra military they closed down a printing shop downtown rala just this morning and the flyer on the door that they plastered was Hamas equals Isis so it goes to show you how manipulative that narrative is and then there's no mention of G being besieged for close to two decades there's no mention of the same thing happening in G right now has happened before at a smaller scale because what we have seen is transcending all trends of violence that we pass alians have witnessed or we have witnessed in the region since 1948 so to claim that it is a Hamas and Israel war is either an inability to actually do the due diligence and look into the context and explain that to your audience or it is intentional and that means you are being complicit in genocide one last question for you we've seen some amazing journalism coming out of Gaza Palestinians too many of whom have paid with their lives uh making a name for themselves getting the recognition that they deserve can you give us a few names of some good follows of Palestinian journalists on the West Bank people whose work is worthy of our following it's so difficult to speak about journalists here tell about it considering just the targeting yeah it's heartache and and as a reporter you know I think we forget that these are our peers and it also you know we're not advocating just for the protection of journalists but as reporters and journalists we're advocating for ourselves um to to remain safe but in terms of coverage I think there are multiple reporters and news organizations that are actually going against the grain and going against the restrictions that are being imposed by by editorial policies abroad at least alzer has been doing incredible coverage um of what's been happening all across Palestine not just LDA and the West Bank but in its entire context we there are organizations such as mwise which has also been reporting excellent um in print uh on the West Bank we have Middle East I that has also been showcasing excellent reporting on the West Bank as well as highlighting and covering the disinformation and mistranslation that has been happening within International media organizations but I mean in in terms of individuals you can see the works of people like fatan uh you can see the works of Muhammad Al although he is not here but he is able to amplify a lot of the coverage that is being sent from local journalists abroad but yeah I'm sorry I don't have maybe too specific specific names that's fine that's fine Mariam baruti thank you for joining us today here at the listening post thank you for having me you've been watching a special edition of our program a compilation of our most informative and at times heartfelt interviews on Israel's genocidal assault on the Gaza Strip we'll stay on this story to see where it goes from here and how it's reported and we'll see you next time here at the listening
