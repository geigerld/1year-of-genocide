let's bring in Maan bashara he's Al's senior political analyst and joins us now live from Paris so Maan we're hearing that Israel is sending a delegation to Doha reportedly as soon as Sunday where are the negotiations at they're still marching in place but they're certainly uh wrangling over details I think the end game for Israel is that they want to continue with the war the end game for Hamas is that they want to end the war want a permanent ceasefire the Israelis are yet to get on board and I think the Americans are still trying to bridge both by basically making promises that if Hamas accepts a transitional ceasefire that it could eventually lead to a permanent ceasefire I don't think it's convincing thus far but they remain wrangling over the details and we do feel that the US pressure on Netanyahu in particular is ramping up to what extent do you think this is affecting his decisions I don't think it's affecting it I think it's probably adding pressure in order for Netanyahu government to present a plan they will present a plan they always have attack plan as it were or a plan of attack uh they did so before the land invasion in the third week of October oober if you remember the Americans demanded it the Israelis delivered it and what did we have as a result a genocide the same thing happened uh few weeks later when the Israelis promised Lincoln that they will be respecting abiding by International humanitarian law and thousands more children and thousands more uh women died who were killed after that so any such promises really are uh deflection they are nonsensical what needs to happen is an end to the war what the America's message to Israel should be not a plan for war a plan for war against 400,000 instead of 1,400,000 is no better really in the end of the day because as that woman that very wise bitter and um hurting woman said in your report it is you know the Palestinians don't want charity they don't want your food and Aid and they don't want uh you know Western sympathy they don't want even understanding what they want is the end of the war so that children have a future that's what she said and she's very correct because this whole mess and everything that's been accumulating on top of it of this diplomatic circus and so-called negotiations and so-called pressure all of that is basically deflecting from the real dras that unfolding in plain sight which is the war the slaughter the genocide continues inated as it did today so instead of the you know air dropping of food instead of bringing it by ships instead of even bringing it by truck the Palestinians are more than capable to feed themselves they are more capable to govern themselves if only the West stops supporting Israel's genocidal war against him that has been going on for decades not just months M bash joining us there from Paris thanks very much Mar
