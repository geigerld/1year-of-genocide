now to the US where demonstrators put up red stained hands and placers in the air behind Secretary of State Anthony blinkin and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in Washington DC earlier the anti-war protest was when blinkin and Austin testified to the Senate Appropriations Committee on Biden's request for $16 billion to fund ambition plan Ambi Ambitions plans for Ukraine let's go over to Capitol Hill and Heidi Jo Castro for the latest quite a Rowdy session there how that's right fly in fact the Secretary of State anony Lincoln couldn't even finish his introductory remarks without eight interruptions by these protesters who were eventually removed they were chanting their ceasefire in Gaza and save gaza's children and they held up those hands that were painted red because of course this hearing wasn't just about Ukraine Aid it was also about $14 billion of aid for Israel that the White House has has asked Congress to approve and blinkin along with the defense secretary their role at this hearing is to sell Senators on giving the White House what it wants and blinkin as expected repeated that he was steadfast that the US is steadfast in its backing of Israel in fact he described with unprecedented graphic details of the death suffered by Israeli civilians on October 7th notably he made no mention of the death suffered by Gaz and civilians in the time since but he did emphasize that the US is working more on humanitarian assistance to Gaza including upping the number of Aid trucks now passing through the Rafa border from 60 which is at currently up to a 100 and blinkin also said there is no indication th far that fears that the Israelis have that this Aid could be diverted to Hamas that has not been the case and there's no evidence to show otherwise yeah and Heidi this growing opposition from republicans in Congress to this Aid package will it pass yeah see there's bipartisan support for that $14 billion for Israel but that is linked in this Aid package to the $60 billion that is for Ukraine and there is a dissension among Republicans about whether the US should continue supporting the ukrainians uh this is because the US wants those fiscal conservatives want to spend less money on these foreign entanglements but as far as the part of Israel is concerned the question isn't whether this aid for Israel from the US will pass but just in what form be it attached to the Ukrainian Aid or as a standalone item and in either case there are bills in both Chambers in the Senate and in the house to advance that Aid at least for Israel and it is expected to pass in the coming week Heidi thank you very much for the update Heidi she cast your life for us there on Capitol Hill
