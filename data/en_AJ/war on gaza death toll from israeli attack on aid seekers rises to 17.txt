the Israeli military is maintaining its Relentless air and ground assault across the Gaza Strip from north to south in Gaza City at least 17 people were killed while waiting for a humanitarian Aid delivery at a major intersection Israeli troops have repeatedly targeted crowds of Palestinians at the Kuwait roundabout where they wait to receive much needed food Parcels meanwhile the Palestine red Cresent society says five people were killed at the same intersection on Friday [Music] the organization said thousands of people were waiting for trucks carrying flour and other basic supplies Witnesses said that warning shots were fired by those organizing the delivery but Israeli troops also opened fire trucks reportedly rammed into people as they were trying to grab Aid packages the roundabout links Southern Gaza with the north where the UN has warned that famine is taking hold while in central Gaza the Israeli strike on a house has killed at least three people in the alghazi refugee camp several people are still missing after the dawn attack and emergency crews are working to rescue those under the debris Israeli attacks have killed more than 32,700 Palestinians since October Let's cross over to TK abum joins us now from Rafa in Southern Gaza good morning TK I wish it was a good morning another strike at the Kuwaiti roundabout uh just tell us a little bit more about what people are telling you about what happened there yes well good morning and that was completely bloody attack that has been carried out overnight on Al quit roundabout where the Israeli forces have opened the fire against people uh who were waiting for aid supplies to be delivered to the another part of gaza's trip and according to eyewitnesses there on the ground they have been describing the situation there being completely chaotic as the Israeli forces have been targeting also members of local and popular tribal committees that are responsible for securing the deliveries of aid supplies to the nor G in order to be safely later distributed to desperate families who are in a very desperate need for such life-saving supplies but clearly so it's not the first attack that has been carried out against those people who are securing and also waiting for a suppli Israel had multiply targeted people in Alit round about which has been called among Palestinians as a death trap by eyewitnesses as we have been contacting them they have been saying that Medical Teams along with the civil defense crews are still grappling to evacuate the uh victims and the injuries from the location there as there are still some people laying on the ground there without receiving any rescue yet because of the intense level of the Israeli bombardment and that's absolutely the scene for the people who are waiting for supplies and mainly this place had been multiply targeted at the same time people keep going there despite the risky nature of the place because simply they have no options remained they know that might they might be killed they know that they might be targeted but they don't want to return back to the houses with empty hands uh in order to uh feed their families who have been suffering from high rates of Mal nutrician Amed a clear sign of famine is emerging on the horizon there and of course uh T it does raise the question which we're also going to be asking our analysts through the day here on Al jazer about specifically how you can safely get Aid into the area when these incidents of attacks are occurring and at the same time incidents of malnutrition are increasing yes uh that's absolutely controversial to reality in fact so Israel is saying that the are facilitating the process of Aid deliveries to the another parts of Gaza Strip and at the same time they have been uh giving uh a different denial uh to the majority of the humanitarian convoys by the United Nations to get an access to the northern part of the territory and at the same time different countries have been forced to carry out different air dropping operations and the the recent established Maritime Corridor that has been allocated for a more Aid deliveries to the Gaza Strip that absolutely reflects the uh diet reality here on on the ground as people are suffering in order to get S much needed life-saving supplies and mainly right now they are depending on the air dropping they have been completely unsafe as that has been falling on the heads of the civilians there and also people uh who are trying to get an A throughout the Merit time Corridor they are suffering to get much needed supplies because of the very limited amount that had been delivered on the course of the past days even those who are waiting for humanitarian convoys on Kuwait and the naboi roundabout they have been multiply exposed to the Israeli fire giving a clear indication that people there are dying slowly they are even being targeted if they want to get an eight Supply and at the same time they have been receiving more orders from the Israeli occupation to no longer exist there besides the ongoing denial and restrictions being osed on humanitarian convoys deliveries to the north and with more growing calls from the International Community and different humanitarian organizations for the Israeli government to alleviate the restrictions being imposed on Aid deliveries as there are hundreds of humanitarian convoys arrestation on the Egyptian side waiting for further approval to get into the territory in terms of the ongoing bombardment that has taken place that also considered to be a very integral element that also hampering Aid deliveries to much needed areas of the Gaza STP Tabo isum there for us in Rafa in southern Gaza thank you
