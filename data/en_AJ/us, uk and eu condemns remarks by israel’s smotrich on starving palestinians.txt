some of Israel's closest allies have condemned comments made by Minister bzel smotrich about letting 2 million Palestinians die of hunger SMR claimed that it might be justified it might be moral to let them starve until Israeli captives are returned those comments have been heavily criticized by the US the UK and the European Union on Thursday let's get more on that with Phil LEL Phil is in Washington DC so Phil tell us what's being said what's the reaction in Washington to well I think saying heavily criticized is probably putting it mildly the Biden Administration for one of a better word seems pretty disgusted by these comments it was a short statement that was released but it was fairly to the point it said we are appalled by these comments and we reiterate that this rhetoric is harmful and it is disturbing the president and the Secretary of State have repeatedly stressed the need to end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza remove any obstacles to the flow of Aid and restore basic services for those in need uh now of course these comments will have been welcomed by some in the far right side of Israel but they have been widely uh frowned upon in the International Community I mean the European Union described them as uh well put them in plain terms said if this is a war crime deliberate starvation that's how you describe it uh the France said it had deep dismay at what it called scandalous remarks and the UK said there could be absolutely no justification for these remarks but perhaps now that we've seen some strong words come from the US Israel's closest Ally maybe that will hit home a little bit more well this is just going to add to what are already fraught relations between the Biden Administration and the Netanyahu government yeah I mean the government here is really having to straddle two lines at the moment because it is giving unwavering support Ironclad is the word that they're using for Israel in terms of its defense against Hezbollah and Iran but at the same time it is clearly obvious through both observations and through leaks uh that Joe Biden is getting increasingly frustrated with prime minister Netanyahu I mean just remember last week when he was at that air base welcoming those hostages back from Russia uh a couple of journalists threw some questions at him about the situation in Gaza and Joe Biden said he meaning prime minister Netanyahu has the basis for a ceasefire he's got to accept it and he also said that the killing of isma Hane had not helped and obviously CA Harris who also met Netanyahu when he was in town last month who could be president in January not beyond the Realms of possibility she has said that she will not remain silent on the issue of Gaza so obviously there is a lot of pressure now from the US on Israel to accept that ceasefire but these comments from the Finance Minister will not have done any help no absolutely and and disgust I think is fair to say voiced by the UK the EU and now the US disgust but not actions I would add Phil LEL reporting from Washington DC thank you very much make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
