the latest victims of Israel's air strikes on Gaza already displaced they were killed when Rockets hit tents they were Sheltering in in conun in the southern part of the strip in Northern Gaza the famine caused by Israel's restrictions on food medicine and essential life-saving supplies has led to more Palestinians dying of hunger and dehydration the latest victim a toddler who died at alepa hospital in Gaza City regrettably she succumbed to dehydration and malnutrition moreover she suffered from a chronic disease and given that we have been in War for the sixth consecutive month we are now running out of the medication she required we encounter similar cases every day Aid Parcels continue to be air dropped but not nearly enough and some have fallen into the sea with no way to retrieve them I've been waiting since Dawn I have a family of seven I came back empty-handed I've not been able to get even a handful of rice Aid must come through the border crossings or with unra this is not working this is humiliating Aid groups say it's critical that Israel stops blocking Aid trucks from entering the strip people are starving to death now and when people reach this level of hunger they have hours in which an intervention might help them they don't have weeks um and so I think we're sort of skirting around the real problem which is the land access which is going to be much more effective until that happens they warn famine will continue to spread in Gaza at an alarming rate Victoria gon B Al jazer
