what are the military risks of an Israeli ground offensive in Gaza the Israeli Army says it's ready for the next stage of its war on the strip and it's massing hundreds of thousands of troops but what does Israel stand to gain from an incursion into the territory this is Inside [Music] Story hello again I'm James Bay Israel has gathered hundreds of thousands of troops ahead of its ground invasion of Gaza but Hamas is likely to be ready for them tens of thousands of Fighters have had time to prepare traps and ambushes with the conflict about to enter a dangerous new phase fears are growing for civilians caught in the crossfire along with concern the war might spread Beyond The Strip we'll go to our panel of guests in just a few moments but first Finton Monahan has this report Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had a question for the tens of thousands of troops masked along the border with Gaza are you ready for what comes next a ground Invasion appears inevitable in the past week the Israeli military has dropped thousands of bombs on Gaza and Netanyahu says it's only the beginning we are striking at our enemy with unprecedented might I emphasize this is just the beginning our enemies have only begun paying the price and I won't detail what is yet to come but I tell you that this is only the beginning Israel has called up as many as 360,000 reservists swelling the Army's ranks to three times its usual size but the enemy is likely to be prepared Hamas is believed to have tens of thousands of Fighters and a complex network of tunnels Beneath The Enclave they're fighting on home ground and have had time to prepare traps and ambushes ahead of its expected Invasion the Israeli Army issued a forced evacuation order for 1.1 million Palestinians in Northern Gaza but they have nowhere to go we couldn't leave they said leave towards the South but there is no Transportation the street was closed there was a traffic jam some cars got bombed by air strikes this is a genocide not a war and it's an attempt to displace the people of the Gaza Strip but this will not happen a ground Invasion could have brought a repercussions for the region following a meeting with Hamas leaders in katar Iran's foreign Ministry warned of far-reaching consequences if Israel pushes ahead with the next stage of its offensive meanwhile the US has deployed two aircraft carriers and a host of war planes to the Middle East President Joe Biden has warned other nations and groups not to get involved let me say this as clearly as I can this is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek Advantage the world is watching thousands of people on both sides have been killed in the past week of fighting further escalation is on the horizon one that may go far beyond the war zone in Gaza vinon Monahan for Inside Story well let's bring in up panel of experts to discuss this further in Beirut we have elas Hannah a retired Lebanese military General in Brussels it's Elijah mager a military analyst who's covered conflicts in the Middle East for more than 30 years and in the US state of Delaware Lawrence Corb a retired US Navy captain and former assistant Secretary of Defense uh thank you very much for joining us I'm going to start with you Lawrence we've got very clear I think Israel signaling now that this is going to happen soon the Prime Minister said the next stage is coming the military have put out a statement the Israeli military there's going to be a coordinated attack from Air Land and Sea um let me ask you you've you've been involved in military planning at the highest levels in the Pentagon what do you think they're thinking about in terms of the timing there are some reports that they were planning to do it at the weekend but it's been delayed because of Cloudy uh conditions and they need to be able to see things from their air cover well I think they were good for them from a military point of view to delay because given the internal problems that you've had in Israel ever since the Prime Minister Neto took over the military wasn't in the normal shape in fact people weren't even showing up for reserve duty because of their concern what Netanyahu was doing it also gives the United States with secretary blinkin and secretary Austin to go around the region to get the other countries in the region to work with us and the Israelis after this military operation is over to make sure that it doesn't uh it doesn't happen again the real question is what how long will it take how much damage will it do and when will the Israelis uh stop it what will be the role of Egypt will they allow uh the hostages and some of the the people from Gaza to come in so that we minimize civilian casualties okay Elijah of course the thing we don't know is exactly what the Israelis are planning to do we don't know the end game here we don't think it's going to be another limited incursion uh prime minister Netanyahu has gone on record every Hamas member is a dead man what do you think they are probably planning on this occasion thank you for having me first of all I think that the question of whether it's just an excuse we've seen in 2006 when Israel decided to attack Lebanon it took them two weeks to organize themselves and call upon the reservist and they were very hesitant to walk into Lebanon and they were not successful in achieving their objectives here we're talking about reservice that coming from all over the places we're talking about 300,000 that are divided on two different fronts plus the reserve under the command of the general Commander uh in case one front needs more than the other because in my opinion there is going to be definitely a second front and we will see that in the next 2472 hours thirdly the Israelis are walking into a trap and they know it the Israelis are very good in their Air Force they can destroy we've seen what they have done in Gaza they can level the city but they can not guarantee a success of the Infantry at the end of the day it is not that air for that going to occupy Street by street fighting in urban city is not a common ad is something extremely challenging even to the Israeli armies we've seen the consequences in 2014 and we understand that the Israelis will receive a heavily damage on all their soldiers and again I repeat if other fronts are not starting and I think that will be visible very soon Ellas Elijah there mentioned 2014 Israel lost 67 soldiers then um tell us in your view how the two sides Stack Up in terms of their their military forces clearly Israel has huge numbers involved they've called up 360,000 reservists how do you see the two military forces that that potentially are going to face each other uh the balance of power is in Israel favor however the characteristic of this war is totally different from 2006 and 2014 if you are planning to go into Gaza for an urban Warfare I mean you have to really Define what is the end goal what is the goal at what time you feel that you have really achieved your goal um Netanyahu is so maximalist he want destroy all of Hamas would he be able to really destroy all of Hamas so I think that there is three dynamics that is really playing in this game first the political Dynamics the military Dynamics the Readiness of this idef Army Israeli Army are they ready really do they have all means in order to go into Gaza what would be the plan I mean the operational plan would they go and cut and compart malize you know this dissect Gaza into sectors what would be after at what time they think that it is you know they have achieve their goal moreover you are talking we have to take into consideration the regional aspect the regional Dynamics what would happen at the Lebanese front which is you so it's becoming hotter and hotter and then after all of that the the the global Dynamics which is really led by the United States of America it's like protecting this operation to a certain degree you know that I think that the Americans have decided at what degree they will stop the war in order to really open up for diplomacy at that time moreover the herculan uh problem herculan task for the Israeli Army is to go into something not really aware of they don't have the situational awareness in an urban Warfare the ratio is totally different from defense and offense usually between two regular armies one Defender against three attacker in this kind of uh urban area maybe you have to have one overturn would Israel be able and accept such kind of casualties Lawrence let me ask you about that about the about Gaza as it stands now which will become potentially the battlefield if we have this ground um intervention you have potentially snipers nks m traps minefields IEDs suicide bombers um one military person I saw say that parts of Gaza now look like Stalingrad and Hamas have all sorts of capabilities some we might not know about for example drones quadcopters capable of drop dropping bombs all those sort of things I mean um if you were a military planner you'd be very wary wouldn't you right now well no doubt about it because as my colleagues have mentioned Urban Warfare as opposed to air and see you're going to have more casualties I have no doubt that Hamas is putting its forces in civilian areas including hospitals and so you even if you try and limit the damage which I think the Israelis will you can't do it uh completely and the real question becomes if you have all of these civilian casualties what is the reaction from the United States and uh Israel's other allies around around the world and yes that's going to be difficult because traditionally the Israelis have suffer very few casualties going back all the way to the yam kapor War so I think this is going to also be a struggle you know for the uh for the go for the government there fortunately they have a Unity government so that should enable them to keep going but I do think they better be prepared to take a lot of casualties and the world needs to be prepared for a lot of Civilian casualties because uh Hamas is going to embed themselves with the the normal people and hospitals and apartment houses and stores so picking up on what Lawrence said Elijah do you think Hamas potentially have the psychological advantage here Israeli troops perhaps C cautious after what happened on October the 7th they saw hamas's tactics they saw their plan they saw their capabilities and of course in that attack Israel lost a lot of proved that Israel's intelligence wasn't good but they also lost a lot of their sensors and cameras around Gaza well let us look at the goal of this objective the objective of this separation first of all it is not to DET deter Hamas because it is a completely different objective because of this war because of the sismic shift in the Israeli public confidence in their military there is a huge uncertainty for the people of Israel this is why the Israelis are going into this war with a very low Spirit only to impose deterence again and to give trust to the population that they have lost and questioning the effectiveness of their Armed Forces so starting we have Hamas with a very High Spirit in comparison to the Israeli army with a very low Spirit to go into Gaza secondly and most importantly we have seen every time Israel Wag war on Hamas Hamas became stronger it is exactly the same thing when Israel waged war on Hezbollah and Hezbollah became such a strong non-state actor that today the Israelis need the support of The Americans to keep it on the side it's not going to stay on the side so we see the Israelis instead of deter Hamas and Destroy Hamas on every war Hamas becoming stronger Hamas doesn't need to hide behind the civilians because the Israelis already are taking care of killing the civilians we have 8,800 wounded most of them civilians we have 2,800 killed most of them civilians so the Israeli are pretty good in targeting civilians and killing them because they are fighting and bombing using a quarter of a nuclear bomb on the city in only five to six days nobody can use such a Firepower but the Israelis and if they have confidence why they need to level the whole city where they want to go in it's because they are afraid so starting before the beginning of the operation they are losing it alas um you just heard Elijah there talking about the Firepower that been used um 6,000 bombs in 6 days we haven't had an update from the Israelis since then but that's more than the US dropped on the Syrian city of raka during The Siege which lasted months and it's more than the US used in Afghanistan in an in an entire year yeah 7,000 7,800 no I mean you have to I mean let me tell you something Israel is in big dilemma big problem uh Israel is fighting non-state act in 19 in 2006 the United States of America wanted the greater Middle East the new Middle East and then they gave the green light for Israel to attack for 33 days they didn't lose but there is the formula that hasah has won because it didn't lose and Israel lost because it didn't win uh Israel cannot really repeat what's happening today with Hamas because after the the flood of ala and this spectacular low Tech versus Hightech Israel cannot really lose against Hamas it's an imperative to destroy Hamas and here comes the big dilemma why because Israel prepares itself for different kind of warfare never fought in cities I remember I do remember in 1982 when they inv Lebanon they inir tire and then go straight to sidon and inir sidon and then went directly to to Beirut and when they try to to enter Beirut they have failed so I mean fighting in cities is so difficult according to you know suu as you said so the Dilemma of of Israel what would be the end game is it to destroy or minimize or you know uh degrade the capability of Hamas so they have to do something otherwise I mean it will be definitively uh uh taken you would no nobody in the region I mean would take Israel as deterrent power as great power militarily speaking if you imagine I mean if you go and you know rebuild the scenario U of flood of Alexa I mean it's low Tech High Tech surprise uh speed it's a blitz cre and I think that Hamas have really plan for different scenarios if they had succeeded with the flood of ala what would happen I I think they they were prepared they were preparing for or they have prepared for all scenarios possible including one of invasion from the Israelis and to the Gaza Lawrence uh let me bring in another factor and it's more than a factor because it's very human and that's the captives that are being held by Hamas right now in Gaza does that make do you think this operation much more difficult for the Israelis and of course we're talking about a 100 or so people but they're not all Israelis some of them are foreign Nationals there are US citizens French citizens UK citizens some of um some of Israel's close allies have a stake in all of this well that certainly does make it more difficult if what the real question is will do the Israelis have the intelligence to know where those hostages are compared to trying undermine the military capability of Hamas and I assume that Hamas is spreading them out all throughout the region so that no matter where the Israelis go to try and eliminate Hamas and their military capability they're going to be endangering hostages there's no doubt about the fact they will do that and that of course will have an impact on opinion around the world including in the uh in the in the United States so that's makes this very difficult is Israel has the capability to do it the real question is are they prepared to pay the cost both in terms of lives and in their uh uh the perception of them around the world certainly Elijah it looks right now as though Israel has the gloves off we've talked about the number of bombs that have been dropped this time around they're not doing what they used to call the roof knocks low intensity strike as a warning they're just warning entire areas and we're hearing and I'll quote this because it's from The New York Times apparently for the ground offensive uh they're going to have new military Rules of Engagement they've been loosened to allow soldiers to make fewer checks before shooting at suspected enemies this is going to lead to a massive death toll is it not obviously because they also have the Hannibal directive where they can kill their own soldiers if they are in captivity and if they are found taken away by the militant so they prefer to negotiate later on over the body rather than a soldier that is alive however I would like to say something we've seen Netanyahu in power for the last 15 years and we still have jalad charit in captivity and he did not negotiate for his release so negotiating at the end of the day for 100 plus uh soldiers officers or civilians he knows that he had to release all the Palestinian soldiers all the Palestinian prisoners if the Hamas and the Jihad has 10 or have 200 so the number is becoming relative at the end of the day and for having these hostages or these prisoners killed during the battle is not going to affect a lot the Americans and all the other National and nationalities because already the approval of the American for a ground offensive is taking into account the death or the killing of their National I think Hamas and the Jihad prefer to have them alive because it's always have we have seen in the negotiation of hostages between the Palestinian and the Lebanese and the Israelis is always better to have a hostage that is alive rather than dead nevertheless with this War I think the Israelis are going to have a rule of Engagement where there is no mercy because we've seen how the Air Force is behaving with the civilians and with Gaza therefore I don't think the Israeli Army that in term of peace is behaving heavily with a very heavy hand on the Palestinian civilians is going to have mercy on anything that is moving particularly when the level of tension is extremely high among the Israelis that for some birds migrating from one country to another they rate the alarm all over Israel and they are in really high tension and they have shot against each other when they were trying to repair electricity or group that are not coordinating because there is a high tension so when they're going to walk in the city of 1.3 million in the north and 1 million in the South they're going to go for the smaller area and the narrower area that is in the north and they're going to walk in the city where they know under every debris there is a trap I've seen that in the camon battle in Syria because this is where I was present and I've seen how sniper put themself really at the bottom of the building not on the top and they managed to kill many of the fighters is trying to occupy the city so there is a large experience today we're talking about among the Hamas Fighters and militant in the city where they have gained so much experience in previous Wars and they know how to fight in urban city but the Israelis don't and we've seen them in 2006 in this in the South Lebanon how they really were forced to withdraw under the head of the gorilla Warfare that are not they not used to on the contrary the Israeli Special Forces know how to have to fight this kind of War but Israel has enough Special Forces to push in Hamas in Gaza of course not okay um elas um if we look already and we've only had a week of this bombardment the death toll of Palestinian civilians is now more than 2014 and that War last Ed for 50 days I've seen one analyst saying the civilian death toll could equal the battle against isil and mosul where there's estimated to be 9,000 to 11,000 dead how worried are you about a vast civilian casualty rate here I am deeply worried because uh for Israel to achieve its goal they have to go inside going inside they have to bombard I mean especially the city of Gaza where they have like 750,000 people and according to the Israeli sources they say that most of the ground underground tunnels where the hamas's commanders and leaders are really hiding in below the shifa hospital so I mean in order to really calculate or Define the victory or the theory of Victory when you do stop and saying I did I do really achieved my goals if Hamas say no because you have left nothing to Hamas to say because you are going as in the World War II unconditional surrender we're talking about surrender now we are talking about destroying all of Hamas how can you really destroy all of Hamas that is really spreading all over Gaza and you are trying to change the population the density of population and we do remember in the urban Warfare the there three elements that play really in the output of any war in in in the city uh demography topography and geography and the cities they do have the special geography and topography they change they change the the landscape the building they change the landscape they make it different maybe maybe we can say on a city it is like the urban welfare is the most the best equalizer between the balance of power it doesn't matter let me just let me just bring in Lawrence at the end because I we we've seen now I think Western countries were fully behind Israel beginning to be a bit of a a splintering some really calling very strongly for restraint what do you think could be a break on the Israelis if we do have mass civilian casualties is it really only US public opinion and the White House in the end well I think whatever side the White House is will be the key these other nations and international organizations are already coming out against the casualties that have been caused just by the bombing so the real question is what role will the United States play I assume that secretary blink going around now to the other countries in the region is working with them to come up with some way to deal with this situation which is inevitable once they send in ground forces as my colleagues have mentioned there's going to be an awful lot of casualties a lot of innocent people Israel says their objective is to completely eliminate Hamas not just their capability to eliminate them completely that is a very very difficult goal for them to achieve in a reasonable amount of time and with a reasonable amount of deaths both to the civilians and to the Israeli forces thank you Lawrence and thank you to our panel
