we begin in Gaza City this hour where the Israeli military has killed at least 104 Palestinians nearly 700 people have also been injured dozens of them in critical condition Thursday's attack has been described as a massacre of civilians hundreds of starving Palestinians had gathered to collect food Aid when they were attacked Israel's Army says its soldiers were forced to open fire because they felt threatened by the crowds Michael Apple explains how it all unfolded in the early hours of the morning thousands of people flocked to alrashed Road Southwest of Gaza City desperate for Aid aerial footage released by the Israeli military shows crowds gathering around what looks like several Aid trucks by the time the sun rose the extent of what happened was clear the dead and the dying lying side by side gunned down by Israeli fire [Music] the Israelis just opened random Fire on us as if it was a trap once we approach the a trucks the Israeli tanks and warplanes started firing on us if this continues like this we do not want any Aid delivered at all every Convoy coming means another Massacre instead of Aid they've come away with the dead by Donkey cot car and makeshift stretches the wounded are taken to nearby hospitals all of which are overwhelmed and barely functioning this is exactly what we have been warning about the hospital being out of service amid this massive influx of patients we are operating on batteries most of our victims are in critical condition which requires urgent surgical intervention but the hospital is without operating rooms I stand helpless we are simply administering first aid treatment only the Israeli military says its forces opened fire when troops felt threatened while a spokesperson for the Israeli government says Palestinian drivers plowed into the crowds when the trucks were overwhelmed but neither has provided evidence one of the survivors says bodies are still lying on the streets where they were gunned down as soon as the eight trucks entered the Israelis started shelling and shooting everyone who is on the road they opened fire randomly killing innocent men and women in Cold Blood there was gunfire snipers shooting tanks shelling and drones Palestinians are left with few options starve to death slowly or risk losing their lives collecting Aid Mike lappel El jazer as some of the people injured in the attack were taken to Al shifa Hospital in Gaza City this is the scene that staff member Dr jadala Al sha described to us there are really no words to describe the situation it reminds us of the dark scenes from the Baptist Hospital 4 months ago where 500 people were killed in one Israeli a strike since the early hours of the morning the hospital has been flooded with dozens of dead bodies and hundreds of injured the majority of the victims suffered gunshot wounds and shrapnel in the head and upper parts of their bodies they were hit by Direct artillery shelling drone missiles and gunfire all our operation rooms are full and all medical staff have been deployed above all we ran out of medical supplies and fuel necessary to operate the hospital we hope we will be able to provide any life-saving procedures to those victims all victims are in critical condition they're lying on the floor We Stand helpless amid the sharp shortage of supplies and staff at tabom is in Rafa Southern aaza Forest tar you've been gathering information on this along with our alaz team what more can you tell us about this yes it was a very uh shocking and distressing event today where uh thousands of Palestinians and who are completely desperate in noring Gaza have been waiting as usual every day for more flow of the humanitarian supplies and humanitarian trucks to get to the parts of Taza now the people had been multiply targeted by the Israeli forces in previous occasions but today it's considered to be one of the bloodiest attacks where we have been seeing and hearing more shocking news about more than uh 100 Palestinians being killed as we have been seeing also videos emerging from the location showing an intense Israeli shooting against those people who were gathering waiting for humanitarian supplies the majority of them did not manage to return back with anything they returned empty-handed as those people are completely have nothing to Sur Rive on the light of the ongoing Israeli bombardment that OS a significant restriction on Aid delivery but at the same time the the wfp had suspended its operations and Aid deliveries to the north for the same reasons collapse in security and this is what Palestinians today have been witnessing they were completely disarmed they have exposed to the Israeli fire and some of them they just wanted to give a humanitarian assistance to return back to their families with something in their hand defeat them and it's specifically that within this em number of casualties and people being killed it was another load on the capacity of hospitals that are severely and barely operating right now just only providing primitive care there and this is absolutely terrifying for them TK thank you very much for that reporting I know you and the rest of our Al Shazer team in Gaza working hard to try and gather as much information as we can about today's pre-dawn attack on these uh these Palestinians who are lining up for Aid in in Northern Gaza thank you very much T let's bring in Zayn basravi Zayn you're in rala in the occupied West Bank so we're trying to build as complete of a picture as we can about what happened this morning what are you learning on your end well the aerial footage that the Israeli military has released appears to show massive crowds swarming the few Aid trucks that are able to deliver any kind of help to the eged population of Gaza the Israelis have put it out as a potentially reasonable excuse for why they felt threatened the crowds were chaotic and out of control they felt they had to open fire to protect their soldiers but instead of being a reasonable excuse what Palestinians are seeing is really an indictment of Israeli choices inside Gaza the chaos has stemmed from Israel blocking any sort of reasonable International Aid response blocking groups making it more difficult for un bodies to carry out their work this chaos is a result of what they have done for the past 5 months which is dismantle a society dismantle uh Services Urban centers in a land area half the size of New York twice the size of Washington DC to that point the Biden Administration the US White House has actually asked the Israelis to stop targeting members of the Hamas run civilian police Force who escort these a trucks inside Gaza uh because they were warning of a quote total breakdown of Law and Order and that is largely what we're seeing here and to suggest that the Israelis had no choice they were trying to protect themselves Palestinians say adds insult to injury and just to get a sense of how bad the situation is 576,000 people in Gaza are near famine these are un statistics 2.3 million people are relying on woefully inadequate food Aid and Oxfam has just put out a statement saying it is appalled by the reports of killing people in Gaza waiting for food Aid they say Israel's actions were deliberate targeting civilians and a gross violation of international humanitarian law and Humanity Zay BVI reporting from occupied uh from rala I beg your pardon thank you very much Zane and Bernard Smith is in occupied East Jerusalem Bernard how does Israel explain what happened this so seral Israel's military has had a briefing uh not too long ago trying to uh elaborate on what they believe what they say happened in Gaza they say this incident happened at around wad Gaza which is this W this river that Israel has used to separate the North of Gaza from the south and there's a checkpoint there and they say that these a trucks were clearing this checkpoint when they were surrounded by a large Crow crowd of people at that stage the Israeli military said they didn't fire anybody anybody who was killed was killed in the crush or even run over by vehicles and then the military says there was a second incident where once those Vehicles had gone further north people left behind approached the Israeli military which they say was in a threatening Manner and that is when the Israelis opened fire now if you ask our colleagues in Gaza they will say well people are killed every day getting Aid by killed by the Israelis every day when they're trying to get aid but the reason there's so much Focus today is because of the large numbers of people killed but it is normal it is standard in this war that Palestinians are killed when they go and try and get Aid all right Berard thank you very much
