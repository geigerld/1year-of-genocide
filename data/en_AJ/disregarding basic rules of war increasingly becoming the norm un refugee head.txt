now the United Nations Secretary General Antonio guz has said Aid deliveries to Gaza are C completely inadequate we heard earlier also from the uh commissioner of the United Nations for high refuge for refugees the High Commissioner for refugees I should say philipo Grandy who was speaking to the UN Security Council and he said that International humanitarian law is being ignored in Gaza take a listen the past three weeks have provided devastating proof that disregarding the basic rules of War International humanitarian law is increasingly becoming the norm and not the exception with Innocent civilians killed in unprecedented numbers in the Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians and in the killing of Palestinian civilians and massive destruction of infrastructure caused by the ongoing Israeli military operation as we we speak and as you know over 2 million gazans half of them children are going through what my colleague Philip lazarini has called hell on Earth let's bring in Gabriel elizando who's at the United Nations headqu is for us in New York gave a very powerful statement there from filipo Grandy to the UN Security Council tell us more about what he said and how it was received yeah I think people were listening and intently to his words particularly now because of the strike on the jabalia refugee camp that as we've been reporting appears to have killed potentially hundreds he did not address that specific incident when he uh was talking to the security Council there as you just heard however within the last few minutes Mr Grandy has came come out of the security council chambers I was able to ask him specifically has he seen the images from the jabala refugee camp and he responded Yes he has seen them and he was a little emotional quite frankly when I said what is your response to them he paused for several seconds and said that uh and paraphrasing what he said he basically told me that it was some of the worst uh that he has ever seen and that says a lot coming from him he's been a diplomat for 30 years uh at the United Nations and was the former head of unra which is the UN agency that deals with Palestinian refugees in Gaza so uh he has seen it uh I asked him does he think it's a war crime he said it's not for me to state that it's up for others to make that to determination but clearly the head of uh the U High Commissioner for refugees of the UN there filipo grandi has seen what's going on in the jabali refugee camp and is following it closely Gabe we've had several uh resolutions um tabled at the UN Security Council they've all been uh of course vetoed those resolutions they've all failed what happens now at the security Council yeah there's a lot of frustration with some Security Council Members that they have not been able to in one unified voice get a resolution through and we're over three weeks into this conflict four Security Council resolutions have failed for various reasons two by Russia one by Brazil that was vetoed by the United States and one by the United States that was essentially vetoed by China and Russia now we are hearing that uh uh Malta in conjunction with other uh non-permanent members of the security Council are working on another draft resolution we have not seen it yet but they're working on it behind the scenes for the last several days hoping to make it public here uh very soon they say uh and they are hoping that this draft resolution will get the support of enough Security Council Members to pass the key is will it call for a ceasefire will it call for humanitarian pause and will the US and the UK agree to that these are all things that are are moving behind the scenes right now and as events move very fast in Gaza uh there is ramped up urgency you can tell by some members of the security Council to try to get a resolution through all right Gabe thank you for the update from the United Nations headquarters in New York
