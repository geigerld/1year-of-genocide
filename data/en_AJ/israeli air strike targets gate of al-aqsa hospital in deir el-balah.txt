we are getting some news into us about a strike in Gaza hany mmud is live in Dera Bala in central Gaza honey what can you tell us just just couple minutes couple minutes ago an air strike just struck a it struck the Gate of the hospital that's that's actually a few meters away from where we are standing here since ear hours of this morning the Skies of the Central Area mainly above the hospital this hospital was clouded with many of the drones you can hear them in the background and for the past few hours we've been talking to each other that the presence the dense presence of these attack of drones is for a reason here and just within the past couple minutes huge air strike that is right next to the gate of the hospital we're getting now a confirmed reports judging from what what I'm looking at right now but because it's a massive explosion the dust and the debris just covered main parts of the hospital when I talk about next to the gate of the hospital just the landscape of the area this is a a road that is at about 8 m wide and across from the gate there is a house that has been already bombed at the initial weeks of the war it's been targeted again now the de breeze and the the dust all come to the Courtyard of the hospital as we speak right right now this is we would been warning of the the dense presence of these drones and we we did not expect to it to happen right at this time but it did happen as you can hear in the background the the buzz sound of these attack drones is still in the skies and still clouding the Skies of the Central Area m above the hospital see where as you see from the frame of the camera these are one of the injuries a child who happened to be hit by a shrapnell there's another one also being rushed inside the hospital and this is from the flying shrap naels and de breeze as the explosion was quite intense I'm I'm not sure if you guys could hear that in the studio but it was so deafening it was so loud here uh honey we can most definitely hear the continual sound of drones uh above you Israeli military drones are you suggesting it was one of those drones that carried out this specific strike do we know what the intended target was [Music] then well what we know so far it's a house that has been already bombed but the fact that it's not far from the hospital this has already created a sense of intimidation a sense of fear and concern as people remember within the past few days right before the announcement of the PA in the fighting in the Central Area because of the vaccination campaign people were literally told by this military as they received messages and received they read the the leaflets that were dropped by the Israeli Army to go back to these blocks 12 128 29 130 they're all next to each other and they were told they are safe literally the word safe was in those text messages was in those Def flets and people were told to get back to these areas and now the the explosion just took place that shattered any sense of safety that remained to people also it shattered any sense of in the narrative about the pauses in the fighting as again this is very similar to what the Israeli military has been doing in the past 10 months it's all it's full of lies it's misleading it's contradictory it's fake people told to go to areas to avoid being bombed and they get bombed and they get killed and get bed in the very particular areas and locations they were told to go to this is we we we keep monitoring the development of this story but the fact is happening without any prior warning what ever this Road next to the gate of the hospital is quite busy at this particular time of the day it's more of like a rush hours it's a market place here people tend to leave their tents leave to to tend to leave the areas where they evacuated we they have been evacuated in and come to this road and particular streets leading to the gate of the hospital and buying and shop and restock from whatever is available so it's really a busy hour quite more of a like a rush hour uh in the area and what we're getting now consistent what I was saying the street was full of it of hundreds of people either those who are coming back to their homes taking their bongas and taking the very Road where the bomb where the explosion happens going back to the eastern part of Dar B City or at the vicin of the hospital when the explosion happens all right hany many thanks for that update we will of course come back to you um as when we get more information just to clarify hany and the rest of the team have been reporting on the roll out of polio vaccines uh one of the centers there in der Al Bala just to repeat what we've just heard from hany what appears to have been a strike uh possibly carried out by an Israeli military drone on a Target close to the gates of that hospital as I say on day two of the polio vaccine roll out something that the Israeli military said they would provide a safe Corridor to allow civilians uh to get to into allow them to be vaccinated make sure to subscribe to our channel to get latest news from Al jazer
