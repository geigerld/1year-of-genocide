well Egypt has been stepping up its number of checkpoints along its border with Gaza that satellite images are revealing this now in November construction Crews began working on a raised strip of land some 200 meters away from the fence dividing Egypt from the Gaza Strip it's now 3.5 km long that brings the total length of the earth barrier to some 14 km we understand Egypt is also building a new concrete wall along the old border wall well Israel's advance to the south of Gaza has been raising tensions with Egypt the two countries signed a formal peace treaty back in 1979 based on What's called the Camp David Accords it lays out a complicated set of agreements about land and borders now importantly it limits the presence of Egypt's military in the Sinai Peninsula a separate agreement was also then signed in 2005 after Israeli soldiers and settlers withdrew from the Gaza Strip and that covered how the rougher border crossing was to be run as well as how Egypt could deploy guards along that border but Israel is now talking about relocating huge numbers of Palestinians away from Rafa Egypt has warned that any attempt to move move people across the border could lead to the termination of the treaty and the other agreements too between the two countries well let's not bring in maub he's the director of the G studies Center and a professor of Middle East politics at katar University ma always great to have you as we've been reporting Egypt has been clear that any forced Mass displacement of people from Gaza is a red line for them we see there already fortifying the Border area what does that red line mean to Cairo what kind of action could we see you know since um November there was a different messages coming from Cairo about the situation in Gaza and the the the most important me two messages one no displacement people will not be allowed to go to SAA and the other the other important message um there will be no um military operation on what so-called Philadelphia uh uh cross border with with Egypt and the security of that U basically area will be under the Egyptians and those two messages basically were uh obvious between both sides what was interesting the the hidden messages where basically um Israel was accusing um Egypt of being responsible of the you know or problematic issue on the rafos border where Egyptian now claim that the problem in in is Israel so there is a a war a war between both sides but when it comes to the um uh Philadelphia and when it comes to the uh um procedures that Egyptians are following it's obvious that they don't want to have any Palestinian going to SAA so far well if that red line is crossed what could we see happen Mau um in the last uh 24 hours the red line was if if any Israelis pushed towards that the the whole peace treaty will be basically put on hold um the the the news came from the Israeli side the Egyptians basically kept silent but um to be honest um I think maybe this is this is a way to uh test the water if this happens I think uh when it comes from Channel 13 of Israel that was I call it a test of what how the Egyptian will will response to that um I'm not sure so far that the Egyptians has responded serious seriously about what happened in Gaza whether when it comes to the humanitarian Aid or when it comes to the politic to the politics to the humanitarian a they are not doing enough to push more more more uh Aid to come into Gaza uh there is a a bureaucracy on their borders that is um even by the uh United Nations been acknowledging that and saying you know the Egyptians should do more um and that's not to blame only the Israelis so I think the Egyptians they try to check two things one what is the American Position will be and how far the Americans can pressure Netanyahu and the second element is how much Arabs and and other nations Europeans and the EU for in particular can pressure Israelis I think the Egyptians they keep eye on those two main factors and see how much they can pressure Netanyahu I'm not sure the Egyptian can really really play a major role on stopping rafah military operation that the Israelis want to do I'm not sure they would be able to stop it they need uh some support internationally from the United States from the United Nation from the Europeans otherwise alone I'm not I'm not sure they can do it well I've been wondering about the White House response here because we know that Egypt has close economic and Military ties with the US where is Washington on this they've been saying for some time they won't accept the force displacement of people from Gaza but what does that actually mean in practice in according to the Washington Post just uh in the last uh 20 25 minutes I was was reading they say we have no impact in secret or in public on Netanyahu we have no impact and we are missing that momentum and that is uh that is the assessment of people close to piden who now they push him to criticize Biden to criticize Nan in public so basically there is a serious need to Biden to be more Brave and basically cross the red lines he puts for himself from day one when he and his administration accepted the Israeli narrative and followed following that narrative they need to reach the point that that narrative has not offered him offer Biden any actually help in his in the elections and he needs now to cross that line and decide about how to pressure the Israelis so he can win the vote of the young people in the United States if he wants to remain um he wants to remain in in the in in the White House well ma let me ask you about these protests that we've also been seeing at Karam Abu salum do you think they could impact the aid relationship that the role that Egypt is playing you were talking earlier about that war of words over who's actually stopping aid from getting into Gaza those demonstration as are a reflection of the division which Netanyahu government has created between the families of captives and the families of the soldiers so those are the family of the soldier and Netanyahu government they want to say that we have uh uh an active society which basically still in favor of the war and they in favor of actually not allowing uh humanitarian Aid to get into Gaza so it's a reflection it's a political game thaty is playing to basically divide and roll and one of the signs of that is what happened in the K abam basically crossb boards Maj they're speaking to us from katar University at a professor of Middle Eastern politics always great to get your thoughts thank you for joining us again Mau thank you thank you thank you
