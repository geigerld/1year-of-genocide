the Norwegian Refugee council is warning that any attempt by Israel to permanently displace Palestinians within or from Gaza would amount to a breach of international law the Israeli Army's expanding ground offensive is forcing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians even further south and worsening an already dire humanitarian situation according to the UN 1.9 million Palestinians more than 80% of the population have been forced from their homes by Israeli attacks or evacuation orders it says Israel's indiscriminate bombardment has damaged more than a quarter of a million housing units and completely destroyed a further 55,000 making them uninhabitable It also says more than 1 million Palestinians have no safe or secure home to return to Aid workers are battling to reach those in need because of ongoing Israeli attacks they say the only way to deliver humanitarian Aid is a sustainable ceasefire Ahmed is Middle East adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council he joins us live now from Aman thanks very much uh for being with us so talk to us first of all about some of the challenges that your team have faced there in particular and as we mentioned how how difficult it is for the the groups that are that are working there to deliver any Aid when there is a conflict going on um yes of course uh 50 of my colleagues have been pushed all the way down to down south to Rafa which is now one of the most populated uh most densely populated areas in Gaza we're talking about 12,000 people per square kilometer it's almost impossible to operate and satisfy the the you know the immense needs to meet the immense needs of of the populations there my team uh tells us uh our team tells us that um there are people who have to go days without a meal they themselves are teams have been displaced repeatedly at times with their extended families they have to build tents and stay in tents that can hardly shelter people from the worsening weather conditions the increasingly uh desperate situation of course all of this with almost Complete Siege um no food no enough food that is allowed in no enough clean uh drinking water and of course their displacement that continues to increase with Israel creeping closer Israeli tanks creeping closer to the South and um as as you know the the UN Security Council passed this resolution last week calling for uh more uh humanitarian Aid to be uh brought into uh the Gaza Strip but but no ceasefire have you noticed any increase at all in in humanitarian uh shipment since that time has has that made a difference at all it is very hard to tell I mean um what we have been saying here is that the amount uh we shouldn't be you know um preoccupied with counting numbers of of ships and shipments and a trucks what we need to see is difference on the ground and so far that has not been achieved there are people that are still hungry actually starving we're on the verge of famine for half a million people at the same time you know desperation means that people not enough are not getting enough um you know AIDS um and that includes water as well the situation on the ground is desperate in the sense that people who are being pushed to the South have nowhere to go have nowhere to stay so while this has been a a step in the right direction we need a giant stride here and we need countries to come together to agree to a ceasefire a lasting ceasefire what is happening on the opposite is more pushing of people uh towards the South and hence our um warnings that you know it is alarming how Palestinians are being pushed and and are being uh asked to uh leave their homes constantly and repeatedly and that is a violation of uh of international law and just briefly you mentioned in the release that's been provided to us about the fear of of uh people in Palestinians being pushed into EG Egypt how how real is that possibility right now uh I mean um when you think of the the plans that have been endorsed by the ministry of intelligence in Israel by when you think of when you hear the rhetoric by the Prime Minister and his senior ministers and officials we have every reason to worry uh it is already happening that people are being pushed without any Prospect of going going back home uh and now we fear that they will be pushed over the Border as you know as it seems that there are you know the Israelis are thinking of that concretely they are already discussing that plan and we have made it clear that this would constitute an atrocity crime which means that it could be either a war crime or a crime against humanity and this is why it is contingent on World's powers to stop that from happening to stop that um nightmare scenario from happening what we need is exactly the opposite for people to be able to go back home safely and to be with their families and not to be pushed over the Border against their will appreciate your time Ahmed Bam from the Norwegian Refugee Council
