well over the years children have paid a heavy price from Israel's offensives on Gaza hundreds have been killed many more maimed or injured and left living with trauma fear and grief let's go back to 2008 that's when Israel launched its so-called operation castled a devastating surprise air and ground offensive on Gaza that lasted 23 days 342 children were killed Israel's military operation in 2012 took the lives of at least 30 Palestinian children some as young as 2 years old in 2014 547 were killed in 50 days most as a direct result of Israeli attacks in 2021 at least 67 died in 11 days of conflict and in only nine days of War this month as we were saying more than a thousand have been killed that's the worst toll on Palestinian children in years the un's children's agency says time is running out for those in Gaza Pat Breen is a former Irish trade Minister a former chair of the Foreign Relations Committee in Ireland's Parliament sir you're joining us from limmerick in the Republic of Ireland we're trying to analy how are you good afternoon it's good to have you on the show we've been looking at how various countries stand in this conflict what they've been saying what they've been doing I'd like your thoughts on Europe's position since the beginning of this war well first of all can I say to you uh the picture in one of Irish Ireland's daadi's new newspaper this morning the Irish independent of two small children and the fear and the pain in their face and eyes is Illustrated very clearly in the photograph and it happened just after a bombardment of Gaza yesterday and of course the Irish government are very concerned uh about what's happening in Gaza and we have been concerned about this over over the history of of the conflicts over 75 years I visited Gaza myself back after after operation Cate in 2009 to see from as firsthand uh the destruction after operation Cate and um you know to say that today the U bombardment of Gaza is is the worst in 75 years um is something you know that that you know you have to just can't imagine and the Irish government are concerned the Prime Minister last evening met president mcon at the at the Alis palace in Paris and they um you know shared ideas of how to get both the French and the Irish Nationals out of um G Gaza in the event of the Raa uh Gates opening um France and irand are very aligned in in the in the way we're dealing with this project we believe that Israel has a right to protect itself but it doesn't um you know have a right uh to break humanitarian law and that's something that's you know that's very much evident at the moment we are very concerned U that the uh an operation will take place in the coming days both from air sea and land uh into Gaza and this would cause um huge huge humanitarian problems um it's not possible first walk and I just said to you to move a million people from northern Gaza to Southern Gaza and where do these people go Southern G Gaza is already full and they have to you know their their houses are being bombarded where to go when they come back trying to find hamis trying to find an needle in a HC so it's a very difficult situation and I would hope that the um you know the return visit now by secretary blink to Israel that he will bring back a message from the other Arab leaders that uh a ground Invasion shouldn't happen does Ireland have Nationals in Gaza well we have about 40 Nationals in Gaza at the moment most them would be working with the United Nations or they would have Jewel passports as well I mean that's the concern for the foreign minister at the moment Mall Martin uh he spoke to um the um president of the European Council last night sha Michelle in relation to this and to make cons consy contingency plans to get these people out of um Gaza should the um you know the refa um Border Gates open uh we don't know this morning what's going to happen here Israel says it probably won't hope it happen at the moment but it's it's important that for humanitarian reasons that that gate opens as quickly as possible uh to get people that need humanitarian assistance those injured we've talked about a thousand children dead there are thousands more in hospitals and we're told that within 24 hours there'll be no electricity um uh to to man the um the hospital um you know technology to keep these people alive and that's a very worrying Factor indeed all right Pat Breen former Irish trade Minister former chair of the Foreign Relations Committee in Ireland's Parliament thank you very much for joining us on the program today
