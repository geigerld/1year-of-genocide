the United Nations has called it a war on [Applause] Children gaza's Health Ministry has documented more than 15,000 of their deaths and Aid agencies are sounding the alarm on yet another Grim statistic the missing children according to humanitarian organization save the children almost 21 1,000 miners in Gaza have been reported missing since the beginning of the war in October 177,000 of them are either unaccompanied or separated from their families while at least 4,000 are believed to be trapped under Rubble in the aftermath of Israeli strikes on residential buildings and refuge centers wherever you look in Gaza there are children they make up nearly half of the population in the besiege strip in the wake of unrelenting war aid agencies say it's become more difficult to support them nearly 19,000 children are reported orphaned in Gaza that has left the fate of many miners entirely or in part in the hands of total strangers they warn this is increasing the risk of abuse exploitation and neglect and that's put a spot light on a generation of children who have not only lost their parents but are left alone and unprotected in a war zone Felix noara Al jazer we're joined Now by khed kzar he's the general director of the child rights organization defense for children International Palestine he's with us live in rala thank you for your time sir so the UN calling the Gaza war war on children we know that over 15,000 of them have been killed since the War Began how much does this latest report add to the growing concerns about how this war is affecting children uh first of all thank you very much for sharing the this information and of course for talking about this very important topic uh what's happening in gizza is unpresented before we are working in this field for more than 30 years but what we are facing what we are witnessing is Tres uh even uh we we we didn't seen before even during the second world war so yeah it is a war against children children in Gazza are paying the big cost the big price for the Israeli genocide on Gazza and of course also in the West Bank children are also subject to uh war crimes and C crimes against the humanity the report highlights that some of gaza's children have been forcibly disappeared including an unknown number detained and forcibly transferred out of Gaza is that something you can shed any light on yes the fundamental rights of the Palestinian children in Gaza are violated systematically and continuously from the Israeli Army so this is why we are talking about targeting children and War on children children in Gaza is around 50% of the population as the report mentioned so uh all the rights are violated the right to life is not guaranteed anymore in Gaza so the number of the children who been killed and I'm so sorry to talk about children in numbers but the the number also reflect the facts on the ground so we talk about around 20,000 children missed in Gaza so those who are killed it's there are about 50% almost 50% of the killing in Gaza and when we talk about 50 20,000 killed this means that more than 40,000 being injured and the right to to health is not guarantee anymore right to food right to to clean water right to housing adequate housing all the right all the necessity of the life are denied for the children in Gaza and in so what is yes apologies for interrupting sir uh from your experience how does war and conflict affect the mental health of children what sort of long-term issues are we talking about here until now we are talking about the right to keep Survivor to keep alive but of course those who are live under atrocities since more than eight months of course psychologically they all damaged they all affected they all need immediate support psychological support otherwise they will be also considered as out of of the life and and tell us a bit more about how the challeng is involved in giving support to Children those who are left behind those that are alive and are vulnerable to exploitation neglect and abuse H how do you take care of those those children so from my experience I believe that the Israeli policy is targeting children and also focusing on how to to kill the hope for the children so those who are left without any family member like we are now talking about almost 177,000 those who been injured those who've been uh starving and looking for a piece of food of bread to keep survival so all of them and those who are live under the Israeli BL pomping all the all the time all the time the BL in the in the the sky so all of them they are live under such circumstances and of course with this un ongoing situation psychologically I believe that they have been damaged and they need immediate now nobody can give such support for the children because they are as the Secretary General of United Nation said there's no place for children in Gaza there is no means of in Gaza so the children are of course live under such ongoing situation while not we are unable to give them the support that they need in the right time but to give the right the support okay after that it will be too too too too late too late I I
