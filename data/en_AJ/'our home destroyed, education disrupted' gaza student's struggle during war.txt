Our house was destroyed, and we succeeded more than once. I mean, every few times we go to a place, we go from school to hospital to house, all in a sigh. We live in a school, meaning we live our lives in everything, but education is not available in this school. The class in which I am supposed to give guidance is supposed to give guidance, but we lived. In it, I mean, we tried to coexist in it despite the hardships because of the war that the Jews did against us, and we hope that the war will end and we can go back to studying, go back to learning, and go back to living our lives in homes, not in schools, and God willing, the school will return to teach, not to the displaced, because frankly, living in schools is not nice because all means of life are cut off.  There is also not much transportation and food available, but thank God, it means a lot of hardship because I was deprived of the most basic right to education, and this will be the best year in the life of every student in the whole world because it determines his educational destiny, but unfortunately this year was destroyed, everything was destroyed, and the whole life was destroyed after this war. God willing, may God protect us from war
