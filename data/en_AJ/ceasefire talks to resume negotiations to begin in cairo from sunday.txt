demonstrators in Tel Aviv say they're increasingly angry at the government's inability to bring back these maning Israeli captives now there was a rally held by the family members of those still being held in Gaza but they say they're tired of holding peaceful rallies and are calling for the entire state of Israel to quote take to the streets and burn the country down previously they were calling on Benjamin Netanyahu to resign and for elections to be held immediately but now they're saying that he needs to be overthrown and until that happens these protests in massive size and scale will continuously be happening tonight a lot of violence between demonstrators and Israeli police as they attempt to clear roads and here in Tel Aviv trying to block the major highway known as ey alone something that was a reoccurring theme in the year of anti-government demonstrations but police have come out in the masses in order to try and prevent that ham salut Al jaaz Tel Aviv well let's discuss this in all the latest developments in Israel's war on Gaza with tame kmut he's an assistant professor of public policy at the DOA Institute for graduate studies thank you for joining us before we talk about the resumption of of the ceasefire talks in Cairo I wanted to get your thoughts first on what's going on inside Israel right now and these ongoing protests are they posing any threat to Netanyahu and his coalition government uh FY at at this stage I mean they're more of u a noise but not really threat for n because sadly by large the Israel Society is still Pro War uh Natan is still standing on a solid Coalition uh and uh so far they have not reached the spping point where when it comes to their size and their their sheer size and and impact to really deter Netanyahu or change his political behavior and he's aware of these uh facts and Dynamics he's reading this the Israelis Street very well so at this stage I don't think uh they POS real threat however he's he's he's a master tactician and and he's still engaging with these demands by sending delegations left and right to engage in negotiations I was going to ask you about that so the the ceasefire talks are set to resume in Cairo on Sunday and then they'll move on to Doha as well but at the same time Netanyahu is adamant that he will go ahead with the offensive on Rafa with the invasion of Rafa why is this happening at the same time simultaneously what message is he sending and and what do you think will come out of these fire talks if anything so indeed I mean I mean sending a delegation this could serve his internal uh interest like this angry Audience by him pretending that he's engaging in these negotiations but at the same time if we if you look at the of the same team it's it's I mean it still lacks a mandate to strike a deal Natan still holds the final say on on any future deals uh meaning it has been reported in Israeli media that it's only him who objects uh a key condition that has been an obstacle so far in in succeeding any future negotiations which is the return of Palestinian refugees from south to North and so far this has been a main obstacle the Hamas negotiator negotiators wants to see uh some movement on this on this condition but the Israelis are very stubborn Netanyahu himself are very stubborn opposite to the rest of his War cabinets who are apparently okay with people going back to the north and also if if Israel still plans to move ahead with a military operation in RAF well it it would be logical for people to be allowed to go back to their homes on the north but he's he's still not he's not he's not he's not giving any uh any compromises on this and that's that's the main problem what about Hamas will they are they likely to compromise on the question of releasing captives of course they will because Hamas Hamas does not want to see this as a zero sum game I mean for them emerging as the I mean losing everything so so far Hamas has been cornered in this war the Palestinian people by large have paid paid a heavy price as this war still continues and so Hamas as a Palestinian faction it I mean it's it's it has been put in this narrow corner where I think the way these negotiations have been designed and the way Nano plays with the conditions uh uh in these negotiations are merely designed to to be rejected by Hamas because rationally negoti negotiation should be should should lead to something an outcome that satisfies the two parties but so far this has been going on for a long time and I think the Israelis they have the final say and if they're sincere about moving on and and giving some compromises to Hamas to have the captiv captive the cap the Israeli captives release this could happen but again it's natany it's his obstacle it's himself he's not allowing this to happen okay Tam as always good to get your thoughts about the situation in Gaza thank you very much Tam carot from the Doha Institute of Graduate Studies now
