now Daniel lifshitz is the grandson of retired Israeli journalist odad lifshitz who was taken captive during the October 7th attack and he's joining us live from Tel Aviv thank you very much for your time this evening firstly um what if anything have you heard about your grandfather in Gaza so Elizabeth hi um well my grandfather the last thing that we know about him is that uh is 180 days ago when uh my grandmother been released she told us that probably he's dead because he got injured in his hand the terrorist shot the door of the safe room and he got injured in his hand and they dragged him outside took my grandmother rolled her in a carpet put her on a motorbike legs one side hands the other and the last scene of my grandfather was him they just threw him by the house uh bleeding and unconscious she thought he's not with us but then in the first release uh two hostages saw him one with a white galabia uh bleeding next to her and then uh he got kind of a treatment and another hostage came back she' been there for 55 days and she said that she'd been there for six months imagine every hostage think it's a three days over one and she said that he was with her for a month he was actually even changing for her diapers there they are old people and um he has a blood pressure issues and a lung disease and he faint and they took him and since then we'd have nothing about him we don't know anything about him in the last six months and uh it's unimaginable that my grandfather he is the only great grandfather held hostage in the world that's a horrible title for 84 years old man on Saturday uh Mr lifshits I'm sure that you're following you know all of the reports around the ceasefire negotiations very closely given that they involve the release of Israeli captives one of the most recent sticking points seems to be that um you know Hamas is willing to release something like 303 captives but Israel wants to make sure that the captives that they are released are alive what do you say to that so I don't want to listen to too many Rumors in the media but I know that uh the deal that Hamas agreed now is not what they spoke about before but I know that Israel made a painful con concessions to uh come to a deal and uh the negotiation teams are in Cairo and I I hope that they will get into making this deal and end the suffer of uh all the sides uh personally those uh first hostages supposed to go out are in a very bad humanitarian situation we don't even know the situation as Hamas didn't even let the Red Cross to see them so we have no information um what I'm looking for is that they will be able to negotiate until a deal is uh done because every day we are losing them as as as you said 33 hostages we don't know who's alive who's not I don't know the real number there but I'm sure that uh many of them are not alive anymore because all those people over 80 years old my grandfather H Perry those who fought all their life for the coexistence of the Palestinians and the Israeli my grandfather was taking sick Palestinians to the Israeli Hospital Seck gazin from Aris border every Friday to a very expensive treatment of uh chemotherapy bringing them back and this guy been kidnapped during a hudna from his house in kibuts N Ro there he should be released unconditionally that's what I'm looking for that it's impossible that we are even speaking seven months after about release of old people I mean that's against everything that's against religious that's against the Quran that's really against every humanitarian uh issue every human humankind we have seen many things happen over the last seven months of this war that are against every International humanitarian law the protests calling for the release of captives haven't stopped since the War Began but judging by the Israeli government's actions do you think that they're having an impact do you think that the Israeli government is prioritizing your grandfa the other Israeli captives look if we are here seven months after so uh it means the priority was not at first for every part but now in the last few months I see that uh they tried to uh get into a deal and uh now everyone are negotiating in Cairo and uh unfortunately you know in the Middle East someone wise told me the negotiations are Under Fire I would prefer they will be not under Fire and there will be no more suffer not for civilians in the Palestinians side and on our side and they could be able to get to an agreement that end that because you know the end of the war is down river to the release of the hostages and I was in Doha in January and I look on the Prime Minister Muhammad and Bin Abdul Rahman bin Jim malani and in his eyes and he's telling me that he's doing everything for the release to I called them to make more pressure and more effort to end the suffer of everyone and make sure all the hostages are coming back the 132 hostages and Gaza can go back to uh rebuild and as well you know I feel that all Gaza is kidnapped by Hamas as well not only my grandfather that is Daniel lifshitz the uh grandson of one of the Israeli captives being held in Gaza thank you for your time make
