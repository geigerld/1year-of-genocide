I'm Anna saridu um I'm a first year medical student at the University of Oxford and we're currently in the Oxford encampment um which is a collection of members of the um community of Oxford and the university in support of the people of Palestine so what we want ultimately is for the University to acknowledge this as a genocide um we want there to be condemnation for the actions of the Israeli government um and for the complicity of European governments including the United Kingdoms as well as the United States um in not acknowledging this as it needs to be um and further to that funding and arming Israel as a nation and its Army and allowing for this to happen and beyond that um we know that Oxford has Investments um in Israeli companies and Israeli business um at a college level this is unclear so as well as wanting Clarity um for how these Investments are made at the college level um we want for Oxford University as an institution to divest um from these companies and to stop funding genocide in this way in directly as well as directly and hopefully um the action of Institutions so we're not the only encampment in the UK I think there's n or 10 of us currently um hopefully these institutions responding in this way put some pressure on our government as well um to mirror these actions and to do the same at a national level we will stay here as long as we can and as long as it is safe for us to do so um given how much help we've had from the community and how much um um Aid we've had in the form of food and supplies um wooden planks so we don't walk through the mud um you know help in any form and also donations to keep the camp going I think we're in a good position um to remain here obviously not forever um but I think I would be very surprised if we have no response from the University at all um I would like to think that the people um who lead these um prestigious universities which are known across the world um do care about what their students think um and would like to at least open some sort of conversation um about how these demands can be met and how they can best represent student interests because we are all paying to be here and even though we all love this University and I feel very lucky to be here but with that being said I also feel that my voice in this matters and all of us do and that is why we've come together for this issue make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
