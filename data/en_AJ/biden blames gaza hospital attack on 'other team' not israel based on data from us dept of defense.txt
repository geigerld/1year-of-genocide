well the US President Joe Biden as you've been hearing has met with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv he supported Israel's denial of involvement in that attack on a hospital in Gaza Alan Fischer brings us that report it was a trip meant to help deescalate the crisis in Gaza but it began to unravel before Joe Biden even touched down in Tel Aviv warm hugs to be followed by tough questions said the White House particularly on humanitarian issues but then there was a massacre at a Gaza Hospital overshadowing everything the Americans have ordered their own inquiry into what happened but Joe Biden appears to be endorsing Israeli denials I was deeply saddened and outraged by the uh explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday and based on what I've seen it appears as though it was done by the other team not not you Joe Biden has promised Israel what it needs to carry out its offensive in Gaza Min support clearly welcomed by the country's prime minister with one eye on the American audience on October 7th Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis maybe more this is in a country of fewer than 10 million people this would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day that's 2911 that is why October 7th is another day that we live in infamy Jo Biden was meant to leave here and meet with three Arab leaders in Jordan but and an extraordinary diplomatic snub they essentially canceled angry that the US president was not prepared to call for a ceasefire but he did want to ring concessions during his visit aware of the growing anger at the rise in the number of dead and the humanitarian crisis in a final speech before leaving after this extraordinary visit Joe Biden revealed he' secured Israeli cooperation for Aid to be allowed into Gaza working in close cooperation with the government of Egypt the United Nations and its agencies like the world program and other partners in the region to get trucks moving across the border as soon as possible Joe Biden's unwavering support for Israel has won many admirers here but in the wider region there's concern the US isn't using the influence it has to do more to stop the assault in Gaza and stop the number of dead from rising Alan Fischer Al jazer Tel Aviv well let's bring in Maan Bashar our senior political analyst who joins us from London Maran what did you make of Biden's visit and and particularly his choice of language that we saw on T aiv well clearly first and foremost in as far as his own politics and the one back at home in the United States he certainly went from embracing uh prime minister Netanyahu uh emotionally and politically to basically em embracing him physically I think the idea of a hug uh on on camera was quite important and uh apparently it was very important for the Prime Minister himself I mean I've never seen him hug that closely and clearly he needed the hug uh because it was a a symbolic gesture that the American president in in Israel when Israel is at a state of War so I think there was that and then there was the idea that especially that he arrived after the uh bombing of the uh Al hospital and the the death of hundreds that he had to start speaking more in you know humanitarian terms and pay maybe pay lip service to Palestinian sufferings after uh he went on and on and on in details about Israeli suffering but be that as it may uh if you add it all together I think the the phrase we need to use today it's not exactly fortunate one but it is what it is is pyromaniac fireman in the sense that the American president is nudging supporting unconditionally Israel to carry on with its indiscriminate uh genocidal war in the Gaza STP and at the same time he's talking about avoiding the death of civilians avoiding civilian suffering and making sure that there is humanitarian assistance and so forth and I think just picking on what Alan Fisher said I think that has been convincing for the Israelis but it has not be convincing for much of the Arab world well speaking of which Biden was also supposed to be meeting with Arab leaders in Aman right but that was all cancelled that meeting was meant to I understand create the basis for a further Summit in Egypt on the weekend so what now I think that's as an important uh turnabout or as uh President Biden likes to say all the time it was an infliction point for the us and for the region something happened uh yesterday and and clearly If October 7 was a was an important date October 17 was another important date in the sense of the change of mood in the Arab world and the change of mood on the Arab Street and the anger and the solidarity with the Palestinian struggle and Palestinian suffering that certainly put a lot of heat and pressure on Arab leaders and I think it left first the Palestinian leader with no other option but to walk away and get back to ramala where things were basically falling apart and then the Jordanian and the Egyptian leaders also decided that you know what I mean we are dependent on uh American assistance yes we are on the payroll but you know what we can't afford it we have to take a stand and they did take a stand now just to be clear that stand was simply to say we're going to cancel that Summit because the circumcise does doesn't help but none of them closed an Israeli Embassy none of them recalled uh uh you know ambassador from Israel and none of them certainly cut any relations with Israel well meanwhile Maran there are obvious fears in the International Community of escalation right I I want to ask you about a comment that the Palestinian Ambassador made in the security Council today that this is a war that could shape the next 10 years in your mind what could that look like well I think it's a bit of what we talked about uh from day one which is there's supposed to be a consensus around it I think Israel's declaration of war and its decision to now carry on what 12 days of bombing uh of the Gaza Strip mostly indiscriminant where we have thousands of deaths and tens of thousands of casualties in this war that Israel has decided to launch against this densely populated area was going to lead sooner or later especially if a land Invasion starts to uh the kind of urban Warfare that we haven't seen since the second world war in the sense that uh there will probably be tens of thousands more like hundreds of thousands of casualties and probably the Israelis will also uh incur some casualties as well if they go in uh all the way so clearly that's going to be you know a major tragic War uh whereby I'm not sure there's going to be winners and losers and even when Israel does it it does you know occupy there is no end game after that and that's why the American president advised the the Israelis that it would be a big mistake for them to occupy so here we are now on the logic of indiscriminate bombing it just goes on and on and mistakes now are done failures are done and we're having the logic of uh you know too many people uh dying in war as if they are sort of you know uh casual by mistake when in fact the Israelis have made it clear that at least the Israeli president has made it clear that there are no innocent people in Gaza and that they are all responsible hence there's an intent behind what a massacre becomes a genoside alir senior political analyst Maan bashara sharing those thoughts from London thanks for joining us again maram
