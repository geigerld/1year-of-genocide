thank you for joining us it's 6 months since Israel launched its war on Gaza in what the international court of justice regards as a plausible case of genocide it began after Hamas attacked Southern Israel on October the 7th killing more than 1,100 people since then Israel's bombardment of the strip has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians nearly half of them children most of the population around 1.7 million people has been displaced another round of ceasefire negotiations is set to to resume in Cairo in the coming hours an Israeli delegation is expected to attend and Hamas has confirmed it's also sending representatives in some of the latest fighting on the ground the armed wing of Hamas the Kasam brigad say it's they've killed a Fighters 14 uh Israeli soldiers rather during confrontations in Kan Yunis in southern Gaza the battles were centered around Al Amal and Alana neighborhoods the Israeli Army has confirmed at least four of its soldiers were killed in southern Gaza our military is still engaged in the Gaza Strip in southern Gaza Brigade 98 is engaged in conun particularly in the al-amal neighborhood their soldiers are engaged in brutal and fierce combat from close range we also are conducting aerial strikes in conun in order to destruct terrorist infrastructure currently we are finalizing the destruction of three tunnels being used in attacks one of which traverses into Israel the tunnels were discovered by the Israeli military as they were establishing checkpoints in the area live now to Al jazer hanim Mahmud in Rafa so six months on and the fighting rages on Han bring us up to speed with the latest including this Ambush on Israeli soldiers in southern Gaza right well 6 months into this genocidal War there is still a great support for it among Israelis nanaho cell is in charge and no signs of slowing down the genocidal acts and the atrocities and the mass arrest and massing across the Gaza Strip just overnight attacks are continue on over crowded ra City where several people were critically injured transferred to and already exhausted uh uh almost at the brink of collapsed health facility that's a Nar Hospital in the Central Area we're looking at more attacks happening at the western part of the Central Area mainly on refugee camps but perhaps the worst of what's happening right now is in kanun city and just remind our viewer the Israeli military has been operating on the ground aggressively uh for the past four months in the city of Khan Unis mly destroying a close to 90% of its residential buildings public facilities as well as uh the the infrastructure and driving the population out into further Southern Park or the Central Area making them displaced people right now the eastern part of City area where according to uh civil defense crew and and and and eyewitnesses who managed to get to the area to inspect the the sheer level of Destruction report about shocking level of destruction of all means of life including schools health facilities and Clinics and residential homes and infrastructure all going and that's where uh an ambush according to a statement released by Hamas military Wing Alam Brigade that they ambushed three Mara tanks in the Zenna area that's the eastern part of of the city and has been getting under bombardment for the past weeks and since the beginning of the war uh Hamas reported the military wing of Hamas reported in a statement that nine people were killed in the Ambush and in a separate attack three more that brings the total into uh into 13 uh people uh who have been uh four other people killed they bring the total into four people who have been killed meanwhile in the western part of Khan Unice the Israeli military is still at Al AML neighborhood that's where Al AML health facility Al AML hospital is located operating aggressively the military issued a statement saying that it is working on dismantling uh terrorist infrastructure and a running extreme fight on the ground but according to eyewitness there Israeli military is continue to justify The Killing and the destruction of largest civilian population on the ground and honey where do things stand as far as more Aid getting into Gaza Israel had said it would open the areas Crossing into Northern Gaza has that happened at all not at all we don't see any signs of any significant change in terms of flow of human Aid and Food Supplies the trucks into the Gaza Strip the fact that we we're seeing that there're miles on on the other side of the borders where Miles of trucks have been prevented and and land Crossing and be virtually closed in front of humanitarian Aid and from the northern part we know after the phone call that was described as a very tough phone call between Biden and nany the Israeli military announced new measures on the ground to allow more humanitarian aid but it has been almost 48 hours since the announcement of these measure measures but none nothing is happening on the ground nothing has it changed significantly with the the famine is spreading so quickly and more people are dying in another part uh it there need to be more Swift actions uh uh to protect and save lives and protect them from the danger of family but on the ground no signs of any significant change has has been visible thank you very much for the update that's Al jazer hanim Mahmud reporting there live from Rafa
