patients and are running out of fuel and basic medical Necessities I would like to confirm that at the start of the second month of this war the medical system in Gaza is totally and comprehensively unable to offer services in every part of the medical system the medical system in Gaza cannot save the lives of people cannot treat the wounded because they are being targeted directly by the Israeli occupation we suffer a lack of fuel and medical supplies particularly in Northern Gaza where bakeries have been targeted this has led to a lack of food facilities no bread no food supplies for Citizens patients and Medical Teams consequently Medical Teams in hospitals in Northern Gaza are without food and without the ability to save lives let's get an update now on the situation in the
