in the main building of sh Hospital which is the main General surger and Orthopedic building above the emergency department so the the situation is getting really more and more tighter it's really horrible here it has been continuous bombing and firing uh since the last let me say five hours almost the Israel is tanks are moving towards the shifa hospital I've seen two tanks getting in the gate the main gate the Eastern Gate of shifa hospital and they were inside shifa hospital and we keep hearing the tanks moving within the area of chifa Hospital the bombing have been really really aggressive over the last few many hours with continuous uh shooting you know all over the place all over the areas you cannot you don't know from where exactly sometimes you hear it from the East the other time you see from the south or from the West so it's totally like surrounding the hospital and keeps firing continuously with all kinds of you know to the hospital the Israelis have called the hospital Administration around an hour ago saying that they are getting in the hospital and they are about to get inside the buildings and to investigate and to try to check each building one by one and each room within the hospital and they advise the people they them not to look through the windows or the doors and that everyone might be at risk if they TR to do anything so uh and then they said nothing about the way of doing this they said nothing about the mechanism of getting in uh the the the Weir thing that since they ask about this thing nothing has happened at least in our building I can tell you and then the you know the the bombing and the shooting you can hear it ground didn't stop at all sometimes it's really really very very dense so uh so again the hospital is full of patients we have around 700 patients we have civilians within the hospital Sheltering there are families with kids with ladies and we have the medical staff so imagine how scary is that to everyone here with the hospital everyone feels scary and and imagine for the Paran this the first time to be in contact with the Israelis at least for whoever was born uh you know in their in their 0s yeah it sounds it sounds like an absolutely terrifying situation unfolding in a hospital which is meant to be a place of healing and also of Refuge often in Gaza Dr ammed Malala Lati you're saying that you are inside the main building that you can hear um that you can hear explosion that you can hear gunfire that you've seen Israeli tanks but can you just tell us exactly where you are inside the main building of shiffer and and what is around you what is it that you can see around you actually we in the doctor's office here we we can't check anything you know it's totally dangerous to try to check through the window so what happened since they start the attacking the people tried to go inside the corridors and none of the people is you know directly within the windows areas as the the Israelis will be shooting all over the areas and what happened that maybe three hours ago they attacked the fourth floor of the same building with a with a little like just small rocket or something happened to one of the patients room with around half meter diameter hole happened in the water so the people know it's totally unsafe okay to to stay to stay within the windows or the doors so luckily our room is like we have two rooms so we are in the back room which is away from the windows okay otherwise all the patients and the people are within the the corridors and and who is in the doctor's office with you let me tell you something as as as Palestinians okay as doctors whoever decided to stay in shifa hospital feels it's totally a Big challenge we have taken out to ourselves we have taken decision to be Ms uh you know until we survive this horrible situation this massacre happening so uh most of the doctors are sleeping now okay it's 3:00 in the morning the people are really tired because we have been working the whole day we don't care about the Israelis what we care more about our patients what we feel the worst thing to happen is to lose the uh what we wanted to do which is taking care of our patient if the Israelis would Evacuate the hospital in improper way or killing whatever they want then we lose 700 patients who need really active care at this moment these are the ones who whom for which we stayed in Gaza we stayed in sh hospital we feel this is our message you know our mission to help these people we are dedicated to help them so what we are worried about not about the Israel we don't care listen whatever they do we feel this is a good chance which happen to doctors to be part of you know just resisting this uh occupation and just being in our places helping our patients our people in Gaza so literally literally I think that people won't understand how how relaxed we are from inside but happen that the people feel scary it's totally scary situation it's totally unacceptable situation the first two hours we were walking between the patients calming them down between the and are you still Dr MTI are you still able to attend to any patients are any of the doctors there are any of the nurses able to attend to these patients when there is an ongoing Israeli ground operation in the hospital unfortunately we reach a level before this attack today that we run out of the electricity for most of the Departments so there is no scan there is no x-rays there is no laboratory working there is no most of the the hospital setup is like almost collapsed so even in the operating the we have no electricity no oxygen supply uh so we operate only the life saving things so for the last sorry two days we're unable to provide really proper care to the patient just when the Israelis have announced that they are coming in we had a patient with upper like with bleeding from the mouth through the Gast from the stomach we were unable to do anything not because we were scared yeah it happened because the endoscopy department is in another building which is totally evacuated now because of and this is of course something that we have been showing on Al jazer over the past month the crippling of not just gaza's largest hospital but medical facilities across the gaza's trip because of not just Israeli bombardment but the cutting off of fuel and electricity as a result of the siege M uh Dr ammed Malla Lati we thank you very much uh for joining us on Al jazer to tell us what is happening at shiffer hospital right now we really appreciate your time thank you very much
