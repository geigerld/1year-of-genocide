just going to jump in there IAH I'm sorry if we just look at the screen here you can see uh big explosions taking place above uh above Gaza right now and earlier we were talking about this this potential assault on Al's hospital and that's that's not sure exactly what that is it's some kind kind of flare isn't it that's exactly and that's where I'm trying to make the link actually if the Israeli government does not care about their own prisoners with the their families protesting by the the House of the Prime Minister how would they care about the gazans how would they care about the Palestinians in the AL hospital so this actually gives us an indication that we should take alud uh bombing is more seriously right because this government is basically is is is seeing itself that's above the law that's being uh protected by the Western leaders support and they're doing you know they're throwing everything up upside down with the uh international law on what they can do so that's why I think the two issues are are totally or closely linked between the prisoners exchange and the continuous bombing and the ground Invasion that they're making and what Israeli government can do as a result of that because this also if Israel what the Israeli government is is a true of what they're saying that using the Ala hospital as uh place you of operations by Hamas then we should expect there is probably also that Israeli prisoners are there if it this proves to be true but again that's the problem is that of the Israeli government is not not looking at all any of these factors and they're just driven by the collective punishment and the genocide and the ethnic cleansing that they are conducting in Gaza regardless of what the price for the prisoners or for any other uh Palestinian Factor people that whether it's in the H health somewhere else and just again we're looking at these pictures that it's extraordin I can't imagine what it must be like if you're on the ground right beneath that not exactly sure what it is I'm not expert enough to know we we're trying to find out exactly what's going on here but it had the appearance of some kind of flare but flares would normally dissipate this seems to be just carrying on yeah but also there is the possibility Israel also used fist for it in in uh bombs in Gaza in the past so this could be also one of them uh or lighting bonds or what's called right uh or that we that they targeted a u you know they that they hit a huge or a big Target in Gaza that is producing whatever it's very evident that something pretty major is is happening and we've been very concerned about Al's Hospital in in our coverage talking about it and the fact that Israel had told everybody to leave and to evacuate what 14,000 people are Sheltering there I think hundreds of patients doctors administrative staff and so forth all staying put so we're holding our breath hoping that uh there isn't a strike on that hospital itself we heard a comment earlier um that this is as serious now as the Cuba Missile Crisis in a sense and do you do you get a view that we're at a a critical juncture at this moment you know as the the window of as Israel would perceive it of opportunity to act diminishes with every Palestinian death and and the the growth as you talked about of the big protest that we're seeing and and the slight change in tone calling for humanitarian trues and so forth that that actually might bring this to some kind of denum well first of all I think it's yes I agree it's very similar to the Cuban Missile Crisis but there are two levels of decision making U here the difference is because during the Cuban Missile Crisis we had John Kennedy who was in charge in full control and was able to make decision decisions so that was the thing but here we have two levels of decision- making we have Israel that by the way does not care even if it's if this explodes to be a regional or even a third world war they they they don't care that's not in part of their calculations because again they just enjoy the support and the coverage that they receive from the Biden Administration so that's why they're proceeding irrespective of the consequences for others that's happening in the region or or by the way to the United States itself and to the US interest in the region because this is the second level of decision making that I'm referring to here where it's the Biden Administration the Biden administration's larger foreign policy in the world it's much bigger than the current War it it has the Ukraine it has China Russia and so many other things so the US Administration has been very strict and very clear about it's against our national interest is for this war to expand to the region okay IAH back with you in a moment let's go to TK abom in KH Unis in Gaza and T I don't know if you can see what we can see on screen here this blinding yellow light looks to be some kind of flare that's hovering above just casting this huge pole of light across Gaza uh what more do you know about it well uh as you can clearly uh see at the back of ground of the Ukraine on right now a different bombardment took place in the territory as there are going there are ongoing fire exchange between Palestinian Fighters and the Israeli occupation trops near the borders and uh specifically in the Northern areas of uh B hon City in areas uh Crossing border where are there are clashes have been erupted between uh the Israeli ground Invasion troops and the Palestinian Fighters the Israeli ongoing strikes continue relentlessly uh targeting several areas in the territory starting with the uh Central areas of the Gaza Strip in Taha neighborhood where uh there are three residential Towers where level to the ground uh in that complex also the surrounding areas of alot Hospital were previously bombarded by the Israeli ongoing strikes it's also worth mentioning that the Israeli occupation has threatened to bomb the Orthodox Cultural Center which contains and host more than 500 Palestinians who were displaced from the houses uh and the the uh General director of alud hospital has told Al jazer that there are more than 160,000 Palestinians are residing in the surrounding areas and even inside the alotz hospital so any kind of bombardment for the hospital will bring us to a new Massacre that will claim the lives of thousands of Palestinians and will BR catastrophic consequences on the humanitarian level also the attacks continued in the uh Eastern areas of uh of the um T and even the the far west of B where there's going where there is a ground troop is trying to infl rate to the territory had been confronted by the Palestinian Fighters the clashes are continuing till this current moment waiting for further confirmation about the uh the latest updates that on the ground in terms of the number of casualties in both sides uh T tell us more about the uh the numbers of people who've come down to uh the south of Gaza because of course the order was to evacuate from Al K's hospital and it was previously ordered uh in weeks before that to what degree have people come down to the South and and not returned that the house is moving forward to the southern areas of the territory uh the southern areas of the Gaza Strip become overcrowded of people who are really residing in different uh shelters Affiliated to the United Nations and others are residing in the surrounding areas of Gaza different hospital in the south of the territory also um a great number of people did not find even space for them to live even uh either in the hospital or in the um in the onoa shs which become overwhelmed and overcrowded with people uh more than 600,000 Palestinians are residing in the honor athletic chter so uh a number of people decided to come back again to the north and Central Gaza uh in order to uh remain in the houses as there is no any safe place in the territory M while these areas in the south of the Gaza Strip witness the same level of bombardment in the Norther territories all right T we'll leave it there for the moment thanks very much indeed Tark Abu AUM uh let's bring in yumna El said who's in Gaza City so yumna I imagining that what is happening with those big flares lighting up the sky is happening near you is that right yes yes I can see them right here from the window and usually when we see these uh uh uh oh second okay so when we see these uh light bombs being thrown like that in the sky and all the bombardments that you can see around us now and the smoke everywhere we know that these areas where these light bombs are being thrown are going to be severely severely bombarded uh afterward now of course the Gaza Strip is falling in a complete darkness it's completely dark outside there's no light at all so so uh the Israeli military uses these uh light bombs to actually uh throw in the areas that it is going to Target before it targets Just To See Clearly where it is going to be targeting I can see them in in in all all in front of me in that line all in front of me right now and this is very very close it's in neighborhood this should be uh basically very close also to the hospitals in the area around the hospital as well and Y tell me beforehand we were last time we spoke to you there were it was bombardment was continuing at that point as well uh because it seemed to be the neighborhood around Al's hospital that was being targeted uh people at the hospital had been ordered to go more than 12,000 uh people taking shelter there plus all the patients tell us about that yes indeed so since the beginning of uh the early hours of this day hospital was again for the fourth time warned to evacuate before it is going to be bombarded by the Israeli military this time the Israeli military uh called the people Sheltering in the hospital itself not just the uh director and the medical staff like all the other times before uh but told them that they are risking their lives by staying in the hospital and that the hospital will be bombed so uh it asked them to evacuate of course none of the 14,000 people including over 400 patients have uh evacuated or left the hospital uh the director of the hospital told me clearly that there is no means to evacuate that great number of people there is no transportation in the Gaza Strip there's no fuel for transportation and there is no place in gazda city that is supposed to be more safer in a hospital that people can uh shelter in now thousands more than that number 14,000 uh thousands of them are in a shifa complex which is just a little bit uh uh in in the Gaza City itself in the heart of Gaza City in a shifa street it's uh couple of kilometers away from a uh hospital as we are talking about the G STP I can see a huge bomart I can see the Flames now um missiles are falling intensively in that area you just just to clarify that area where you think the missiles you can see missiles falling into whereabouts is that in relation to Al's hospital that is all in the area where around surrounding the AL hospital and that's what the the people staying at the hospital and the the medical staff in the hospital have been telling us all day that uh the bment are around the area of the hospital just about an hour ago the bment got closer to the hospital closer to the area of the hospital in uh much more intense uh warning towards them to teare them to evacuate the hospital can you tell from where you are if if the hospital itself is being hit at this point or is it too hard to say from here from where you are no the hospital hasn't yet been hit have heard it if it was hit we can see that the light bombs and the bombardments that are ongoing now are still around the hospital in the area that is surrounding the hospital all right y we'll leave it there for the moment back with you shortly no doubt thanks in the meantime youel side there in Gaza City
