hello I'm Adrian finigan and this is County on the cost on ala Zer your weekly look at the world of business and economics this week Israel's war on Gaza has hurt its agricultural heartlands the nation is struggling to fill the Gap left by Foreign workers who fled due to the conflict also this week as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East escalate gold is becoming more and more expensive but will oil also fire up plus environmental values before paychecks many employees are walking out of companies that fail to commit to the fight against climate change food security has been at the heart of Israel's economic policy for decades but Israeli farmers are now worried that the war war on Gaza could turn their fields into Barren land Growers can't reach their crops in the area surrounding the strip which is known as Israel's vegetable patch and there's a sharp shortage of Palestinian and foreign workers with a lack of Pickers fruits and vegetables are left to rot where they grew many farmers fear the conflict could hurt the agricultural industry for many months to come well a survey of 389 Farmers con conducted by the migal Galilee Research Institute found 89% of Israeli Farmers have experienced some damage and nearly all of them expect more losses during the next 3 months nearly 3ars of the farmers face disruption to their Workforce even in areas not close to the fighting farmers expected a 35% drop in both production and revenue on average but that's projected to double in areas close to the border with Gaza Israel's agricultural industry has long relied mainly on Palestinian and thae workers but many Palestinians from the occupied West Bank are banned from entering Israel thousands of foreign workers fled when the war started and Israeli drivers Pickers machine operators and managers have been called up for military duty the shortfall is estimated to be more than 30,000 workers farmers are looking to fill the Gap with volunteers or by hiring Israelis signon bonuses are being offered to Israelis willing to work on the farms and soldiers have been mobilized to help harest crops the government is trying to encourage foreign workers to go back to the fields by extending their visas and offering them extra payments of $500 a month it's also looking to recruit thousands of laborers from countries including India and Sri Lanka meanwhile the departure of hundreds of malawians to work on Israeli Farms has sparked a debate in the cash trapped African country critics of the agreement are worried about safety measures put in place to protect malawians as the war continues that's despite attempts by officials in Malawi and Israel to assuage their Fears human rights experts have warned foreign workers could be at risk of exploitation as Israel scrambles to fill the labor Gap well joining us now from London is eel winter he's the silver vague professor of Economics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a professor of Economics at Lancaster University in the UK Professor good to have you with us before we talk about the toall that this war is taking on the agricultural sector in uh Israel I want to know whether it is still a main driver of Israel's economy how important is it to the country yeah agriculture in Israel is very important uh uh but it's not crucial as as it was uh let's say 30 years ago uh these days we are importing uh much more uh uh food produce meat uh vegetables uh fruits uh from other countries but the uh industry is very important for um uh for those who um uh who work in this industry uh for those who have the farms uh they rely on this for their lives and uh uh the war is making it very very difficult for them for two reasons one is uh some some some Farms have been evacuated because of the war well this for for security reasons and the other reason is that uh much of the workers are foreign workers and many of these foreign workers not all but many of these foreign workers um went back because of the war to their home countries um Israelis citizens now it's quite amazing phenomenon people from age of uh 13 to uh a 90 volunteer uh to to I will do it myself uh a few weeks uh in next few weeks uh to work in the fields to replace those foreign workers okay but this is not enough Professor so the I'm sorry to interrupt you but but time is tight here you say that that Israel is now more Reliant upon upon Imports I there is a cost to that surely I mean it's more expensive to import food than it is to to to grow your own isn't it I mean what what is that having a drag on the economy not really I mean uh surprisingly the produce that are are uh uh made in Israel are more expensive because of the labor costs Israel uh Israel imports from from country where the prices are much lower and uh you may be surprised by uh the vegetables and fruits that are on the market that are from Israeli produce are more expensive uh but uh you you you know that now now the the the situation especially I said especially for those who work on the agriculture is is difficult but I think the war when the war ends uh uh things will recover quite quickly you know when we're talking about agriculture there's one more thing that need to be said here in in relation to the war Israel is one of the leading countries in um in the production of Technology agriculture technology and uh when I think about it I mean the the potential of Israel helping Gaza okay uh in boosting its agriculture um industry is amazing I mean this potential has been put aside for so many years okay and my hope my real hope is when this war ends um the that I believe that this was Israel is helping in agriculture many undeveloped countries I mean uh much of its technology as being export and experts uh are are going to other countries to to teach people how to use these Technologies and but and it's so frustrating to see that it doesn't take place near home okay and it doesn't take near homes because what happens now and hopefully uh uh soon uh this will be gone and my hope is that Israel will be able to help in the agriculture Gaza need agriculture flourishing agriculture industry and that I hope that Israel will be able to assist it we we talked about Israel's Reliance on on foreign workers for its agricultural sector rights groups have criticized the working conditions that they experienced that was before uh the War Began now they're warning that they're at risk of exploitation what what do you make of of of those criticism this won't happen I think uh Israel have a very strict rules about uh dealing a treating of foreign workers they're very liberal uh uh they're very social uh these rule are going to be kept and I tell you something else on the psychology level people in Israel are so appreciative to those worker who decided not to go home but to stay with Israel to help in the Agriculture and did it to some extent uh not for money but but for solidarity and it just makes no sense to treat these workers badly when they uh when they did something so uh uh so nice and so so uh supportive to Israel so I I doubt that this will happen you you talked Professor about people volunteering to work in the agriculture sector but there's a short full of what 30,000 workers among them the Palestinians who are now banned from entering Israel I mean can can that number be made up can can it cannot replace it cannot replace the labor force that Israel had before the war absolutely it's more a gesture made by the citizen it helps a it helps somewhat but not uh it cannot bring back the situation to what was before uh and and there were that's why the uh the sector is uh in a Slowdown uh but as I said I mean at the moment the war is over uh these workers will go come back to Israel okay and uh uh the sector will revive itself very quickly Professor many thanks indeed for being with us on counting the cost now Israel Siege uh Relentless bombing and ground operations have upended all manner of life in Gaza Human Rights Watch released video of satellite imagery showing the destruction of orchards green houses and farmland in the northern part of the strip it says the damaged compounds concerns about food insecurity and lost livelihoods Israel has cut off food water and fuel supplies to the already besieged strip since the beginning of the war aid deliveries are limited and the humanitarian situation is catastrophic to know more about this do watch our previous editions of counting the cost where we detailed the crippling cost of the war for Gaza at its residence now when geopolitical tensions rise investers tend to put their money into safe havens like gold the yellow metal is looking hot right now as the war on Gaza escalates but the cost of oil is also sensitive to events in the Middle East yet after an attack on an American warship and Commercial vessels in the southern Red Sea it's changed very little in value prices could go up though if the wall widens across the region and disrupt supplies oil prices have swung wildly in recent months despite attempts by Major producers to shore up the market they've recently agreed once again to deepen voluntary cuts to output for the first quarter of 2024 the total curbs amount to more than 2 million barrels per day including a rolling over of previous cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia OPEC plus has also invited Brazil to join the group but countries struggling with a high cost of living like the US want to ease prices the Nations pumped a record 13 million barrels a day into the market now Brent crude the international Benchmark rallied after OPEC plus Cuts were announced but then lost more than 2% trading near $80 a barrel last week that's well below a year high of almost $96 a barrel in September prices were expected to surpass $100 a barrel in the past two months but despite output reductions by oil producers they've whip sored in in the70s oil prices hit more than $120 a barrel last year after Russia invaded Ukraine the international monetary fund says that Saudi Arabia needs to earn nearly $86 a barrel to fund an ambitious overhaul of its economy from Dubai we're joined Now by Jil Ahmad Jam is Chief Market Analyst at global trading and brokerage Corporation good to have you with us Jam so we've got a war in the Middle East and yet oil prices have hardly moved what's going on it's exactly that Adrian essentially look after the terrible events that started on October 7 we did have an initial $9 to $10 spike in the oil price over the next tradeing week or so but since then we've now dropped more than $20 and we're now heading towards below 70 US Dollars which is the lowest level since early July there's a few different reasons for this firstly no matter how difficult and tragic these events are taking place it is not in an area of high economic activity nor in an area of high exports so we can compare the 2023 crisis which is taking place now against the 2022 events of Russia and Ukraine it's completely different so we can't say it's Apple for Apple nonetheless another factor is that institutional and asset managers have always been on the side of the coin that no new entrance or new theme to The Conflict will be getting involved creating more of a supply issue and more than one month on that call has very much proved correct because we have dropped as much as2 us since that impact following the event in October 7th now OPEC plus has repeatedly cut production as we said um another voluntary reduction announced last week and yet markets have hardly budged on that news either why OPEC and OPEC plus it sounds very good on Headline but typically it's always been seen as a dysfunctional group with a lack of unity and a lack of compliance I give you a couple of different examples of this following the OPEC plus meeting which firstly was postponed abruptly and then it was scheduled just a couple of days later the announcement was that yes we're going to extend the production Cuts but all individual members who comply with this will be announcing their statements their figures separately this automatically results in even more signs of a lack of unity a lack of a clear message and essentially yes OPEC and OPEC plus do control as much as 90% of oil reserves and 60% of O production but until you get those clear consistent and standardized messages from the group financial markets do not see it as something that we can typically always believe because again the lack of compliance is there for us to see if we also had some other standardization where all different members have different price points for exports for government revenues and so forth so basically we have a number of different conflicts of interest taking place as well which is why despite OPEC plus having such a huge market share its longer term impact on financial market oil price specifically in this example is not that much material unless we do have consistent messages provided from the group and how significant is is Brazil being invited to join OPEC plus it's significant from Headline Brazil is one of the top 10 producers of the commodity it's also a large import of the commodity as well but again I'll give you some of the historical context here OPEC was seen as initially 13 different members the establishment of OPEC plus added a further 11 members to that group and now Brazil if it becomes a member and of an observer which again is not clear at the stage would make it 12 but until we see that Unity the consistency and that all members have equal votes equal distribution and they have equal interests at heart it will not mean that much over the longer term there are concerns J over um slower demand from China how much of a problem for OPEC plus is production in the US which which is is ramping up it was the initial concern if we look back back towards the oil price crash that started roughly 10 years ago that was the major reason why it was that us was set to take up more of the storm it was set to become the world's largest producer and exporter of the commodity which in fact 2022 data from the Energy Information agency actually proved that was going to be the case and again we do have concerns as well about slowing global economic growth you pointed out China which are the major import of the commodity but as we head into 2024 we still have a number of different global economic health issues first ly uncertain Central Bank policy and inflation projections which are all Weighing on global economic growth we have also not yet seen the true impact of the sharpest shift higher in interest rate policy that many of us have seen in our generation until we get the signals and we are starting to see the indications that Global central banks in developed world the US Federal Reserve which of course controls us interest rate policy European Central Bank for Europe the bank of England for the UK and so forth until we start getting the signals coming through that they're really going to start cutting interest interest rates into 2024 we do see more concerns prevailing about global economic growth which is why supply and demand is still an issue all right J St stay with us thanks for that but I I want to talk to you about gold which we'll turn our attention to now as you can see the precious metal jumped in price by more than 3% on December 4th to a record of more than $2,135 an ounce before pairing some of those gains that's more than the previous all-time high it set in August 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic boosted uh Safe Haven demand uh gold prices have risen by more than 10% so far this year so uh Jam gold never has been this expensive is it just about current geopolitical tension or is there something else going on here we have a number of different uncertainties in the world geopolitical tensions on multiple fronts global economic health concerns how developed and emerging economies are handled in the high interest rate policy and we do see reasons why gold Still Remains in demand even though it has fallen from that $2,100 record high just a few days ago it's still above $2,000 and we also see signals that the central banks are holding gold we see the largest increases in Gold uh allocations for roughly 70 years and I do think it comes down to global economic health concerns uncertainty as to where the world is heading and then other economic projections as well Central Bank policy and supply and demand how economies are going to continer to handle High interest rates we still have a number of complexities which is why as a safe haven gold Still Remains as an Investor's best friend all right J that so that's gold let's turn our attention now to bitcoin which has surged to its highest price in nearly 20 months the world's largest crypto currency has surpassed $44,000 marking a 150% increase this year the value of the digital coin has plunged to as low as $177,000 after a series of interest rate hikes by by the US Federal Reserve the collapse of FTX one of the biggest crypto companies has also pushed uh the price down uh so jabil is uh Bitcoin making a comeback it very much appears to be the case is that early Christmas present and somewhat of a Sant ready if we look back on what Bitcoin was priced at one year ago was $16,000 so we're now approaching close to three times that value just one year later uh nonetheless we passed some psychological resistance levels 30,000 $3 35,000 $40,000 earlier this week as you see Traders and investors are very quick to price and further gains we need to see if we can hold on to that $45,000 us handle I do think that the momentum stock is somewhat exhausted because we've had a huge move over just a couple of trading weeks but there are signs of cryptocurrencies being more widely adopted there are expectations that an exchange traded fund will be presented and created by one of the leading asset managers which does suggest from a fixed income and different investor level that a much more sophisticated and seasoned investor will be able to invest in cryptocurrencies which is why Bitcoin is really in the fever right now J many thanks indeed for being with us on County of the coast really good to talk to you now one of the main attractions of a job is usually how much an employee is paid but a growing number of workers are now prioritizing environmental goals over salaries so-called climate quitters are ready to turn down a recruitment offer or resign if their employer doesn't commit to climate action the trend is particularly growing in the UK where consulting company KPMG has recently conducted a survey of 6,000 people it found that environmental social and governance or ESG factors are influencing employment decisions for almost half of British office workers the study says that Millennials and young workers are driving the climate quitting Trend seeking out a more environmentally friendly job 20% of respondents have turned down job offers if the company didn't demonstrate climate and social commitments while 51% of 2,000 students surveyed globally by the Yale School of Management said that they would accept lower salaries to work for an environmentally responsible company the International Energy agency says that more people were employed by Clean energy companies than by fossil fuel ones this year let's get back to Dubai from there we're joined by John malli head of Global Environmental social and govern Ence at KPMG International good to have you with us John apart from being environmentally conscious what is is it that's motivating these employees to quit or not accept a job in the first place and are they mostly younger workers our research shows that almost half of the uh UK workers of what I'll be clear and saying all ages are basing their employment decisions on environmental but also social considerations now this is particularly true uh among Millennial and gen Z employees where the figure Rises to more than half but I I just want to be really clear in stating that this is not uh it is not just about climate uh for example for Gen z a whoin 92% of them place an Importance of Being able to link their own values and their own Purpose with that of the organizations that they work for young professionals want to work for and indeed they want to achieve uh goals which go beyond profit alone now uh interestingly what we've seen in our research that younger workers say between 18 and 34 um most of them uh they're primarily interested in Fair pay commitments whilst the the next bracket up uh those uh between 35 and 44 um they are most focused on environmental impact of the company's uh uh work that they do and there are other considerations uh such as broader ethical considerations uh um also taken we've seen through the data I I would just clarify very quickly that our data shows the key factors guiding where employees choose to work today and indeed in the future with 20% of adults uh um and 30% of the 18 to 24 brackets turning down job offers as you mentioned is is this phenomenon affecting companies and that it's it's forcing them in a way to change their environmental policies and and are there any particular sectors that that are being being affected more than others yeah yes indeed there there's a a strong uh sector related data that we see coming through uh so for climate um uh for example this resonates more in what we call the hard to Abate sectors so uh hearing we see at 24% said that they would not uh work in mining 23% would not work in in oil and gas and 21% uh would not work in petrochemicals uh but this this is not just about climate I said it before I'll say it again uh the two most common sectors in which correspondents uh sorry respondents said they would not work in are um much more Social and Health focused uh so for example 24% said they would not work in the alcohol sector and we see that 42% said they would not work uh in the tobacco sector and John as we transition towards more uh renewable energy uh suppliers I mean could could that transform the job market uh yes indeed absolutely so as we transition uh what we see is uh emerging Tech Technologies emerging areas so you talked about renewable energy onshore wind offshore wind Technologies around this such as carbon capture carbon storage and so on all of these will lead to new jobs a new set of skills and we absolutely see at young people coming through who are passionate about this agenda wanting to work in these areas and we absolutely see that transforming the jobs Market uh in the future John it's been really good to talk to you on counting the cost many thanks indeed for being with us and that's our show for this week if you'd like to comment on anything that you've seen you can get in touch with us by tweeting me on X that still sounds awkward I'm at a finigan on X try to remember to use the hash AJ CC when you do or you could drop us a line counting the cost at al.net is our email address as always there's plenty more for you online at al.com CC that takes you straight to our page and there you'll find individual reports links and entire episodes for you to catch up on but that's it for this edition of counting the cost I'm Adrien finigan from the team here in Doha thanks for being with us the news on Al era is [Music]
