just some breaking news now Israeli forces are asking Palestinians to move out of the eastern part of Rafa in southern Gaza ahead of a threatened assault then being asked to move to Al maasi area close to the coastline more than 1 and a half million people have been Sheltering in Rafa after Israeli Army forced them out of Northern and Central Gaza Let's cross now to Han mmud who joins us from Rafa in Southern Gaza honey what more can you tell us yes well uh within the past couple days and know with what seems to be the failure of the the ceasefire talks in Cairo and the uh insistence of the Israeli Prime Minister on expanding the ground Invasion to RAF City and in light of the the attacks yesterday on Karm abalam and this really intense response and in fact in overnight they attacked almost 11 air raid targeted several areas in in eastern part of RA city which seems to be the targeted area right now in which the local residents of this part of the of RAF city has been ordered by the Israeli military to evacuate sharply and immediately to the western part of City New York as the evacuation Zone Al maasi that has been designated previously by the Israeli military as a safe zone now it's important to point out that so far all the evacuation Zone designated by Israeli military has has not been largely safe for evacuates for the displaced family in fact they have been under attack they were attacked repeatedly either at the western part of panun or here in ra City where at least 1.5 million people have been Sheltering across the overcrowded ra City and thousands of displaced families in the western part of the city Al Mai evacuation on stretches from the western part of city on the ca Road passing through KH unit all the way to ra near the Egyptian Gaza border this is another order by the Israeli military to evacuate people started to move now it's also uh worth pointing out that in the past couple days people have started moving on their own because they were expecting the ceasefire talk were not going to uh make any progress so they started they packed up their stuff and start moving but not necessarily to the evacuation Zone because the mistrust in believing the in in the Israeli narrative is so huge right now people Rec called in told to evacuate to these areas whether they're their relative members or family members or somebody some people that they know they were killed inside these evacuation zone so some people took a different route went to different areas seeking shelters as you say I mean throughout this war on Gaza there haven't been any so-called safe areas at all so what is the mood there on the ground then to this news very very distressed quite there is a state of panic right now as I arrived to the site where I'm where we're reporting it from most of the time for the past month about this ongoing War people are clearly panicking they're they're asking questions about where exactly is the safe Zone when in fact they had someone that they knew or a family member was killed in in that particular uh area uh whether it's in in ra or the the southern part of the city of kanun or even the Central Area more recently uh safe zone is is quite misleading is quite contradictory and largely uh vague the israelian military hasn't been quite clear and honest about the about designating these areas for for evacu and displ family to move on people here are frustrated they're angry and they they say that you can't you can't have a a safe Zone in a war zone this war has been raging for the past seven months it has destroyed all means of Life all Social Services facilities it turned Gaza into a A Wasteland the only place that is left for people that that they can stay in while not safe 100% is RA the L Refuge for all displaced families is now under attack and people have ordered to move to Western part of the city the see it is a move by this to cage them in in one area one person just within the past couple minutes he said I could hear that clearly walking into the side but he said they putting us all in this concentration camp at the western part of the city right now honey mmud for now thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get latest news from Al jazer
