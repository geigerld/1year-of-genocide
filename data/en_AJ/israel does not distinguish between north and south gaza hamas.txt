you I'm sorry to interrupt you we are going to go to a press conference that's being held by AMA hamdan Hamas spokesman and I do also want to say to something you mentioned there we have been reporting what we've been hearing from the doctors at alifa as well as what Israel has been claiming we've been reporting comments from both sides let's now listen into this press conference by speaking of the massacres committed by the new Nazis we all witness the crimes committed by the Nazi Zionist Around the Clock yesterday alone a number of prgrams were perpetrated alfalah school was pounded where 150 gazans were killed and today yet another massacre in Alura un school it is Affiliated to the honora it is hoting the flag of the United Nations yet it was pound Ed by the Israeli War PLS once again it is also located within Yunis area an area alleged by the Israeli occupation forces to be safe I assure you that 43 of the victims are from the southern gin this means that the Israeli occupation forces does not discriminate the north from the south they continue to propagate false reports with the hope to evacuate the entire North part of Gaza the recent assault on alifa hospital as the Israeli occupation forces surrounded the hospital by columns of Tanks four days ago today they storm the hospital forcing the medical staff and all the wounded and the victims to be evacuated the Israeli occupation forces simply is sending a symbolic message because ala hospital is the symbol of protection now the Israeli Zionist regime has desecrated the holiest of the Holy principle there is no room for any sanctity in their attacks they in the face of their military failure and their mental and moral defeat they were left with nothing but continue to perpetrate killing and destruction among the civilians even the medical supply storages were not spared the water P pump the network pipe the water Network and the electricity Transformers the director of the Ala hospital was summoned six times he was ordered to evacuate and the response was clear we are not leaving the Israeli response was shelling the Intensive Care units all of those in the Intensive Care units were killed in addition to that half of the newborn babies in the incubators were killed the Israeli occupation forces recently this morning gave them a 1 hour ultimatum to leave all those able to walk must go more than 600 wounded and patients were forced to leave the majority of the medical team left the hospitals only only very few ones remained to take care of the remaining wounds who are not able to move what happened at alifa hospital is part of the series of military violations and violations of all principles ethical and Humane the patience and the wounded were forced to evacuate at gun point together with the civilians who took refuge in the hospital this is yet another crime unprecedented in history in addition to that the Israeli bulldozers exed the mass grave that doctors were forced to make inside the hospital yard the dead bodies were exed and the dead bodies were taken by the Israelis this is unprecedent Ed in history the hospital the shifa hospital has turned into a military Barracks this is not only a crime against humanity it is yet a war crime we expect the whole world the International Community to stand up to this and to force the Israeli occupation forces to abide by the international resolutions and War conventions now the Israeli occupation forces are trying to fabricate evidence as part of their charade of false allegations they are now turn ala hospital as a command center for their operations they are now defeated later on we expect the Israeli occupation forces to allege that the hospital was part of Hamas operations we hold the United States Administration liable together with the Israeli occupation forces also those world leaders who remain silent as we speak more than 12,000 Palestinians were killed including 4,000 500 children in addition to 4,000 still buried under the debris 30,000 wounded this wouldn't have happened without the green light given by Biden and his administration and the protection and the card blanch given to the Israeli occupation forces coupled with the Silence of the whole world those are are held liable for this genocide War perpetrated by the new Nazis Zionist regime with absolute huis and barbarism before the eyes and the nose of the whole world these program coupled with starvation Siege targeting of hospitals and schools are part and parcel of the Zionist regime's plan to forcibly transfer gazans to the South as a step towards expelling them out of the entire gasa strip however all these plans will be dashed at the rock of our resistance and despite all this many of our fellow gazans civilians gazans remained at home in the north and as we speak only in Gaza and up to the north more than 800,000 Palestinians who are standing their ground with respect to the allegations propagated by the Israeli occupation forces that there were evidence that captives were held in ALA to them we say clearly that Alam Bates that they had had transferred some of the captives to receive Medical Treatments as a result of the barbaric shelling by the Israeli War Plane and for their own safety and well-being those captives were transported to the hospital this was confirmed by well you've been listening there to Osama hamdan a Hamas spokesman speaking at a press conference taking place in Beirut he's condemned Israeli actions at alifa hospital Gaz largest the destruction of facilities equipment medical supplies the shelling of buildings he's also addressed the evacuation of the hospital saying that it was forced with doctors and patients forced out of that facility at gunpoint he's also accused Israeli forces of Exum Mass graves in that hospital compound and taking the bodies with them Mr hamdan says that Israel is fabricating evidence at alifa to support its claim that Hamas has been using it as a command center he says Israel has rather turned the compound into its own milit Barracks Hamas has repeatedly said that Israel has desecrated sacred principles by targeting civilians and that they hold United States too responsible for what they're calling a genocide saying that's what's taking place right now he says it's also part of a plan a forc displacement to eventually push all Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip
