David Bell Lopez is a professor of international and comparative politics at the federal University of mines and joins us from Bell Horizon in Brazil good to have you with us uh uh on the program it does seem that when Lula D Silva speaks South America and the global audience sit up and take note how important is it for Brazil's leader to say what he says in the way that he says it that's a good question because Brazil under Lula has become a prominent player on the international scenario again and uh if you take the numbers uh it explains quite a lot Brazil accounts for half of the territory the economy and the population of South America so when Brazil speaks uh it speaks I mean it projects uh voice of South America to the rest of the world in terms of the recall of the Brazilian Ambassador back to Brazilia it's not not the first South American country to do this early on in this conflict in Gaza Chile Colombia Honduras and Bolivia cut diplomatic ties very quickly why do you think president Silva waited it took a while for him to find the right tone the right approach so you're right when you when you remember that many other countries in South America and mostly uh left-wing governments they have decided to cut ties with Israel uh much before Brazil but over the last three4 weeks I'd say Brazil has been escalating so the tone has been elevated and of course the circumstances both domestic and international uh have been important to explain to account for this change do we expect that tone to become stronger or more vocal as Brazil takes the president prescy of both the G20 and then the Financial Group bricks I don't think it's going to become stronger or even stronger because it's already reached aned height and uh so the the the I believe the the next steps would involve some efforts in order to uh reconcile and to calm down the atmosphere The Diplomatic atmosphere uh because at the moment uh relations are really t between the two countries so it cannot go any any tensor or any I mean any any more uh uh intoxicated uh so the tendency is exactly the opposite I believe the countries will find ways to collaborate I don't know how but they might and of course one of the big issues that President Silva has to be concerned about is his demestic audience there is a sizable Jewish community in Brazil over 10 million Arabs he walks a very fine line doesn't he when it comes to making sure that he can get keep his public on side at least uh actually it do yes we in Brazil have around 150,000 uh Jewish people in in the country and uh they uh exert lots of power in some uh specific issue areas uh and they of course they might have an upper hand in determining the kind of foreign policy in the past at least they would have a lot of I mean uh room to maneuver and they would be very influential in defining the the guidelines the the the the lines of Brazil's foreign policy but nowadays I think things might have changed a little bit uh because Lula he doesn't seem to be fearing the consequences of fighting this uh stance the Israeli stance for the question of Gaza so probably his found Lula the president of Brazil has found something to fight for and which can be very rewarding for him and for his interests in international Affairs would you say that it's also reflective of the glob the leaders of the global South we're seeing leaders in Africa Asia uh and the Americans certainly find their voice they know that they're going to come up against to brick wall when it comes to the US's position on on Israel and Palestine and as you say he's found his voice but it seems that there is a ground swell of opinion that goes beyond politicians as well it's the public too politicians are watching what's going on in their countries most of all uh president uh Lula D Silva as well he knows how Brazilians feel I could not agree more with you and Lula possibly has that in mind when he he uttered his words very strong words with regard to the war to the conflict in Gaza uh of course he was considering uh the support he might Garner from the global South after all there are some 130 countries in the world that would recognize the Palestinian State as a full-fledged Territorial state while condemning Israel for uh the military operations car out in Gaza at the moment so of course Lula has considered in his calculations this kind of landscape interesting times uh Mr bellm Lopez thank you so much for joining us for mines really appreciate your time thank you thanks for having me
