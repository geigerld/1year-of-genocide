with a 7-Day ceasefire in Gaza over fighting has resumed between Israel and Hamas caught in the middle are civilians from both sides there raised questions about proportionality and accountability so is Israel meeting its obligations under the laws of war this is Inside Story [Music] hello there and welcome to the program I'm Laura Kyle after mediators failed to extend a 7-Day ceasefire in Gaza Israel has resumed its bombardment of the strip air strikes have targeted houses and refugee camps in the North Center and the south of Gaza Palestinians are already suffering a humanitarian crisis the UN says 80% of the population is has been forcibly displaced and the Health Care system has collapsed the Israeli Army's offensive raises questions of responsibility and accountability prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel is acting in self-defense after the attack by Hamas on October the 7th killed 1,200 people under international law Israel is the occupying power in Gaza and the West Bank and is obliged to protect all the people there but Israel doesn't recognize Palestine as a state and says Hamas has bases in hospitals and residential areas making them legitimate military targets we'll be unpacking the complexities of this argument with our guests in just a moment but first this report from Finton Monahan Israel released Muhammad nazal as part of a prisoner exchange agreed with Hamas the young man spoke of mistreatment at the hands of Israeli authorities one of the guys was so badly beaten his cellmates kept calling and yelling for someone to help and they finally arrived they felt his pulse through the bars he was dead after that they were just insulters when the soldier came to fetch me before my release he said they would hunt me down and bring me back to jail some Israeli captiv released by Hamas also spoke of the harsh conditions of their detention in Gaza several treaties governing the treatment of civilians soldiers and prisoners of War are known collectively as the law of armed conflict it applies to government forces and non-state armed groups such as Hamas Israel's treatment of Palestinian prisoners its policies towards Palestinians in the occupied territories and most recently its military campaign in Gaza are raising questions about whether Israel is respecting International humanitarian law the treaties state that combatants avoid civilian infrastructure and concentrate only on Military targets but Israel has repeatedly bombed hospitals homes and schools in Gaza saying Hamas uses them for military purposes it is a legitimate military Target and why is that because Hamas uses all locates all of their offices headquarters their research and development and all of their other military assets if it's above ground they locate themselves in civilian buildings then there's the civilian death toll Hamas was widely condemned for its military offensive in southern in Israel on October the 7th the Israeli government said 1200 people were killed and more than 200 were taken captive but since then the Israeli bombardment of Gaza has killed more than 15,000 Palestinians according to the Gaza Health Ministry critics say Israel's response is not proportionate another principle in the laws governing armed conflict Israel maintains its attacks in Gaza are self-defense but even its biggest Ally the US has called for more protection of civilians but Israel has the most sophisticated one of the most sophisticated militaries in the world it is capable of neutralizing the threat posed by Hamas while minimizing harm to innocent men women and children and it has an obligation to do so the legal situation is further Complicated by the status of Palestine which Israel does not consider an independent state as the war drags on and the death toll Rises Israel is facing growing accusations that it's falling short of its obligations under international law Vincent Mahan for Inside Story let's discuss this further let's bring in our guests in ramala in the occupied West Bank Mustafa barouti Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative and a former information Minister for the Palestinian Authority in New York ammed abuu Legal researcher and advocacy officer at alhak an independent Palestinian human rights organization and in Liverpool in the UK triestino Marinello a professor of law at Liverpool John Moors University and a member of the legal team representing Gaza victims in the international criminal court a very warm welcome to all of you triestino this Friday Israel resumed air strikes on Gaza once again killing civilians in huge numbers it's now also targeting what we're supposed to be safe areas in the South can you outline for us what are supposed to be the rules of war in this conflict well first of all many thanks for having me today I mean discussing the rule of law looking at the situation in Gaza from an international perspective means first of all to discuss the context in which these hostilities have taking place hostilities and context cannot be assessed separately and the context is the one in which there has been now almost 17 year blockade of Gaza Strip a blockade which has produced a number of Crisis and which has cause a situation that according to the United Nations different bodies of the UN was even before the S of October unacceptable un sustainable and deplorable a situation that was defined was defined by the Secretary General of the United Nation has a collective punishment a segregation of the civilian population in Gaza blockade means under international law occupation of the Gaza Strip the entire Palestinian territory under international law so not only the West Bank including East Jerusalem but also the Gaza STP is still occupied despite the 2005 disengagement of the of the Israeli troops Gaza is still occupied under international law for a very simple reason because Israeli Authority still exercise an effective control of the entire Gaza trip controlling almost his land borders territorial Waters um air space uh even um tax revenues are under the effective control of the Israeli authorities so we are talking of a context which is still occupied under international law Okay so we've got to the occupying power Mustafa bouti what are the obligations of the occupying power in Gaza at the moment but also also in the West Bank the obligation of the occupying power is to take care of the civilians who are under their occupation and Israel is doing exactly the opposite not only in Gaza Strip but also in West Bank the whole Oso agreement was used by Israel in the West Bank for instance to get rid of any responsibility towards the people who are under their occupation and transfer it to the Palestinian Authority which continued to be an authority without Authority and an authority under occupation deprived from any real power so the game that Israel plays all the time and now wants to repeat it in Gaza is to reoccupy Gaza completely control it totally with military power but find somebody else to take care of the humanitarian needs of the people but not only that they've destroyed 60% of all homes in Gaza they've destroyed all the infrastructure in Gaza a city so practically not only they are not taking care of the needs of the people under their occupation they're actually destroying any possibility for life of the people under their occupation because their actual goal is really the ethnic cleansing of Gaza completely and that is the reason why they decided to renew their attacks now in Gaza there isn't any part of international law in my opinion that Israel did not violate okay is is itself was established as a settler Colonial project through a huge operation of ethnic cleansing against 70% of the Palestinian people who were forced out of their land out of their country to become refugees ammed do you see uh the Palestinians situation the the the violent resistance against occupation that we are seeing that we have seen is there a Al ity with within that well um using uh resistance in any form including armed struggle U um to resist occupation uh is permitted under international law there's no questions there the Palestinians have the right to resist the occupation now which means of resistance they choose it's up to the Palestinian people this includes armed resistance but it has to be in accordance and in compliance with international law in particular uh the law governing the conduct of hostilities that is international humanitarian law attack then if we look at the attack by Hamas on October the 7th it's been called a war crime 1,200 people were killed about 240 people were taken captive both breaking international law but as a non-state actor in this conflict what rules of war is Hamas Bound by uh the same that Israel is by by the the um the application of international humanitarian law applies to all parties uh uh to the conduct of hostilities so uh um but one needs to differentiate I nobody can claim that an attack in its totality uh is illegal because we just said unoccupied people have the right to resist the occupation so this goes back to the rhetorical question do you cond Hamas for example and this is a way to derail the discussion one cannot ask a Palestinian to condemn hamas's attack in its totality but when talks about Israeli usage of us use of force talk about technicality of IHL whether a certain strike was proportionate or not so the attack in and by itself so for example attacking Israeli soldiers dragging them out of of Tanks as we saw and taking them to Gaza this in particular this exact incident is remitted under international law any attack against the UB Army is permitted under international law as long as it complies with the rules of international humanitarian law on the other hand any attack on civilians is prohibited under international law and could amount to a war crime uh and the body to decide that has to be an independent investigative body uh and the experience of of the situation in pales this body cannot be any investigative body from from Israel Israel has a history of denying justice of systematic impunity a history of pathologically lying about the responsibility of its uh soldiers and ensuring that they enjoy absolute uh impunity and I think this is because the the whole Israeli setler Colonial project an apar regime is a premise on a promise of impunity to its soldiers so we will definitely get onto the issue of accountability a little later in the discussion triestino don't think we've really got to the Crux yet of what the actual rules in a conflict are because all conflicts are governed by the rules of law international humanitarian law Geneva conventions can you outline for us for our viewers what exactly they are well first of all I mean it's arguable that if this is a occupied territory also the G St as we said before that Israel has a right to self-defense against and occupied territory has made states claim but assuming I mean that once the conflict has started the military operation has started Israel Authority have to comply first of all with fundamental principles of international humanitarian law first of all principle of Distinction so making a clear distinction between military objectives and civilian object and civilians principle of proportionality so not not putting in place disproportionate attacks and finally principle of precaution providing civan population with effective warnings for instance all of have been violated and there is clear evidence in relation to this Goda War it's not a novelty all the military operation against Goda have been characterized by violation by the Israel authority of these three principles in particular of the principle of Distinction by putting in place indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian objects we could provide plenty of examples in s October in this regard for instance the shifa hospital or the other medical units in Gaza which have a protected status under International humanitarian law have been intentionally attacked by the Israel Authority or the attack of the 31st of October against jabalia refugee camp in which the Israeli authorities have claimed that there was a military aass military commander well there was no evidence for that but even if Israel should provide clear evidence of that that's that does not make the civilian group in the jabalia refugee camp as a military Target according to International humanitarian law is also clearly established by international criminal tribunals Mustafa bagti what do you make of the evidence that Israel has provided so far what evidence sorry the evidence that it has put on social media we're seeing videos of tunnels we're seeing um them going through areas that it said was where the hostages were being held what do you make of those first of all let's say that Netanyahu is nothing but a pathological ler besides being a war criminal and his army and his spokes people com are repeating lies after lies even after these lies were revoked even by the American Media you remember the whole story about decapitation of children CNN had to apologize for reporting that the rape of women Los Angeles Times had to apologize for reporting that the number of Palestinians killed and and and now we have the names and the dates of birth and everything and the ID numbers of all people killed so Israel continues to tell lies after lies after lies to justify what what I'm quite interested to within the bounds of this discussion though is whether this kind of evidence would ever hold up in the court of law absolutely not of course not what will hold in the court of law if there is an independent real Commission of international law that is not biased to Israel and that is not subjected or vulnerable to American pressure Israel will be judged for the following the following war crimes the The Continuous occupation the system of aparti the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians the genocide that is conducted against people in Gaza and the collective punishment against the whole population not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank in addition to rejecting and refusing to implement no less than 1,000 resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nation Security Council all of that was done by Israel why because the Western governments and especially the United States of America and in particular the government of Britain have allowed Israel to be imp punitive to international law have allowed Israel to be unaccountable have treated Israel differently from every other country in the world and look at the comparison a very clear comparison between the way the world treats the situation in Ukraine and that in Palestine in Ukraine they support what they say the occupied people in Palestine they are supporting the occupa and I mean by that the United States and Britain and some other Western governments okay that is I just want to jump in there because we will be we will be looking at uh the international community's response just a little later I'm still just trying to uh pin down what exactly it is within the law that Israel is is breaking and ammed because Israel we have to note that Israel continuously insists that its conduct is in accordance with international law and it does seem so far to have the backing of the US in that however it's also cited as having a loose interpretation of the international law so how much room is there as a lawyer how much room is there for interpretation of this international law but where to be honest to say Israel has a loose interpretation is even an understatement Israel has a distorted interpretation of international law it makes a mockery of international uh humanitarian law and its violations of uh of the laws of all and of international humanitarian law are abundantly clear uh unless for those who don't want to see it or who want to follow Israel's lies and and propaganda Israel claims first and foremost that uh it's acting in self-defense it's important also to to uh to explain that a bit the body of law that governs the right to self-defense for states is regulated under article 51 of the United Nation chter this is a right to States when they're attacked by another state not by non-state actors like resistance uh groups and even if there is a doubt about a state's right to respond to attacks coming from arms groups definitely there is no doubt that an occupying power does not have the right to defend itself against the people it occupies because naturally it has positioned itself as the aggressor as the occupier and as a matter of fact the uh the the highest court in the United Nation the principal judicial organ of the un uh namely the international court of justice and the 2004 advisory opinion has already said because Israel argued self-defense back then and the court said clearly that the right to self-defense is irrelevant when it comes to the occupied Palestinian territory so this has to be uh clarified at the outset in terms of Israel's violation it's important to differentiate between different kinds of of of violations Israel is committing uh war crimes uh uh during the conduct of uh hostilities and this is a question of IHL principles like proportionality distinction and other uh uh important principles but Israel is also committing uh continuous war crimes when it comes to to Palestine and I think one of the most important crimes of those is the transfer of population to the occupied territor also known as settlements this is one of the most important crimes because it underlines the sitler colonial nature of Israel occupation and it's COC Colonial ideology Zionism that is a premised on the arer of the Palestinian people and replacing them in their indigenous land and that is the the the fundamental issue and this is a crime that is let um I jump in there because I want triestino to to look at that a little bit more um all these violations they're held in a huge file that the IC has uh former prosecutor Fatu Ben suda began uh an investigation in 200 21 we've never seen anything come of that why not well first of all I would like to add to the violations we have been talking I mean that there is already evidence for the international criminal court to start an investigation in relation to war crimes we have mentioned but also the crimes against humanity or forcable transfer looking at the evacuation order of the entire population from the north of Gaza to the South and there is also according to several Express International organizations of the ongoing Commission of genocide in Gaza as you correctly say the former prosecutor open an investigation in 2021 into the Gaza situation it was a decision with a very narrow scope of the investigation looking at 2014 war crimes committed in Gaza at crimes committed within the context of the great match of return and at the settlements in the West Bank as a war crime unfortunately since the new prosecutor has tooken office the British barister Kim Khan he has been very reluctant in putting in place any effective investigation into in this situation the answer to your question can maybe is that the court is under incredible pressure not to put in place effective investigation when it comes to Nationals from powerful countries that applied to Iraq for the British troops that applied to Afghanistan for the US Nationals and still applying to to to to Palestine this is a clear case of double standards as has been mentioned before the court has shown to be able to react promptly to Commission of international crime another context in few days there was a request for arrest warrant against Russian Nationals in particular against the President Putin we haven't seen this it's since 2009 that Palestine has tried to engage with the IC but after 14 years there has never been a simple request of arrest warrant or some months to appear in other words there has never been a case before the international criminal court and even in these days the prosecutor is still very vague when it comes when he talks about about ongoing crimes committed against Palestinian victims and this is Mustafa I just want to bring you in at this point because we we Circle back now to your earlier point that you were making about International pressure or lack of it ICC prosecutor Karam Khan is is visiting Israel at the request of the victims of the October 7th Hamas attack he's also going to be visiting ramala what would be your message to him he should go to Gaza not to ramala he should do he he is welcomed in ramala but he should go go also to Gaza that's where most of the war crimes are happening and uh let me say you say to you that we are totally unsatisfied with the behavior of Mr Karim Khan there has been already so many evidence about the Israeli war crimes in 2014 2012 2008 in Gaza and he never looked at it he never started the investigation in my opinion he's very vulnerable to American and Israeli pressures and I don't expect much of him when he's coming to visit Israel who did not allow bin suda before to visit Israel that that is not a very good indication when he is not saying that he should be also visiting Gaza and and let me say here that that is exactly the problem the problem is that Israel is allowed to be outside the ranks of international law and one of the issues that should be raised here is is the fact that Israel has declared war on occupied people not once not twice but several times war on occupied people is illegal is unacceptable by International warw they are occupying us and at the same time declaring war on us and and that by itself of course is a very grave violation but but in my opinion the United States of America Britain and some other Western governments are equally responsible not only in terms we just drawing to the end of our discussions I just want to bring back ammed because without the application of international law to Israel and Palestine some are warning that this conflict will only continue do you agree with that 100% this is the the fact that we have this situation is the systematic impunity that Israel has been uh enjoying and ensuring for uh its soldiers I think um this current situation um is a very important one not only for Palestine but for the whole body of of international law and the international K Court in particular I think this is the liip m test for its credibility I totally agree with what you're uh uh with what the other guests have said that it's utterly unacceptable the way that the court is approaching this situation you need not to forget that since Karim Khan took office and became the persecutor he hasn't issued one statement before the 7th of October despite Israel's continuing violations despite Israel's attacking worshippers inside lamos the holiest place for Muslims around the world an act that could have provoked a regional war and he didn't think it's enough to issue a statement and I'm just gonna jump in there to give the last word to triestino because we've only got a minute left I want to know from tritina who's going to be at the IC do you think Israel is going to be held to account well this is uh I mean so far we know that this has been very difficult and it's apparently from statements of the prosecutor I mean this is uh it's not easy that this is going it's likely this is going to happen but that's the reason why the pressure on the office of the prosecutor and on the court must be kept High not only by states which have submitted some referrals to the court in this regard but also to Civil Society organization I would like to conclude to say that without the work of Palestinian Civil Society organization in the West Bank in the Gaza stre there will be no investigation at the ICC at all it's just thanks to them that the court has been able to open an investigation okay and
