amid those fears of escalation US President Joe Biden is set to visit Israel on Wednesday in a show of solidarity Secretary of State Anthony blinkin made that announcement after overnight talks with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blinkin said that they agreed to Begin work on some kind of plan that could see Aid allowed into Gaza the United States and Israel have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitarian aid from donor Nations and multilateral organizations to reach civilians in Gaza and them alone including the possibility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of Harm's Way It Is critical that Aid begin flowing into Gaza as soon as possible we share Israel's concern that Hamas May seize or destroy Aid entering Gaza or otherwise preventing it from reaching the people who need it if Hamas in any way blocks humanitarian assistance from reaching civilians including by seizing the aid itself we'll be the first to condemn it and we will work to prevent it from happening again well let's now speak to our White House correspondent kimbery hit kimbery we know that Biden is about to be on route to Israel if he isn't already talk us through his agenda there and what he hopes to achieve on this trip yeah the US president said to depart early evening washing time so he's not yet left he he should be leaving about six hours or later he's rarely on time um what we do know is that he is going to be meeting with the Israeli Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and there are three goals that he has for that meeting uh the first is to outline humanitarian assistance to essentially uh make sure that there's a framework for that to make sure that there's food water medicine getting in and making sure that there's a safe passage for those that are uh trapped to get out but that this doesn't allow or benefit humas at all so uh that is one of the top priorities of this visit the other is Military Support the United States standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Israel and making no uh mistake about that wants to make sure it's getting the support that it needs and working with Congress to do so so finding some clarity on that as well as getting an update on the pace of military operations and as well uh finding an update on the uh hostages and how those uh not only Americans but also foreign Nationals can be reunited with their fames so that meeting will take place and then concurrently or rather right after that meeting uh the US president will be traveling to Jordan where he will be meeting with uh King Abdullah he will also be meeting with President Cece and Mahmud abas of the Palestinian Authority kimy as you and I are talking we're watching Smoke Rise Above Gaza City right now as the civilian death toll in Gaza continues to mount have you noticed any kind of a change in tone from the United States uh well there certainly has been a change in tone in terms of the priority of the humanitarian situation uh the US president on About a Week Ago insisted that the United States in Israel were complying with international law and making it a priority that they comply with international law making this sort of moral distinction between itself and Hamas except that there didn't seem to be any sort of moral distinction given the fact that Israel was denying electricity food water and the US was supporting Israel in that and didn't seem to be making any sort of effort to hold Israel to account but it seems in the last 24 hours there seems to be a shift towards making the humanitarian effort a priority and ensuring that civilians get what they need and so that would certainly be a market shift compared to many days earlier our White House correspondent kimbery halet there for us thank you very much kimy and just to point out to our viewers we are watching further air strikes right now live on your screen well let's now bring bring in Andrew basovich he's a US military historian he also co-founded the Quincy Institute for responsible statecraft he joins us now from Walpole in Massachusetts Mr basovich I want to start by asking you to reflect a little on the US response over the last 10 days both in terms of military mobilization and rhetoric how closely aligned now are the US and Israeli National Security practices not as closely aligned as they were 24 hours after this War Began uh I think that the shock uh felt by Israelis was matched by the shock of many Americans uh and so the rhetoric we were hearing both from the Biden Administration uh and from commentators basically mirrored the rhetoric from uh the Israelis that that Hamas was going to be destroyed uh and there appeared to be very little concern about the negative consequences for uh for these the civilian residents of Gaza it seems to me that that now has substantially changed and the humanitarian issue is moving quickly to the Forefront even as that happens though I believe Israel national security adviser has said that he believes the US will get involved if the war spreads if we for instance the escalation on the Lebanese border Iranian involvement what's your assessment now of the Biden when it comes to the Middle East I I my my impression is that despite what that uh uh spokesman said uh that Israel does not want uh the United States to become militarily involved uh doing so would be a massive departure from the Israeli strategic tradition uh which insists that Israel defends itself uh in all in all circumstances uh beyond that I seriously doubt that Mr Biden wants to become directly involved uh in the war that is to say putting American soldiers at risk possibly sustaining us casualties uh he is uh well in that our country is now well into uh an election campaign uh recent American wars have not gone well uh have not benefited uh incumbents I'm referring to Iraq and Afghanistan primarily uh and therefore from a political calculus I would say that the last thing the Biden Administration wants is to get the US in another shooting War I want to ask you a little bit about your writing because in the past you've said that the inhabitants of Gaza and the occupied West Bank could only annoy Israel and not do it serious harm do you think that's changed and and has harm already been done even if it's been only to the the perception of Israel as being invulnerable yeah if I wrote that it was wrong because the Hamas attack has clearly indicated uh capabilities to do damage to Israel that are far beyond what I think most observers uh expected now that doesn't mean that Hamas has the capability of overrunning Israel or of really winning uh a war uh with with the IDF uh but but they have demonstrated uh capabilities and determination uh that have uh done tremendous harm uh to to Israel and and one suspects that that Hamas has the capability to do more of the same again I want to ask you a little bit about the rhetoric that you mentioned there in the immediate aftermath of the attacks in Israel and at the start of this war because those the rhetoric that was used then has had consequences four years ago you said and I'm sorry to quote you back to yourself it's not been permissible to have an honest conversation about the US Israeli relationship and about Israeli policies to insist on having that honest conversation is to invite punishment do you feel that way in the US today oh I think there's no doubt about it uh and and the Hamas uh terror attack uh has has made it that much more difficult for Americans to take any kind of a balanced view of of the of the uh uh Israeli Palestinian conflict to do so uh is to be painted an aaser to be painted an apologist for Hamas and therefore what I think is necessary which is to uh to take seriously the history of this conflict and how it has evolved uh that is off the table uh and and that is one of the reasons why it's going to be that much more difficult to come to a reasoned piece once this war is finally over you speak about a reasoned piece do you think what we're seeing unfold now potentially could provide an opportunity to make different choices going forward perhaps even reinvigorate some kind of an engagement with a new peace process well I would like to answer your question in the affirmative I I would like to say that this can pave the way for some kind of arrangement that would enable able Palestinians and Israelis to live together in peace I think the likelihood of that happening is close to nil now that said there are moments in history uh when War brings about substantial and indeed positive political change in a sense I think we saw an example of that in the wake of the 73 War which led to peace between Israel and Egypt so in in theory that's possible as a practical matter uh I don't see the leadership on either side of this uh conflict that is going to make that kind of a deal possible Andrew basovich there a US military historian and a co-founder of the Quincy Institute for responsible statecraft really great to get your thoughts here on Al jazer Mr basovich thank you for joining us thank you
