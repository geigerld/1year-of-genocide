well returning now to our top story the Israeli military says it has confirmed that it has killed Maran Isa the deputy military commander of Hamas let's bring in Al jazer senior political analyst Maan Bashar he joins me now in the studio Maran just how senior was Issa where did he sit within the whole Hamas ecosystem well presumably I mean of course Hamas is is not exactly you know open it's not a government uh in terms of its military Wing but it's said that he's second in command of the military wing of Hamas now if you ask the Israelis of course they would like to make him as if uh he is as high as possible because then he is more valuable Target and hence it is a presumably a greater success for the Israelis um and in the the Israeli officials Israeli generals have been quite adamant in the past five months to underline the idea that uh they're going to go after Hamas leaders right yeah and to the mind of many observers if Israel can get to the top uh Echelon of Hamas in Gaza it could start believing that it is achieving some form of Victory or at least some form of Revenge right however what what we know from the history of this conflict and certainly since hamas's establishment uh as a political and military group in the late 1990s uh sorry in the late 1980s Israel began assassinating Hamas leaders in the 1990s think about it is that every time Israel declared Victory by assassinating one Hamas leader dozens stepped up to take his place so the idea of declaring Victory because one or two or several Hamas leaders were killed has proven to be more of a facade more of a deception for public consumption than it is an actual achievement because as I said not only dozens have stepped up to take their place whenever a leader is assassinated but we've seen um from the 1990s onward from the 2002 onwards is that with every assassinated generation of leaders a new leaders that took on were even more hardcore sure than the previous generations so the previous gener for example I don't know they were doctors and uh and Architects and engineers and whatever that happened to be radical uh resistant uh leaders the new um the new leaders like for example senoir right the top military leader in in Gaza he spent 22 years in Israeli jail the man is so hardcore and so hardened right in his heart and mind and ideology and so on so forth that he certainly far more app ly competent and far more radical than all his predecessors so killing these leaders might be claimed to be a tactical or strategic Victory but in the end of the day Hamas has proven more than capable of producing more and more leaders am I right and thinking in this conflict so far Maan Isa is actually the the senior most Hamas figure who has been killed well between arui and Lebanon yeah right who again in Gaza yes uh but of course as we all know uh that um Hamas you know is run more as a as an organization that's quite hierarchical and and has quite the command uh within the hierarchy that trickles down so who whatever the hierarchy is doesn't matter what the geography is and in fact some of their most hardcore leaders are in fact in that section right among the three four sections is the one that is based in the prisons very interesting and one of the three four main commanders are actually in prisons because they have a prison wing for Hamas Maran just in terms of assessing what Israel's thinking right now as you say they've said very publicly that they plan to destroy the whole of Hamas for many of them that means destroying certainly the leadership of Hamas especially the military leadership what is your assessment of how that's going so far I understand that certainly a majority I believe of Battalion commanders have been taken out out so in terms of of the way that Israel is approaching this in terms of their measures of success how are they doing look I mean there's no doubt that after five months of bombings much of it indiscriminate that some of the collateral damage uh happened to be Hamas leaders right and clearly a lot of them were killed there's no doubt about that I'm not sure if it's 2/3 1/3 3/4s all of that is just asate but I know two things to be a fact that we've known thus far the past five months and that's what really it's troubling for the Israelis one is that no Hamas Fighters have surrendered voluntarily to the Israelis the Israelis picked up all kinds of people called that called them Hamas but there are no Hamas Fighters that surrenders two Hamas leaders none of them have capitulated to Israel in Gaza and these are the two things that are most troubling for the Israelis and in fact when you listen to their experts they keep going over it again and again how could these people meaning the ERS and the militants be so hardcore that not one has recap has capitulated not one has surrendered very interesting Dynamic certainly going forward now too M Bashar thank you so much for joining us again
