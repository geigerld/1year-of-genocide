the people of Gaza haven't had much to eat since the War Began and now for the first time the UN say a state of famine is evident in Northern Gaza severe restrictions have blocked food deliveries Israel's constant bombardment is further isolating more areas forcing Palestinians to survive on leaves scraps and food handouts the head of the UN world food program is renewing calls for a humanitarian ceasefire what I can explain to you is is that there is famine full-blown famine in the north and it's moving its way south and so with what we're asking for and what we continually ask for is is a ceasefire and the ability to have unfettered access uh to get in safe and unfettered access to get into the uh into into Gaza various ports and various various gay Crossings uh but we you know it hasn't always worked that way Israel has been block in most of the aid trucks from coming in allowing only a trickle of eight to reach Palestinians International efforts have shifted to air dropping supplies but that's insufficient and unsustainable to meet the dire need on the ground it's horror it's you know it it's it's so hard to look at and it's so hard to hear also so uh uh I'm just I'm I'm so hoping that we can get a ceasefire and and begin to to feed these people especially in the north uh in a in a more in in a much faster fashion but also including as I said water uh sanitation medicine it's all part of the famine the famine issue and it's also something that we need to make sure that the world understands we can't let this happen the entire Gaza population of 2.3 million people do not have enough food and the crisis is escalating each day children are struggling the most hospitals started reporting the first deaths from starvation in early March efforts to prevent famine hinge on the ceasefire but a deal remains as elusive as ever Axel zovich aljer Ben Grant's the Gaza lead for the food relief group global empowerment Mission he's joining us live from der obala in Gaza Ben good to have you with us we saw at the top of um uh Axel's report there pictures of a family in jabalia who are struggling to find food I know that you and your teams have been delivering some Aid there talk us through what you have been seeing when in jabalia well it is extremely distressing um especially the mission that we are just came back from uh comparing the difference between the areas or the people in the areas of the South and the middle areas um with comparison to the north I mean the people are looking extremely skinny exhausted there is definite famine within the regions there and on a mass scale so this is why stepping up our efforts to ens sure we can get the aid to the people as quick as possible is is so essential right now how difficult is it to get Aid to people uh into Gaza generally but also to the north particularly yeah so you know getting them into G we all know it's been slow utilizing you know pretty much the one Crossing refer Crossing but you know so then once we get Aid in there which we have managed to do in in a you know reasonably large scale so of to get it up to the north is a whole another process I mean don't get me wrong it's it's more around the lines of having to ensure our safety as well as the safety of the aid and so we carry out the deconfliction notification process with the IDF where we have to draw up and write up um every single movement we're going to do the vehicles the load where they're going to go the exact grid locations um and the timings and then on the actual day of the movement we have to have constant communication with them um to you know inform them of exactly where we're going to be so every step of the way we're waiting for a green light the green light to move on head to that location but the problem with this is the communication side of things um you know it's trying to get signal in the phone in an active war zone is very difficult to get hold of the IDS to get the green light um sa phones don't always work we can't have star links it's we just need to up on the communication and that will probably speed up the whole process but we also need to ensure that we can get more Aid up there more larger Aid convoys need to be allowed um we're particularly hopeful of the Aras Crossing now opening and US been able to utilize that because that will massively increase the amount of Aid coming in obviously the aid is in desperate need by the people and one would imagine from what our correspondent hany mmud was saying earlier on more and more people are heading back northwards as they feel slightly safer about about doing that therefore the demand increases tell me about the kind of delays that you're facing if you get a truck that's going across the border into Gaza what's how long does it take to get that truck eventually up towards Northern Gaza well from the moment we set off I'd say to the moment we actually get to our warehouse it could take anything from 6 to 9 hours maybe which is unbelievable um and that's just having to wait like I said it's an active war zone SO waiting at the checkpoint for the operations to come underway and then allowing us to go through and there's always delays so it is very very difficult m are you able to um tailor the kind of Aid that you're supplying do you have a clearer idea now of what kind of Aid people actually need uh particularly in Northern Gaza particularly around jabalia or is it a question of just trying to get as much of any type of Aid as possible into Gaza and then trying to disseminate it as you see fit yes well I mean we had a breakdown of the different food Aid that we brought up there we we took you know bags of flour um about 26 uh you know th000 kilos of it um 21,000 kilos of rice but then we also maximized on food Parcels now these are very very special because they haven't actually been distributed to anyone up there and it allows families to not just have one uh particular large bul commodity they can have a whole range of different products the full family would be able to survive on for a number of days and these are the area that I think needs to be focused on um you know simultaneously actually with hygiene kits if we can have food parcels and hygiene kids to the families it means they have absolutely everything they need um well the Bare Essentials they need uh to be able to survive so that's what we're trying to make toiz on right now Ben Grant is from the food relief group global empowerment Mission and we appreciate you being with
