Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu says he's working to free the captives held in Gaza but he won't end the war to secure their freedom there's a lot of media hype about efforts to secure the release of more abductees so I would like to clarify we're working to find another way to release our hostages but I stress not at any cost I have red lines including we will not end the war we will not remove the Army from the Gaza Strip and we will not release thousand of terrorists we're working all the time to release our abductees and to achieve the war's other goals eliminating Hamas and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat we're working to achieve all three goals together and we will not give up on any of them ham Salo joins us live from occupied East Jerusalem so that's the line that netan has been putting out what has his spy Chief though been telling the cabinet the head of mad meeting with Israel's war cabinet to discuss with them what he and the mediators came up with at a meeting in Europe over the weekend according to Israeli media David Baria presenting a ninepoint outline for a plan that would see the release of captives in multiple different stages in the first phase we're looking at a 35-day pause in the fighting in exchange for 35 captives this would include any remaining women and children the elderly and those who need medical care then there would be around another week's pause to reassess how they're going to get out the rest of the captives who would be up for release and in that second phase we are talking about com combatants both male and female Israeli Soldiers the deal though that he presented didn't yet specify how many Palestinian prisoners would be released as part of the deal we do know Netanyahu has been reiterating this for around 48 hours now saying that there won't be such large concessions given up in exchange for the captive saying that he has a lot of red lines even meeting with some of the families of those captives who are currently being held in Gaza that meeting taking place in West Jerusalem on Wednesday night he told them there were serious concrete steps the Israeli government was taking but they were doing it in a discret way so that it could have more of a success rate so that a lot of the details don't get leaked and that they are not subject to pressure by the Israeli public in order to secure a deal but again the Prime Minister has said that Israel will not be giving up large concessions as part of this deal so that sounds a little bit different than what n has been saying different signals from different parts of the administration I guess a sign of conflicting pressure how's Netanyahu dealing with it there's a lot of pressure from multiple angles you have pressure from the families of the captives who say the government's not doing enough you've pressure from Israel's biggest Ally the United States who says that Israel needs to prosecute this war differently you've pressure from the war cabinet netanyahu's own Coalition and even the opposition so there's a lot on his plate as the war is in its fourth month now from his own government you have dissent from the members of the right wing who say if Netanyahu enters a deal that is not favorable to them that they say is bad for Israel they're going to leave the government then you have the opposition the fiercest critics of Netanyahu throughout the war saying that they would provide a safety net for him they would join some sort of unity government for a certain amount of time so that they can secure a deal to bring those captives back to their families so there is a lot of different pressure from a lot of different angles from the very top levels from netanyahu's war cabinet all the way down the line to the opposition an incredibly complex time for Israeli politics all right we'll leave it there thanks so much h
