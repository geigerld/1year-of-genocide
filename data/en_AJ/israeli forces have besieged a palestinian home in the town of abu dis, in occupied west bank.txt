Israeli forces have besieged a Palestinian home in the town of abis in occupi East Jerusalem Israeli forces say the home belongs to a Palestinian who suspected of being a fighter and he's refused to surrender let's get more on this and go to Sarah hyat in occupied East Jerusalem Sarah so what more can you tell us then about this raid in occupied East Jerusalem uh where these forces have surrounded a house there yeah that's right well that's come to an end now it was going on for several hours they were looking uh for a person in a place called abis uh at just east of Jerusalem um and he has been killed they apparently taken his body that's what we're hearing uh it was going on for many hours there was a lot of gunfire uh and you know there's been a step up a massive step up on these raids not just uh here but mostly also in West the West Bank in occupied West Bank um Security Forces entered and this he apparently he didn't want to give himself up uh there was a gun battle that ensued uh and eventually um they killed him and there were several other injuries it's not clear how many um the Israeli forces have had a habit of taking those bodies with them sometimes and they will often hold on to them for years without uh releasing them but this all comes off the back of that October 7 attack and the step up in the war in Gaza where those kind of raids have definitely increased and it's causing a real amongst Palestinians because many people feel that they are also being arrested uh for the simplest of things and held uh without any uh legal representation either and Sarah what more have Israeli officials been saying about opening up this Main Road in Gaza to allow people to move from the north to the South yeah well we were reporting about this yesterday where they had only uh given uh pal Palestinians in the north and Central parts to move to the South had' only given them about an hour's warning bearing in mind a lot of people don't have access to the internet uh or even mobile phones because of uh comms being down in some areas um and then even people that we know that tried to leave uh between those that three-hour window um said it was too dangerous they'd heard gunfire um and the road itself uh a lot of it is destroyed now this is one of the main main roads actually in that takes you all the way from the north to the South well uh the Israeli military says that it's allowing that window once again today um trying to warn people to move past uh Wy uh uh Gaza and to head to the areas like Khan Yunis um but again whether they'll be able to do so the Palestinians is another question um the Israeli uh Army is saying that actually it was the Hamas Fighters that started um attacking uh the Israeli forces and that's what stopped people from leaving some eyewitnessed reports from those that are Palestinians said that they had uh been actually attacked by the Israeli forces uh themselves so we'll have to see of course it's another window hopefully people will be able to move whether that will be possible is another question Sarah thank you
