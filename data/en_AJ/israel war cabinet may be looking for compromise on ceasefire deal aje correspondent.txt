The Three Counties mediating ceasefire talks between Hamas and Israel have released a joint statement urging both sides to accept the proposal Qatar Egypt and the United States are calling on them to finalize the proposed agreement saying that these principles brought the demands of all parties together in a deal that serves multiple interests and will bring immediate relief to the long-suffering people of Gaza and the long-suffering hostages and their families then goes on to say that the deal offers a road map for a permanent ceasefire and an ending of the crisis well Hamas spokesperson Osama Haman says the group hasn't yet received the proposal announced by President Biden on Friday we have not received anything written and based on our experience what is verbally said is not what is usually documented that is why we are ready to study any documents with all the details however what is being broadcast in the media reflects positivity we can see that people are conscious that the continuous War and the killing of our people will not make us lose our steadfastness so there were a lot of positive elements however we need to see it documented on a piece of paper that should be sent to us we just reminder the Israeli government has banned Al jazer from reporting in Israel which is why Imran Khan joins us from the Jordanian Capital Aman and uh imran's the Israeli War cabinet is due to meet in the next couple of hours so we may have a clearer idea on Israel's position well I think the operative word there is May uh let's see what that war cabinet meeting actually does now remember this is the regular War cabinet meeting it wasn't an emergency session that was convened in the light of the US president's uh proposal but the war cabinet is divided you have Benny Gans and you have the defense minister you have Galant who have long been talking about a plan for the day after now Benny gance has reacted to Israel uh to the US president's proposal he says it needs to be studied it needs to be looked at he's effectively hedging his bets we have a Netanyahu Aid who has been speaking publicly uh he says look it's a bad deal uh but it's something that we do need to take seriously so if there was a crystal ball and if political analysts had access to that crystal ball they' probably be talking about some sort of compromise uh deal that allows them to accept what uh the US President Joe Biden proposed even though he framed it as an Israeli proposal so maybe that will be that the they will agree to the first phase of that and then they say if that goes well then we'll do the second then we'll do uh the third but they won't agree to a all three phases at once remember Israel's position uh from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is absolutely clear no permanent ceasefire until all their goals have been met Hamas you heard their reaction there they're willing to look into this and so it's going to be interesting because external pressures are also building on uh the war cabinet uh there was a huge protest in Tel Aviv last night we're looking about 120,000 Israelis out on the streets massive banners suggesting that the Biden deal needs to be taken that's something that the war cabinet though the people within the war cabinet simply can't ignore public sentiment but prime minister Benjamin nany who still has his secret weapon he still has those uh far right ministers uh who have threatened to pull out the government if he accepts uh the deal wholesale that's being proposed by uh Joe Biden he also knows that if he can come up with some sort of compromise they'll remain within the Coalition and he'll remain in power so a lot of negotiations to come uh according to a lot of people uh in Israeli media political comment ators and the such it's due to be a very uncomfortable War cabinet meeting no indeed uh and you'll be keeping across any developments for us Imran Khan there for us in Aman and just a remind again the Israeli reporting inside Israel make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
