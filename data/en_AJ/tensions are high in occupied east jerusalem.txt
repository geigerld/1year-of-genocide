we begin in Gaza where Israeli forces have intensified their attacks in the northern Central and Southern parts of the besieged strip and video has emerged showing at least a 100 Palestinian men who've been stripped and made to kneel on a street in Northern Gaza they've been taking Refuge at three un run schools in B lahia with their families the Israeli Army took them to an undisclosed location well the jabalia refugee camp has been targeted again in Israel's latest strikes a building housing displaced people was hit and overnight air strikes killed at least five people in the noit camp funerals have been held for six men killed in Israeli raids in the alar refugee camp in tobas that's in the occupied West Bank the Army also stormed rala Hebron and Bethlehem leading to confrontations since Israel began its war on Gaza 272 Palestinians have been killed in raids in the occupied West Bank we'll get more on the fighting in Gaza shortly as well as what's happening in the occupied West Bank but we first start in occupied East Jerusalem because that's where there is heavy security around Thea MOS compound where tensions are high and we have Sarah Kyra joining us from occupied East Jerusalem so uh Sarah the Palestinian worshippers trying to get into AA we understand have been banned by Israeli forces tell us about that and what's been the aftermath yeah that's right that's been the case since October 7 when the Hamas attack happened that's uh in a few days we'll be uh heading into two months of this every Friday prayer uh people over a certain age are not allowed in anyone usually it seems under the age of 65 for men and for women it seems around under the age of 45 are banded from from uh performing their prayers at AA mosque which is the third holiest site for Muslims around the world um just earlier when we were speaking to you we were actually pushed back by the Israeli uh forces just down uh the roads uh here to my left is Wy jaws and this is an area where the youngsters uh try and come along as they do with their grandparents and fathers and they are often pushed back every week in fact they've been pushed back by te gas and uh smelly water now interestingly this week it didn't happen before the uh prayers took place and we thought that's strange it's a very quiet Friday given that it's been happening every week and given that pattern and then as soon as people were coming out and I'm just going to show you where they were coming out from if you come uh this way if you look just up the road here to my left that entrance there that takes you to the right where that bus is going that is one of the entrances to El AA Moss compound now people were coming out worshippers were coming out and before we knew it the uh Israeli uh forces that you're seeing just behind me here as well and all around me in fact um they then were heading in that direction to where the Jaws in their dozens and were firing the tear gas and smelly water of course we were seeing Palestinians looking out from their homes that's become a scene they've become used to but it Still Remains very difficult for them because there's a restriction of movement not just when it comes to the basic rights such as performing prayers but even movement around occupied East Jerusalem shopkeepers have been told to shut their shops earlier uh many people are doing that just for fear of once once it's dark and it's dark quite early now that it's winter time um that they'll be targeted by the Israeli forces uh for really just being just being being palestin opinion um if you fly the flag it's always been illegal and certainly now if you're showing any support for those in Gaza that can land you in jail and if you land in jail as a Palestinian you might be there for years without any charges without um even representation without legal representation and even children get held in detention last week when we saw um the Palestinian prisoners being released some of them were from occupied East Jerusalem and they were very very clearly told they would not be allowed to celebrate that order was also coming from itamar benir now that name is important because he once was on The Fringe of Israeli politics and then he became part of this coalition government a far right Israeli coalition government with the likes of him he is the national security minister he also has uh convictions of uh inciting racism against what they call Arabs Arabs I.E Palestinians um he was also part of a a far right Ultra nationalist group that is was banned um and that just gives you an idea that through him and through other ministers such as bezel mmrc who is the Finance Minister but also in charge of the expansion of illegal uh settlements illegal Israeli settlements in occupied territories not just in the West Bank but also in occupied East Jerusalem 1,000 more than 1,700 of those units were approved just a couple of days ago right um so encroachment isn't just in terms of land but it's also in terms of everyday life and this is just an example during okay thank you so much Sarah Kat reporting from occupied East Jerusalem
