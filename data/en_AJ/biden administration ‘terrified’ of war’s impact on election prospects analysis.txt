well Ramy curri is distinguished public policy fellow at the American University of Beirut he joins us from Washington DC welcome to the program in terms of the discussions then what are the main stumbling blocks that would need to be addressed before any deal could be made uh the main stumbling blocks are the ones that have always been there from the beginning which is that neither side the Israelis uh nor Hamas wants to U concede anything to the other side um and neither of them are willing to unilaterally concede um anything they're willing to make Mutual concessions if they both gain what is critical for them that hasn't happened yet they did have that initial pause and they released some hostages and prisoners of some U I don't know it was about two months ago whatever it was but the um the big uh goal there at after the Hamas wants a permanent ceasefire all the Israelis out of Gaza the Palestinians being able to move back to the north anywhere they want and full uh resumption of humanitarian Aid as it was uh before October uh 7 um so the Israelis want the hostages released they want to make sure that they're not going to be attacked again from Gaza uh and they they say they want to destroy Hamas uh they're probably going to get the first two things they want but it's unlikely that Hamas can be destroyed because Hamas is really a sentiment it's an idea that has transformed into a movement but that movement has transformed itself over the years and others were there before it and after it so you can't really destroy Hamas but you have to take away the reasons why a Hamas is needed and that's the Israeli occupation and the subjugation of the Palestinians so they're getting close to the point where both sides are going to be able to get what they say are their critical demands and if they can both get them simultaneously then you could have a really impressive agreement probably in two stages as they're thinking now and all of this though in a shadow of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu consistently warning of a fullscale assault on the southern Gaza City of Rafa well this is part of the negotiations you know you have to keep the pressure up on the other side you've got to keep the threats up you've got to make it uh seem that you're not bothered you can stay like this for another year the reality though what's fascinating here is the involvement of the third party which is the United States this is a war between the United States and Israel on one side and Hamas and some other groups on the Palestinian side the United States is really worried about many things they were terrified of the Iranian Israeli exchange of um fire weapon you know attacks between them even though they were both controlled they were terrified of a wider war in the region what the impact of this on oil flows on investment on global trade would be a catastrophe the United States government uh led by the Democrats and Biden are terrified of the impact of this war on their election prospects in November U at poll yesterday showed that 81% of young people all people not just rats 81% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 think that uh the war is being badly managed and they disapprove of the way the war is going and American support for it this is a huge huge thing for American politicians and they're also finding that they're not being isolated around the world because you can't isolate them they're so strong but they don't have the same clout that they that they used to people are looking to China to uh Russia to India to the bricks to other people for strategic relationships as well as Americans so there's huge fear in the US the Israelis have been worried in the last few days about the international criminal court issuing uh summons indictments against Israeli leaders for war crimes as well as probably against Hamas people and Hamas is worried that it's U not really getting the kind of support it was expecting from Arab or Iranian or other supporters in the region and that's pretty much on its own and and you know Gaz has been pretty much destroyed so all three of the main players have tremendous pressures on them to to make a permanent ceasefire get the best deal they can get and then move on to a permanent political resolution if possible but that's that's stage two which is in the future we leave it there Ramy kurri we very much appreciate your insights thank you for joining us here in Al jaer make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaaz
