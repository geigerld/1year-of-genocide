the head of hamas's political Bureau SM hania says the group is ready to accept an agreement that guarantees a permanent ceas fire he says it also wants a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza reconstruction and an exchange deal Hamas showed great seriousness and flexibility in order to reach an agreement that would spare the blood of our Palestinian people and stop the Israeli aggression this was reflected in our acceptance of what was mentioned by President Joe Biden in his speech as well as our welcome to the security Council resolution that was issued few days ago we gave our response to the mediators through a joint delegation between us and our brothers in the Islamic Jihad movement in Qatar our response is consistent with the principles put forward by President Biden's speech and with the security council's resolution regarding the three stages of the deal and the terms of the ceasefire please government has banned aljer from reporting there so ham Sal now joins us from the Jordanian Capital am man so any reaction there in Israel to the comments we're hearing from Hamas members well there's always reaction from Israeli officials When leaders in Hamas speak out but all of those comments are usually Anonymous to Israeli media and some of those comments that have been laay anonymously of course have been saying that Hamas is the reason there hasn't been a ceasefire that the deal that the Biden administration had laid out was in fact rejected by Hamas the Israelis saw it as a negative response so we've been seeing a lot of pointing the finger a lot of back and forth between the Israelis and Hamas each side blames the other for why there hasn't been a ceasefire agreement and the anonymous Israeli officials ended their statements to Israeli media by saying that Hamas was in fact the one who violated the previous ceasefire agreement back in November where again Hamas accuses the Israelis of violating that deal but let's remember that both sides have really tough sticking points that we've been talking about for months Hamas wants to see a total end to the war a withdrawal of Israeli troops where the Israelis have said that until all of the goals of the war are achieved that's simply not going to happen and if Hamas does in fact want to see an end to the war they're going to have to go back to the Biden administration's three-phase plan and really agree to it the way Israel wants it but until now we are still nowhere closer to a deal and H a protest group began a campaign of weeklong disruptions how disruptive was the beginning today well today we saw major highways throughout Israel that have been blocked in what protest organizers are calling a week of disruption this means that there will be sporadic protests every single day throughout multiple parts of the country and this is something we have seen from the Israeli public before not just throughout the war but in fact previously before the war when they were protesting against the government there are expected to be protests throughout the week outside of the Israeli Parliament and what organizers are saying is quote give the mandate back to the people calling on elections to be held immediately for new leadership we've been seeing thousands of Israelis taking to the streets in Tel Aviv and in other parts of Israel on a weekly basis but now they're saying that simply too much time has gone by the war is entering its 10th month and it is too much time for the captives to still be held in Gaza so the Israeli public is trying to send a message that they're looking for new leadership immediately thanks so much h and a reminder the Israeli government banned Al jazer from operating in Israel and extended that decision which is why hamda joined us from neighboring Jordan right Yousef Mandel is professor of political science and international relations at Carter University he joins us from Constantine in Algeria good to have you with us so first of all I mean what does hamas's statement suggest to you about where the ceasefire talks are at this stage well I think that what Hamas wants is to dictate uh its will on these negotiations obviously the Israelis have a different point of view they wanted uh toes fires and they wanted to achieve their stated objectives at the beginning of the war namely the destruction of Hamas and making sure that Israel is safe there will be normal attacks from Gaza Hamas on the other hand uh has been holding tight on its demands and they saying there no there'll be no temporary ceasefires what we want is a complete ceas fire for and the secondly is complete withdrawal of isra forces from Gaza and of course uh building the whole area it seems to me that given the international uh pressure that we've seen in so many uh cities in the western world and most importantly in so many uh University campuses in the United States and Britain just to name these two traditional allies of Israel I think that public opinion has been swinging more towards Hamas there are so many number of countries in Europe who have recognized uh Palestine as a state there are many divisions within uh Israel itself and especially the war cabinet with the recent resignation of Gand I think all these seem to strengthen hamas's hands in the negotiations and most importantly perhaps is that Israel has not been able to defeat Hamas on uh on the ground there'll be so many Palestinian losses yes but the Palestinians have been resilient and they there as your images have shown like you said few seconds ago that uh Al jaaz was banned from reporting from Israel is another uh important development because Al jaaz has been showing the other side of the story something that the Israel do not want to see what is the US position though how is that evolving well last we heard from Secretary of State Anthony blinkin was saying that hamas's response contains things they can work on and things they can't what is the position now well I think it's very difficult to Gorge the US's position obviously from the beginning that the US has been very supportive of uh Israel uh providing them with all the support either military political economic and so on and so forth but given the elections in the US within couple of months from uh three months from now uh public opinion has been swinging we see that at least the US position has been trying to realize that the situation is very very serious they accepted that some of hamas's uh demands are legitimate they can work on but also they don't want to upset the Biden Administration doesn't want to upset the strong Jewish Lobby in the US and does not want to upset uh its allies in Israel so I think it's taking the middle ground and hoping hoping to see some kind of developments that will make the picture uh clearer as far as the United States is concerned and youf today we had some conflicting signals on a pause the Israeli military saying earlier that it would begin pauses isra politicians being reported to have criticized that what does that tell us about the cohesiveness of thinking and decision making within Israeli authorities right now well I think they there are so many deep divisions within Israel at the moment they have been for the the last uh few months or so there are people in Israel who want a a ceasefire a complete uh ceasefire but if there is a ceasefire in at the moment I think that would signal the end of Benyamin nanahu perip I think there are the divisions in Israel are two FS two camps the Natan who Camp who want to continue uh this war in order to achieve its objectives and most importantly keep his uh positions others in my mind to my mind who see sense that this war who has been going on for the last eight months or so has not achieved any of its objectives there have been some uh hostages freed recently but they came at a very high cost the all the hostages who are freed were freed through negotiations so the war has not achieved anything and these people are seeing little bit of sense to say that the people are saying that the The Only Way Forward is through negotiations and the battlefield will not achieve anything all right Yousef wandel from cutter University thank you so much thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
