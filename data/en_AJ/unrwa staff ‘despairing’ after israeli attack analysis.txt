the war on Gaza now and Israeli forces have killed at least 39 Palestinians across the strip since Wednesday six were employees of the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees they were killed in a targeted Israeli strike on a school in the alnus rat refugee camp funerals have been held for some of the 18 people who died in the attack the school was being used as a shelter housing around 12,000 displaced Palestinians unra says it's the highest death toll among its staff in a single incident during the 11-month War let's bring in Han Mahmud now who is in darl Bala in central Gaza honey uh the funeral has been held for those people who were killed in that devastating attack on the UN run school yesterday well Mariam it's an aftermath after an aftermath a tragedy after a tragedy just as we were talking about the funeral procession here and the the farewell for the many who were killed inside the school uh the other Hills facilities are also busy accommodating large influx of injuries from a recent fresh attack on a residential building in southern part of kanuni that's an area between the central area and Han Unice near the European hospital and the residential block is known as the res as the European residential complex in southern part of hanun city where four member of from one family inside of a residential flat were killed as a drone fired missiles inside these inside this flat killing four members of One family and injuring the remaining family members who were inside the flat and this is the patterns of attacks have been happening over and over here inside the hospital and that is the scenario everywhere not only at this health facility but here we're able to see doctors what they're doing their intervention their their effort to try to save lives but the lack of medical suppli the insufficient medical staff the fact that almost a year long genocidal war and people here dealing with cases back to back for the for almost a whole year is just very exhausting and making it very difficult to intervene in a proper way and to save lives injuries from the yesterday's attack on a school ja school which by the way is not the first time it's the fifth attack on the school leaving 18 people killed majority women and children including six anoa employees and that's hard part of ongoing attacks isra military it's political Elite are pushing for an narrative to delegitimize honor and its work across the Gaza STP and make it look so bad so in order to justify any of the attacks so far Ana sta has lost close to 20 220 of its staff members on the gr working in different fields and delivering Aid and con securing Aid convoys and delivering a vaccination to the nor part of of the Gaza Strip but those were inside the facility helping the many uh children and women inside this evacuation Center to survive these difficult conditions honey thank you very much for the update that's Al jaz's hany Mahmud reporting their life from darab Bala in central Gaza as hany mentioned there six unra employees were killed in the attack on that un run School in Alat let's take a closer look at the impact of the war on un's operations in the Gaza strip the UN agency employs about 13,000 staff 220 have been killed in Israeli attacks since October the 7th more than 190 of its facilities have been destroyed only 10 of the agency's 27 Health Care Centers remain operational nearly 70% of the 193 schools it runs have been hit and many severely damaged 95% of them were being used to shelter displaced people the UN agency supports nearly 6 million Palestinian refugees across the Middle East the US is its largest donor contributing more than $420 million in 2023 while joining us now on the newsour is Sam Rose who's the senior deputy director of unra Affairs in Gaza he's live from kanu and his son Sam thank you so much for being with us it is devastating to see these continuing attacks on humanitarian workers how are your teams on the ground coping uh in the wake of this new tragedy and how is it affecting your operations in Gaza thanks for having me on look this is one of the most difficult days that that we faced in UN in Gaza during the most difficult conflicts that we've we've ever faced staff in the offices are in Shock that they're grieving they're despairing and the colleagues on the ground who who I've talked to in the shelter providing firstline response are just just devastated yet another attack on a protected un facility the fifth time as he said at the at the start of the the the C that that that this school itself has been attacked so it it's devastating it's horrific it's all these superlatives and just the scale and the rapidity of the incidents are just too difficult for us to get our heads around sometimes yeah these were local humanitarian workers who were helping their fellow Palestinians today Gaza really is a dangerous Place uh to work for for humanitarian workers no one seems to be safe is there a point Sam where where it'll be impossible to do your work on the ground I mean we're certainly running out of options the highest number of un workers and humanitarians slain in in any conflict the vast majority of them unra workers we're facing increasing difficulties getting our supplies into we had a terrible terrible incident at one of the checkpoints uh trying to go north a couple of of of nights ago to a lead on the administration of of the polio campaign so yeah we're running out of options the space in which we're able to operate geographically but also kind of conceptually and existentially is is simply shrinking and our staff working day in day out around the clock to whom I want to express my my tribute and my condolences to them and their families they're facing it increasingly difficult because we as unra are not able to afford them the protections that they uh that they require and unre doesn't operate in a vacuum unre is an organ of the UN General Assembly we're part of the United Nations and we have to call on UN member states to to see what they can do to make this environment safer for us safer for our staff safer for the 12,000 who were Sheltering in that installation running away and evacuating from bombardments and conflict what they can do to keep them safe let me just ask you Sam about this call that was hit on Wednesday and Israel justification for targeting it um the the this SCH was hit five times already this year it was being used as a shelter as we know but the Israeli Army has said that this was a Hamas command and control center what do you say to that was this school or the area around it as you know being used for fighting purposes I mean i' say three things one is I I mean I can't confirm the specifics o of that secondly regardless of that there are rules in war that require all parties to a conflict to respect the humanitarian character the protected character of certain installations that includes un installations that includes schools there were 12,000 people Sheltering in that school the vast majority of them women and children who deserve protection uh the third thing I would say is that this school was being used just a few days ago for delivery of of polio vaccin so precisely the place that we were going to as the United Nations to provide safety for these children has now yet again come under attack it's simply devastating as you've said Sam UN member states are meant to protect humanitarian Ian workers we've heard the Secretary General again uh condemn this attack saying it was unacceptable but this seems to be happening time and time again we hear the condemnation we know it's a violation of international law what else are you hoping to see from these UN member states uh so they can ensure that humanitarian workers like those of unra are protected in these conflict zones we call on member states to uphold the principles of of the United United Nations Charter and protect the character of humanitarian operations and humanitarian installations all humanitarians here and and in other conflicts around the world we call for the United Nations member states to put pressure on those who are undermining the the character of of those organizations and its employees including unra but most of all right now we call for an immediate ceasefire we call for a release of hostages because that's the only way that this is going to come come to an end if not I'll be on this show next week talking about yet another catastrophe yet more Carnage yet more devastating and completely needless loss of life thank you so much for talking to us Sam Sam Rose is the senior deputy director of unra Affairs in Gaza make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
