it is 20 minutes to midday in Israel and we're cutting to the live pictures of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who is hosting the US President Joe Biden let's listen the world sees that support and the moral Clarity that you have demonstrated from the moment Israel was attacked you've rightly drawn a clear line between the forces of civilization and the forces of barbarism you described what Hamas did as sheer evil it is exactly that Hamas murdered children in front of their parents and parents in front of their children they burnt people alive they raped and murdered women they beheaded soldiers they they search for the secret hiding places where parents hid their children and just imagine Mr President the the fear and the Panic of those little children in their last moments as the monsters discovered found out their hiding places Kamas kidnapped women children elderly Holocaust survivals I know you share our outrage on this and I know you share our determination to bring these people back on October 7th Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis maybe more this is in a country of fewer than 10 million people this would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day that's 2911 that is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy Mr President you rightly said that Hamas is worse than Isis the German chancellor who visited here yesterday said that Hamas were the new Nazis you're both right and just as a civilized World United to defeat the Nazis and United to defeat Isis the Civilized world must unite to defeat Hamas I can assure you Mr President Israel is United to defeat Hamas and we will defeat Hamas and remove this terrible threat from our lives the forces of civilization will prevail for our sake for your sake for peace and Security in our region and in the world Mr President for the people of Israel there's only one thing better than having a true friend like you standing with Israel and that is having you standing in Israel your visit here is the first visit of an American president in Israel at a time of War it is deeply deeply moving it speaks of the depth of your personal commitment to Israel it speaks to the depth of your personal commitment to the future of the Jewish people and the one and only Jewish state so I know I speak for all the people of Israel when I say thank you Mr President thank you for standing with Israel today tomorrow and always Mr Prime Minister thank you very much look folks uh I wanted to be here today uh for a simple reason I want the people of Israel the people of the world to know where the United States stand hands I've had my great secretary of state here he's been here for a lot but I wanted to personally come and make that clear terrorist group Hamas has slaughtered as been pointed out over 1,300 people and is not hyperbole Su just slaughtered slaughtered and uh including 31 Americans is part of that and uh they've taken scores of people hostage including children you said imagine what those children hiding from Hamas were thinking it's beyond my comprehension be able to imagine what they're thinking beyond my comprehension they're committed evils that and atrocities that U make Isis look uh somewhat more rational you know um Americans are grieving with you they really are and Americans are wor worried Americans are worried because we know there's a this is not an easy field to navigate what you have to do but uh the fact is that Israel as they respond to these attacks it seems to me that have to continue to ensure that you have what you need to defend yourselves and we're going to make sure that occurs as you know and we have to also bear in mind that AAS does not represent all the Palestinian people and uh it has brought them only suffering you know uh years ago I asked the Secretary of State when he and I working in the Senate to write something for man he said uh he wrote a line that uh I think is appropriate he said uh it's not we lead uh not just uh well I won't go into it I'll wait later taking too much time but the point is this that uh um I was deeply saddened an outrage by the uh explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday and based on what I've seen it appears as though it was done by the other team not not you but there's a lot of people out there not sure so we got a lot we got to overcome a lot of things and also means encouraging life-saving uh capacity to help the Palestinians were innocent caught in the middle of this and uh well anyway that's that's who we are not just me but I mean that's who the United States is and uh um it's just not the example of our power is the power our example it's almost as important the world's looking we uh Israel has a value set like the United States does and other democracies and uh and they're looking to see what we're going to do so uh Mr Prime Minister I'm very happy to be back in Israel with you thank you for having me and uh I'm looking forward to having a thorough discussion about where everybody goes from here but thank you and uh I want to say to the people of Israel their courage their commitment their bravery is uh is stunning it's really stunning I'm proud of to be here thank you okay you've just been listening to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden with their opening statements at the outset of this uh visit of support by Biden for Israel uh couple of the um headlines as we bring in alzer's Alan fiser who's standing by for us in Tel Aviv covering uh this trip couple of the quotes alen um from the Israeli Prime Minister uh Netanyahu he praised Biden's moral Clarity he framed the war in Gaza as a conflict between the forces ofil civilization and the forces of barbery uh he appeared to do some some math uh and on the death tolls and compared essentially the the death toll in Israel to 2911 um that's on the Netanyahu side and highlights from Biden and then you'll to you'll tell me Allan what you took away from this uh Joe Biden says he was here obviously to show support for Israel um quote the hamas's atrocities make Isis look somewhat more rational end quote and also importantly um Biden referenced briefly the strike on the hospital in Gaza that took place about 14 15 hours ago now that killed 500 Palestinians and he says from what he has seen from what Biden has seen the hospital explosion was caused by the other side the other team I believe he said said end quote so that was Biden saying as far as he's concerned uh Israel did not carry out that attack that's the state of play those are the opening remarks Alan what can you tell us I I think uh what is clear is that when the Americans said that their National Security team would be looking at what actually caused the explosion in Gaza on Tuesday night uh that there would be a longer inquiry it seems that Joe Biden has already decided he knows what happened by saying in a very poor choice of words that the other team was responsible he did say that he was deeply outraged by what had happened and concerned but this visit is an extraordinary show of support for the Israelis and essentially by Joe Biden saying that he believes that it was a misfiring rocket that caused the chaos and the Carnage at the hospital in Gaza that essentially there's now a green light for Israel to do what it wants his comparisons to ISA that was a very very poor choice of words by the president to even begin to consider that Isis uh was rational if Donald Trump had said something like that there would be outrage for for days it was a very very poor choice of words uh but it's clear that that Joe Biden uh is giving his support to whatever may come in the next few days we're aware that there was talk that the Israelis postponed the ground war to allow Joe Biden to carry out this visit but the suggestion obviously is that in the next few days they we're going to see a ground offensive just on what Benjamin Netanyahu said it was interesting that he did make the comparison uh to 2911 Benjamin Netanyahu has spent a great deal of time in the United States he's aware of the American psyche and by Plumbing into 911 he is uh he knows what he's doing he he's absolutely absolutely certain what he's doing and there was that phrase where he said not only is it great that Joe Biden is standing with Israel it's great that Joe Biden is standing in Israel because as I say this is an extraordinary show of support for Israel at this time normally American presidents are calling for restraint here is essentially Joe Biden giving the green light to what may happen in the next couple of days albeit saying that there is a desperate need to get humanitarian Aid into Gaza and get innocent people out of Gaza what's left for Biden to do I mean Netanyahu and Biden have both made some important statements here uh this was only moments after Biden arrived in Tel Aviv what else is he going to do during this trip well on his way back he's going to be speaking to president CCE of Egypt and president Mahmud abas of the Palestinian Authority now the reason he's going to speak to them on the phone is that they canell uh the summit that was due to be held along onside the King of Jordan in a man because they wanted Joe Biden to call for a ceasefire and it's clear that the Americans aren't at that point whether it be a human humanitarian ceasefire like the Secretary General of the UN has called for in the last few hours or an absolute ceasefire and the fact that he wasn't prepared to put his name to that meant that the the Arab leaders felt that they would be complicit in whatever happens in the next few days and so unusually how often do you get a US president being snubbed and particularly from a close Ally like Jordan the Arab leaders the three of them decided to walk away now everything has been Complicated by what has happened over the last 24 hours at the hospital in Gaza and that makes this trip much more Dynamic but what is clear is that Joe Biden's support for Israel that he expressed hours after what happened on the 7eventh of this month is unwavering and and he again promised Israel whatever they needed to defend themselves that's alzer's Alan Fischer reporting just moments after we heard from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the US President Joe Biden who has just landed in Israel to show his support to Netanyahu and to Israel
