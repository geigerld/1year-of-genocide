and we can speak now with Mahmud Al Kash sir you're an English teacher in Gaza you're joining us uh from Rafa on this first day of Ramadan thank you for your time today how are you and your family doing yes uh actually as I'm a displac person among all of uh these tens of thousands of dis displ persons you can see that it's uh k cic situation now yes so obviously Ramadan being uh a actually uh sorry go ahead if I can say that yes okay just to talk about the life here it's it's very gloy and miserable situations hard circumstances uh we find difficulties in how to get food because you know even when we get food this the prices are in the sky it's very expensive it's doubled like 10 times then before the war and actually I'm nowadays working as a volunteer for many uh kitchens uh actually tea charitable kitchens or sou kitchens and one of them is it's called and in this kitchen they provide food hot meals for tens of thousands of displaced families who are now suffering in the camps in the shelters around this area in Rafa City yes I was going to ask you where do you pray given that so many of the mosques across the Gaza Strip have been either badly damaged or completely destroyed actually there are still some MOS that we can pray at but when we want to take the decision to go to the mosque to tray actually a lot of people people are afraid to go to the mosque because you know that a lot of mosque are attacked so it's like a difficult situation to go to pray and you know that they may attack this situation a lot of rockets May destroy everything around so it's a bit a little bit difficult and some uh prayers we pray at home and even for people who are now uh you can imagine that in a small tent and it's very crowded at least 10 or 15 persons in a small tent uh with no food no clothes uh no money no job so they are wondering every day how can they get food so this puts more pressure upon the father who's responsible for this family actually this happens every day so we try our best to provide food for these people and to alleviate the pain to relieve the pain but actually all of our attempts not all of them are in vain but it's not enough at all I I'd like to ask you a question about faith and spirituality in a time of War uh Ramadan is a time for reflection what are you able how do you exercise your faith and and what are you able to reflect on when as you explain to us you're looking for enough food to feed you and your relatives you're at any moment uh at every moment you are in danger of being bombed and you've been displaced you're not living in your home what can you reflect on under those circumstances actually uh for me I'm a father of uh little kids so when there is a nearby bomb so my children for sure they are crying and I must hug them at least to relieve their pain and to to relieve this suffering at that moment but actually it has a lot of uh effects on them even after this war a lot of suffering will remain in this area after this uh genocide so for uh let me talk about the part of food actually when uh one person or one father who has a family after evacuating Under Fire and walking for nearly uh maybe 30 kilomet all of this area after escaping from fire when they suddenly found themselves in a small tent so how can he provide food in this way he is forced to go to some kitchens and you know a lot of people are crowded in this free kitchen to get food and some people are maybe hard maybe their dignity are hard in this in this uh place so uh we we talk about a very complicated situation we took about a gloomy atmosphere and there is no light at the end of the tunnel all of people are now in the first day of Ramadan you know they have no gas to cook for food forar you know fasting for almost 15 hours in a day and then you want to eat after being so hungry so you can't find the enough food you can't find fire even if you want to uh purchase some uh wood to uh I mean sticks of food to uh burn the fire you know it hurts you because uh the black VOR comes inside the nose the eyes Sir and this even happens for me many times very difficult for us but we have no choice what you mentioned that you were a father what do you tell your children at the moment how do you parent in a situation like this one ah actually uh some times maybe I succeed to let me say to deceive them and to tell them that I will buy for you the the food maybe after 2 hours 3 hours until they can just go to sleep and sometimes I can provide for them it depends on the situation and the current state in the shop and the prices all right mahm Al Kash you're an English teacher in Gaza thank you very much for uh joining us this hour thank you for your time and sharing all that with
