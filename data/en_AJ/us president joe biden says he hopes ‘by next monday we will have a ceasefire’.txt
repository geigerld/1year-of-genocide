now the US President Joe Biden says an agreement for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza could be reached by Monday and as part of it he says Israel is ready to Hal military activities during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan which also begins in the coming days Al jazer sources say that the initial framework for the deal includes the exchange of 400 Palestinian prisoners for 40 Israeli captives held in Gaza Israel has also reportedly agreed to the gradual return of displaced Palestinians to Northern Gaza sources say under the deal Israel would reposition its forces away from crowded areas and halt aerial surveillance for 8 hours a day now Biden made his remarks during appearance on a late night Chat Show and we've got a at least a principal agreement there will be a ceasefire while that takes place ramadan's coming up and there's been an agreement by the Israelis that they would not engage in activities during Ramadan as well in order to give us time to to get all the hostages out that gives us time to begin to move in directions that a lot of Arab countries are prepared to move in and in the meantime there are too many innocent people that are being killed and uh Israel has slowed down the attacks in Rafa they have to and they've made a commitment to me they're going to see to it that there's ability to evacuate significant portions of Rafa before they go and take out the remainder of Hamas but it but it's a process Israel has had the overwhelming support of the vast majority of Nations if it keeps this up without this incredibly conservative government they have and Ben gavier and others most I've known every major foreign policy leader in Israel since goldem mayir they're going to lose support from around the world and that is not in Israel's interest Mike kind joins us now from Washington DC it does beg the question Mike what does Biden know that uh we don't seems to be sort of order of the day when it comes to any potential ceasefire indeed yes but there in that statement that Biden made on The Late Night show he's talking about an immediate agreement a midterm agreement and a long-term agreement he got a lot in that uh particular appearance on the Nate night show he's talking about the indication of a ceasefire beginning incoming days saying that this has been agreed to in principle of viously President Biden must be aware of something that the wider public is not the discussions that have been going on between all the interested parties but then he continues and says that Israel has committed as well to end activities during the holy month of Ramadan now that begins around March the 10th uh Biden saying that this would give people time to get the captives being held in Gaza out of that country and then he goes even further and he says this interm and extended SE fire would then give us time to alter the dynamic and what he's hinting at here is a wider Arab recognition of Israel in exchange for a ceasefire or long-term agreement uh between Israel and Palestinians so there's a lot packed into these comments that he made in the late night show and clearly he's got access to information as president of the United States at the general public doesn't uh but in brief it would appear well President Biden says that there is an agre agement in principle to get a ceasefire in place in coming days Mike thanks very much for the update Mike Hannah there for us in Washington DC well vill marks joins us now from occupied East Jerusalem and one wonders what Israel is is either thinking or saying about Biden's comments villm well the Israeli government is not saying a huge amount we've reached out to prime minister Benjamin netanyahu's office they have said they are not offering comment on the remarks from the US leader we've also reached out to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here that's often involved in these kinds of negotiations and obviously often responds to what foreign governments say about Israel they too have not responded to our requests in terms of the other parties to this negotiation of course we've been hearing from the qari foreign Ministry over the last couple of hours Hamas we've been trying to reach out to some of the people close to that organization we've not been hearing back from them yet they have spoken to reiters over the course of the the last few hours in which they've said and this is according to the Reuters news agency these are unnamed officials inside Hamas saying that Biden's remarks suggesting the agreement had already been reached in principle were premature there were still big gaps that needed to be bridged clearly there is a concern that the details of this deal that have been put out there into the public are not entirely agreed on between the two sides that maybe quite obvious thing to say the central contradiction of course is going to be around resolving the long-term plan for the Israeli military inside Gaza the Israelis have said repeatedly as has prime minister Netanyahu on television that he will push ahead with operations in Rafa whether there is a ceasefire or not Hamas has publicly talked about the need for a permanent ceasefire trying to bridge that Gap seems to be one of the challenges and of course villm just to clarify for our viewers where does Israel stand on any conversation that involves the word pause or ceasefire it's a really good question and I think a lot of governments have tied themselves in kns trying to figure out the differential here Netanyahu let's just take him at his word as the Prime Minister he has said that whatever happens the Israelis will push on through speaking to CBS Face the Nation over the course of the weekend whether there is a ceasefire or not over the last over the the next I should say 6 weeks or so let's just say there's going to be uh 40 days of ceasefire in return for 40 Israeli captives being released during those 40 days there would be a cessation of hostilities there would be a reduction in let's say aerial reconnaissance but after that netanyahu's made it very clear that he wants to see what he's called absolute Victory so the idea that this is going to become a permanent ceasefire doesn't seem to be something that Israeli officials publicly are acknowledging as a possibility vill marks forest and occupied East Jerusalem thank you
