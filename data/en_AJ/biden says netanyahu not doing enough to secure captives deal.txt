US President Joe Biden is meeting with the American negotiating team who've been taking part in the Gaza ceasefire talks he called the meeting after the body of a US Israeli citizen was recovered along with five others in southern Gaza on Saturday President Biden spoke to the media before going into that meeting and uh so checking on What's following up on what's happening in Israel and then uh I'll be off to Pittsburgh are you planning to present a final hostage field to the uh both sides this week we're very close to that what makes you think that this deal will be successful in a way that the other deals were not hope friends Eternal Mr President if do you think it's time for prime minister Netanyahu to do more on this issue do you think he's doing enough no Mr President what is your reaction to the demonstrations across Israel what is your reaction to the demonstrations I'm going to get the detail when I walk into I'll talk you after that okay last for Pres give a message for the hostages family sir yes I've spoken to the American hostage I spoke to his mom and dad and uh we're not giving up we're going to continue to push as hard as we can I speak to our White House correspondent kimy haet so um uh Joe Biden kimbley couldn't have been clearer he doesn't think Netanyahu is doing enough what do we anticipate from this meeting yeah well in the absence of what the US president sees as a lack of effort by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the US leaders the US President Joe Biden along with his vice president kamla Harris and their negotiating team are working in the white house right now trying to uh really put the fine details on what is being called a take it or leave it type proposal when this been negotiated between the United States Qatar and also Egypt one that will really try to push the Israeli Prime Minister over the Finish Line to close a deal with Hamas to bring those Israeli captives back to Israel in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jail so what we know is this is really going to be an effort to work along the highest levels of government in a diplomatic push to really get him to try and close this deal now giy how important is it for Biden and Harris to control the narrative and to reach uh some something that resembles a conclusion allall of this ahead of the November election then well for kamla Harris this is critical because uh this is really becoming an attack line for her uh political opponents Republican and former president Donald Trump uh you've got to remember that kamla Harris as vice president is tied to what the American public perceives to be the foreign policy blunders of Joe Biden already he's being blamed and has been attached to sort of a stain from the chaotic Afghan withdrawal of which she has tried to distance herself so if this is also perceived to be a failure on the part of the president and the fact that kamla Harris has invested herself in trying to reach a ceasefire deal with uh and push for that with uh the Israeli Prime Minister she is also going to be blamed for that so uh she's working hard but the bottom line is is even as they've tried to uh Campa in Pennsylvania this crisis is certainly uh something that's going to overshadow that campaign appearance all right kimbery many thanks for that kimly hit at the White House make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
