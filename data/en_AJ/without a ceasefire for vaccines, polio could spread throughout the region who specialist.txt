the World Health Organization plans to conduct a polio vaccine campaign in Gaza after the virus was detected in Wastewater the wh is going to send 1.2 million vaccines to Gaza with 600,000 of those for children under the age of eight now the first round of vaccinations is scheduled to be rolled out from August the 17th the who has requested a ceasefire and humanitarian groans to roll out the campaign Israel's rejected the these requests in the past on July the 21st Israel's military announced it was going to start vaccinating its soldiers in Gaza against the threat of polio the who says Gaza had a 99% vaccination rate before the war and that's now dropped to 86% leaving pockets of Children at Risk Hamed Jafari is director of polio eradication for Eastern Mediterranean region at the who he's joining us live from London thank you very much indeed uh for being with us um in the event that Israel doesn't allow for a pause in the fight to allow this roll out to go ahead which is on a huge scale what are you going to do so this is going to be a very um if we do not have a ceasefire and if the if sufficient freedom of movement of health workers to be able to plan the logistics and operations and actually uh find all the children and then vaccinate them if that is not allowed uh the risk of this outbreak spreading not only within Gaza but outside of Gaza uh to other parts of of occupied Palestinian territory Israel and surrounding countries the risk who assesses that risk to be very high and while uh no cases of paralytic polio have been detected so far that risk will continue to increase especially among the youngest children among infants who have not been consistently getting their uh vaccination because of the disruption of the the uh Service delivery in Gaza you were mentioning before that part of the process is obviously simply trying to find people in order to be able to inoculate them and you said that there are 600,000 of the the vaccinations are geared towards children under the age of eight do you have the Staffing and the facilities to be able to track people down in order to be able to administer the vaccine so wh is working very closely with the Ministry of Health of the occupied Palestine in uh palestin territory with UNICEF with unva and other partners humanitarian actors that are on the ground uh we obviously can't do this uh do this alone there are health workers on the ground and then we will need to train the vaccinators who will be going to vaccinate children and ideally what we do in a situation of a polio outbreak is to do house-to-house vaccination campaigns that obviously is elusive in the current situation in Gaza where children are in shelters in in uh uh overcrowded uh displaced camps uh so we'll have to organize campaigns both through Health Facilities through temporary fix sites and where possible go tent to tent or Camp to camp but it's very important that this can the planning for this to map where the children are to move all the vaccines and Logistics and then start vaccinating children so that we can reach everybody uh would not only require a ceasefire and cessation of hostilities it would require a significant freedom of movement uh which is very difficult in Gaza right now given all the heavy checkpoints and the detentions that happen at at checkpoints you touch touched a moment ago on the possible outcome in the event that you're not able to carry this vaccination program out just elaborate on that for us how how bad could this get this you know polio is an ongoing Public Health Emergency of international concern under the IH uh so it is a public health emergency wherever polio virus is detected so it's a public health emergency in Gaza right now and if it spreads out of Gaza into Israel into other into West Bank it becomes a public health emergency there Lebanon is at risk Egypt is at risk Jordan is at risk and other countries of the region are at risk and with Travelers you remember two years ago uh polio virus was detected in suan London in New York so this can spread very fast internationally and most importantly it's a direct threat to the children of Gaza that this can start paralyzing children very very rapidly Hamed Jafari director of polio eradication for Eastern Mediterranean region at the wh thank you very much indeed for being with us thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
