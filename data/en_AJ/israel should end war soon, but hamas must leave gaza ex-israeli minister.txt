artillery bombardment and shellings continued overnight in Rafa and Israeli forces remain in control of the main border crossing with Egypt blocking most humanitarian supplies while hospitals run critically low on fuel Palestinians were already facing famine especially in the north but now there's even less Aid getting in many have fled to Central Gaza but only one water station is working there meanwhile the US president has sent his strongest message yet to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Joe Biden said say he'll stop the supply of weapons to Israel if it launches an allout attack on Rafa Yosi berin is a former Israeli Minister of Justice he's joining us now from Berlin thank you very much indeed for being with us on Al jazer I want to talk to you first of all about Joe Biden's threat to pause weapons uh to Israel this I if I understand it correctly is going to affect future arms deliveries but in real terms in your assessment how much of a threat do you think that actually is well I I think that it is a message rather than something very practical I am not a military expert but I don't believe that the daily activities in ra or or somewhere else are dependent on the the American delivery of ammunition do you think that that um in order to show a strong response to this threat in inverted Commerce from Joe Biden it could actually put push Benjamin netanyahu's resolve to move further into Rafa and perhaps more strongly with a a a subsequent significant loss of life simply to to show that he will not be dictated to by another government no it's not a kindergarten I don't think so in terms of the the drive that Benjamin Netanyahu has in order to push forward um a move into Rafa how much of that do you think is coming from him and how much of it is being driven by the farri co elements of his Coalition well I I don't believe that we are going to a kind of a zero some game in this war or in any war between a state and a terrorist group or terrorist even Army and I think that we should and we can put an end to this uh War very very soon by doing two things insisting on the Israeli side insisting on the exchange of prisoners of hostages and on the other on the other hand or additional to that to demand that the pal the Palestinian Hamas leadership will leave Gaza Israel cannot afford it that Hamas will continue and govern Gaza but it doesn't mean that we have to continue this war forever and kill innocent people on both sides it's enough I mean it is a very long much long longer than expected and as you know in the history it happened in 82 when when Arafat was asked to leave Lebanon with his leadership and he did it and then things changed and and the rest is history I think that here again we should and we can insist on the on the Hamas leadership to leave Gaza and then a a multilateral force of of Arab countries and Others May rule Gaza Israel will totally withdraw and this is I believe the the most reasonable solution for the problem I cannot tell you what what is going to happen tomorrow in in Rafa or in another place but it may be endless and it is not helping each of any of us in in the current situation in near future in terms of in the event that Hamas was not to have a role in the future of Gaza obviously somebody would have to have a role what would you what structure would you see being put in place that would be acceptable to all sides well I don't know whether it is going to be acceptable for all sides but the Americans who are playing a very important and positive role should insist on it and I mean PLO this is our partner with the PLO we signed the Oslo agreement and all the other agreements in the last 30 years the the Gaza Strip was taken by force when Hamas took it in June 2007 and until then it was the Palestinian Authority which was in charge on on Gaza and that should be the case in the future but because of its weakness I'm not sure that it is possible I'm not sure that the Palestinian Authority is ready to take it upon itself right now so there is a need for a a transitional period of a year or two in which a as I said a multilateral force will rule Gaza and be in charge of of saving it and its citizens and help building it again it's widely believed that Benjamin nanahu supported albeit perhaps unofficially Hamas being in power for Gaza in Gaza for years because he didn't want Israel to have that responsibility and China's recently hosted talks between fata and Hamas in order to try to find some sort of Common Ground fata being the political group behind the Palestinian Authority it's going to be difficult to find a way of unpicking Hamas from Gaza from a region where at least administratively it has had such a strong hold for so long first of all you are right I I think it won't be easy and this is why I believe that it is not a matter of of an ongoing War about a political decision of the Kamas leadership they can save themselves and the the the Gaza STP if they take such a an offer and then I believe that there will be Israelis who will say no we cannot let them live and we should continue and and fight but here it is going to be the American World to tell them enough is enough and now this leadership regretfully Will Survive and go to another place and I you are also right in saying that Netanyahu preferred not that he he he was supportive God forbid Hamas but it was easier for him to deal with Hamas and to allow them to get the the the budget that they needed rather than to deal with the PLO or the fat the fatak Le PLO in order to get to the two-state solution because he doesn't want to partition the land and that is his huge biggest mistake you mentioned that there were two key elements that as far as you could see were were intrinsic to earing this conflict one of course was agreeing an exchange of prisoners the second one was the role of Hamas as as we've talked about the Hamas has already agreed that there will be an exchange of prisoners an exchange of of captives being held in Gaza for prisoners uh in uh being held in Israel so what is the fundamental block do you see to the ceasefire negotiations that are currently going on in Cairo if those agreements have already been reached by Hamas I must say that I I read the Hamas offer this is not a Nuance of the previous offer by Egypt and and C it is it is a new idea the the idea is that the exchange of prisoners is very blurry you don't know if you read it carefully what is the number of hostages that babies and old people and others who they they are ready to to release and and on the other hand it means that Hamas continues to rule Gaza and that is bad news I believe for all of us or for all of us who believe in peace y
