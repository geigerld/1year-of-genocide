well sharuk dawat has been released by the Israelis after spending eight years in prison she spoke of her surprise at being freed to be liberated I didn't expect that I would be released this year even though my mom always said I have a feeling my daughter that this year is going to be the year of freedom for you and I believed my mom and I believed with the feelings of my mom and I stayed strong all these years for my mom for my family for my dad for everyone I stayed strong and seriously we give the message to the people of Gaza that stay steadfast we are always our hearts with you seriously the price for Glory is very high but we are people that we can create miracles from our Bain and there is always a challenge but we are always determined I also want to give a message to the prisoners that I left behind me please stay strong and as I was released while I was sentenced for 16 years and for the girls who are life sentence I can tell you that stay strong be patient and believe me there it will be a release soon God willing
