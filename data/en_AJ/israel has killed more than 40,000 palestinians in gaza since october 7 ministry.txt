killed on daily basis I just want to jump in there because we are actually just getting news from the Gaza Health Ministry that that Grim Milestone of 40,000 people has been passed the official figure is now 40,5 people of course we were just saying earlier that 40 people had been killed in the last 24 hours alone and that has taken the death toll in Gaza to over 40,000 people it's a terrible number it's a terrible toll on the population there as you say many people also critically injured the official number now is 92,5 And1 and Hanny that number that 40,000 figure that we have been looking at for the past few days now as the numbers get closer to it is actually likely to be far higher isn't it with a number of people still unaccounted for people who are buried under the rubble after Israeli air strikes yes that is correct the number that we're looking at is or our reading of this number or the figures available right now it's a it's a conservative reading of the number of casualties whether those who were killed or those are critically injured what we're looking at is simply a conservative reading of the statistics on the ground it's far higher in reality there are those are still who are missing there's still those that family members remaining family members have no idea about their about they don't know what happened to them whether they were detained whether they were buried under the rubbles or they they just gun missing you know sometimes people said they just evaporated because the kind of bombs that dropped across the GP the initial weeks of of this genocidal war is really military intentionally and deliberately dropped what it's called the dumb bombs these dumb bombs pretty much vul pariz entire residential blocks including uh people who were staying in these residential buildings residential blocks have gone missing and so far we have families members remaining family who survived these attacks are still searching for family members who were with them inside these residential buildings or they were present at the time of the attacks with no signs of their whereabouts so far there's those who are still buried missing
