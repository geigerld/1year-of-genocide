now the influential us Republican senator lindsy Graham says Israel will have to accept a two-state solution if it wants to normalize ties with Saudi Arabia speaking to NBC News the staunch critic of President Joe Biden praised the administration's efforts to push for a normalization deal between Israel and Riad to my friends in Israel you do whatever you think is best for the state of Israel but I can tell you Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries cannot normalize with this Israel if they seen if they're having been seen as throwing the Palestinians under the bus we have two choices continue the death spiral or use October 7th as a catalyst for change I think this the Arabs are going to demand some form of two-state solution to recognize Israel I think Israel is going to demand security buffers different than before and they need to make those demands I don't know how this ends but I'll tell you this if we don't get this right this time we're talking about another generation of just tip for de death let's get more on this from shab britans our correspondent to's following events for us in Washington DC and sheab it has to be said that this is a bit of a departure in terms of sort of Republican talking points isn't it and it's quite instructive to look at how Graham got to this departure this tough love saying oh look you know we we we support you but this may not be popular but you know you have to accept a two-state solution cuz actually that interaction on that program began with a question of is Israel doing enough to limit civilian deaths though sen Senator and you could see I was watching Graham kind of gulp because clearly there is no justification for what's going on in Gaza and he said I would hope they could do more but then he did what everyone in the Biden Administration is doing too he immediately then says but let's talk about the day after this pivot to the Future the day after don't talk about today because of course everything that's being done today is being done with American Support American green light American weapons so let's talk about the future and that's where then there's that element of criticism partly because Netanyahu himself has completely destroyed the narrative edifice of the American foreign policy establishment here by saying no we never were interested in giving the Palestinians a two-state solution we were never going to do that I never wanted to do that and of course this is what the Palestinians have been saying for ages this is what impartial observers have been saying for ages that the narrative oh Clinton that Camp David you know Arafat walked away blah it was all complete nonsense and it's all being admitted now so so they're scrambling that foreign policy establishment is is scrambling so they're saying look you see we are being critical about Israel here we're saying look you should at least get a two-state solution sometime in the future this doesn't mean that they're not going to continue to unconditionally support Israel but in the same way that Biden last week was saying look this is about PR it's about public opinion and if you you seen as too intransigent you're going to lose public opinion that's the main issue for senators like lindsy Graham and for presidents like Biden she brany there for us with the latest thanks very much
