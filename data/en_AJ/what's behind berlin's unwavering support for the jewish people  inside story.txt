Germany denies supplying Israel with weapons of war yet it's one of the staunchest supporters of Israel's war on Gaza what's behind Germany's position and what are the long-term consequences for its diplomacy in the Middle East this is Inside [Music] Story hello there and welcome to the program I'm Laura Kyle 80 years after the Holocaust Germany is accused of being complicit in Israeli genocide in Gaza Nicaragua wants the international court of justice to order Berlin to stop military exports to Israel German lawyers have rejected the case as baseless and biased they say Berlin is a fierce advocate for international humanitarian law but at the same time for years Germany has declared the security of the state of Israel is at its core of a foreign policy it's very rais in debt that's World opinion turns against Israel's brutal war on Gaza where does that leave Berlin's unwavering support for the Jewish people we'll discuss all this with our panel of guests in just a moment but first this report from Alexandra bers when Germany appeared before the un's top Court accused of facilitating Israeli genocide in Gaza its defense Drew squarely on National History it had learned from its past lawyers argued it had learned from the Holocaust Germany is doing its utmost to live up to its responsibility Isa both the Israeli and the Palestinian people this explains one of the principles upon which our foreign policy with regard to all Middle East issues rests our history is the reason why Israel's security has been at the core of German foreign policy the need to atone for the killing of 6 million Jews during the second world war has made supporting Israel a historic Duty for Berlin it's even described as a reason for existence at this moment Germany has only one place and that is alongside Israel this is what we mean when we say the security of Israel is Germany's res [Applause] on own history our responsibility stemming from the Holocaust makes it our Everlasting duty to stand up for the Existence and the safety of the state of Israel Schulz was the first foreign head of state to visit Israel after the October 7th attacks by Hamas Germany is the second largest armed supplier to Israel after the United States it's abstained from multiple un votes calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and intervened in defense of Israel against South Africa's charges of genocide at the hag but the mounting death toll in Gaza has put Germany Under Pressure forcing it to question its unwavering support on recent visits to Israel the foreign minister noted the survival of Palestinians is just as important as Israel's National securitya the humanitarian situation in Gaza is Hell the fact that we're stuck in this dilemma must not come at the expense of gaza's hungry civilian population within Germany police have clamped down on protests in support of Palestine and the country officially defines any appearance of hatred towards Israel as anti-Semitism free but opinion polls conducted by public broadcasters in March suggest nearly 70% of Germans believe Israel's military actions in Gaza are not justified up from 50% just a few weeks before Alexandra buers Al jazer for Inside Story well let's bring in our guests now and joining us from Berlin is tobas Baker a member of the German Parliament for Alliance 90 the greens and a political scientist in Washington DC is John cner an author and journalist who's a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute and in the German city of stutgart is sh he director of The Alliance For Justice between Israelis and and Palestinians he tracks the arms trade between Germany and Israel a very warm welcome to all of you Tobias let's start with you what's your response uh as a member of the German government to Nicaragua's accusation at the international court of justice that Germany is complicit in the genocide of Palestinians well um as a member of parliament I of course argue that we have to take any accusations that is uh brought up in front of the international court of justice in front of the icj uh quite serious but when it comes to to the details uh I do argue as well that um most of what's been brought up um I would rather say is probably based on on a misunderstanding um and uh that this does not really hold the accusations um and I think the the the the presentation by our government yesterday yesterday in the court U made clear that we are taking our responsibility in terms of humanitarian assistance very serious um but also our um well well when it comes to to how we control arm exports Etc that this is uh very well controlled um but still of course you need to take it serious it is after all a a hze in front of the icj um but I am pretty much uh sure that um there there is a clear path where this is going to go if I could just dig into that a little bit to B what exactly was misunderstood I I think mainly when it comes to the humanitarian Aid and the uh which is often perceived and and our reaction to to the the the facts or the the Israelis brought up that certain members of unur were involved in the terroristic attacks of the 7th of October and uh after that we decided that there is not not going to be any new funding for unra from Germany but that still means that everything that we promised was delivered and we are still one of the biggest if not the biggest donors of unra and I think this is uh very important to understand that of course we are taking those accusations very serious in Germany but we still stick to our humanitarian uh or to the humanitarian cost we are still um well delivered everything promised to unra and we're still funding a lot of humanitarian Aid throughout other organizations okay I'll get on to the weapons aspect with Shar in just a moment first of all John let's just uh look at the aid aspect so Germany a strong part of Germany's defense seemed to be that because they do give a huge amount of Aid to Palestinians it it kind of condones the support towards Israel well I mean the first thing to say is um that yes it is needs to be taken very seriously I think it's just a matter of regret that Germany is being brought to a court by a country Nicaragua whose leader Daniel Ortega is probably one of the worst violators of human rights of any um leader uh that won't necessarily affect the way the court looks at it anybody is able to bring a case South Africa brought a case against Israel a month or two ago and we're going to see more and more of that as the glob south or middle ground states are becoming more assertive which is absolutely their right it is absolutely true that Germany does give and and always has given um a considerable amount of Aid to uh Palestinians in Gaza in the West Bank um that said that does not in any way minimize the question of German's problems Germany's problems now with Israel I was I was writing a piece for The Guardian newspaper only last Friday I split my time between Germany and and elsewhere and I have been really quite struck and depressed by the inability of public Germany to find a language that both reconciles theirs on the whole idea of postwar postn Germany uh regarding it as a fundamental plank of its existence and of the reason of state of Germany to support Israel alongside legitimate criticism of the actions of this far-right Netanyahu government and the inability the fact that Germany is and the German government has been so desperate to close down discussion of that suggests to me that it hasn't made the progress that I had always assumed it had in terms of coming up with an a sympathetic but objective approach to Israel Tas what what would your response be to that because there has been a lot of silencing of critics of Israel and pro Palestinian voices since the war on Gaza began in Germany well I would first of all argue that in the very first statement our foreign minister gave after the terroristic attack on the 7th of October um before she flew off to Israel um she made clear that of course Israel has the right to defend itself but within the framework of the international law that means on the base of international law it has the right to defend itself but it also gives the framework and therefore um all the responsibility Israel has to take on if it defends itself and I think this is very important of course I do understand this is nuanced and this is to a certain amount um and not what people might hope for how the suffering of the Palestinians is seen for the very first statement I would argue that was of course the response to the horrific attacks on the 7th of October and after that I would say yes it's incredibly important that we see and we talk about the inhumane suffering the Palestinians have to take on um and we have to discuss it very I don't want to say carefully but uh in a matter in a serious matter that just jump in there because it's not necessarily talking about the suffering of the Palestinians it's talking about the action of the Israelis and the German government has said that it must act within the bounds of international humanitarian law and yet it's not why is it not um I mean the the the German government is supplying Aid to the Palestinians and I would argue that is definitely within humanitarian international law um on the other hand most of the weapon deliveries since the 7th of October the vast majority of it were were part of of testing of training or industrial industrial cooperation so of course I do understand that that we have delivered weapons uh in the past to Israel um to defend itself and of course I do also see that um and I think that and I mean that is another case in front of the icj if there and it is up to the icj to decide decide that if the use in this war of force of military uh equipment is in the frame of international law and of course this ruling of the icj in this other case is incredibly important okay well let's look let's look at those weapons um that was a crucial part of the icj case against Germany so let's just have a listen to what the defense argument was when it said that the weapons that Germany sent to Israel were not lethal if we look at what has actually been licensed for export to Israel under this framework since October 2023 we see no artillery shells no Munitions nearly all experts exports involve what is known as other military equipment typically of a subordinate or defensive nature as a matter of fact only four weapons War weapons have been licensed for export since October 2023 three of which concern test or practice equipment sh let's bring you into the discussion at this point because you have contributed to a lengthy report on Germany's weapons export to Israel so do you agree with the core of this defense that Germany made yesterday in court absolutely not it is unfortunately very disingenuous this defense by Germany at the court claimed that the vast majority of weapons H were not weapons of war but this is an internal definition that the German government has developed in order to whitewash very deadly weapons that are being sold and uh those weapons which are defined as weapons of war where they claim are mostly weapons for training in fact we have evidence from the Israeli military that they've used ammunition and propellant which are designated for training in order to kill people in Gaza H we know that the ship the warships that Germany has sold to Israel are used to bomb the Gaza Strip This is under no circumstances considered to be self-defense because Israel does not have the right to defend itself in occupied territory and does not have the right to use artillery against unarmed civilians this is a a war crime as well as a part of what accumulates to the crime of genocide and therefore it is completely illegal what Germany's doing these weapons I should say about these warships Mr B did mentioned that they were sold before H nevertheless the last of those warships it's called s six has been delivered to Israel after October 7 when already it was clear that Israel is committing a genocide and in this defense that we've seen by by Germany in the court we've seen first of all that they have ignored the most important statement by by the lawyers of nicaragu which they said quite at the beginning the German a reason of state to stand by the side of Israel does not signify that Israel has a right to represent all the Jewish people H so what we are really seeing here is a very um cynical abuse of the memory of the Holocaust in order to profit from an arms trade and we've seen so many so much evidence of German uh deadly weapons whether they call them weapons of war or not H being used to kill Palestinians in the Gaza Strip to kill civilians as Act of Revenge as Act of genocide and it's simply not convincing that the German government is not fully aware of this the information is out in the open out in public let's just give toas Tas a chance to respond there first of all just pick up on sher's last point was the German government fully aware of what was being sent to Israel and used in Gaza I cannot answer that um of course we're tracking what or usually we're tracking what's happening with the weapons whether they are um applied in in the framework that is agreed on um but uh this is uh confidential information and and of course I cannot um I I actually don't know how much that's been the case in in in this in this um weapon delivery cases whether we already have those information um whether we have the reports and of course certain reports are public um but of course they need to be confirmed to um well violate or step out of greed um um um contracts so okay but it's fair to assume isn't it that ammunition being given to Israel is being used to kill people in the Gaza Strip as I said um my information is that all um as and this of course agrees with what was presented yesterday in the court is that most of the the vast majority of what has been delivered was for training purpose if this is um applied differently of course that needs to be looked at but there is no um no no sure sure um information about that U that we can act on at the moment okay I mean as none of us here are lawyers let's U move away from the the detailed nuances of that case yesterday and look at the situation in Germany more broadly John I want to bring you in and pick up on something sh said that this support wholesale support of Israel especially now the whole government of Israel in its war on Gaza Sher has called it a cynical abuse of the memory of the Holocaust what do you say to that I sort of there's a German word which is Y which means yes and no I half agree with that in the inability I do not see it as a cynical abuse I see it as an inab ability to understand and in some ways going off on on a slightly different tangent the memories of the war have also in my view uh confuse Germany when it comes to defending Ukraine against Russia the sense of never against War um which it was a false conclusion from the second world war rather than you defend democracy so Germany in one respect has been too cautious uh in my view when it comes to Ukraine and has Le learned the wrong lessons and as with regards to Israel it is a fundamental tenant of I mean it is obvious that Germany is always going to have a different relationship to Israel than other countries because of its history that said it cannot be seen to be this swamping envelope that precludes that prevents discussions about what the Israeli government is doing and the Netanyahu government and this particular government which is propped up by the far right would be considered a rogue government were it not Israel it is an extreme government represented by somebody like Netanyahu who absolutely belongs to the altright hard right type of leader that sadly is becoming all too prevalent around the world and yet Germany doesn't appear to have the emotional oxygen if that isn't a mixed metaphor to to understand how to deal with this government you have even now Joe Biden being uh pretty critical although some regard that is as cynical because he is he is still supplying Israel with with weapons you have the Brits and it's foreign secretary David Cameron being quite at least rhetorically tough on Israel the French are too the Germans are pretty much and I take the point that beach the foreign minister has said more but ultimately it comes down to Olaf Schultz and there's nothing coming out of the chancellory that gives any indication that this German government is anything but Paralyzed by fear of criticizing Israel tobas there there is a difference isn't there between supporting Jews supporting Israel and supporting this particular government in Israel because it's not a government that upholds many of the Germans values particularly D said the the values of the green party your party got a prime minister facing corruption trials trying to overhaul the Supreme Court extreme rightwing members of the government so how does it reconcile how do you reconcile your wholesale support it um I mean first of all we are supporting the Israel the the state state of Israel um and and the right to exist of Israel that's the the um and I think this is very important not only if you watch the debate within the last few weeks but also I would really say within the first within the last few months I would agree that there has been a period of shock of shock of the 7th of October and I think this has been particularly big in Germany because it was after all all the day the most Jews have been killed since the Holocaust and I think that had an impact on our Memorial culture and many many people in Germany but after the first uh shock about that I would argue that there has been a lot of debate around the Israeli government um and within the last few weeks we've been seeing that um that that of course not only the fact that it's a right-wing government but also the question how they're fighting uh that war and the problems with how they're fighting that war is being discussed um more and more of course also in in in circles where I argue that have been uh more opposed to the idea that this uh is a problem problematic approach but I think it's very important on the other hand of course we're still having a debate around how much um criticism of this government or not not how much criticism that's the wrong way to put it I would rather say what kind of words to use to criticize that government and I think there is a of course very um nuanced approach on um um what is perceived uh or what actually is anti-Semitic and I think there we have a very strong debate around um and and I do understand that this uncertain from from from a certain perspective uh seems as if we would not discuss uh about how what's actually happening on the ground as if we would not discuss about What's happen Gaza jump in because we are we are running slightly out of time we haven't heard much from sh and sure I apologize for that but just listening to the way Tobias is speaking he's choosing his words so carefully and I understand that this is a very complex subject within Germany but is it to the point now where Germany's tied itself up in knots Tobias does say uh that there is a lot of debate around the Israeli government and support for it or criticism for it or words criticizing it is there are you feeling that people are allowed to say what they feel no absolutely not there is a culture of censorship H people are being cancelled every day in Germany and journalists University professors are simply not allowed to to speak their mind including Jewish activist Jewish Scholars are also silenced every day if they dare to support Palestinian rights I think that what Mr belel referred to in terms of ger German's cult memory culture of memory has completely failed because Germany was supposed to be the first country in the world to recognize the warning signs hunger Mass starvation being used as a weapon of War dehumanizing an entire group of people these are the signs of genocide but apparently instead we hear from him when he says we don't know we'll need to look into it so basically to say uh all of this information which is out in the open reported here on Al Jaz is simply not known to the German government because they choose to close their eyes and it is his party the green party not ol of Schultz H which has established a special Committee in order to facilitate more arms exports to Israel after October 7 and so this it was the the responsibility of this committee to examine whether how these weapons are being used and in fact it's the Minister of Foreign Affairs of his party an belok who consistently opposed a ceasefire and blocked attempts to promote ceasefire whether on the UN or the EU level and promoted more Bloodshed this is I am very conscious that we are running out of time and I can see Tobias wanting to jump in there just to respond I I first first of all I think we need to establish that there's still well more than 100 people uh being taken hostage and of course they need to be freed to have a permanent solution on this War I mean this is what all the negotiations are about but after all the humanitarian pause a fire pause was always or not always but pushed for for many many months by above all analina beok and I think the other point is very important to understand that there is a problem what's happening on the ground does not make us complicit and I think we are addressing that there needs to be more humanitarian Aid to get into Gaza that Israel has a responsibility on the occupied territories to well solve the humanitarian crisis I think this is very very important but what I'm saying what I was saying before what we don't know is regarding the firearms and the weapons we delivered our information is that this was on a vast majority for training or industrial purpose okay that sadly we have run out of time we do have to wrap up our discussion even though it could go on for a lot longer I do appreciate you all taking the time to join us tobas B John cner and Sh he thank you very much and
