meanwhile the White House says there's a framework agreement on the table for a six-week ceasefire in Gaza Israel has not turned it down well now the wait is on for Hamas to agree talks are ongoing here in Doha with parties hoping to have a deal in place by Ramadan in around a week's time well rosin Jordan joins us live now from Washington DC uh rosin sir talk us through what we've heard from us officials then us officials briefed the reporters here in Washington earlier on Saturday to say that uh they have a framework in place for a six- week pause or ceasefire in the war on Gaza according to these us officials the Israeli government has more or less signed off on the deal and now everyone is waiting to hear from the leadership of Hamas on whether it will meet its uh obligations under the deal namely to release a number of captives held in Gaza who belong to one four categories the elderly women the sick and the injured now so far there has not been any response from Hamas but us officials said that uh they were continuing negotiations not just in Doha but with a Partners in the region in order to try to make this framework which they're now calling the first phase or phase a to uh get to the next step which would be one step closer to an end to the the war in Gaza yeah Ros and just a few days ago President Biden seemed to be rowing back on the prospect of an imminent deal but now it appears a deal is back on the table well that's because you saw a renewed burst of diplomacy of highlevel diplomacy after Thursday's incident in Rafa in which Israeli troops fired on civilians who were greeting a convoy truck that was bringing humanitarian Aid the Israelis claim that they felt threatened by some in the group those on the ground say that the Israelis simply opened fire without justification there are investigations underway but because of that incident us officials were very worried about having this negotiated uh six- week ceasefire fall apart after weeks of negotiations between Doha and Paris and Cairo and so the renewed sense of optimism if we can call it that is because officials on Saturday here in Washington believe that there is still this commitment to try to get this um the ceasefire in place before the start of Ramadan and Ross just a final thought to you we're hearing that Israeli War cabinet minister Benny gance uh is due to travel to Washington to hold talks uh with vice president KLA Harris what more do we know about this well there are numerous uh news reports here in Washington suggesting not only that Mr Gat will be in Washington for in the early part of the coming week but that he is supposedly going to meet with the vice president kamla Harris as well as with the National Security adviser Jake Sullivan on Monday according to these reports the two US officials are talking everything Gaza with Benny Gant they're talking about the need to increase dramatically the amount of humanitarian Aid to the Palestinian people living inside Gaza efforts to try to engage in some sort of prisoner swap undering that uh six week ceasefire and trying to actually get to a point where you can get one step closer not just to ending this war but to trying to set up the framework for the eventual establishment of a separate Palestinian State there is a lot there and it is noteworthy that Benny gatz reportedly is making this trip without the uh support or permission of the Prime Minister Benjamin net so it'll be very interesting to see once all of these reported meetings take place to see what that impact is on the ongoing efforts to set up this framework for a six-week ceasefire all right Ros Jordan live for us there in Washington DC Ros thank you Al jaz's ber of Smith is in rala in the occupied West Bank and he has further reaction to the prospect of a deal this looks like the US is increasing the pressure on Hamas to agree the broad terms of this six week ceasefire deal Hamas says it will deliver its official answer in Cairo on Sunday that's when mediators from the US katar and Egypt are expected to meet again according to Egyptian media and where teams from Hamas and Israel are expected to turn up it's by no means clear that Hamas is going to accept this deal deal though they have previously insisted on a full permanent ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza demands that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called delusional Netanyahu has said he's not going to send anyone to Cairo these are reports from Israeli media until Hamas gives up a list of all the hostages that are still alive and again we heard earlier from Hamas that they are not prepared to do this so both sides on the face of it seem still to be far apart Bernard Smith Al jazer rala in the occupied West Bank
