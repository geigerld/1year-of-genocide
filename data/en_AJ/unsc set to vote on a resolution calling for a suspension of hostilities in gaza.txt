the United Nations Security Council is holding an open session on the war on Gaza they're expected to vote on a resolution calling for a suspension of hostilities later on Tuesday meanwhile the special coordinator for the Middle East peace process has given an update to the security Council ahead of that vote he says he is alarmed by growing violence against Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank I remain Gravely concerned by the impact of the ongoing hostilities on the humanitarian situation in Gaza the current conditions are making it impossible for Meaningful humanitarian operations to be conducted I'm also deeply concerned by escalating tensions in the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem intensified armed exchanges between Palestinians and Israeli Security Forces predominantly in the context of Israeli operations have led to exceedingly high levels of fatalities and arrests I read itate that security forces must exercise maximum restraints and use lethal Force only when it's strictly unavoidable unavoidable to protect life let's bring in our correspondent Gabriel alzando he's joining us live from the UN headquarters in New York and there is some hope for this vote is in their Gabe which is due in the coming hours that's right there is some hope that this could possibly be a resolution that is accepted by everybody on the council and that it could perhaps uh alleviate some of the suffering in Gaza and get more humanitarian Aid in that's sort of the big picture here but this vote has been delayed it's a little after 100 p.m. here local time in New York about 1:20 to be exact we thought this vote was going to happen at 10:00 a.m. then we thought we heard that it was delayed to 11: then 12:30 now we're heing it could be as late as 400 p.m. local time or even 5:00 p.m. why the reason is and the answer is because there are still negotiations taking place behind closed doors at this very hour according to sources that Dair has been speaking to because this is such a critical resolution and the wording in it is so sensitive particularly number one is this is a humanitarian resolution that is the focus of it uh by the UAE that was the main uh drafter The Who wrote up this draft resolution and are the main sponsors of it but there's issues about uh uh uh how to stop the bombardment if you will and the first draft said that it called for an urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities to allow for humanitarian Aid that's something that the US probably would not go for so they've changed the wording to the Urgent suspension of hostilities to allow for unhindered humanitarian access and for Urgent steps towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities key words there essentially the US would not vote for anything we believe that would uh uh stop permanently uh Israel's ability to conduct their military operations in Gaza and so that is why the UAE and others on the council are trying to find some wording that would be a suspension of hostilities to get the US on board all right Gabe so a lot writing on the wording of this resolution what else is significant in it yeah there's a lot it's it's a pretty hefty resolution there there's a lot in it and a couple other things to point out is number one is the council is is saying that uh if this is voted on it goes forward and passes uh they want a a un Le monitoring mechanism in terms of the aid again this is a resolution really focused on ramping up or scaling up the aid either by land sea or air in Gaza they want a monitoring mechanism of some sort to see how that Aid is getting in facilitate that Aid getting in and then uh monitor its dispersal in gasa presumably to make it go faster and the other issue as well is also in here they say that uh this resolution says that they want to have a uh UniFi Gaza with the West Bank under the authority of the Palestinian under the authority of the Palestinian Authority after this conflict is over that's very an interesting an interesting part of this resolution as well left unset is is that with Hamas part of Hamas are they assuming that Hamas will no longer be part of the equation after this conflict is over I don't know but clearly they put that in uh the resolution uh that uh after the conflict is over they expect the the the West Bank in Gaza to be unified under Palestinian Authority control thank you very much Gabriel aland with the latest live at the UN in New York
