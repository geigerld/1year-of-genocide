okay we have Al jaz's White House correspondent Kimberly haa joining us so what more did we hear from Joe Biden in the last hour and is there any indication how this assassination of hania's family members will be seen in the US Kimberly well what we know is that the US president didn't answer a key part of the question that was posed to him in that answer that was played just a moment ago and that is whether he would limit military aid to Israel and so that is uh one of the big question marks in the United States right now there is growing pressure on the US president to do so and with these killings of the uh CH the children and grandchildren of the Hamas political leader uh there may be even more uh pressure on the president to do so the Israeli Prime Minister is not only UN poopular in Israel but he is increasingly unpopular in the United States and uh the the three billion in exess annually it's nearly four billion that is given by the US Congress is increasingly being questioned in the United States whether or not us taxpayers believe that uh the US can afford it or if they want to be responsible for the 33,000 Palestinians in excess that have been killed uh by uh us bombs so uh that is one factor but the other factor in all of this that is the concern and for the United States is the captives in the negotiations that are so very fragile and as we heard from your previous guest there they are reviewing the proposal that has been put forward by the United States in Egypt and uh they have yet to respond and that is something that the United States is waiting for and now that may not be forthcoming as a result of the strike that has taken place and claimed those six lives and that is going to be a very very disappointing and complicating factor for the United States that had been eager to not only have the Israeli captives potentially at least named but also uh there were many that were hoping that they could uh perhaps see the uh possible return of some uh Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails and also the possible movement of some who were hoping to return to Northern Gaza so this is going to be seen in the United States as a major setback all right thank you so much Kim H thanks for that update from the White House Sultan Barakat is a professor of public policy at hammed bin Khalifa University joining us here in Qatar welcome back to Al jazer um do you think that this assassination is a major setback for the talks well it must be it's uh it's happening at the time when they were just about uh revisiting the talks that they started a few days ago and uh it does feel as if it has been specific ly done to derail it and we have we have seen overall over the last 10 days or so the moral tide turning against Netanyahu and his Coalition across the world and uh we discussed this a couple of days ago that I feel this time of the negotiation he has most to lose he has to climb down more than Hamas has to in order to reach the agreement for a ceasefire whether it's temporary or or permanent phase or all in done in one phase and and this of course will affect it uh the discussion is now going around whether we do ceasefire immediately ceasefire or we phase it over few weeks which I think Biden is calling for but to be able to face it you have to establish a minimum level of trust between the two sides and if there was any trust this is now have really demolished it um let me just put to you um something that we've heard from Israel so in the wake of this assassination of several me members of Hamas is political leader Han there's a former deputy of Chief of Staff of the Israeli Army y Golan and he's released this statement he said the killings carried out by the Israeli military however Justified and appropriate they may be point to a lack of political wisdom in regards to the timing chosen carrying out such dramatic actions on the eve of a possible deal for the release of the hostages constitutes another serious layer in their lawlessness I mean this is coming from someone who is a former uh Deputy Chief of sta staff of the Israeli Army and what do you make of the timing of this assassination and these killings I mean I we agree with I mean we agree with them in terms of timing and it's totally unjustified you cannot justify it because these three children were not really part of the military wing of Hamas they're considered as civilians the timing the symbolic uh the symbolism of killing them on Aden futter on their first visit to their family is terrible and I think it will have a lot of impact throughout the Muslim world but uh in in general I think the uh the way you look at it the Israelis can claim that this has been part of a list that they pre-prepared H which is related to their use of artificial intelligence you know this lavender system that they have where they pre-identify targets and then depending on calculations the system just goes and they all have received uh pre-approval of killing and this is why we see the huge casualty in in Gaza but uh but looking at it carefully it looks more like the Central Kitchen assassination it is calculated and I'm sure there has been a human approval uh element in it because of the way it's been targeted this is not targeting a building or compound uh this is a moving Target and there may be even have come from the top it would have it must be I mean this kind of assassination does not happen randomly uh also because of um the timing that when it happened the fact that they have they would have seen seen the three children in the car if they've seen if they identified positively the three young men they would have identified the grandchildren as well so for that I think someone must have taken the decision to to go ahead and um we heard President Biden he was speaking at the White House just a short time ago and in the past 24 hours what he's done he's it seems to be that he's sharpened his criticism towards Netanyahu saying that Netanyahu is making a mistake in Gaza is this this development going to uh sort of strain that relationship a little bit more to some extent but the real frustration I think within the Biden Administration is the is the fact that Netanyahu by extending this war to six months now has really taken them taken them off the ball in relation to their real strategic objectives their strategic objectives are to beit towards southeast Asia uh dealing with China as a major threat this is the sort of thing that he was doing ear today with Japan and North Korea Korea this is what Biden came in office to resolve and uh his very um Doctrine at the very beginning was to withdraw from the Middle East as he did withdraw from Afghanistan and to concentrate pretty much on China and Russia by taking him dragging him into this conflict for more than six months he must have overburdened him I mean the man must feel absolutely fed up that this is not going to go anywhere anytime soon he's approaching an election he's not dealing with the obje that brought him to power in the first place and that must build a lot of frustration now this incident is going to must add to it because I suspect and I'm sure as we heard area from the Hamas representative it will have an impact on the negotiations if not uh sort of delay it all for a few weeks at least for a few days okay Sultan Baraka thank you so much for that thank make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
