David D Ro is professor at the National Defense University joins us here in the studio great to have you with us we just saw the the Iranian foreign minister addressing the UN we're now hearing that there's going to be restrictions placed by the US on his delegation in New York that with the other sanctions that have recently just been placed on Iran what sort of impact are they going to have minimal um these are sort of di Minimus actions that the government can take to show they're doing things I think that when you start with the economic sanctions those are constantly being uh identified sanctionable targets and are being announced on an almost daily basis by the US government so the fact that they're being publicized a little bit more I think is is the Biden Administration trying to show people and try to show Israel's leadership that they are taking an active role the restrictions on the Iranian foreign minister um refer to his uh ability to wander around New York when he's there for un business um there is uh a case to be made there have been instance where he was speaking to reporters threatening them and their family uh in New York uh saying you know you're trembling you should be trembling I know you have family uh but generally this is viewed as sort of petty uh there have been other delegations that have been engaged in active Espionage uh I think this is more just trying to show that we're doing something short of War absolutely because we're still waiting to see what Israel is going to do it's vowed to respond it's hold numerous War cabinets meetings to try and decide on that response what do you think it's going to choose what sort of line of action is it going to choose well there's there's several uh I think it does have to respond I think that Israel cannot uh allow an attack of this magnitude which I I would argue is disproportionate uh to to be unchallenged it this can't become a normal thing for Israel any Israeli politician who agrees to that won't have a future in Israeli politics so um I think that what they will try to do is identify a Target that is closely identified with the Revolutionary guard or with the religious regime that will inflict maximum embarrassment and damage but is related somehow to this this is very hard but it could possibly be a drone Factory or missile Factory uh the uh Factory at B Air Base in Isfahan would be a good Target but it's very far inland hard to strike uh and then maybe uh some of the economic interests that the Revolutionary guard increasingly controls they control by some estimates as much as 45% of the Iranian economy so if they could find a business that is known to be owned by the Revolutionary guard that doesn't do a good job uh and Target that that would probably not give the solidification of the Iranian populace behind the regime effect that Israel's also trying to avoid it's very tricky it's very tricky so do you think Israel will be able to respond in a way that will not further escalate will not warrant a response from Iran and further escalation well we're we're talking about Pride here so rationality and the things that uh your viewers engage in that's that's not on the table so I I cannot predict what's going on I can predict that when Israel does respond they will say this is a discreet proportionate event and it's up for Iran to as to how they take that in the past um they have been able to uh you know they've suffered some embarrassment and have been able to absorb that you know by making a promise to respond at some future time but uh you know when you when you get Pride involved you get irrationality and that's when analysts like me just enter into the Dark Ages unfortunately so it's interesting another point of this is that we've got the US and Israel holding meetings on the Rafa ground Invasion the US has been very clear that it does not support a grand invasion of Rafa until perhaps recently do you sense a change in tone and is that connected to Israel holding off on escalating the situation with Iran yeah I look prior to the Iranian attack on Israel Israel was boxed in an international opinion uh the narrative was Israel and civilian casualties and suffering in Gaza now the narrative in the west at least has shifted to Israel Under Siege by Iran uh Iran in effect has pushed the suffering of Gaza off the table in most of the West and it's rehabilitated Israel uh among people in the west and in the United States who were at the verge of calling for a halt on it so I think it's a very real possibility that as a direct result of this Iranian action the United States will say okay we'll hold you know Israel will say we'll hold back on that but we have to achieve our security goals in Gaza and those security goals can't be achieved without a military occupation of Rafa for some period of time David Ros very good to speak to you thanks very much for taking the time to join us here thank
