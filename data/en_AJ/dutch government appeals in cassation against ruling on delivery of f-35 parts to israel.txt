it was seen as a test case rights organizations filed a civil suit against the Dutch State saying supplying Israel with spear parts for F35 fighter jets makes the Netherlands complicit in possible war crimes in Gaza the judge at a lower court had dismissed the case saying the court couldn't interfere in government policy decisions the appeal court had a different view exper from the experts of the UN have found that there is an incredible number of Civilian casualties thousands of children have been killed and so the violence is not proportional that's why there is a clear risk of violations of the laws of war since 2019 the Netherlands has housed the European distribution center for F35 spare parts from where it also supplies Israel in 2022 it exported spear Parts worth $2.4 million to the country with the escalation of the war in Gaza this number is now predicted to be much higher it's dependent on the F35 without any any doubt so it's it's um it's not just a small bit in this whole story it is really a main element and it will it will definitely if for now it will definitely affect uh Israeli Warfare Israel owns dozens of these us-made fighter planes it is expected they will now depend on the US to provide the necessary spare parts while this verdict will not directly impact the war on Gaza it could be seen as a precedent for other organizations in Europe to file similar cases against their governments other Nos and other countries are already preparing similar cases and we've been in contact with them but even more than that I hope it's a turning point for how Western governments look at their role and responsibility and realize that also before a judge they are co-responsible for what's happening in Gaza for the first time a court has ordered the country to stop sending weapons to Israel the verdict is seen as a severe blow to the Dutch government who had argued that stopping its contribution to the F-35 program would jeopardize its ties with the US and Israel and would have a Severus economic impact in his verdict the judged argued that political and economic interests can't be more important than the protection of Civilian lives during a war the Dutch state will now take the case to the Supreme Court but that doesn't mean can still export spear F35 parts to Israel the court has given the state one week to formally execute the verdict step fast in alzer De make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
