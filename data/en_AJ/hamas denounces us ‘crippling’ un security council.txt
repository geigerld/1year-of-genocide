we're interrupting that report to take you live to the I believe the Lebanese Capital beut where we're hearing from Hamas spokesperson Usama ham let's listen in recovery of our injured and freedom and liberation of our captives in the occupations prisons and I would like to say that the sacrifices of our people have put us all in a path towards One Direction leading to victory in this battle leading to the desired Freedom by Allah's Grace despite the pain and the scale of Destruction killing and the Nazi brutality committed by the occupation in the Gaza Strip with the American monies and weapons as more than 19,000 people have been killed and the injured amounted to 52,000 however our people could continue unwavering their their epic Saga standing fast and sacrificing foiling all the occupations uh aggressive plans these unwavering people who have never known breaking down and they have never known they would never know surrender nor retreat in their extended struggle they will not to stop except with Victory with Allah's blessings and these are images of the steadfastness and fortitude of our women and children I just want to send a message to Netanyahu all my children are for my land for my country do you think by killing these children he has achieved anything he hasn't achieved anything we will rise from under the rubble this is our military we will never be defeated these people who are [Music] talking are paying with the lives of their children whom their fathers and mothers are being killed and massacred Before Their Eyes they are experiencing the Zionist War Machine funded by the Americans killing all their beloved ones our Palestinian people who paid with their blood after every Bloodshed and after all these sacrifices our people realize the fact that there is no retreat no turning back our path leads only to one point which is victory in this battle and securing Liberation and freedom and a dignified life for these people and establishing our fully Sovereign uh state with Jerusalem as its capital the aggression has lost its balance and they are not thinking no more of the security and safety of their soldiers in Gaza stri and they care no more for their captives and all they are focused on is the political security of the uh War cabinet this this trial of evil are Leading the People to an unknown and uncertainty dreaming of of dreams and objectives that will never be achieved on Gaza their dreams will break on the Hard Rock of our Valor this criminal this this criminal um enemy doesn't care about the lives of their soldiers their soldiers arrive to their homes either killed in bags or injured or traumatized in the future hours what alasam will reveal about the events of the last few hours this failed trial doesn't care about the lives of the captives with their resistance as they continue their barbaric bombardment against the people in Gaza um our message to the families of these captives is loud and clear your crisis is with Netanyahu and the his War cabinet with his continued aggression impedes the release of captives and he is responsible for that if you want them to go home back then you should make Netanyahu understand that resistance will not break and we tell only the truth and this defeated Army in in their in their latest attempts to depict and mimic and copy copy the resistance as they shoot at walls and they declare victory in an abandoned tunnel after it has been used once only the day that the resistance has uh defeated this occupation and they show only footages and recordings that has no military value whatsoever we would like to emphasize here that bid's Administration is a partner in the war against Gaza and they they suspend the ability and impede the ability of the entry of a to Gaza this Administration has crippled the uh Security Council and they are negotiating the resolution that calls for stopping the aggression and allowing Aid to the Palestinian people this Administration with their veto and suspending this resolution will continue to be a partner into the genocide committed by the cubation against the civilians in Gaza STP unless this Administration doesn't start stopping this aggression and stop their supply of weapons uh they will be held completely responsible ethically and legally for all crimes committed in Gaza this administrations continued to repeating their call to the occupation of protecting civilians from harm and enabling it to Gaza is just a media propaganda and a media stunt with no meaning whatsoever trying to absorve the anger of the people and the world in light of their full support to this Nazi occupation in a genocide and systemic and systemic um war crimes and here we say loud and clearly to Biden and his administration you are Partners in the crime your hands are blooded with the Bloods of women and children in Gaza and these this blood will be a curse that will will daunt you forever you're adopting the occupations lies on propaganda will not succeed in changing facts on the ground and facts of History it's a fasy occupation that has committed and continues to commit massacr against unarmed people for more than 70 years making you Partners in this Nazi crime we notice with the Valor and fortitude of our people that the Invaders have no our way but to intensify their their massacr and bombardment against our people with and the British also have joined the wagon today in the morning the occupation Army has released a recording of the destruction of 56 civilian buildings in a Shaya in Gaza Strip This is the footage of bombarding such buildings accompanied by comments by an officer of a brigade it says farewell to a and victory starts from here that's what he said here starts Victory according to your delusion from here your defeat will start before the eyes of the entire world this a crime and many others will always be a stigma uh for on all these supporters of this entity this recording is is an important documentation for the war crime committed by the occupation we call upon the the he to prosecute the perpetrators of this crime and their military as well as political leaderships and here we stress the historic and legal responsib on the shoulder of the International Organization for the Red Cross and the Ona which we are wondering why are why are they unable to save the people taking refuge in the honor schools caring for them and protecting the hospitals and Health Care Centers from the occupations targeting we call upon the Ona and the wh to overcome all the hindrances of the occupation they trying to impose in the International Community and carry out their duties of saving and protecting civilians in their shelters especially in the northern Gaza Parts which is lacking the basic pillars and fundamentals of Life Food Water medicine and massacres are committed all the time and here we would like to shed light on the captives that have been kidnapped by the Israeli Nazi army from the Gaza Strip they kidnapped them from the the shelters from hospitals and from schools claiming that they are from alasam and this Nazi military have subjected them what they have learned from the experiences of the US Secretary of Defense as they have stripped them of their clothes and covered their eyes taking them to um a Detention Center at B these captives and kidnapped remained in shackles denied water food and sleep kept in cages in open air no one knows anything about their faith these are statements made by some of them who have been released recently in addition to that the occupation is committing a he crime when they invade the houses of civilians as they kill people in the streets before the eyes of their family members including women and children then they don't commit only the crime but they commit it before the eyes of eyewitnesses challenging the entire world about that we would like to confirm the following this NY military with their behavior they confirm the fact that they are a gang and a rogue militia with no humanity and no ethical values kidnapping people from shelters these Zionist Crimes by arresting unarmed civilians subjecting them to to torture are crimes Sim similar to crimes committed in Guantanamo and the infamous abug gra as if it's the only experience shared with the American Army to the Israeli Army destruction mistreatment and and violating human rights we we hold the Israeli occupation responsibility for the life of all these captives and we say that non-disclosing their fate it means a decision to kill them and make them disappear and hiding such a crime hereby we call upon all humanitarian organizations for immediate action to expose the crimes of this occupation and their heinous violations criminalizing their crimes and actions against our people need to reveal where they are kept and to pressure on the occupation to release these people immediately and subject such criminals to the uh tribunes for war crimes here we would like to value the the brave St of our brothers in Yemen an and the Armed Forces as they are preventing Zionist ships from passing for the war they are waging against against our people and we consider that the US declaration of forming a a n Coalition is insistence and persistance by Biden and his administration to continue killing our people and using starvation preventing our people from medicine and supplies this president in light of his defending the Zionist entity is oblivious to the insistance of our people and all the free of the world not to support Palestine Gaza and the resistance and ignores the fact that his behavior will not deter supporting Palestine and its resistance such Behavior exposes his true color which doesn't Rec recogniz human rights doesn't recognize human dignity when the when the enemy is isra and supporting and this pushes us to continue more with our resistance who we call upon we call upon all the countries contributing to such Force to reconsider their decision which is which is an exposed abetment and and this is a constitutes contribution to the crimes committed against our people in Gaza the American Administration the sponsor of such Al Alliance and all the contributing countries must realize that the root cause of the problem is the existence of the occupation and on our land and they all are responsible to stop the crimes of this occupation and end it from our land rather than rather than forming an alliance that would destabilize Security in the region we would like also to express our appreciation and gratitude of the Malaysian government preventing uh Israeli ships with Israeli Flags um from ducking from their ports and prevent any ship headed or to isra from loading any any cargo from Malaysian ports and we are grateful for such a stand and from and from here we would like to call upon Arab and Muslim countries to follow suit and follow similar steps in support of our people so in support of our people in G who are defending their freedom and Independence and a manifestation of respecting International order we also would like to call upon call upon um labor unions uh from all around the world to refuse dealing with all Israeli ships and refuse to load them with any Goods or Supply them with any fuel or food in usion we pray to Allah Almighty to Bless The Souls of our Martyrs and kill people and we pray for the speedy recovery of our sick and injured and we pray for a soon Victory and Allah will shall Prevail however many people do not know it is a Jihad Victory or Mom and thank you we have been listening there to Hamas spokes person assama hamdan he's speaking from the Lebanese Capital Beirut uh about the situation in Gaza calling on the United Nations the wh the World Health Organization to do more to protect civilians who are Sheltering at their property
