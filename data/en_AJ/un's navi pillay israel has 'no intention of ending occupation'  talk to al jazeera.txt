world in May 2021 in the aftermath of Israel's 11-day bombardment of Gaza that killed 250 Palestinians the un independent International Commission of inquiry on the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel was established its mandate to investigate all alleged violations of international humanitarian law establish the underlying causes of recurrent tensions document and verify the evidence and identify those responsible the woman leading the inquiry is former un High Commissioner for human rights Navi pil weeks before Hamas carried out its October the 7th surprise offensive in southern Israel and Israel launched a major military operation in Gaza P released a report it says the commission finds the increasingly militarized law enforcement operations of Israel and repeated attacks by Israel on Gaza are aimed at maintaining its unlawful 56-year occupation with the latest escalation now in its third week nav pil talks to Al jazer Na P thank you for talking to Al jazer let's just start at the beginning about what your commission is you are a distinguished judge but this isn't a court this is an investigating uh mechanism my understanding is is it was set up in uh 2021 immediately after the fourth Gaza War I assume the Human Rights Council who set this up wanted to avoid another Gaza war and yet we now have a fifth Gaza War which is bloodier than any of the conflicts in the past yeah thank you very much for this opportunity James thank you for your program um this is a uh it's obviously not a court of law but all commissions do follow some of the precepts of a Judicial inquiry and that is respecting Independence impartiality carefully weighing the evidence so it's much uh more secure than uh you know press statements issued by institutions and so on so that's the beauty of Commission of inquiry they do investigate they produce reports they make recommendations which is what we have done now in this particular commission has a very wide mandate firstly it's not time bound it's almost permanent and that's one of the reasons why some States including the United States and Europe did not support the establishment of this commission that it doesn't have an end date to which I have said said well the occupation doesn't have an end date either and you tend to support that occupation um the other aspects of the Mandate are that we have an investigative mandate we can uh identify suspects key perpetrators work with judicial institutions such as the international court of justice and uh as I said already to make recommendations uh to look into to um the root causes of the conflict that's a very important mandate that has not been done before above all we have a territorial jurisdiction that does not apply to any other commission and that is we have jurisdiction over in inside Israel Palestine the West Bank and Gaza so that's a a wide jurisdiction and that's why we can cover new and emerging issues such as the events that are happening now yes I I agree with you that clearly uh Palestine that moved for this commission had in mind that once and for all they could attend to crucial questions such as the observance of international law the end of the occupation and other matters that are crucial to end the conflict to achieve peace in in the Middle East and I imagine that that's why they they want Ed this Commission of inquiry and you're quite right then it we were all taken completely unawares by this attack that was committed by Hamas now your latest report doesn't cover the events after uh October the 7th uh but um you obviously have um an inquiry um your your investigation can look at those in future reports let me ask you about those uh what Hass did first on on that date are those war crimes yeah firstly say let me say our current report was actually completed in August these are the UN rules it was filed here but immediately after October 7th when the uh this attack occurred and Hamas has admitted their responsibility that's why we acknowledge them as the responsible party uh we because of our extended mandate immediately dropped our own planned program of work and jumped into investigating this uh by the third day we issued a press statement condemning this attack because it harmed civilians and violated international law and we called for submissions we immediately started collecting Gathering evidence to fulfill our Mandate of achieving Justice and accountability working with Justice institutions such as the international criminal court from the evidence that we gathered it's clear to us that war crimes are being committed and now with the uh Israeli action or reaction to the Hamas attack we really find from the facts that war crimes are being committed have been committed by Hamas are being committed by Israel and that's because of the indiscriminate attack and the killings and injuries to civilians including children obviously since then we've seen a massive bombardment by Israel do you in your view consider this is legitimate self-defense or is this Collective punishment and in fact brutal Revenge from the evidence we've already gathered we are concluding that this is indiscriminate attacks against civilians very excessive and does not conform with the requisites of international law which is disproportionality and with the focus on protection of civilians and therefore we thought this cannot uh be equated with self-defense it's it am monst to Collective punishment and we know the facts of those who are dying over half of those who die are women and children so far I've heard the statistic that you know we we're not sure of any of this we in we will establish these statistics later but without verification I'm horrified at the figure of just two of the children who have been killed how can children ever be deemed to be a a threat so much so that Israel has to defend itself against these babies and children on the sixth day of the war Israel itself they said they dropped 6,000 bombs that's the same number used by the US in their battle against isil in raaka and in six days they used more bombs than the US used in Afghanistan in a single year what do you make of that I think this should shock all of us into rapid reaction I'm right here at the UN as I speak to you James and I'm appalled at the lack of uh quick decisions in the deliberations that are going on in the security Council and the general assembly these are the facts that they that should be before them to immediately demand what we have already called for in our press statement which is a cessation of hostilities not just a humanitarian pause I think I believe that's a subject matter of the discussion but a ceasefire and why we call for that is because civilians are at risk International humanitarian law and the uh Geneva conventions are being violated very seriously in front of our eyes well let me ask you about some of the other things let let me let me ask you about some of the other things that Israel has done and whether you think these are violations of international law they've cut off the water and the electricity they've only allowed limited aid supplies in and they're not allowing fuel in now fuel is needed as you know to pump the water and for desalination of the water but also for the hospitals uh the uh dialysis machines ventilators they may all have to be shut off and there's also a very disturbing report that perhaps incubators which are keeping more than a hundred uh new babies alive may also have to be shut off are these war crimes these are war crimes they are clear violations of international law and here let me take my cap off as the chair of the this commission and to speak as my lengthy judicial experience both on the Rwanda the United Nations Tribunal for Rwanda and the international criminal court so I know the way judges weigh the evidence that these facts will clearly amount to very serious war crimes they have to stop immediately the other thing that Israel has done is ordered people in Gaza City and the north to move to the south of the Gaza Strip initially they gave people only 24 hours and as you know that population includes elderly people people with children people who are in hospital who cannot move that sort of order that sort of instruction from Israel does that count as forc deportation in your view we've already thought so we're looking at that you know we reported these forced deportations forced removal dislocation of uh Palestinians in our report that we had completed in August and now we see the situation much worse when people in the north of Gaza are being ordered to move out of there I mean to move where nobody wants to receive them but the worst situation is uh we've already heard from some families that when they moved from the north to the south of Gaza they were bombed one person said his entire family has been killed uh so with uh great anxiety we've now uh adopted an attitude of Expediting our investigation as fast as we can and these latest events as I said they're not in this current report uh but the current report shows the events of the last year before what we've seen in the last few weeks and one of the things that's in this current report uh is the killing of our Al jazer colleague Shireen Abu akle now I always always try and be impartial but it's very very hard on this occasion because she was our colleague and I worked with Shireen but let me ask you about that day that she died early in the morning there was an Israeli military raid in Janine a pred Dawn raid and along with other reporters from Al jazer and other media she went to go and cover what was clearly a newsworthy event you've looked into this closely what happened then our investigation and our concl clusions that we incorporated in our report and delivered to the general assembly is now in fact a United Nation's investigation so firstly that's the beauty of the Mandate they didn't have to create a new mechanism to investigate this we have done so uh even with limited resources we were able to engage in a forensic examination we identified the Israeli Defense Force milit unit it's the do Dean uh unit and we know the commander of that unit we have his name we haven't disclosed the name as yet but we will to a Judicial institution and so we found that that was uh a direct intentional killing of uh Shireen with her and she's been deprived of her right to life if a killing is not investigated and if if not if there's no apology and compensation that at least there must be Justice and the perpetrators must be brought to account now Shireen was with other press they were clearly were they not um identifiable as members of the press also I understand sharim was shot in the head they clearly intended to kill her the as a commission we ourselves held oral hearings in Geneva and the journalist who accompanied Shireen and and he took a bullet in his arm I think he gave evidence before so we already have his evidence that there Shireen was there to report on violations as she saw them in Janine so she was there for a true journalistic uh reason and I think we the public are appalled when a journalist is attacked because that journalist was doing a service for us the public she was you at Great risk she was reporting on events so that we will be informed and that's why this her killing is causing so much grief not only to the family but to the media world and to all of us what do you make of what the isra what the Israelis said about this immediately after the killing they said it was Palestinian terrorist s firing indiscriminately and then they came out with a preliminary investigation where they said it was um hundreds of bullets from Palestinian gunmen and possibly an exchange of fire between Palestinian gunmen and Israeli security forces and then when they came up with their final report in September last year a high possibility that she was accidentally hit by Security Forces gunfire their their explanations have changed repeatedly which points clearly to her to the untruths that we are being presented with it makes us suspicious it makes us so suspicious that we find it hard to have any confidence in any explanations that Israel gives and what makes it particularly suspicious is why won't they allow an investigation they've blocked the FBI investigation but we have again and again asked to to be able to enter Israel not only to investigate this killing of Shireen but to hear from Israeli victims they have a right to tell of their experiences their suffering and particularly these recent events victims of these attacks civilian Israelis who were injured whose family members were killed they have a right to speak to us as well so therefore this is what I said at the general assembly saying to the Israeli Ambassador who was present let us in if you have nothing to hide why not let us in so we could conduct impartial investigations I'm satisfied with where we got with the limited resources there's a lot to answer for I should think that it's ready to be considered by a prosecutor of the international criminal court so you know the truth can't be hidden for long you identify the the Commando unit the DU Devan apparently also known as unit 217 being responsible um I've been reading about them they apparently carry out high-risk and complex operations including targeted killings of militants but they seem to on this occasion it's a targeted killing of a journalist um is it just the soldier who fired that round who is legally responsible or does this go up the chain of command yeah no in international law um under the Rome statute provides for command responsibility that's why we zeroed in on establishing the name of the commander we don't know the name of the soldier who actually fired the bullet but we haven't stopped our investigations we'll we'll be pursuing it it's important that we know the name of the commander but he because he probably issued the order on which the soldier who did the actual shooting uh acted he followed orders you have said that you're not allowed to go uh into Israel or the Palestinian territories they've not given you permission to go there not only that though um you've had lots of criticism of your commission of inquiry from the US who says you're B but Israel's gone even further they say that your commission of inquiry is anti-Semitic what do you make of those allegations let me first say James you know I was a High Commissioner for for it's a 4-year term I was I was only one who whose term was extended to six years yeah well Israel voted in support of the extension of my term I'm the only High Commissioner who was invited to conduct a mission inside Israel I mean nobody criticized me for bias or of being an anti-Semitic these kind of uh what I call abuse are being H since I undertook this responsibility of chearing the commission of inquiry I will continue my work in uh in the manner in which I have been accustomed to we have our own standards uh together with the other Commissioners so we will continue the abuse does not deter us uh on the other hand I could see that all these actions really to distract attention from the content of the report I would like them to look at the substance of our report and see where we've gone wrong in terms of the facts we've gathered and the law as we've interpreted it so I'm very happy that our recommendations have been adopted by the general assembly and the question of the lawfulness of the occupation and the responsibility of per of parties State members who support an unlawful occupation are spelled out by the international court of justice I do see that that will advance the peace process and not uh obstruct the peace process as our detractors claim you're not the only person who's come under attack by Israel in recent days Israel has been attacking a man you know very well the Secretary General of the United Nations Antonio Gus he said in the security Council the attack by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum Israel responded by blocking un officials including the humanitarian Chief Martin Griffith from visiting and has called on the Secretary General to resign do you see similarities in the attacks on the UN now and the attacks on your commission of inquiry I think the attacks on our commission of inquiry are mild I'm uh I'm I find that it's remarkable how much the um the critics from Israel have mounted their attacks on the Secretary General himself this has never happened before asking the Secretary General to resign when he has made a legitimate statement one country member should not be allowed to make statements such as this or to call for the withdrawal of the Secretary General I understand that the foreign minister has since watered down his statement it should never have been made in the first place the Secretary General made a legitimate statement in my view and actually we are the ones who provided the evidence of what's been going on in the past years which sets the uh factual background to why the Secretary General is quite right in saying that this attack is not uh ju just something that arose in isolation but that we must look at the context we must look at how desperate Palestinians are for some end to the conflict and the uh oppression under which they have to live daily you talk about the context in your report you refer to the broader context of the Israeli occupation which Israel has no intention of ending with your background in South Africa as the first non white female high court judge in South Africa do you think this is an apartate regime yes I I think it is I know that we've been asked to address it as a address the issue of of apartheid now in the commission we're still getting there because we think the root cause is the occupation itself apartheid is one of the uh acts of discrimination that are regularly practiced there and let me say James as a South African who born under apartheid and in the struggle uh we we were very desperate to have some kind of relief you know at the time I never thought we'll see change in our lives and it was at that time as president Mela later explained to us that at some point he had to very reluctantly resort to the principle of embarking on an armed struggle of course admittedly they didn't uh go and kill a whole lot of white people or civilians they went for strategic U um structures such as a a light pole or a oil storage these kind of things but the point I'm making is when you're back when you have a whole population oppressed for so long with no remedies no relief they are actually forced to resolve thought to Armed struggle however as a judge we do condemn indiscriminate attacks on civilians when you say that you don't think Israel wants the occupation to end you know the position of the International Community and you hear it every time there's a security council meeting from all of the main players is there needs to be a two-state solution but you seem to be hinting at something that none of them are PR prepared to say the current Israeli government doesn't want a two-state solution you know James what we see effects on the ground yeah there's hardly any territory left there's been forcible dislocation of Palestinians um an increase of settlements even against Security Council resolutions the moving in of Outsiders all of which goes against the rules of occupation actually if there are any rules uh to this and this is why we think that this occupation uh has continued for so long that Israel does not have any intention of ending it and the possibilities of a two State solution are remote directly as a result of their actions and I'm really surprised that many states particularly in Europe think that the status quo should just continue as is but to what end and this is why I am proud to serve on this commission which majority of member states have adopted in order to address the root causes of the conflict and seek remedies na P thank you for talking to ALG thank you very [Music] much
