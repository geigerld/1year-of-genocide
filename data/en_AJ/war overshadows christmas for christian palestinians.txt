while the offensive in Gaza intensifies Israeli soldiers have been raiding towns and cities in the occupied West Bank areas near Bethlehem and Janine have been targeted once again a young man was killed in the kalandia refugee camp in Northern Jerusalem and his brother arrested bulldozers have destroyed roads there Pavements and water supply lines in Janine Nita Ibrahim is live for us in Bethlehem and Nita perhaps you can give us a bit more detail on on what's been going on these on goinging raids pressure Relentless in the occupied West Bank you know as many analysts would suggest that Israel is not interested in opening another front here in the occupied West Bank people on the ground are telling you that this intensive use of uh of violence against Palestinians during these raids that never seem to be ending in different places across the occupied West Bank is only making tension Brew you know the the 25-year-old who has been killed killed in the kalandia refugee camp who is by the way the second to be killed in 24 hours in the same place in kalandia he was behind the door that the Israelis have detonated to enter inside and arrest his brother talk about the feelings of Injustice the feeling of pain amongst those families who are losing their loved ones all in all across the occupied West Bank we're talking about more than 40 Palestinians who have been arrested as a result of those raids they are intensifying but also there's something that we've been seeing happening sporadically now is becoming more of like a policy detaining family members in order to get people to hand themselves over to the Israeli forces so when they go to a house or to a city and they don't find someone they arrest their relatives and then pressuring them to hand themselves in this is the case that we're seeing across the occupied West Bank and those raids have also happened here where I am in Bethlehem you know this city around this time usually celebrates Christmas usually is festive you know but this year all Christmas celebrations have been cancelled and I want to show you a little bit from in front of the Lutheran Church here in Bethlehem where the pastor and some of the Christian families have decided to uh Mark Christmas in a different way instead of having a Christmas tree that is decorated with ornaments we're seeing baby Jesus wrapped in a cof pal inan K and is placed in a Manger under the rubble we'll talk a little bit more about that with Pastor mudis hak uh at the Lutheran Church what's the idea behind having Jesus under the rubble instead of a Christmas tree Christmas celebrations are cancelled this year in Bethlehem for obvious reasons it's impossible to celebrate when there is a massacre a genocide taking place uh in Gaz with our people and so the idea was to send a message to the world first but also to ourselves a message to the world that this is what Christmas looks like in Palestine this is what Christmas looks like in Bethlehem the birthplace of Jesus Children pull being pulled from under the rubble uh families being displaced with their homes uh destroyed uh and while the world is celebrating Christmas at the birthplace of Jesus this is what Christmas uh looks like this is usually a season for celebrations and also a season for Hope is there hope left we have hope in our faith uh we have hope uh the Christmas story actually gives us hope in the fact that Jesus was born among the occupied this is what happened 200 years ago uh and so going back to this uh manger setting uh it tells us that baby Jesus is in solidarity with those who are suffering with those who are uh oppressed so in this Christmas uh we we find our only source of Hope is is our faith uh in a just God and in our solidarity uh with one another and I hope that this message gets to the world that we are united uh in Palestine uh and sadly right now we are united uh in our pain there's so much detail going on here at building this manger can you tell me a little bit more about how you placed uh the manger in all those details yeah the the image basically came from uh what we see on our screens children being pulled out of the rubel and uh people coming and searching under the rubble to find any sign uh of Life any sign of hope these images have broken us and we wanted uh to bring them uh to the church and usually uh a typical manger would have uh baby Jesus in the middle and then the holy family uh the Shepherds and the mag surrounding him uh but this time around we we thought of uh all these characters in the baby uh in the gospel narrative in the Christmas narrative uh being around the house as if they are searching for Jesus as if they're trying to find him in the midst uh of uh of the rubble with dust uh all of all over them uh again we we want to bring the Christmas story uh make it real in our context today and I think if Jesus is to be born today he would be born under the rubble in Gaza with those who are suffering and the mag and the Shepherds would come and search for Jesus in the midst of the rubble of of a destroyed house as we see today thank you so much Pastor Mund isak of the Lutheran Church he was just telling me earlier that while the celebrations of Christmas have been cancelled the prayers will not stop and they will keep praying and hoping for peace n Abram heartbreaking stuff thanks for that
