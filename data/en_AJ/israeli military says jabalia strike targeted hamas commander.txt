cross over now to occupied East Jerusalem and speak to alzer's Alan fiser Alan so the Israelis finally confirming the attack on the jabala refugee camp that's right they've issued a statement in the the last hour or so suggesting that they were targeting Hamas Fighters they say that in the operation they killed 50 Hamas Fighters some of them senior commanders and they also damaged what they describe as significant ter IST targets above and below ground they say the tunnels there were being used to transport fighters to the beach area and they were using that to launch attacks on Israeli forces so the Israelis are now talking about what happened in jabalia but saying it was a military operation targeting Hamas Fighters and they killed 50 of them including senior commanders Alan we're getting reports that Hamas might be considering releasing more captives what is interesting is that the uh National Security adviser in Israel said that there had been discussions with various parties about possibly releasing some of the captives in the coming days and he said that Qatar had been important in those negotiations but they had realized that Hamas was not serious about freeing anyone and then in the last hour or so we've heard from alm's Brigade which of course is the military wing of Hamas that they actually do have some intention of freeing people in the coming days we inform the mediators that we will release a number of foreigners in the coming days in line with our design not to keep them in Gaza and the fact that we don't need to keep them in our custody of course over the last few days there have been a number of reports that captives were about to be released that possibly they could uh have negotiated their departure that it would be mainly those with je nationality and none of these releases have actually happened there were discussions ongoing uh on Sunday evening and apparently uh it came close to an agreement but it fell apart over details on both sides and diplomats were hoping to restart their talks so if there is a release it would appear that those talks have at least restarted and are moving in a direction which could mean the captives and there's more than 240 of them now being held in Gaza could soon be freed Alan Fisher with the latest there from occupied East Jerusalem thank you for the update
