breaking news another large Israeli air strike has occurred in Gaza near alwafa hospital this time this is moments ago the footage that was captured of that air strike this in the Gaza Strip Let's cross to tar abazo in Kan yunes inside the Gaza Strip tar what can you tell us about this strike well the Israeli occupation forces had increased uh its offensive strikes on the Gaza trip in different areas different SES in the bes territory were hit by the Israeli aircrafts uh an 8 story building in central Gaza Strip in Al jalat Street was leveled to the ground on the civilians head uh dozens of Palestinians at attack were killed and dozens others also were injured the ongoing attacks also continue to take place in jabalia refugee camp this densely populated area considered to be a a place to uh that contains more than 120,000 Palestinians were uh building one story building was destroyed uh also the the Israeli raids continued during the last hour in khuna City an air strike that took place close to the hospital led to the uh led to the killing of two Palestinians and more than 10 others were wounded till this current moment in the besiege territory okay T I want to establish some of the basic facts um where is alwafa hospital where in the Gaza Strip is it located uh generally it's located in the uh Central in the center of the Gaza Strip in a neighborhood uh this hospital is providing different kinds of treatments for thousands of Palestinians who are residing in the uh in the center of the Gaza Strip the majority of people who who really uh refused to leave the houses are receiving a treatment there meanwhile the Israeli ongoing attacks on on hospital increas around I've got a few more questions for you um alwafa hospital was still operating and still had patients right well uh it seems that it has uh been out of services due to the Israeli ongoing bombardment in this area simply because the air strikes had made more than 12 hospitals and the bes territory out of services uh due to the uh the partial and complete uh destruction of different uh sites of the hospitals okay so at the moment when it was struck which is uh a short while ago um it was already out of am I getting this right and therefore might not have had anyone or not many people inside I'm not that's what I'm trying to determine is whether there were likely people inside the hospital at that point or not meanwhile all hospitals in the gasa strip are very grounded of people who were displaced them houses people find hospitals as a safe shelter for them to be evacuated in and even to be protected meanwhile different hospitals since the early beginning of this round of fighting were targeted and others were threaten with evacuation uh some administrations of different hospitals refused the orders of evacuation meanwhile others continue to partially uh provide services uh to be honest and to be clear that the hospitals any hospital that is still open its door doesn't mean that it still keep providing services medical services for Palestinians because of the great shortage of fuel in uh the uh medical uh sector okay I understand what you're telling us that the hospital wasn't functioning as a hospital anymore but it that doesn't mean that it was empty because there are lots of people who are still taking shelter in hospitals even when they're no longer those hospitals are no longer treating patients thank you that's that's uh very important information to bring to light at this hour um is there anything what do you know if anything at this hour about Damage Done in that area generally because we're looking at the picture and given the size of the blast it looks like there would have been damage around the area as well well uh damages in everywhere inside Gaza Strip specifically in uh the uh North and Central Gaza where the hospital is located B do everywhere and the Israeli ongoing chilling really uh caused catastrophic damage to residential and even uh the Civil infrastructure where hospitals cannot uh keep going in uh providing treatment for Palestinians and meanwhile people who are inside the hospital are really even facing such a massive deterioration in their humanitarian conditions also all right tar kazum reporting live from hanun thank you very much TK quick reset before we bring in our next guest you're just seeing right now the immediate aftermath of a strike that took place a very short while ago on alwafa Hospital in the Gaza Strip it is currently 1600 GMT so it's 700 p.m. local in Gaza as we watch those pictures let's bring in Mansour Schuman Mansour you are a resident of Gaza you're joining us from Kan Yunis I understand that you're close to where that strike took place tell me what you saw what you heard tell me anything you know that's correct um we were praying the sunset M prayer uh in congregation we are around 15,000 refugees here in the hospital vicinity while praying we heard a very large blast uh just behind us towards the the west of the Hospital several buildings collapsed and for the last 1 hour until now ambulances have been coming in bringing in dead bodies and injured to be treated so you were inside the compound of the hospital that was struck is that right correct and I'm still here correct and you're still inside the that that compound it so our correspondent was saying that people were still inside that hospital even though it was no longer really operating as a hospital can you confirm that no I think he were talking about wa Hospital inaz City this is n Hospital in okay sorry excuse me so so reset then which hospital and which area are you talking about yeah the question you asked me was in San un did you hear about the bombing correct were inity I said yes we were playing the M perer the sunset in congregation around 15,000 refugees that are settling here right now while praying we heard the bomb behind us and it's FL in two buildings and until now for the last one hour ambulances have and injured people are and are the people who are being brought in is there are there still enough resources at this stage to give them Med the medical treatment that they um the doctors and and nurse nures and medical staff here are some of the bravest creative people I have ever met I've lived in several countries and several continents and what they're doing right now is a little bit of just trying to help uh prioritize those who can live and prioritize giving them the right treatment given the lack of resources the lack of medication the lack of anesthesia the lack of electricity in Fr of the units um what's happening right now is genocide uh fuel is needed as soon as possible over 50% of Hospitals and Clinics in have been bumped to the ground or are not running because there is no more fuel uh the medical uh the ability to provide medical support to the 2.3 million people suffering here is at a red at a red line and we are asking for the International Community for people to come and listen and try to help bring in as soon as possible Fuel and medical supplies into the Gaza Strip and allow the injured which are over 17,500 whoever needs operations to leave the G and to get the operation done where is the humanity where is the international law what are you seeing as we speak right now I'm seeing a lot of ambulances that keep coming in back and forth I seeing until now the effects of the rubble the dust a lot of the the buildings that were affected had asbestos in them so right now we are actually breing very dangerous material um I'm seeing people who are just trying to help get people out of the rubble rush and come back I'm seeing PE I'm seeing a lot of media Personnel who are trying 247 to cover the news um get get the real story what's actually happening here in Gaza to the outside world have you seen any of the aid have you either been a recipient of the aid have you got your hands on any of the aid that's come in about 60 trucks of Aid and everybody has said this is Dr just a drop in the ocean we do understand that but have you got anything whether it's food water have you seen any of the medical supplies being delivered and distributed to the hospitals anything I haven't seen anything I haven't heard anything being distributed in my area just for the the audien's information normally STP gets 400 trucks normally of food different materials coming into STP without War without any major blockade like what's happening now after 16 17 days we got zero and now we get only 50 trucks and a lot of the a lot of what is in those trucks are things that we don't need such as coffin wraps for the dead such as gloves you know where is the fuel where is the real food where is the purification kits for the water and like I said uh right now I mean we have right now over 1.4 million people displaced that left their house either living in one of the 220 Refugee centers which were before un schools or living my like my family with their extended cousins with eight or 10 other families in the same house all sharing the same stored food this is the 21st century genocide and the world will not forget history will write this in their books manour just before I let you go um I think you're aware uh Gins in general are very aware of the news and everything that's being said around the world about what happens where you are so you're probably aware that there's high level diplomacy going on at the United Nations and that the world's big Powers disagree on you know on on a common position on Gaza and they're currently bickering frankly because that's what it is bickering on uh a resolution that would called to stop the fighting and the bombardments in Gaza I'm just wondering what's your message to those diplomats and to those world powers my message is what are they waiting for what are they waiting for why was the UN formed in 1947 or 1948 why do we have the Human Rights Acts why do we have all this diplomacy and efforts and trying to enforce uh enforce our Universal human rights doctrines on different nations while when a small place like 360 kilom squared with 2.3 million civilians are being starred to death are being bombed to death uh none of none of your laws are being applied to us here I don't want to say that the Gaz people are not relying on what they un is about because right now they're losing hope we do not want to reach that level we hope that there are people in the UN in the right frame of mind who are properly analyzing what is happening to the civilians here and apply to us the proper international law stop the fire belt strikes stop the bombing of neighborhoods and killing of children and women let Aid come in let people who need medical medical oper ations to leave open the borders allow freedom of of press to come and report if some if some reporters are deemed not un biased bring your own reporters in and have them report the news the people here are going through genocide history will not forget history will not shame all right manour Schuman uh I appreciate that uh it's a difficult time for you to be speaking to us um again for people who just tuned in in the middle of the interview there was a strike right near where you are uh a short while ago and even as you talk to us you see the people who are being taken to hospital both the dead and the injured uh we appreciate you taking time to put your thoughts together and speak to us here on aljaz Mansour appreciate it thank you thank you
