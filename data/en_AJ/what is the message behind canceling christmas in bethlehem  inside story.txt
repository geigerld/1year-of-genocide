a subdued Christmas in Bethlehem festivities are muted this year in the occupied territories as Israel's war on Gaza rages with Palestinian Christians saying they too are being targeted so what message does this show of Unity by Palestinians convey this is Inside hello and welcome to the program I'm D nauga usually bustling with visitors from around the world Bethlehem is empty this Christmas festivities are muted in the occupied West Bank as Israel shows no sign of ending its Onslaught in Gaza Israeli bombs do not discriminate everything and everyone in the strip is a target from hospital hital to schools and from mosques to churches so what message are Palestinian Christians sending to the World by canceling this year's festivities in Bethlehem we'll go to our guests in a moment but first this report from Michael Apple Silent Night on Christmas Eve in a square usually packed with pilgrims and tourists the Nativity scen showing the baby Jesus whom Christians believe was born in Bethlehem more than 2,000 years ago go altered to reflect Israel's war on Gaza we put this model as you see to reflect the reality and we are sending a message to the International Community and to come here and to stand with the Palestinian cause and to force Israel to stop this aggression against our people the war in Gaza Israeli raids on Palestinian communities in the occupied West Bank and restrictions on movement it's a time of sorrow and frustration and it's taking a toll on businesses that rely on the holiday season the situation in Bethlehem is hard because 80% of the economy here depends on tourism we're trying to keep the workshop running for the workers because they all have responsibilities and this is all they know tourists won't come here as long as the war goes on it's terribly hard and sad it's the same in the old city of occupied East Jerusalem shops are either shut or empty of customers the atmosphere of this year is much different from most years usually it's a hive of activity with all the pilgrims that come um but this year it's very solemn because of the war of course and so many of you are pilgrims we need peace we're looking for a peace it's a wish many Palestinian Christians are praying for both in the occupied West Bank and within Gaza since the beginning of Israel's war on Gaza several Christian facilities have been attacked and Christians killed the survivors have little to celebrate this Christmas displaced and separated from family Fadi is one of about a thousand Palestinian Christians in Gaza no one feels the holiday spirit there won't be the usual Christmas decorations or celebrations we pray to God to end this war soon stop these massacres back in Bethlehem worshippers attend midnight mass in a show of solidarity the Cardinal of the Latin patriarchate of Jerusalem didn't pay his traditional visit to Gaza this year instead his Christmas message delivered in Bethlehem Gaza You are not alone not abandoned Mike Lael for Inside let's now bring in our guest joining us from Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank is Ram Jafari Who action Aid Palestine Communications and advocacy coordinator in rdam the Netherlands is Frank bosan who's an associate professor of cultural theology at the tillberg school of Catholic theology and from the old city in occupied East Jerusalem we're joined by Sammy Yousef he's the CEO of the Latin patriarches of Jerusalem thank you all for joining us good to be with you on Inside Story Sammy Le in occupied East Jerusalem tell us how you're observing Christmas I think uh in a very sad way I must admit uh Christmas this year is uh very muted uh given all the the uh restrictions on travel given the lack of Tourism uh given the continued uh uh conflict in Gaza and of course the lack of any movement on the West Bank so it is truly one of the saddest the Christian Christmases that we have uh been witnessing in in in a long long time uh Bethlehem yesterday was very sad in many ways I think there are many factors that affect that uh including of course the collapse of the tourism sector uh in particular after October 7th uh lack of Mobility people could not go to Bethlehem I myself did not go to Bethlehem yesterday the the checkpoints were open for couple of hours or so uh and of course uh the the permit suspension uh uh so people could not uh basically access their jobs in Israel uh let alone the lack of any salaries uh paid by the Palestinian Authority for 180,000 civil servants so if you look at it from any angle that you wish not only Gaza and the disastrous uh war that is taking place there but also what's happening on the West Bank also is very critical so all that combined really I think uh uh made the the church leaders basically cancel all the celebrations uh surrounding Christmas with the exception of course of the religious ceremonies which took place last night at the church of the Nativity right okay let's get the view from Bethlehem now with Ram jaffar uh RAM every Christmas uh there's a huge Christmas tree that's lit up in Bethlehem this year that's not happening the Nativity sculpture in in Bethlehem uh has been uh put together this year instead of that Christmas tree tell us about that sculpture and what message it's sending out and thanks uh for having me yes beim is very sad this year and um we used in beim to see the trees are full of visitors and tourists and the Towering the Christmas tree are decorated but this year it has not happened uh it is the Palestinian Christians and the Palestinians Muslims are here in Bethlehem are sad and uh are um celebrating or not or are witnessing Christmas with pain with worry with sorry about what it is happening in in Gaza and West Bank many of Palestinian Christians also here in Bethlehem have some close relative in Gaza and some of them lose of this their relatives in the with Israeli strikes that Target churches and Al Hospital in Gaza and so the Bethlehem cannot celebrate and sending the message to the word that we do not to celebrate we want the world to to to to support the ceasefire to demand the world leaders to reach a ceasefire to stop targeting both Muslims and Christians people in in Gaza and West Bank and also H they also H Palestinian Christians feel very worried as other Muslims because they cannot communicate with their relatives their friends in Gaza due to the blackout of communication and also they suffer from the movement restriction they cannot go even the Christians who are living in beem cannot go to Jerusalem and to other places in Palestine to to meet with their relatives to gather with their relatives due to the Restriction due to the stroke to the closure imposed in different parts of the West Banks so the message of Palestinians here is to demand the war to H to stop this war to demand ceasefire and to reach beast and to achieve beace and justice for Palestinians okay uh Frank as someone uh from abroad how do you observe what's going on right now in the occupied territories and particularly I mean every Christmas one of the most important rituals in Palestine is the procession of the patriarch from Jerusalem taking place on December 24th for Catholics now this is a tradition that's dated back to the Ottoman Empire and we understand this year the procession will go on but there won't be any festivities there won't be any musical bands as there usually are every year it's more of a silent procession significant is that well you can you can see that it is significant because usually these kind of rituals in Roman Catholic tradition also in in Bethlehem on the 24th and 25th of December you see that it is like a almost like a religious Carnival there is music there is singing there are beautiful decorations all over the city people are walking processions or people praying people singing uh Christian Christian hints and the whole the whole territory is buzzling with activity with anticipation of the Feast of the Nativity but because of the the horrible conditions now in in in Gaza all the celebration have to be toned down of course not only because there are no tourists and there are no pilgrims to come there but also it's not a time for for big celebration not a time to to celebrate life and to celebrate uh your religious tradition if if if you are in the middle of a war zone so of course Christmas will continue Christmas will celebrated has been celebrated also in in in the Gaza in the churches of Gaza but uh of course it's a time of mour it's a time of loss not a time of Happiness unfortunately while Christmas is par Excellence the Feast of joy and peace right Samy Yousef Christmas is a national holiday for all Palestinians it's not just a Christian holiday and we understand even the Palestinian Authority considers it a national holiday Muslims traditionally uh attend the parades as well give us a sense of the unity at this time of year between the Palestinian Muslims and the Palestinian Christians in the context of the Gaza War certainly I mean this is uh historically is considered a national holiday where it is not only I mean from a religious point of view the Christians celebrate but but also Muslim brothers and sisters do celebrate with us as well and stand in in solidarity and Unity uh and it is not only the Christmas really that that I think signifies that Unity uh I think in the Palestinian territories uh you know for example the Latin patriarchate operates a network of uh of schools there are 44 schools that are operated by the Latin patriarchate uh 12 of them are in Palestine two of them are in Gaza uh and for the most part really the uh the majority in Palestine at least of our students are are non-Christian or Muslim Students uh and thus it is the the tradition really that these celebrations really take place uh of both Christians and Muslims in schools on the streets it's sort of a national festive holiday and that signifies really I think the the unity U and uh that Christian presence is not only in in education it's in healthare Social Services uh and it's quite a significant uh presence uh and and thus that Christian presence really institutional Christian Christian presence is not a Christian presence to serve to serve the Christians only or exclusively tell us tell us more about just one more question for you Samy just tell us more about the um how look we understand the Christians in Gaza while they're small in number they do have an Institutional presence and you were just mentioning that there are two uh schools that are run by the patriarch at there um give us a sense of what is the percentage right now of the Christian Community in Gaza and how strong are they institutionally as far as the number of Christians in Gaza really I mean talking about a little under 1,000 uh uh Christians in Gaza we started before the war at 2017 uh and we have lost 25 people actually uh since the beginning of the war 17 at the sterious church the Greek Orthodox uh uh building collapse two people uh in our own Parish complex uh and about five or six people due to Med medical neglect they simply became sick and could not uh get medical treatment and that's when you're talking about 25 people that's about 2.5% of the Christian population in Gaza that lost their lives as a result and the consequence either directly or indirectly of the world and that is significant for any population uh however given that size the the Christian presence really the contributions in Gaza and elsewhere in thean territories in in the Galilee in in Jordan as well the contributions of this the institutional presence really in education Healthcare and Social Services is an unproportionate contribution uh from the Christian uh world really to the building of societies at large U and if we look at Gaza for example there are two two schools that belong to the Catholic uh or to the Latin patriarch in particular but there's also a rosary sister school Under the banner of the Catholic church and there are two other schools Christian in nature a Baptist school and the Greek Orthodox school so five schools in total actually in Gaza right and the percentage of Christian population is no more than I would imagine 5% combined so 95% of our students in Gaza really are are Muslim Students and uh you know they appreciate the value set that this Catholic Christian education I think brings as part of the educational process bring Frank let's bring in Frank Frank let me ask you this with the dwindling numbers of Christians in Gaza in particular if we just focus on Gaza for a moment and obviously I mean human rights organizations are saying that Israel is bombing indiscriminately and they're bombing civilians and that includes uh all Palestinians in Gaza but if we specifically look at the Christians now who say they are being Target there their their hospitals are being targeted as well as their churches do you fear that the Christian Community is at risk of extinction because of this war well I think that the presence of of Christians in in the Middle East per se is uh very difficult there are a couple of countries where Christians can live in relative peace at the same time there are a couple of countries in the Middle East where the Christian presence is already under M much pressure and this uh this war that is now raging on in Gaza is of course of course very bad news for the population the already small population of Christians in um in Gaza and there are a couple of significant places uh to be found there connected to the Christian narrative especially of course the the the church of nativity and it would be very very pitiful for all people in Gaz especially for for the Christians because we have so so so little people left there and it's so historically and theologically relevant to be there we have been there for so long because it is the place where chrisis believed to have been born so it would be it would be a historical trategy and andrological strategy if if Christians would cease to exist in in Gaz altogether okay one more for you before I bring you to ham but do you think that the Christian Community I mean you speak to us from the Netherlands from what you see in sort of the in Europe and the Western World do you think that the Christian Community is speaking out enough when it comes to the attacks against Christians in Gaza as well as what we're seeing happen in the occupied West Bank in terms of the strikes and the blockades and and the the effect of aparti there well I I think that I think that Christians uh in modern days have uh maybe have forgotten uh how they should um come up for for the brethren in in the faith so so Christians in the west are not very common to stand up for those who are persecuted in other parts of the world maybe North Korea or China or in or in the Middle East so there is in the Netherlands much outcry for all the victims of the conflict on both sides uh of the conflict but there's not so much attention for the position of the Christians in in in this conflict it's not considered to be a very newsworthy kind of of item so there is not not so much attention to there should be more yeah and I mean as we say uh the the attacks and the strikes in Gaza are in fact targeting everybody and that's according to uh human rights organizations as well as many people that we've spoken to here at Al jazer uh RAM let me bring you in the deputy mayor of Jerusalem um earlier this week she was giving an interview to media and she claimed that there are no Christians or churches in Gaza saying that they were driven out by Hamas when you hear such statements what does it make you think and what's your response to that statement uh our response is clear and I join the the statement of your guest there is a more than 1,000 Christians in in Gaza and many Christians in West Bank and uh there are churches there are schools there are existence and U I will remind you one of uh one of the victims who is a musician ilham Farah who was killed in this war by Israeli strikes and uh also she was mourned and she was marked and her achievements and her music and here musical achievement was achieved and highlighted by many Palestinians and to show that Palestinian Christians in Gaza are existing and are contributing to the building of Palestinian Society to the building of Palestinian education ER they are uh very respected people and community in Gaza and they have many achievements and they are being targeted as other parts of population in in Gaza and also for those who might be wondering just tell us how old is the Christian presence in Gaza I don't have they are living there for decades for for for hundreds of years I don't have exact year how how how long they have been living there but they are part of Palestinian original history in in Gaza and they have a a good Legacy and good history and a good achievement in education and there there are many Palestinian figures who contributed on National and religious and political level to Palestinian history to Palestinian civilization I mean and another there are many for example this inan female musician ilham Farah was one of Palestinian Christian who is known for her Legacy for her music for her art for her contribution in Palestinian community in Gaza so we cannot ignore and and see that they do not exist they are they exist and they have a good Legacy and they have a an original history there in Gaza okay uh Sammy religious and Aid organizations have been sending coordinates they say to the UN as well as to Israel uh since the war in Gaza started in October but at the same time we've seen Israel continue to conduct operations and continue to strike uh religious sites as well as hospitals you'll remember the the strike on the Baptist Hospital earlier in the war what is your reaction to these places being hidden this way I think one of great sorrow actually because indeed we have done what we needed to do from day one of the war uh that the coordinates of all the the uh churches in particular but not only churches all the uh Catholic and non-catholic institutions uh uh the the coordinates were were provided to all parties uh and not only directly to the Israeli authorities but through the United States through the Vatican and the holy sea and through various mediate mediators as well so the coordinators are well known in many ways and uh and it's very sad to see that not only Christian institutions of course these are our institutions and and we have to care for them and and we have to ensure that you know the safety of the people that have taken Refuge uh in our institutions is preserved but but the coordinates are very well known I think all around and it's very sad really to see that uh you know in a particular way not only the the the codo but also the the two women that were killed on the premises of the U Holy Family Church inside the church compound additionally I think they strike to the generator and the uh fuel tank right next to it which is adjacent to the Children's Home Again 60 handicapped children are in Residence there as part of the so let me just ask you this Sammy if you don't mind when when your organization sends coordinates to you say the Israelis as well as the UN and even the Americans what kind of response do you get if you get a response resp at all we do get a response and the response is that they are aware and that is given to the uh uh field and that every uh every precaution will be taken not to harm civilians and and the these institutions uh but this is war and War uh mistakes happen and Mis judgment happens in wars and this is the the response that we usually get right okay uh Frank just to pick up on a point that you were noting a few moments ago uh you were talking about the Christian presence in fact in the region and not only in Gaza the Archbishop from the Greek Orthodox Church in Jerusalem back in 2021 he said that the number of Christians immigrating from the Middle East has reached unprecedented levels and he called to preserve this important component in the region in your opinion what does The Disappearance of the Christian element or the dwindling of the Christian element from Palestine mean for the country itself and also for the region well well well I think that um Israel and the the palestinia is is one of the places where people from the three aritic faith can prove that they need one another that they can live together with one another so if Christians Muslims and Jews cannot find a way to live together especially in in Jerusalem and in Bethlehem and in nazare the place that is so important for all three uh monotheistic religions then well then it it gets a bit hopeless for the rest of the world so Israel is in the focus point of the international religious attention always has been and shall for always be that way and if one of the three would happen to disappear Al together from from Israel or Palestine that would mean well that would suggest that the only way that the three monistic relationss can work together is just one of them disappears or maybe even two of them disappears and that would be such a shame for not only uh abrahamic Faith but for the for Humanity as a whole we must find a way to work and live together in peace ream can you weigh in on this in your opinion what does the the dwindling numbers of this religious group in the region mean for diversity of the region so this means that uh that there are many political factors mainly the occupation and the occupation policies it the that impact the immigration of religious and non-religious groups and there are many Palestinian young people and including Muslims and Christians who uh search and look for immigration from Palestine and from Gaza and from West Bank du to the limitation due to the lack of opportunities due to the political situation so this mean means that uh they are affected of uh current and continuous blade imposed in Gaza and in West Bank and the Restriction this means that Palestinian young people Palestinian families who immigrate or leaving Palestine ER they they are not interested in Immigration to other countries but they want to seek another place where they could find Better Living or better condition to live ER this uh this is an indication for immigration different parts of the Palestinian Society outside Palestine Sammy LEF will you uh give us the final word and your final thoughts on this topic sure I I think uh the holy land will be really a very sad place if the Christian presence uh disappears uh and I would like to concentrate on the value of really the the Christian value set really is one of you know forgiveness and coexistence and and respect and love and peace and and this message really that is that filters through the value set that filters through our institutions through the services of our institutions whether in education Healthcare or social services that message does not change during time of War so even at time of war that message Remains the Same and if that message disappears from the scene what is the other message that today we hear on the streets you know one of revenge and one of killing and one of Destruction and so on and so forth so you need you honestly need that message that moderating message really to remain as part of the Mosaic of the Holy Land the holy land will be a very very sad place if this Christian presence disappears and I hope really that that that presence really is translated into stronger institutions of the various churches that are providing these Services once this war is over the day after I would like to see a stronger Christian presence in the Holy Land rather than a diminish presence okay on that note we'll leave it there
