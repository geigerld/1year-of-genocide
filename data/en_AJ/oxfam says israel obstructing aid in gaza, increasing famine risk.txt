now a report by the charity Oxfam is warning Gaza is at breaking point because of Israeli restrictions on humanitarian Aid it says it's become virtually impossible for Aid agencies to reach starving Palestinians children are suffering the most survey found that 85% of them had not eaten for an entire day at least once in the last 3 days before the survey was conducted Oxfam warns by the time famine is declared it will be too late and conditions are deteriorating in overcrowded displacement camps there are only 121 toilets serving 500,000 people in almasi in Western Rafa that means more than 4,000 people are sharing each available toilet and restricted food is putting thousands of people at risk 400,000 lers of fuel is needed a day in order to keep critical services like hospitals running but Israel is allowing only 19% of that fuel into Gaza we can speak now to hadil kazaz she's oxfam's gender coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa region she joins us now from rala thank you so much for your time today I understand you were actually born in Gaza and have family in Gaza today so really you are best place to tell us uh what is going on there uh what are your family telling you about the situation there uh the situation is getting worse every day and my family lived they were ordered to evacuate from Gaza at the early days of the war and they went to rafah and they stayed there for almost six months when they were ordered hasy and quickly to leave uh without being prepared They Carried the very little they had while they managed in the last in the first six months to live in crowded houses where at least five or six families were sharing at least a building or a flat apartment uh they were now they are forced to stay in tense in the masasi of kanun an area which is full of course sand it's a desert place um my sister two days ago was bitten by a Scorpio that's one of an additional point of misery and pain for her where she has to endure uh the huge uh the alarming heat temperatures during the day and they called the temperatures at night lack of food lack of Safety and Security they hear the bombardment surrounding them continuously in Al orat and ra so they are in the middle H the area that you described is it's just around 70 square kilometer which hosts 1.7 million so you can imagine in the small camp where my family is now there are 70 people and they share very small toilet uh other people cannot have this luxury they are are even considered lucky uh to be 7 sharing a small toilet that is flooding h no uh Sweet Water so they have to buy water it's very expensive to buy water uh they depend on the sea water most of the time for washing and for washing clothes and cleaning everything um my my sister for example who is also suffering from a tumor in her spine breed War uh doesn't have any access to medication or any access to Medical Services even when she got bitten by a scorpion so by all all of this is only accumulation of the what's happening because of the closure the complete closure of the Gaza Strip because of the uh um lack of access to humanitarian Services the small the few hospitals that were operating are not operating now because of lack of fuel because of lack of access to medication and medical supplies in addition to the food issue which we warned from since the beginning apologies for interrupting I can't imagine how helpless uh and terrified you must be feeling uh to have family in that situation where you can't do anything about it just to be clear what you're saying is in the last eight months since the War Began they started off in Gaza then they moved to Rafa and then Rafa they moved to almasi because in in the last in the course of the last month when the Israelis went into the south I mean how terrified ing was the situation in Rafa that forced them to move very terrifying because first of all it came suddenly without any preparation like one of my sisters actually had to move 10 times from one house to the other H and then she had to leave like in half an hour to carry whatever she could uh she had to pay a huge amount of money for a small car to carry whatever she can and it took her almost 4 hours to move because of the crowded uh streets and there's no streets basically people are everywhere anywhere that is empty you can find the tent uh it is not it's not an easy it's not a Humane situation where the family lives and it's not absolutely not possible to continue like this I worry so much for my mother who's 8 years old and uh she has been basically fasting most of the time because of lack of food and she wanted to provide some for the small children and the family um so she she she choose to to fast to use the Islamic way of fasting to minimize the meals she has to one one meal a day and now she lost almost 20 25 kilos of her weight uh and at at an 80 years old age you cannot afford to lose that much weight so of course it's terrifying it's the reality of dayto day that maybe the world doesn't see and doesn't hear enough about uh where people are living on canned food for 8 months can you imagine not having access to fresh vegetables or fruits or any nutrients and absorbing all these kinds of preservant and things that comes with the canned food uh it's a situation that is not ongoing it's not possible to continue and that's why we continue demanding for immediate access to humanitarian support and that's why the breast release of Oxfam basically says that we need immediate access that allows food to come medications and items that people need allow also ability for humanitarian actors to move and to be able to access uh these people and help them in the different way they can I am I I I very much hope that your please to listen to hadil kazaz oxfam's gender coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa region thank you so much thank you make sure to subscribe to our Channel to get the latest
