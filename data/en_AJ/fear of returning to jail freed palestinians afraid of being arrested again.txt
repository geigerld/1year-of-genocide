we go to meet them at night away from the prying eyes of Israeli settlers and occupation forces nearby three cousins recently released but with the Spectre of Prisons still hanging over their heads 19-year-old Kus Abu Naim was sentenced to 15 months for throwing stones a symbolic gesture by Young Palestinians to resist the Israeli occupation I was warned not to celebrate my freedom and not to throw stones of course they can get me again but in the end what do you want me to do I'm just defending myself in my Village I'm not a terrorist as they say as cus was driven out of Aer prison his cousin Muhammad was coming in he had been waiting outside for cus to be released when soldiers detained him this wasn't his first time but during this latest brief stay in jail he noticed the conditions had changed there is psychological torture it wasn't like that before now they lock you in a room until you're broken and admit to anything they want when I got home the officer in our area told me my movements were being monitored and next time they'd harm my wife as well despite the threats Muhammad thinks it's important to speak out and hopes the world will understand how difficult it is to Simply Be A Palestinian all of those we spoke to told us the same story that they were warned not to celebrate their new found freedom and not to speak publicly in fact we had interviewed a group of teenagers but a few hours after we left they messaged us asking not to air the interview and they told us that the Israeli officer in charge of their Village had called each one of them individually threatening that if our interview aired they would return to jail more than 3,300 Palestinian had been detained in the occupied West Bank since October the 7th the vast majority held without charge cut off from the world Palestinians must pay the price for the attack regardless of whether they took part in it or not and then all those detained to use for exchanges during deals that's why I say that those who were held after October the 7th are hostages and not prisoners when Muhammad nazel was released the priority was to get him treatment both his hands were broken in what he describes as nightly routine beatings now he's back home seemingly still in shock and relieved he survived one of the guys was so badly beaten his cellmates kept calling and yelling for someone to help when they finally arrived they felt his pulse through the bars he was dead after that they were just insulters when the soldier came to fetch me before my release he said they would hunt me down and bring me back to jail all the Palestinian we spoke to on or off camera share a feeling of unease they are relieved to be at home but wonder how many nights they'll be able to sleep in their beds before Israeli soldiers come for them again abdulhamid AL jazer in the occupied West Bank make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
