we're joined Now by alzer senior political analyst Maron bisha Let's uh talk a little bit more about this Janine Hospital attack it's a Brazen attack is it a violation of international humanitarian law look I'm no legal scholar but for me this is a clear violation of any human decency legality morality or or anything that resembles anything because these things these legalities have been created so that this is not done to any to anyone whether it's on the Israeli side or the Palestinian or The American or the Iranian or Lebanese or whatever side in the end of the day there's a certain sacredness to a hospital or to a school or to a mosque or to a church but in this very particular case the the Palestinian activist the militant he he's been there for a while and his brother his only brother came to visit him there was no reportedly uh preparation for another October 7 operation these were two brothers one of them was almost paralyzed so the Israelis you know basically the way they've conducted this operation against this Hospital killing people as patients not as militants in a battlefield you know that certainly is not is is not is is no less than you know an act of Terror in fact by the Israeli state do you think there's a greater sense of impunity on the Israeli side since October 7th since the war on Gaza there certainly has been uh clearly as Biden predicted President Biden predicted the Israelis are angry there's they are vengeful and so on so forth but there is another aspect to that they are losing uh or at least they are incapable of achieving their objectives in the War uh and hence they're making up for their impotence and their failure by taking it out on the civilian population and it's this certain exhibitionism that we haven't seen before in as much apparently there are also more reservers meaning just a larger sector of the Israeli public is participating in this operation and that their behavior shows just how right-wing how fascistic how fanatical the Israeli Society has become all of that in fact uh uh Laura it it reminds me of this very genius one of those Jewish Geniuses right there's some of them and this very particular Israeli Jewish genius by the name of U yes yahu liovic he was a philosopher he was an orthodox Jew conservative but he was also a biochemist a philosopher a talmud scholar lived until he was 90 in Israel and and after the 1967 occupation he predicted that Israeli soldiers will turn into what he called what he called Judo nais he said and he encouraged Israeli young people not to join the Israeli military because he said as long as Israel becomes an occupying power eventually dominating other people will lead them to become fascist themselves I'm reminded of him nowadays as I see this sadism this exhibitionism this U egregious acts on the part of the Israeli military everywhere and the fact that they boast about it the fact they laugh about it and you see these Israelis diffusing these videos countless videos about their heroism against Palestinian children and women and and and civilians that's just too ugly we get it back more to the politics we've got Ismail hania the uh political head of Hamas heading to Cairo talking about movement on a proposal for a ceasefire why do you think we are seeing movement now some three weeks after all the talks were dead in the water following the assassination of that top Hamas leader in Beirut I think there's a good number of reason on all fronts right I think um of course the Palestinians are fed up with being bombed starved and and this and that and the other and I think Hamas understands that I think the Israelis have basically bombed everything that's bombable or not bombable in in the Gaza Strip I think whatever is left in kanun and RAF I mean now there's concentration of more than a half one and a half million people there so I'm not sure how far they can go I think the Americans are the ones who are really getting their clock uh reaching its end because it's an election year it's getting really out of hand in Yemen in Jordan in Syria in Iraq and you know in Lebanon and elsewhere and Biden keeps saying each and every day we don't want a regional war and certainly I would think he doesn't want after he committed to end the forever Wars and certainly a war with Iran as the Republicans now are pushing him in the United States that's not going to be conducive neither to America Norther to the Biden Administration not to Biden himself so there's a number of clocks ticking and I think there is uh you know will on the part of the Egyptians and certainly the kares to mediate something in the war and have this exchange of captives and prisoners but when you hear prime minister Netanyahu saying no no no no we're not going to release we're gonna we're not going to release you know prisoners we thousands of prisoners we're going to continue with the war and so on so forth you would ask what is going on is he just talking to his base is he just preparing himself to a blinkin visit pressure on him no we don't but we will find out soon enough Mar and Bash thanks very much
