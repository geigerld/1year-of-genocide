well let's speak to Mukesh capila about this he's a former un humanitarian coordinator joining us from Geneva Mr capila very good to have you with us again on Al jazer I know you've had your share experience o of conflicts with conflicts when you see what's happening in Gaza what's happened over the past five weeks this death total of over 11,11 un workers being killed un schools targeted did you ever think the conflict would reach this level you know I've spent the last 20 30 years in numerous conflicts around the world ranging from Afghanistan to many countries in Africa but this one in Gaza is really unique because it's heavily concentrated in a one of the most densely populated places on Earth and us it uses the most modern armaments that you can think of and the and everybody is mixed up civilians humanitarian workers um Hamas and soldiers of All Sorts so the fact that civilians are are being killed in record numbers and also the humanitarian workers is just a tragic inevitability in the sort of conflict that is being waged yeah it shouldn't happen this way and I think the way the the war is being waged is in my opinion somewhat careless compared to some of the other situations that I've seen in Iraq and elsewhere where I think we had much fewer casualties than we are currently witnessing at the moment yeah and the way the war is being raged is really an issue here isn't it uh we've seen un workers humanitarian workers targeted schools that shelter uh uh people who are seeking uh shelter in in un schools being targeted as well we've heard the Israelis say they're targeting these buildings and hospitals and so on and even humanitarian workers because they have connections to Hamas to the the uh fighters in Gaza the UN Ambassador in the Israeli Ambassador at the United Nations has even accused uh some unra workers of being uh members of Hamas how do you think that is going to impact and change humanitarian work in the future I think first to say that it doesn't matter what groups workers belong to but if they're Aid workers and unless they're carrying guns and I haven't heard them going around carrying guns in ambulances or rescue workers from the rubble carrying guns while they're rescuing so I think whoever you are hamus or not hamus if you an aid worker then you should be protected by International uh law so I think what we are seeing now is that all rules are broken down and there are no norms and because this is a whole of a society war with no Norms being observed but there are really no rules at all therefore what we need what needs to happen therefore is rescue from outside we need more of not people leaving leaving Northern Gaza because they can't because the corridors are blocked and there's too dangerous to move but maybe they need to be rescued by people coming in from outside into the territory yeah but people haven't been able to come in outside uh from to the territory from outside very little Aid has gone into the territory from outside I mean you you have experience in this how do you prioritize what to send when you see the level of Devastation and destruction that Gaza has experienced in the past five weeks well they need on the humanitarian stuff they literally need need everything whether it's food or water or essential medicines so I think almost anything is is needed it's not a matter of priorities it's a matter of really all forms of life- saving Aid that that are needed I think there are no easy answers to this one other than the cessation of the of the of the fighting and allowing a pause or a ceasefire as people are debating this at the present time I do not think you can you can magic up any solutions to to the ongoing human suffering and that's a sad reality Now everywhere else where I worked at there have been islands of Tranquility corridors or pauses which have allowed Aid to be brought in and I think this is what needs to happen in in Gaza now if if the if the if Israel doesn't want to do that then I'm afraid the suffering is going to continue and unless you're thinking about some kind of external Intervention which you done in other countries obviously it's not going to happen here external intervention who who what external intervention and and what role for the United Nations in this conflict the UN has been polarized and paralyzed over over this issue in Gaza what role could it be playing here that it's not well the un's traditional role has been peacemaking and peacekeeping but because of the polarized nature of the United Nations at the present time Security Council general assembly and so on then it's a peacemaking role is I think dead at the present time now as far as peacekeeping role is concerned we have some un peacekeepers up at the top but because Israel has taken umage at the remarks of the UN Secretary General I doubt that Israel is going to allow any un peacekeeping role which leaves us with the un's humanitarian role alongside that of the Red Cross red Cresent system and I think that's what the UN is concentrating on it's different organizations Under World food program World Health Organization UNICEF and and so on but the risks they are taking are such with more than 100 people killed that I do not think they can do much more than that and can't humanely ask Aid workers to go where actually even soldiers would find it more difficult to pray Mr capila Mukesh capila thank you so much for talking to us on Al jaaz thank you for joining us Mukesh capila is a former un humanitarian coordinator live there from Geneva
