Egypt's President says he won't allow refugees from Gaza into his country adding it would make the peninsula a target for Israel the whole concept of transferring Palestinians from the Gaza Strip into Sinai is simply moving the fighting and resistance from the Gaza Strip to Sinai which means Sinai will become a base for military operations against Israel and then Israel will try to defend itself and direct its military operations against Egypt and sin Egypt has committed to establishing peace we should remain dedicated to our investment in the peace process we should come up with a viable solution if there is a transfer let it be to the Negev Desert in Israel let Israel do what they wish to do with the military operatives in Gaza before returning the Palestinians back all acts by Israel cutting water and electricity is a means to forcibly transfer Palestinians into the Sinai Peninsula which we totally reject let speak speak to our diplomatic editor James baz he joins us now live here in the studio and danan James I want to ask you about the security Council what's going on there in a minute but picking up on what Alan was saying about so many Arab leaders pulling out saying No thank you to a meeting with Biden if you were hoping I guess that Biden is coming to kind of broker some kind of ceasefire agreement does it look like we're going that way at all I think we may well be going to something short of a Ceasar but some sort of humanitarian pause but you're right the events of the last few hours have really changed things situation the situation changed radically on October the 7th and it's changed radically again the Arab Street I think is what's driving this Arab leaders I think are saying you know we're not going to stick with our existing position we now need to have a ceasefire um I don't think we're going to get the ceasefire but we're going to get something short of that I think and that which brings us to what's happening in the security Council right we've got this Brazilian draft text is that going to succeed where the Russian one failed well I'm just speaking to our colleague Christen salumi who's there'll be covering that in the next 45 minutes when it happens uh and uh there was apparently some pressure behind the scenes for the from the US mission to the United Nations to actually delay this vote doesn't look that like that's going to happen supposed to vote in 45 minutes from now right they are going to vote they are the US the US were apparently putting some pressure on to have a delay until Biden was in the air but that delay is not happening it looks like the vote is definitely on 45 minutes from now this is a resolution that the draft have been worked on for some days and it's been watered down it originally called for an iMed immediate ceasefire it now calls for humanitarian pauses and what I think the US why the US will support this resolution from everything I'm hearing is that they will use this then to try and re- um push the plan of secretary blinkin which was to get the Americans out the those that are that have American passports that are in Gaza 5 to 600 people most of them jeel Nationals get them out of the raer Crossing and get some Aid in a limited pause and then of course uh the American position is that Israel has the right to defend itself so that the bombardment will continue after that just briefly why did they want to delay the vote I think the words I heard was they wanted not to have this vote while President Biden was still in the region they wanted him on a plane out of here that's the the understanding that I got from people okay but then if the idea is a pause rather than a ceasefire what happens after that you've we've got some foreigners out still got millions of Palestinians stuck in Gaza Under Siege I mean does the the paws change the reality of doesn't change the reality it does mean that per they occupied they're under siege and they're bombed might they might have some food and water and medicines delivered but then they will be bombarded again okay very Bleak Outlook then what's happening with diplomacy is this the the big diplomatic solution that this seems at this stage to be all that diplomacy is able to achieve the UN Secretary General is currently um in or on his way from um from from Beijing to Cairo the humanitarian chief of the UN is uh also in Caro they'll be hoping that this pause and then delivery of Aid if it happens is a first step they can build on all right thanks so much James Bay always appreciate your input thanks for coming in
