well Egypt's President says he will not allow refugees from Gaza into his country adding that it would make the Sinai Peninsula a target for Israel the whole concept of transferring Palestinians from the Gaza Strip into Sinai is simply moving the fighting and resistance from the Gaza Strip to Sinai which means Sinai will become a base for military operations against Israel and then Israel will try to defend itself and direct its military operations against Egypt and Egypt is committed to establishing peace we should remain dedicated to our investment in the peace process we should come up with a viable solution if there is a transfer let it be to the Negev Desert in Israel let Israel do what they wish to do with the military operatives in Gaza before returning the Palestinians back all acts by Israel cutting water and electricity is a means to forcibly transfer Palestinians into the Sinai Peninsula which we totally reject well let's take a closer look at the Rafa crossing the sole crossing point between Egypt and the southern end of the Gaza Strip it's gaza's only Lifeline to the outside world but supplies coming into Gaza through Rafa require Israeli approval and it's also only for small vehicles and the movement of people now the other Crossing in the south is Karam Abu Salam it's located where the borders of Egypt Gaza and Israel meet it's also the sole passage for larger trucks carrying goods Fuel and Aid into Gaza hundreds of tons of aid from several countries have been held up in Egypt pending a deal for its safe delivery to Gaza and the evacuation of some foreign passport holders through the other Rafa border crossing well we can now speak to Hussein haridi he's the former Egyptian assistant foreign minister he joins me now from Cairo sir I'll start by asking you for your reaction to president cce's statement we just listened to can you explain for our viewers why Cairo is so adamant that Palestinian refugees should not be sent to Egypt or Jordan the question from an Egyptian point of view as explained uh by President CC this morning is that we we reject the uh transfer of uh Palestinians either from Gaza to Sinai or or from the West Bank to Jordan because uh we are for the establishment of an independent Palestinian State uh uh on the West Bank and in G if the Palestinians in both uh the West Bank and Gaza would leave their territories then there will never be a Palestinian State that's that the reason why Egypt is against the transfer of uh Palestinians to either Egypt or or Jordan of course in the same time the president pointed out that we want to uh send humanitarian Aid into the Gaza Strip and that the G and that the Egyptian side of the Rafa Crossing has always been open the problem was on the Palestinian side that was bombarded on various occasions by the Israeli Air Force uh on the other hand the president made clear that when Egypt had signed a peace treaty with Israel uh in 1979 uh it was betting on peace not only between Egypt and Israel but peace for the Palestinians and peace between uh between Israel and other Arab countries mainly Lebanon Syria and Jordan Jordan signed the peace treaty back in October 1994 and and and of course we are working the president said today that for peace from an egptian point of view is a strategic option quoting him and we would we would like that the the International Community particularly the United States will join Egypt in its efforts to make to make this dream come true so I have a number of questions for you about the International Community and and those efforts in just a moment but I want to pick up on what you were saying there about humanitarian Aid because we have been hearing that there is some kind of Aid agreement that's been reached the US president was saying so but there have been scant details and we know that what Israel and the US was asking for for foreign Nationals to leave for hostages to be released do you know more about the framework of this steal well according to what president President Biden uh made clear uh before he left Israel today he said that he agreed with the Israeli leaders that humanitarian Aid would enter uh the uh Gaza Strip and uh after that the Israeli Prime Minister made a statement in which he said that uh Aid humanitarian a Aid would cross into Gaza only from the RAF Crossing uh President Biden President Biden mentioned uh that the uh entry of the aid would be subjected to inspection inspection and uh this is the first condition the second condition will be that the aid or some parts of the aid won't go to Hamas we have no problem we have no problem although the question of inspection raises raises in itself some some some interrogation marks uh but anyhow the most important the most urgent uh uh task right now is that the convoys of human humanitarian Aid start entering the Gaza Strip as soon as possible so let me ask you about the logistics here because it's my understanding that Rafa is is a relative ly small border crossing right so a lot of the trucks would actually need to travel through Karam Abu Salam that would be the Principal route in for Aid how much control does Egypt have of that Crossing well as you said in your report or one of your reporters correspondents just made made clear Karam Abu is is is initially it was for threat uh convoys H we will we will work with the United Nations we will work with the United Nations with the Israeli authorities in order to move the humanitarian Aid either from The Crossing if it's possible or from the kamam Abu Crossing well we certainly hope that those convoys do get moving very quickly indeed husin haridi there a former Egyptian assistant foreign minister thank you so much for spending time with us here on alera sir thank you madam
