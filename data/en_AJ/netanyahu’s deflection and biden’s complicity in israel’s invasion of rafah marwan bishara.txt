there a senior political analyst he joins us live from Paris Maran what do you think is going on in Rafa we've seen uh two attacks on in the in in the course of the last 72 hours two attacks on displaced people camps and now we're hearing that tanks have been spotted uh along the Philadelphia Corridor are you getting a sense that things are about to escalate well it is a full scale offensive even though the Israelis would like to call it limited in order to please the bid Administration but this is a fullscale invasion of Rafa and it is more of the same that we've seen the past 8 months what is uh something what is different and perhaps uhit surprising for some people who were listening to the rulings in the uh icj International cour of justice and listen to the uh prosecutor of the international criminal court they would have thought uh that things would wind down that the Israeli government would be you know smart enough uh to slow down its war crimes in Gaza in fact what we're seeing is exactly the opposite Israel is escalating its War it's intensifying its offensive against Rafa killing dozens and more of people every day destroying whatever left of hospitals in the city as we've been reporting uh from there right Mar exactly as you say I mean we we've heard from the IC uh saying that prime minister netan is guilty of war crimes we've had the icj ruling just a few days ago demanding that Israel stop its operation in Rafa and yet here we are we are seeing this escalation so how can we how can Israel be held accountable for this well clearly the Israelis are trying to be smart or clever clever meaning they're trying to keep up an appearance of uh being clever about their war crimes so they're talking more about investigations and they're talking more about mistakes as if everyday's mistakes is a mistake no everyday's mistakes over 8 months is a pattern and the pattern is a pattern of war crimes and they try to deflect that with more lies lying is a strategy now for the Israeli government not just a tactic but in the end of the day if you simply look at the statistics and I've been looking at them today this is what comes up and please you know I hope our viewers around the world will pay attention to the math if the United States where Gaza today we would be talking about 16 million casualties 5 million deaths including 2 million children killed by Israelis in Gaza the past 8 months 16 million casualties 5 million American deaths 2 million American children killed if we talk proportionally between Gaza of 2.3 million and America of some 340 million this is the situation today in Gaza the Israelis try to deflect and use all kinds of uh propaganda in order to show that they in fact they care for human life or as Netanyahu likes to put it civilian deaths is a tragedy for Israel a strategy for Hamas well hug this is all crap coming out of the Israelis who are responsible for the war crimes and for the death and destruction in Gaza Maron uh I'm just going to bring up one more point with you because uh we're just seeing a report uh I'm just seeing it on the news wires that the US military has been forced to suspend Aid deliveries to Gaza by sea from that temporary Pier that they built because it's been damaged by bad weather this is interesting of course because uh we we know the the main Aid coming into Gaza has been through RAF but that's no longer possible with the Israelis with the Israeli Army there so this new Port if you like was the only way just a tiny bit of Aid could trickle through and now even that is closed yeah know let me tell you what's really important and probably unintentional uh by the Americans as they uh established that portable Port um in Gaza they presumably tried to take a bit of a distance from the Israelis to say if Israel doesn't want to let the aid in we will try to help although all the United Nations agency have said it's not sufficient we need the land uh Crossings to be open but what it says it basically proves that America Israel's foremost Ally does believe that Israel has been blocking Aid and medical and food to to enter Gaza which is a war crime which is what been at the heart of the indictment uh by the prosecutor of the inter international criminal court and which has been at the heart of the international court of justice that Israel has weaponized hunger that Israel has intentionally blocked aid for months from coming into Gaza fuel food Medical Aid and so on so forth have been blocked pushing the Americans to try to take a bit bit of of a distance and construct a port that's apparently cost something like a quarter of a billion dollars only so that they don't put enough pressure on Israel or punish Israel for blocking the food from entering into Gaza so now there famine in Gaza as testified by almost every other person of knowledge on the subject and Israel is subject to war crimes and genocide at the icj and the ICC because of weaponizing hunger in Gaza thank you for your time Maran Bashar Al jazer senior political analyst there from Paris make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
