Palestinians across the occupied West Bank have declared a general strike to denounce Israel's war on Gaza the attack on Amasi on Saturday triggered their action Palestinians also protested on Saturday night in the cities of Janine Hebron and tubas to condemn the war nor OD joins me now from ralo in the occupied West Bank and no is the strike now underway and what's the scene across the West Bank well in most cities in the West Bank there is a general TR to protest what Palestinians have described as a massacre that took place yesterday uh in al- Maas in al- maasi a large scale bombardment that we at Al jazer have covered quite extensively of course this you know comes as the bare minimum of a the reflection of anger among Palestinians to express solidarity to feel that they're doing something to stand by their uh fellow Palestinians in Gaza as they feel helpless while also at the same time confronting Israeli raids we've seen Israeli raids overnight in ramala in alir in tarim in Dura south of of Hebron and several arrests so that reality of occupation and and Relentless War happening in Gaza raids and and and home demolitions and confiscation of land Happening Here in the West Bank coming full circle in this expression of solidarity in those gener eneral strikes no Beyond it being simply an expression of solidarity what actual impact do we think this general strike is likely to have there well unfortunately very little because this is just Palestinians trying to express that they are angry they're also angry at their fractured politics we have to note here that in ramala for example the factions the Palestinian factions were unable to agree to join the general strike while the same factions in other cities agreed on that as as I said the bare minimum expression of solidarity so it's one more Stark reminder that a fractured paralyzed Palestinian politics can do very little to help end the war or extend Aid to Palestinians who are in dire need of it at the moment in Gaza all right Nora many thanks for that nor and raana make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer now
