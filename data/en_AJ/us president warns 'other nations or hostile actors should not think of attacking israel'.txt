all right um sorry we're going to have to jump in and take you to Joe Biden speaking in Tel Aviv ever be alone most importantly the uh I know recent terrorist assault on the people of this nation has left a deep deep wound more than 1,300 innocent Israelis killed including at least 31 American citizens by the terrorist group Hamas hundreds hundreds of young people at am Music Festival the festival was for peace for peace gunned down as they ran for their lives scores of Innocents from infants to elderly grandparents Israelis and Americans taken hostage children slaughtered babies slaughtered entire families massacred rape beheadings bodies burned alive MOS committed atrocities that recall the worst ravages of Isis unleashing pure unadulterated evil upon the world there's no rationalizing it no excusing it period the brutality we saw would have cut deep anywhere in the world but it cuts deeper here in Israel October 7th which was sacred a sacred Jewish holiday became the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust it has brought to the surface painful memories and scars L by Millennia of anti-semitism in the genocide of the Jewish people the world watched then it knew and the world did nothing we will not stand by and do nothing again not today not tomorrow not ever to those who are living in limbo waiting desperately to learn the fate of a loved one especially to families of the hostages you're not alone we're working with Partners throughout the region pursuing every Avenue to bring home those who are being H captive by Hamas I can't speak publicly about all the details but let me assure you for me as the American president there's no higher priority than the release and safe return of all these hostages to those who are grieving a child a parent a spouse a sibling a friend I know you feel like there's that black hole in the middle of your chest you feel like you're being sucked into it the Survivor remorse the anger the questions of faith in your soul starting at staring at that empty chair sitting shiva the first Sabbath without them they're the everyday things small things that you miss the most the scent when you open the closet door the morning coffee you shared together the bend of his smile the perfect pitch of her laugh the giggle of your little boy the baby for those who have lost loved ones this is what I know they'll never be truly gone there's something that's never fully lost your love for them and their love for you and I promise you you'll be walking along some days and say what would she or he want me to do you smile when you pass a place that reminds you of them that's when you know when a smile comes to your lips before a tear to your eye that's you know you're going to to fully make it that's what will give you the fortitude to find light in the darkest hours when terrorists believe they could bring down bring you down bend your will break your resolve but they never did and they never will instead we saw incredible stories of heroism and courage Israelis taking care of one another neighbors forming watch groups protect their kibuts opening their homes to shelter survivors retired soldiers running into danger once again civilian Medics flying across rescue flying rescue missions and off-duty Medics at the music festival caring for the wounded before coming victim before becoming the victim himself volunteers retrieving bodies of the dead so families could bury their loved ones in accordance with Jewish tradition reservice leaving behind their families their honeymoons their studies abroad without hesitation and so much more the state of Israel is born to be a safe place for the Jewish people of the world that's why I was born blong said if Israel didn't exist we'd have to invent it while it may not feel that way today Israel must again be a safe place for the Jewish people and I promise you we're going to do everything in our power to make sure that it will be 75 years ago just 11 minutes after its founding president Harry S Truman and the United States of America became the first nation to recognize Israel we've stood by your side ever since we're going to Stand By Your Side now my Administration been in close touch with your leadership from the first moments of this attack we're going to make sure we have what you have what you need to protect your people to defend your nation for decades we've ensured Israel's qualitative military Edge and later this week I'm going to ask the United States Congress for unprecedented support package for Israel's defense we're going to keep Iron Dome fully supplied so we can continue standing Sentinel over Israeli Skies saving Israeli lives we' moved US military assets to the region including positioning the USS Ford carrier strike group in the Eastern Mediterranean with the USS seisen on the way to deter to defer further aggression against Israel and to prevent this conflict from spreading the world will know that Israel is Israel is stronger than ever and my message to any state or any other hostile actor thinking about attacking Israel Remains the Same as it was a week ago don't don't don't since this terrorist terrorist attack took place we've seen it described as Israel's 9/11 but for a nation the size of Israel was like 15 911s the scale may be different but I'm sure those Horrors have tapped into so some kind of Primal feeling in Israel just like it did felt in the United States shock pain rage and all consuming rage I understand and many Americans understand you can't can't look at what has happened here to your mothers your fathers your grandparents Sons daughters children even babies and not scream out for justice justice must be done but I caution this while you feel that rage don't be consumed by it after 911 we were in Rage in the United States while we sought Justice and got Justice we also made mistakes and the first US president to visit Israel in time of War I made wartime decisions I know the choices are never clear or easy for the leadership there's always cost but it requires being deliberate requires asking very hard questions it requires clarity about the objectives and an honest assessment about whether the path you're on will achieve those objectives the vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people Hamas uses innocence innocent families in Gaza as human Shields putting their command centers their weapons their Communications tunnels and residential areas Palestinian people are suffering greatly as well we mourn the loss of innocent Palestinian lives like the entire world I was outraged and saddened by the enormous loss of life yesterday in the hospital in Gaza based on the information we've seen today it appears a result of an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza the United States unequivocally stands for the protection of civilian life during conflict and I grieve I truly grieve for the families who were killed or wounded by this tragedy people of Gaza need food water medicine shelter today I asked the Israeli cabinet I met with for some time this morning to agree to the delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza based on their understanding that there will be inspections that the aid should go to civilians not to Hamas Israel agreed the humanitarian assistance can begin to move from Egypt to Gaza let me be clear if amas diverts or steals the assistance they will have demonstrated once again that they have no concern for the welfare of the Palestinian people and it will end as a practical matter it will it will stop the International Community from being able to provide this Aid we're working in close cooperation with the government of Egypt the United Nations and its agencies like the world program and other partners in the region to get trucks moving across the border as soon as possible separately I ask Israel that the global Community demand that the International Red Cross be able to visit hostages I just demanded that the United States fully a just demand that the United States fully supports today I'm also announcing $100 million in new US funding for humanitarian assistance in both Gaza and the West Bank this money will support more than one million displaced and conflict affected Palestinians including emergency needs in Gaza you are a Jewish State you are a Jewish state but you're also a democracy un likee the United States you don't live by the rules of terrorists you live by the rule of law when conflicts flare you live by the law of Wars what sets us apart from the terrorists is we believe in the fundamental Dignity of every human life Israeli Palestinian Arab Jew Muslim Christian everyone you can't give up what makes you who you are if you give that up then the terrorist win and we can never let them win you know Israel is a miracle a Triumph of faith and resolve and resilience over impossible pain and loss think about October 7th the Jewish holiday where you read about the death of Moses a tragic story of a profound loss to an entire nation a death that could have left helpless hopelessness in the hearts of the entire of entire nation but though Moses died his memory his message his lessons have lived on for generations of the Jewish people as well as many others and just as the memory of your loved ones will live on as well after reading the story of moses' death those who observe the holiday began reading the Torah from the very beginning the story of creation reminds us of two things first that when we get knocked down we get back up again and we begin a new and second when we're faced with tragedy and loss we must go back to the beginning and remember who we are we are all human beings creating the image of God With Dignity humanity and purpose in the darkness to be the light unto the world is what we're about you inspire hope and light for so many around the world that's what the terrorists seek to destroy that's what they seek to destroy because they live in darkness but not you not Israel nations of conscience like the United States and Israel are not measured solely by the example or power we're measured by the power of our example that's why as hard as it is must keep pursuing peace must keep pursuing a path so that Israel and the Palestinian people can both live safely in Security in dignity and in peace for me that means a two-state solution must keep working for Israel's greater integration with his neighbors these attacks have only strengthen my commitment and determination and my will to get that done I'm here to tell you the terrorist will not win Freedom will win so let me end where I began Israel You're Not Alone United States stands with you I told the story before and I'll tell it again of my first meeting with an Israeli Prime Minister 50 years ago as a young Senator I was sitting across from Golden mayair at her desk in her office and she had a guy named a guy who later became prime minister sitting next to me just before the 1973 yam kapor war and she flipped the maps up and down telling me how bad things were and how terrible they were all of a sudden she looked at me and she said would you like a photograph I looked at her she she got up from her desk and walked down into that hallway I think it's Marble forign walked down the hallway we walk down there were a bunch of photographers standing in front of us we're standing shoulder toosh shoulder without her looking at me she said to me knowing i' hear why do you look so worried Senator Biden and I said worried like of course I'm worried and she looked at me and she didn't look she said we don't worry senator we Israelis have a secret weapon we have nowhere else to go well today I say to all of Israel the United States isn't going anywhere either we're going to stand with you we'll walk beside you in those dark days and walk beside you in the good days to come and they will come as you say in Hebrew which I'm not going to attempt to do because I'm such a terrible linguist I'll say in English the people of Israel live the people of Israel live Israel will be safe secure Jewish and Democratic state today tomorrow and forever may God protect all those who work for peace God save those who are still In Harm's Way thank you very much Mr President what is your You Are Not Alone we will not stand by and do nothing we are pursuing every Avenue Israel must again be a safe place the words there of the US President Joe Biden recounting some of the suffering that Israel felt on October the 7th when he said more than 1300 Israelis were killed children slaughtered pure unadulterated evil he went on to reference Palestinian Ian suffering saying he Mourns the Palestinian loss of life but at the same time he went on to blame Palestinian groups for the attack we saw last night in Gaza City when alah Hospital the Baptist hospital was hit saying he believes it was errant rocket Fire by a terror group let's bring in Alan fiser who's in telis Allan distilling this speech this is clearly a strong message of support that will not be shaken for Israel regardless of what one sees the last 24 hours or 48 Hours on the ground that's right and also suggesting that uh the information that he received from the Pentagon uh points to the fact that this was a a fair fielded missile firing from inside Gaza rather than an operation carried out by Israel uh a couple of interesting things Joe Biden really needed deliverables from this visit and he seems to have convinced the Israeli War cabinet that they do have to open up humanitarian corridors and trucks of Aid will start getting into Gaza very soon not quite clear whether or not there'll also be the Dual Nationals who have been at the Raa Crossing will be able to leave as well but Joe Biden's saying that screening is now in place to make sure that those trucks can start getting in that was a concern of the Israelis Anthony blinkin had mentioned the fact that the the aid was likely to start flowing on on Sunday but that was the main stumbling B it looks as if that may well have uh been overcome and and Joe Biden trying to be the honest broker by suggesting that of course the answer to to the issues in the Middle East is greater engagement with Israel and we've seen that through the Abraham Accords but also a two-state solution and standing in Tel Aviv saying that that is the The Way Forward uh but also he's deeply concerned about the number of people that are being held captive he doesn't know how many Americans might be among the number we've certainly seen people here who've been demanding their return uh throughout the course of the day but he is also aware that politically uh a hostage crisis and presidential elections are not words that go well together so he will when he says that you can't I can't speak of everything that's going on but my Administration is working very hard to make sure that those people are returned there's a number of reasons for that not least of which is political and the domestic front all right thanks so much alen fiser there
