the Israeli military says its forces are on the outskirts of Gaza City tanks and soldiers have crossed into the area three main locations this marks the deepest incursion into the territory since Israel withdrew from Gaza back in 2005 the Israeli military says 18 soldiers have been killed since the ground offensive began last week let's go now to Alan fiser he joins us live from occupied East Jerusalem so what are they saying about the mountain casualties uh we are told that uh there has been a lot of intense fighting in and around Gaza that the Israeli forces are finding that they're coming up against anti-tank battalions they're also coming up against uh hang grades being thrown at them and landmines we know that one of their senior commanders of the armor Brigade has been killed he was a man that was regarded as a hero in Israel because of how he uh turned his troops round on the 7th of October and fought back against Hamas he has now died and this comes just a couple of days after the Israelis said that they killed hamas's main anti-tank organizer and they said that that this would make things easier as they move further into to the Gaza Strip but it's clear the urban fighting that they expected to to encounter it's there and and it's slowing their progress they might not be moving as fast as many analysts thought they would in the early days of this conflict and Alan we know the US Secretary of State is heading to the region tomorrow what's expected to be his mission this time well he's coming to find out what Israel's new military objectives are you remember that Anthony blinkin was here twice before the ground war actually started he will again reiterate his support for Israel and the right to defend themselves as long as they do it within international law both humanitarian law and the rules of war and he gave evidence on Capitol Hill earlier this week and we heard him say that there would be no ceasefire that that would be a benefit to Hamas there is some suggestion that he might call for a humanitarian pause but certainly given his comments earlier this week that seems unlikely now during that hearing he said that perhaps the uh Palestinian Authority could play an enhanced role in governing Gaza after the war well just in the last 30 minutes or so Hamas has released a statement saying it is rude and arant of the United States to try and suggest such a thing that they reject blatant attempts to intervene and impose a new regime in Gaza itself uh now we know that Anthony blinkin will meet with senior government figures here his intention then is to go to a man in Jordan where he'll meet uh King Abdullah there and then he will go to turkia and he will speak to uh the the president and and senior members of the turkia government there's always the possibility as we saw back in October that Anthony blinkin could add steps on to this visit but clearly his visit here uh his visit to Israel on Friday is going to be uh the most significant o of all his discussions all right we'll leave it there thanks so much Alan fiser well Alan liel is a former director general of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a former Israeli ambassador to South Africa joins us now from Tel Aviv good to have you with us so first of all do you think Benjamin netan has made the release of Israeli captives in Gaza a priority I think it is up on his agenda but naturally with the last days of fighting inside the Gaza strep all the focus is on the fighting but I think the Israeli government has it high on its agenda the families are acting also independently they have headquarters in Tel Aviv of the 232 families and they are reaching out to the world with the stories of the people in captivity and they trying to send up a message outside Israel and to the Israeli government that they think a a deal should be done fast and even using the term all for all so I'm in almost daily touch with families and trying to help the families as far as we can now over the last few days when we've been speaking and interviewing with Hamas officials they've said they would be willing to release the Israeli captives if Palestinian prisoners could be released if essential Goods could be allowed into Gaza and the bombing could be halted do you think that's something of a starting point at the very least that Israel could engage with if this government of Benjamin Netanyahu wanted I can first of all I'm not the Israeli government as you know and I don't speak on behalf of the Israeli government your perspective or your analysis and I can give you my feeling and the feelings of some of the families ER I think what we should try focus on is a the term all for all I think as you tie to the Daily fighting it is complicated thing complicating things but I think this term all for all should be H thoroughly examined and and the definitely the families are in favor of it and the families as you know have some cloud and the voice is being heard and I I think if we can disassociate H this uh preparations for an exchange from the daily fighting ER it will it might make it easier I'm glad you mentioned the the families because as we see an intensification of the air strikes on Gaza in what balum the Israeli Human Rights group called in its report a criminal policy of Revenge what Amnesty International said on October 19th that the air strikes were violations of international law as families see that this not only claims more and more Palestinian civilian lives but according to Hamas also the lives of some of the civilian Israeli captives is that pressure going to intensify in turn on the Israeli Prime Minister look again I'm taking the angle of the families and only the angle of the families and the families want the people in captivity released no definitions now they are very very worried as the fighting is inside Gaza and they guess their people are inside Gaza you can imagine how parents feel about their children and I just came from a meeting with them they want the people in captivity out and if it will be done in an exchange in an exchange the more we push into it all kind of definitions and all kind kind of additional conditions beyond the all for all it it will not happen even the all for all itself is complicated because you don't know who holds who and where and so on so I think I think and this is the feeling I get from the families that if H all Sites including the International Community will try to examine an all for all exchange we might make progress H if we push this issue of People in captivity into the overall picture it will be much more difficult to arrange any release or exchange all right we'll leave it there thanks so much for your thoughts on that thank you
