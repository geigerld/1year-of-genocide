we have placed 10 newborns prematurely born babies on on one bed because these children they need a particular temperature they need a particular respiration and ventilators particular nutrition they need High medical care now they are in a very perilous and precarious situation now the risk of the entire power outage going from the entire hospital this will be a great threat we are talking about prematurely born babies weighing between 800 to 2,000 Gams such ways require very Intensive Care Unit and we have lost two kids so far there are shocking images I have them unfortunately I don't have internet connection to show them because the occupation has severed uh internet connection on all uh channels of communication okay so just to reiterate what you're telling us doctor there were 39 newborn babies prematurely born in incubators and two of them have now died after being taken out of their incubators can you tell us exactly why they've been taken out of those incubators is it because of a lack of electricity because of a lack of fuel due to lack of fuel that generates power and electricity to the incubators without fuel we can't function we can't operate and there will be no electricity these incubators are powered by electricity at a particular temperature and oxygen supplies have been hit that feed these incubators therefore they died due to three reasons low temperature lack of oxygen uh they died therefore now what we are doing is that we are warming these children using primitive methods we inject inject and place them or surround them with warm water and cover them in order to warm them up however this situation can't continue for long has anyone offered to has we understand that this is not sustainable has anyone offered to help with these babies we communicated with International Red Cross they gave us permission to move them from one place to another within one hour that's that's the only thing that the Red Cross was able to do we we requested protection for these children and protection for all patients in the Intensive Care Unit however they told us that you have only one hour to remove these children from one place to another now we place the children in a very unhealthy uh places that is not conducive to their condition these children were born after less than S months of pregnancy weighing less than 2,000 grams they need very very very high um Medical Care they are left in normal room a regular room regular beds without the needed requirements and accommodation for uh prematurely born babies they need particular temperature particular ventilators uh particular nutrition particular type of milk all these are lacking now now we are struggling to save their lives using primitive methods using manual simple methods but however this is very unsustainable and I say that this place we have electricity until the morning only once electricity is out these children will die will die just like the previous two Dr Salia the Israeli military has said that they've offered to evacuate these babies out of Al shifa hospital is this the case that is not the case at all I am in touch with them they contacted me I offered them I told them that I have patients and I have uh babies incub incubators and I need them to I need to remove them to a safe place I offered this but they didn't respond I requested to evacuate them using es to Safe places safe places means another hospital we can't leave them like they did with ar hospital when they told the children to go wherever you can this will not happen with children in incubators in this way children will die on the way we want safe exit with with safe and secure medical supervision to arrive to safely to another hospital now all the hospitals in Gaza Strip in in the North and South cannot receive this High number of children in incubators we are demanding from the entire world from your uh platform we need to take them out safely using safe ambulances and incubators and that's exactly what I want to ask you Dr Salia there are very few functioning medical facilities left in Gaza after one month of Israeli bombardment if you are able to organize the safe passage for these new newborn babies to get them the care they need where can they go are you saying that they will need to leave Gaza to get the care they need exactly exactly now in Gaza and the northern of Gaza there is no place not a single medical facility even arantis pediatrics hospital they have been completely closed they can't receive any cases so where to go with these children do we throw them out in the street this will not happen we will stay with them until they are secured safely and I reiterate they need to be secured and transported to a safe place using safe ambulances with with safe uh ventilators safe uh medical staff to a safe destination if this is these guarantees are offered by the Red Cross we will do this because we will not let our children die on the street
