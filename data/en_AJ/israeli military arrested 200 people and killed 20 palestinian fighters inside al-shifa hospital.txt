Israeli forces remain inside elifa hospital after launching a fourth raid since the war on Gaza began after shelling and shooting inside the complex Israeli troops have been going room to room detaining people Sheltering inside the Israeli military says 20 people were killed in the siege it says Hamas Fighters were hiding in the building well in a few moments we'll speak to vill Marx who is an occupied East Jerusalem for us but first let go to hanim mmud who is live for us in Rafa in southern Gaza and honey Israeli forces is still at Al shifa what's the latest you're hearing from there yes Tom well let's start with the fact that is really military with Drew from the inside the asifa complex when what seem to be a tactical withdrawal and one more time stormed the hospital at later hours and right now what is doing on the ground and bulldozing the courtyard of the of the hospital the front yard the backyard of the hospital and conducting an aggressive search building to building room to room and also Warehouse inside shifa hospital and been doing so it causing a great deal of damage to the property and a really overwhelmed and damage to property from the time it was a storm uh in early December uh last year uh but right now we're looking at the an an unconfirmed reports right now various reports about large number of people have been uh detained inside the hospital other than the previous numbers uh of early mornings of of yesterday we're looking at closer to 150 or a little over than depending on the uh the kind of reports that we're looking at still unconfirmed but there are at least 20 people have been killed inside a shifa complex as the storm continued and one of the people were killed inside the hospital is a top security Comm commander who have been coordinating the efforts between Gaza Clans and Ona and have successfully secured the delivery of a 0 trucks within the past two days uh to uh the northern part of Gaza City at the northern part of the strip and Gaza City and by doing so the according to what we heard from a people in Gaza and the northern part by killing this command security Commander uh they're looking at more chaotic situations are going to happen as uh it just it shattered a sense of safety security for other people to uh continue coordinating uh this kind of work on to deliver Aid to the northern part and Gaza City and honey it's it's not just elifa is it there there have been more strikes and attacks elsewhere overnight too yes well the air strikes continue to pound also at the vicinity of of aifa complex more of the residential buildings are not only being relentlessly bombed right now we've heard about two residential buildings at the northern gate of the shifa hospital they've been completely destroyed uh also from the southern part of the complex one more residential building a mosque at the western part of of it overnight air strikes here in rafah City targeted several area in central raan eastern part of the city killing at least 14 people and again we're look at the same pattern of people who are being killed by these attacks uh overnight women and children displaced families inside uh residential homes so at least three areas were targeted overnight attacks in Gaza City at almost at the same time when the overnight attacks happen in ra another Relentless air strike in West in the uh northern part of Gaza City mainly in a shwan district where a residential home with displaced families inside of it where uh destroyed the initial reports talk about six people who transferred to Kamal adwan hospital and large number of injuries but again we're looking since asifa hospital is under military Siege right now and the the military is operating inside of it all it transferred to a really a a a overwhelmed and almost out of service Hospital in the northern part kamalan hospital that put the life of those injuries at risk right now as there is no medical uh treatment or medical supply available to do to save lives right now okay thanks so much honey we really appreciate it as always honey mmud for us there in Rafa okay let's bring in vill Marx who is in occupied East Jerusalem for us and vill what is the result of the Israeli operation so far from their point of view well thean military's last major statement on this came overnight they talked about the fact that they were continuing their operations in and around the complex they'd arrested 200 people they suspected of acting against them they're now interrogating investigating those individuals they said that they killed 20 people don't forget they said they came under Fire they returned fire from several Hospital buildings they also said that they had killed an individual called f makbul they described him as a senior special operations directorate for hamas's internal security people we've spoken to in Gaza though this morning have said he was a law enforcement officer no doubt part of the Hamas structure but essentially a policeman and had played a critical role over the last few weeks in making sure that Aid convoys through the strip could pass safely and unhindered so his death something the Israeli government the Israeli military talking about as significant it will be interesting to see what that means for law enforcement and that kind of support for Aid convoys in the days ahead yeah indeed vill what does the raid ultimately say about us Israel's continued military activities in Gaza it shows very clearly that areas that they had previously operated in including this complex as early as November are still places where they come under Fire presumably from Hamas Fighters they said they acted on intelligence to go back into this Hospital complex they are not just going to be focused on Rafa which has been really really important both from their perspective militarily but from an international pressure perspective because of the numbers of individuals civilians in that region in that southern part of Gaza this seems to indicate that it's going to be incredibly complicated over the next few weeks to hold onto territory in Gaza for the Israeli military without coming under attack from Hamas and that again is another reason there may be further pressure on the Israeli government to try and figure out a ceasefire deal okay thank you thank you so much vill uh vill marks for us there in occupied East Jerusalem
