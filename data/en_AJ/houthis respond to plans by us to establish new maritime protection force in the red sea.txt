while houthis in Yemen have released a new statement after reports the US is planning to establish a new Maritime protection force in the Red Sea houthis have been carrying out attacks on commercial ships passing through those Waters as Bernard was just describing they say they're targeting ships linked to Israel in protest against military actions in Gaza in a statement a prominent houthi Commander said quote any escalation in Gaza is an escalation in the Red Sea and any Cal in Gaza is considered a calm in the Red Sea he went on to say any country or party that comes between us and Palestine we will confront it Hussein Alti is a political commentator he's joining us live from Yemen's capital S thank you very much indeed for being with us why do the houthis feel that targeting shipping in this way is the best way to bring pressure on Israel the Us and other foreign governments uh I mean it's clear the important of this shib line especially after they target Israeli link to own the ship or is or ships that's actually hidden to Israel they have warned before those ships not to use the Red Sea and we've seen according to uh some International media as an example the elot port Southern of of occupied Palestine is is out of out of business at this point and many ship that they were heading toward uh uh some part of uh of the Z state of Israel in the Mediterranean Sea has stopped as an example a shiing giant called o which based on Hong Kong they have said that they will stop any shiing toward Israel and it's really strange for the other giant shipping company like MK and other one from France and Germany they have declared that they will not use the Red Sea actually they are the one who going to lose a big huge amount of money because Yen Army only declared that they will Target any ship that is going to Israel or have any goes to be delivered toward Israel and I think that has a great pressure on Israel if it hasn't got any pressure why Israel is calling for the International Community to respond why bamin netan he said if they aren going to respond we will respond we will give the the Germany Britain and uh us uh few days to respond this show you that actually the this kind of attack is hurting Israeli economy and it's really really symbol in here in Yemen they have bought it Israel will LIF its blade against Gaza and allow food and medicine and fuel ENT Gaza and this is actually the request of the united nation of the human right groups uh to lift the blockade against Gaza is not only a request from Yemen so uh Israel do that all that will stop as soon as they stop their attack against Gaza you the statement that I referred to before said that any escalation in Gaza houthis would regard any escalation in Gaza would uh as a resulting escalation in houthi action uh against the US and Israel and in the Red Sea what would you regard as an escalation in Gaza and I want to ask you also about the US plan to increase the number of uh Naval protection ships that are going to be in the Red Sea would you regard that as an escalation uh first of all any escalation in Gaza it would be the continues of Israeli attack and blockade on Gaza uh and any escalation in the Red Sea it could it it is considered any uh slightly movement from the so-call the new Coalition that the United States is trying uh to to build in the Red Sea if any interference with Y many forces either trying to take a ship or trying to attack a ship if any interference will come in the Red Sea against our S Forces or any interference will will Target any position or missile launch position inside Yemen the targeting uh do ship this could be considered an escalation and this could actually turn the entire Red Sea into a battle Zone and the big one who going to lose from this is the uh is is the west and as well uh they have warned country that actually have bases in uh have American bases especially Saudi Arabia United Arab emirat and bahin and other country because we they believe here that any attack against Yemen it could actually be launched from those country because the Red Sea is really a narrow sea it will be hard for the United State to avoid any attack against it ship that's why if any attack will come from this country as Muhammad baiti have said A week ago he's one of thei leaders he said that uh they will not let any single oil field or gas field or oil tanker or any ship belong to this uh country they will set it on a fire and I believe that the entire region actually will come uh as soon as United States will try to attack Yemen the entire region will get into a flame and the United States and Europe should rethink again because it's winter now they are in very very big need of this uh oil coming from this country that's why the one who's having now the upper hand is the many forces because they are the one who control of the Red Sea and as well they are the one who in control of bab mandab husin alari is a political commentator he's been joining us live from Yemen's Capital Sana thank you very much indeed for being with us houi attack in the Red Sea and US plans to increase a naval presence there major shipping firms are suspending Passage through the Baba mandab straet following a series of attacks by Iran backed Hui Fighters the attacks have targeted commercial ships traveling to egyp sus canal through the Red Sea as they approach the narrow Babel mandab straight to the South a strategically important and busy Waterway between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula is only 32 km wide through which 12% of the world's trade passes 10% of global oil carried by ships also goes through the straight some companies have started taking a longer Route Around Africa and the Cape of Good Hope which will increase the trip from about 19 days to 31 days adding to the costs and delays we're going to speak to our correspondent Hashim aabar who's in the studio here with us and he's been covering Yemen and that part of the world for many years we were talking to uh houie political commentator just a moment ago and he was saying that it was that the houthis were determined that they were going to be able to manage this situation in the Red Sea that they were going to be able to control the shipping lanes even if the US brought in this multinational um Coalition of forces what is interesting is the fact that only a few years ago we were talking about the houthis as an armed group who's defending parts of of Yemen and trying to take control of other parts of Yemen now we're essentially they're in in a process of being able to as they would suggest it throt one of the key shipping lanes in the world indeed this is a defining moment for the huthis because with their military capabilities they can easily disrupt the traffic other at Sea particularly given that they have the missiles the Drone attacks they have a maritime uh Force which is deployed across the coastal areas that can pose serious threat in mment the problem with Babel M which is the southern Outlet of the Red Sea is that at the narrowest point is about 18 miles with all the LG ships and oil tankers massive vessels deployed cruising through that area any attack any incident can clog all that area which can have far-reaching consequences not on the region but on the global economy because you have a a huge chunk of the volume of oil fuel and G Energy that cruises through that area and we've seen the huis further escalating their attacks why are they doing this for two key reasons first of all they're bolstering their popularity in an unprecedented way I was with the huthis about 12 years ago when they were a very small uh group operating in the northern part of the country 2014 they've expanded their influence and they took over the capital 2015 they move South the Saudis launched an attack against them to try to push them back nine years later they still control a vast territory in the northern part of the country came October the 7th they are widely perceived to be across many parts of the Arab and Muslim world the only group that stood against the Israelis and the Americans because of their attacks targeting elat and particularly the attacks targeting commercial ships what happens tomorrow we have to wait and see but when you look at most of the uh tweets by seniori officials they say they're adamant of the need to continue the fight I want to widen this out uh slightly because at the start of the the Israeli War in Gaza us support was speculated to be based on their its perception that the war would serve to show Iran that some of its Iran's proxies could be controlled Hamas is said to be one of them the hudis are said to be another how much of this do you think this plan to expand the naval presence the multinational Naval presence in this particular region could actually raise tensions with Iran it could and it could further destabilize the region the Americans believe that they can replicate what they did in 2008 by establishing the naval task force that was combating Somali pirates but this is different political landscape although there's a general perception that the hthis are backed by Iran but also there was always this consensus that you you'd better have the huis control the northern part of the country instead you will have alqa or other ofs take over which could just lead to further instability just before October the 7th the Saudis were on the verge of signing a breakthrough deal with the hthy that could put an end to the conflict in the region it was sheld they were waiting to see what happens in the upcoming weeks I don't think the Saudis are willing to see this further escalate into a confrontation if the Americans decide tomorrow they have targets they will start stri striking in Yemen the huis will definitely have to retaliate retaliation will be creating more upset for the Saudis in particular so I don't see the Saudis willing to move forward will you be able to have Arab and Muslim countries joining this Naval task force that is going to Target a Muslim country I have my own personal doubts about it so it's going to be an extremely delicate F line that the Americans will have to walk in the upcoming weeks to convince many people to join this task force kashm thank you very much indeed hasham aabar bringing us up to date and giving us that analysis there thank you
