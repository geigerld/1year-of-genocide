the first senior Israeli official has resigned over hamas's October attack the military intelligence Chief took responsibility for major security failures what message does it send during Israel's war on Gaza and could it be the first step towards accountability this is Inside Story [Music] hello and welcome to the program I'm Muhammad jamj more than six months after Hamas carried out an ambitious multi-prong defensive on Southern Israel the highest ranking Israeli government official has stepped down in his resignation letter Major General Aaron haliva noted that Authority comes with responsibility and admitted the military intelligence directorate under his command had failed to warn of the October 7th attack it comes as public outrage against perceived Israeli government and military failures gains momentum we'll delve into the ramifications of jiva's departure and examine the demands for accountability with our panel in a moment but first this report from Axel zovich a major shakeup at the highest level of Israeli military intelligence Major General aarun haliva has stepped down more than 6 months after the surprise attack by Hamas fighters on Southern Israel that killed 1,139 people his res Nation letter States the intelligence directorate under my command did not fulfill its task I have carried that black day with me ever since haliva had already taken full responsibility publicly in the days after the offensive but stayed on due to the ongoing war in Gaza now he's become the first senior Israeli official to resign over the lapse in security reports suggest up to a year before the October 7th attack Israel had received intelligence that Hamas Was preparing for an effect ensive in the days leading up to it both allies and Israeli military intelligence noted unusual activity in Gaza but those warnings were not heated and the Israeli military was taken by surprise leading to a delayed response haliva has called for the establishment of a state committee to fully investigate the failings that led to the unprecedented assault his resignation has increased pressure on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who has resisted calls to step down there is uh one line that uh was uh directed is directed to uh the Prime Minister he says Authority comes with responsibility and Netanyahu is the highest Authority and he never took responsibility so actually Mr khwa wanted to set kind of a personal mess message to nany uh to tell him if I can do it you also should do it with ala's departure the focus now turns to how Israel's military and political leadership will address the growing public demand for accountability Axel zovich Al jazer for Inside Story all right let's go ahead and bring in our panel in London Daniel Levy is the president of the US Middle East project he advised AUD Barack when he served as Israeli Prime Minister in Sydney Australia Anthony Lowenstein is the author of The recently published book The Palestine laboratory a global investigation into how Israel's occupation has provided a testing ground for weapons and Technology exported globally and in Tel Aviv Gideon Levy is a columnist for the haret newspaper and the author of the punishment of Gaza a book about the development of the Israeli policy that led to the 2009 invasion of the Gaza Strip a warm welcome to you all and thanks so much for joining us today on Inside Story Daniel let me start with you today so Military Intelligence Chief Aaron haliva has become the first senior Israeli official to resign over failures to prevent the October 7th attack I'm curious about the timing why step down now and will this set the stage for more resignations I cannot speak to that question of timing there are rumors regarding uh one of his deputies having to have left for health issues which may have actually delayed uh jiva's uh departure there is certainly speculation and there has been for some time that some of the security military Chiefs uh who have very early on stated their intention that they would not continue uh after the end of this War I think it's clear that Netanyahu is looking at a a long War a Forever War perhaps um that that they would step down I think for some this was in intended to build pressure on the Prime Minister it may be that some now feel that there is no pressure on the Prime Minister and that this is a way of trying to generate that of course uh there's no serious uh undertaking of a commission of inquiry but I think one can get lost in those granular details and miss the big picture which is that whether it's inside the military or the political class the ability to seriously reflect uh on not just what happened on that day and this is the crucial thing if one focuses narrowly on this idea that there was an intelligence failure and it almost cches the essence of everything that's wrong with the way this is looked at that the Intel Chief has gone first because the problem isn't one of Intel in that narrow security military sense the problem is intelligence in terms of the broad word if you looked it up in a dictionary Intelligence being intelligent not being stupid and the idea that you could keep Palestinians in this situation without rights without infranet under occupation under an apartheid regime and that this would deliver security that's not a question of whether the Intel flows were working properly that's a basic stupidity that will never hold Anthony I saw you reacting to what Daniel was saying there so I want to let you jump in but I also want to ask you what message does this send while the war on Gaza continues well I'd say to the Israeli public who are increasingly disillusioned with the war not very strong I mean as Daniel rightly says if one looks at intelligence in a very narrow sense then October 7 was a catastrophe for Israel but in the broader sense this was Far bigger than that and what I mean by that is that for many many years many in the Israeli public this is not just a government and intelligence failure many in the Israeli public were sold convinced I would say Hoodwinked in to believing that gazin 2.3 million of them could be caged indefinitely without any kind of serious response and along the Gaza Israel fence there has been huge amounts of Israeli companies that have spent lots of money billions and billions of dollars something I look at in my book trying to protect Israel from garans which clearly fail miserably and it's interesting to know many of those companies that failed so miserably on that day their technology failed their sight failed are selling and testing weapons in Gaza as we speak to foreign buyers another words an intelligence chief chief can leave can resign other people may follow none of that will change the fact that the end of this war whenever that happens Israel will be less safe than it was on October the 6th Gideon in jiva's resignation letter he wrote that Authority comes with responsibility and that's being interpreted by many in Israel as a suggest question that it may be time for prime minister Netanyahu that he go ahead and resign do you believe that haliva was intending to send that signal that it's time for Netanyahu to face accountability it might very be aliwa is quite a political guy with a lot of friends in the political environment which protests against netan but you know khiva is not in a position to tell others what to do I I'm not surprised that is resigning I'm surprised he's resigning only now because he couldn't function ever since the 7th of October how can he function ever since then who would listen to him and if someone would listen to him what kind of responsibility is it to listen to such a failure so khwa together with all the generals must go and in the same time I totally agree to anony and Daniel namely that we the failure of the seven is just a small failure this does not mean that people are responsible for this failure shouldn't go away the big failure is still untouched in Israel Israel did not draw any lessons from the sevens Israel still believes and maybe more intensively in the old beliefs that we can continue with the occupation continue with the apartheid and we can live on our sword only on our sword forever Gideon let me just follow up with you and ask you about the fact that haliva also called for the establishment assault on October 7 is that something we're going to see happen at any point soon even if we'll see it Muhammad don't expect too much from it those investigation committees in Israel first of all their work last for months and years until no one remembers what was the cause of their establishment and then they are always vague and never put it this is the experience until now maybe we will now invent a new kind of Committee of Investigation committee but everyone who speaks about investigation committee means to postpone everything until the investigation will be concluded which will be years time there is very little to investigate here things are so clear there was no Army on the seventh there was no Intelligence on the seventh that Israel is occupying in Gaza in the West Bank for decades without having any solution and any intention to put an end to it Daniel I can see you reacting as well to what Gideon is saying there so I'm going to give you the chance to go ahead and jump in as well go ahead well I always enjoy if that's the right word um listening to Gideon and this is the point I I I I don't think people should have expectations from what an investigation within that structure within that system can come up with because the questions will not be the questions that need to be asked yes there'll be things about you know was material that was passed on taken seriously but it it's that granular detail which is the least important lesson to learn because the questions that one can almost be guaranteed will not be on the table are the questions of what are the root causes how do we treat the Palestinians and here you know I think sometimes get bitis we make this so much about Netanyahu it's a system it's a systemic structural violence thing that the political class in the military are all CAU up in when when you do hear people say well there's got to be diplomacy fine that's right but if the diplomacy on offer is nothing more than how one manages this system of occupation and aparte then that's not actually an alternative so the question won't be on the table of whether Israel's process of having having security collaboration with a Palestinian Authority in the West Bank that has no credibility with its people of trying to blockade glaza indefinitely because you think perhaps you can domesticate Hamas of a regional set of relations which are are built on I would argue a castle of Sands you know what what do what have these normalization Abraham Accord agreements done for Israel in practice all they've taught the Israelis is this idea a false idea that things are okay if we make peace with some people in the Gulf we can continue to keep the Palestinians in this condition so the crucial questions that need to be asked will not be asked and what Anthony said earlier is really important because one of the signals this sends is that this so-called startup Nation Hightech power has been exposed for its vulnerabilities and its failures and the world is seeing this and the world is seeing that Israel is not managing asymmetric Warfare effectively because Hamas and I would argue some of the other resistance axis actors are showing that you can turn the power of Israel on itself because when Israel responds in this hugely disproportionate way it is in fact undermining its own equities whether they be legal moral deterrence Etc so Anthony if we can pick up on what Daniel was saying there and I saw you nodding your head uh responding to some of what he was saying there if there is this system in place what happens in the event that there are more resignations let's say at some point that netanyahu's political career comes to an end many people in Israel are calling for him to resign if we get to a scenario whereby that actually happens or if there are new elections what happens thereafter I wish I could say the outcome would be very different Netanyahu on current polling would probably lose an election but his likely successor Benny Gant is virtually no different on Gaza on the occupation on any accountability just this week the US has announced possible sanctions on the particularly extreme element of the IDF whove committed huge crimes in the West Bank Benny gans's response was equal outrage along with Netanyahu in other words if we expect there to be radical change when a different prime minister comes into waare will be disappointed and this goes I think to the broader point that accountability within Israel Over decades has barely existed in other words there's barely been any soldiers let alone generals actually held to account for crimes committed in the West Bank or Gaza the only way I would argue this will really ever change and I would argue similarly with the US with its behavior in Iraq and Afghanistan in the last 20 or so years are international Trials of soldiers or generals or politicians before an international Court the ha for example that shows there will be a cost a price for committing crimes in Gaza or the West Bank and it's worth saying finally that we can investigate or Israel can investigate the 7th of October as much as it wants how about what's happened in the last six months the 7th of October in my view was a crime but what's been happening in the last 6 months 35 45 50,000 potential Palestinians killed the vast majority of her civilians there will be no investigation within Israel for those pal inian who have been killed and without accountability in an international Forum or Court nothing as I and Gideon has been writing this relentlessly for years but especially since October 7 Israeli culture within the public forget about the military of intelligence there's a blood lust and without accountability globally sadly this will not change Gideon you heard Anthony there talk about the fact that you've written extensively about what you call a blood lust in Israeli society and that's something that I wanted to ask you specifically about it's been a theme in a lot of your writing in one of your more recent columns you wrote that it's doubtful there has ever been so much thirst for blood and war in Israel and I'm curious to get your thoughts about how at this particular moment when there is a lot of condemnation of Netanyahu and polling suggests that he's at an all-time low when it comes to credibility trust from the public popularity how much is the fact that what you're calling this Blood lust existing in Israeli Society how much is that helping him and his cohorts in government unfortunately it helps him a lot because the 7th of October took the Israelis out of the closet or change their minds but in any case after the 7th of October the Israelis feel that everything is legitimate that Israel has the right to do whatever it wants no limits no international law no Humanity nothing most of the Israelis feel that Gaza deserves this punishment and most of the Israel think that Israel didn't cross any line by killing so many civilians now netan is just figure in all these processes but it's not all about netan I write I obviously totally agree to anonio say that Ben Gans will not be any any better and no one of the potential candidates in Israel will be any better only because of the simple reason that there is quite a consensus in Israeli Society it is always described as very divided yes they are very divided about minority they are very very United much too United about the basic ISU namely continuing the occupation going to this war look how Israel support this war even after six months of failure so supporting the war continuing the occupation continuing the aparte gets always big big rates in any poll in Israel of support of of really one opinion which says much more so after the sevens one opinion which says we have the right to do whatever we want and nobody will tell us what to do Daniel I've spent quite a bit of time over the course of the past year reporting from Israel before October 7th I was reporting on the judicial overhaul protest where you saw a lot of anger directed toward the Netanyahu government plan to try to overhaul the Judiciary now after October 7th there have been these protests that have been increasing uh first it was the family of captives uh that are being held in Gaza now there are more explicit anti-government demonstrations and I'm curious to get your thoughts about if you think that these different protest movement will coales against around sort of a an overall anger towards Netanyahu and and how that impacts him specifically at a time when his popularity is at an all-time low when people are so angry at him when there are government officials that are saying they're taking responsibility for the intelligence failure that led to October 7th but Netanyahu has continued to say he essentially he's not taking responsibility that he'll answer tough questions but it'll be later well Muhammad I I I followed some of that reporting that you undertook yes the protests have uh increased in intensity uh in recent weeks somewhat less since this mini escalation with Iran uh there was anger over the extent to which Netanyahu has deprioritized the hostage issue there was the return to some of that division that we saw prior to October 7th and it may well be that nanyu is in trouble politically uh the polling is not looking good for him but there's no election on the horizon and this is one of the reasons why Netanyahu is a particularly dangerous uh leader at the moment uh beyond what we have gotten used to because it seems that his own political future is tied in to the continuing of the war but I think it's it's really crucial to not lose sight of what's been mentioned which is that if you zoom out the question of natany who is a very effective politician he's very effective regionally internationally we can't take that away from him but the path that he has set out is is really quite consensual and you know if one goes back to to October 7th and absolutely that was a violation of international law preceded by Israel's violations continued afterwards the one of the things that made that possible and makes the failings possible is if you dehum I the other side if you hold them in such contempt then that puts you on the path to the kind of hubris which I think LED uh to these failures in the in the in in what happened and you know the fact that Israel is at the international court of justice plausibly violating the genocide convention the fact that a un special rapporter can write a report Franchesco alanes the anatomy of a genocide shows how much deeper than nanyu this goes the former labor leader who's the president of Israel Isaac herzo he's the first person the icj quoted in terms of incitement to genocide and I believe because the question that hangs in the air is whether it's Natan yahu or not how does one envisage possible change a possible different Dynamic where we're not all sitting here saying it's not just nanyu it's not just gants it's the almost the entirety of the Zionist political class so I think there's a problem here in terms of the project in terms of whether Zionism can do what's written on the tin and deliver security for Jewish Israelis it is failed to do that it's obviously delivered Devastation for Palestinians how does that begin to change that's where one gets into the question of impunity Because unless Israel's cost benefit calculation looks different unless Israel is held accountable I'm not saying that would force Israelis to change but it means that Israelis start to ask the questions of is it worth it to treat the Palestinians like this if the answer is you can get away with anything then the question if it's if it's worth it doesn't even get asked Gideon I saw you reacting to what Daniel was saying there it looked like you wanted to jump in please go ahead no we we are all agreeing more or less on on the point that focusing on Nan is is a mistake I I claim it now for years when the Israeli protest is demonstrating and demonstrating my best friends they are demonstrating against Nan this is fair enough this is just but it's not the point and I tell you more than this pay attention to the Protestant Israel none of them is protesting against the war none of them is protesting against the mess killing of Gaza none of them is protesting against the starvation the The Killing Children the the the uprooted people the the the refugees none of them is mentioned it's only about getting rid getting rid of netan it is very easy to see netan as as the big Satan which he is in many ways but hey what are you suggesting instead of Fe whom are you suggesting instead of Fe do you really touch the core of the problem or you found yourself your comfort Life by pointing out netan just get rid of him Israel will turn back to become the paradise that we dreamed about So my answer says guys that's not the point yeah Daniel I mean Gideon is making a good point there the fact is that in pole after poll in Israel uh it's reflected that while most Israelis want to see Netanyahu go most of them are also still supporting the war effort correct and exactly and that's a it's a convenient story that some in the west some of Israel's enablers in the US are telling themselves so Hegel the the Democrat lead in the Senate gives this speech considered pathbreaking but it really boils down to if only there was no nanyu things would be okay the Biden Administration sometimes seems to to to Echo this kind of thing it's a really convenient really mistaken way to look at this it's an easy place to go because no one wants to actually challenge the root causes of this and unless you do you're not going to get anywhere you know netanyahu's successor may be better may be worse but it's systemic one has to address that systemic problem Anthony if we're talking about systemic issues within Israel and the Israeli government one of the questions that continues to be asked in the wake of this resignation is is this a first step towards accountability in Israel but if you're talking about accountability that looks different depending on who you're asking right I mean you have accountability in Israel towards the Israeli people with regards to the failures that led to the October 7th attack but then you have what many in the International Community are calling for which is accountability for atrocities committed in Gaza isn't that right for sure and essentially Israel is both unwilling and incapable of doing so within its own legal system they've shown that for years and years and I think the question that we're talking about really really goes to a more existential one for Israel it was an interesting piece last week in the New York Times written by Benny Morris the right-wing Isel historian who I don't agree with on pretty much anything but he said something very interesting within that he supported going into rougher and all these terrible things but he said something and I'm paraphrasing here words to the effect of it's really inarguable that it's it is the most unsafe place in the world to be Jewish these days is Israel now what does that tell you about Israel 75 years or so after its birth that of course anti-Semitism is real and some places in the world undeniably it's a growing problem but if a so-called respected again someone I don't really agree with but someone who is a member of the Israeli establishment argues and says that point almost as a throwaway Line This goes far far deeper than Netanyahu or frankly any political leader in Israel this goes to an existential question of Israel's future that the whole so-called dream of Zionism as Daniel said was to provide safety for Jews and clearly and I would argue almost impossible to argue against this it is not safe for Jews now and I would argue long before October 7 and certainly in the last six months it's even got more unsafe for Jews within Israel and I would argue in the global diaspora this is the problem Israel faces and without International pressure which I think will start to build the US and London are not going to be pushing for arms embargos but certain States will and sanctions and trying to put Israeli soldiers on in the coming years that will happen or at least attempts will for that to happen and this is where the the game can change all right well we have run out of time so we're going to have to leave the conversation there thanks so much to our guests Daniel Levy Anthony Lowenstein and Gideon Levy and thank you too for watching you can see the program again anytime by visiting our
