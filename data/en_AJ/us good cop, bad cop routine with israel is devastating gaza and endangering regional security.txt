well the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is in Saudi Arabia as part of a wider Regional diplomatic tour that began on Thursday Lincoln is meeting leaders to discuss the war on Gaza and is due to arrive in Israel just in the next hour or so Al's senior political analyst Mar bash joins us now here on set so Lincoln We Believe will be touching down within this hour actually he's arriving in Israel on a day that it has killed 250 plus people in Gaza what do you make of that it's really incredulous just as the Biden Administration and secretary blinkin are trying to put out the fires that Israel has been inflaming Israel throws more fuel to the fire in Gaza and Lebanon this uh you know killings in Gaza this industrial scale murder of hundreds of people every day and inflaming the situation with Lebanon at the same time while it's also heating up on the West Bank with more occupation of more Palestinian cities on the West Bank all of that you know makes one wonder is the United States complicit with Israel playing good cup to Israel's bad cup attitude bad cup horrible cup attitude in the occupied Palestinian territories or is the Biden Administration in on it meaning it wants Hamas defeated at any cost even if it's playing touchy feely about civilian deaths but in fact it wants Israel to continue with the war even in different kind of phase but it wants Hamas defeated it wants to bring back America's P Americana Abraham Accords and so on so forth because as we all know the Biden Administration wanted to bring America back to the area doesn't want Iran Russia and China to fill up any strategic void the problem with all of that as I've been reminded could it be both cynical and stupid at the same time in the sense that yes it might have a geopolitical imperative but putting it in the hands of Netanyahu and his fascist ministers and his army that is not uh you know is not uh afraid of committing the worst of massacres and escalating the worst of situation in a volatile region in a sense that uh the Biden Administration is boxing it in behind a prime minister and a and a and a government that's not even popular in its own country I mean if you conduct a negotiation an election today in Israel this whole Coalition probably will be collapsing and not gaining another election and in the US with Biden he wouldn't be being elected today would he so you know again right cynical stupid or both because this is definitely not serving America's interest and the in in the United stat the Biden administration's interest in the United States Biden already is not popular in an election year although his economy is doing really well but clearly there's a sense there's a perception that Biden is losing it you know age and otherwise and the the the boiling public opinion especially in the Democratic party that really wants a ceasefire right today we just heard now from Biden speaking in a church where he says you know he gets why people want a ceas fire why don't you act on it right is the United States Biden has huge leverage with Israel right the Diplomatic support the military support the financial support as I was saying earlier Israel got from the United States more than the equivalent of what the entire continent of Europe got out of the United States in terms of the Marshal plan after second world war and yet Biden is not able to use leverage about the day after to talk to Israel about what to do about Gaza the day after what to do about the West Bank they're not able to get Israel to agree on a single one of its demands Palestinian Authority needs to extend its authority to Gaza Netanyahu says no no reoccupation of Gaza nanaho says no no security zones Gaza Netanyahu says no whatever the Biden Administration propos in terms of longterm plan of a Palestinian state naano says absolutely not so where is the disconnect well it's not so much of a disconnect as much as there's this idea that Biden has this romantic idea about an Israel that's fighting for its life and Israel that is struggling against uh you know uh extremist in a dangerous neighborhood and the likes this might have been I don't think it was but this might have been the perception back in the 1980s or the 1970s when Biden first visited Israel in 1972 or 197 this might have been the case right but today Israel is one of the richest countries in the world it is the most uh powerful military in the region it's a nuclear power right so the idea that Biden continues to think about it in a romantic wrong way is definitely hurting both Israel the region and the United States so the idea is that's something got to give right what what would it be I think the people in the region that blinkin visited from Turkey to Saudi Arabia through Jordan and Lebanon and now perhaps the Palestinian Authority he needs to hear an ears full that look we have a plan it's called the Arab plan the Arab plan is about two states it's about recognizing Israel not only by all the Arab countries but by all the Arab and Muslim majority countries there is a plan on the table peace is possible without War and the United States and Israel could benefit from that if only if only the Biden Administration uses its leverage with Israel instead of paying this silly good cup bad cup touchy feely thing with netan government when it needs to act like the grownup superpower it is M Bashar great to hear your thoughts thanks for joining us once again
