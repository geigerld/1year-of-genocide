well senior Hamas representative Osama hamdan is joining us on the phone from Beirut thank you for your time Mr hamdan what's your reaction to Egypt's proposal well uh I have to say that uh what you have said came from uh media resources we are not talking about solid ideas introduced yet uh and that doesn't mean some of those ideas were dealt during the negotiations or the talks between Hamas and the Egyptians and maybe other mediators but it is still ideas talked about and our uh position clear position was no talks about uh any kind of prisoners exchange without a complete ceasefire with the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza well the Egyptian proposal does call for a complete ceasefire be it in stages while Israeli captives are released in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli jails are you open to that if there is a complete stop in the fighting well as as I've said uh we can't talk about any kind of uh arrangements to in the issue without a complete Israeli uh ceasefire and withdrawal from uh GZA uh no one accept to negotiate under the fair not Hamas nor anyone else uh and if anyone seeks to help the Palestinians if anyone seeks to uh find a solution which can prevent the Palestinians from being killed daily uh or committed the massacr against them he has to start from this point from stubbing the massacre being committed to against the Palestinians this is the the first step uh to solve any kind of arrangements or to talk about any kind of arrangements uh on the basis of the brazar exchange okay the proposal also calls for the establishment this is later on this is after a ceasefire is ceasefire is implemented it also calls for the establishment of a government of experts to rule Gaza and the West Bank for a transitional period before presidential and parliamentary elections if there is a ceasefire would Hamas allow that further down the line well uh let's say uh that uh the idea of who will be the ruler of the Palestinians and the leading ship of the Palestinians is an internal Palestinian issue and our clear position all the time was the people must the Palestinian people must elect their own leadership no one has the right to dictate uh a leadership for the Palestinians the Americans the Israelis nor neither other anyone else so simply but that is exactly what the proposal is saying the proposal is saying that it will be a group of Palestinian experts for a temporary period before presidential and parliamentary elections are held they're not saying that the US or Israel will decide on on what happens who who who will decide uh this uh temporary leadership who will decide to uh select those people or or who is in charge to nominate those people if it was a Palestinian decision well we don't mind to NE to discuss that among our Palestinian fellows but if it was dictated by anyone else it will be rejected directly okay what about if both sides can agree again on a ceasefire would Hamas require a third party to oversee Israel's withdrawal from Gaza well it's clear that uh we need someone to guarantee any kind of arrangement with the Israel uh when we have talked about the temporary ceasefire in the last few weeks uh Israelis Israeli troops violated that all the time and uh there was a kind of uh observation and interference from uh our brothers in Qatar and in Egypt that makes the the situation uh to be handled for a few days no one can trust the Israelis no one can trust their uh uh any kind of arrangements with them so there must be someone who can control or at least talk directly to the Israelis making the needed pressure so they can implement the complete or the the any Arrangements completely and and who would Hamas trust to be that party well it's it's clear that we can't trust the Americans because they are Partners in the massacre commited in GDA but uh for sure we are trusting our brothers in in in Qatar and Egypt and they canate that and they can also observe that all right that is senior Hamas representative Osama hamdan joining us on the phone from Beirut thank you very much for your time
