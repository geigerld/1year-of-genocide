hi I'm Steve Clemens and I have a question does the assassination of a top Hamas leader outside Gaza mark an escalation of Israel's war in the Middle East let's get to the bottom line the assassination of Salah aruri hamas's Deputy political leader and one of its top military leaders along with six other members of the group in Beirut brings new focus on the regional implications of the war that started on October 7th when Hamas Fighters broke through the fence surrounding Gaza and killed hundreds of Israeli soldiers and civilians Israel's response has been a Non-Stop bombing campaign and a military incursion that has killed more than 22,000 Palestinians at this point mostly women and children Israel has also blocked supplies of food water electricity gas and medicine and displaced almost all of the 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza creating a humanitarian catastrophe so where is the region heading after 3 months of this allout War and what changes with the assassination of Salah aruri today we're talking with retired US Army Brigadier General Mark kimet who served in the state department the defense department us Central Command and NATO General kimet thank you so much for joining us let me just start out you're a military guy and obviously October 7th was a horrible and brutal moment uh between Israel and and a faction uh of Palestinians in Hamas I'm just interested in terms of pursuing objectives as you were think about this as a military planner and plan how is this war going from your perspective well um remember that the military plan is derived from the Strategic objectives set out by the by the government and in this case the government the Netanyahu government set out three primary objectives number one to destroy hamas's leadership number two to to completely eliminate the infrastructure the terrorist infrastructure inside of and number three to get the hostages back um we all knew this was going to be a long war and it's proven out to be obviously we've only got onethird of the hostages back there have been a number of Hamas leadership killed but certainly not enough to decapitate Hamas and while the terrorist infrastructure is being discovered it's still fully operational so I would say that at this point even the Israelis would admit militarily they're only about onethird of the way through achieving the military objectives set out by the Strategic guidance so from a military and and strategic perspective are Israel's goals achievable at this point well first of all U I've said before and I don't want to be sarcastic but I'm not sure that if I was Israel I would be listening to the United States based on our win loss record over the last 20 years we have got to recognize that Israel is trying to fight a war no differently than we fought World War II and we fought Japan which in both cases we said we will fight until the destruction of the military in Japan and the defeat of Hitler's government and his military in Germany they are using the same tactics we used the firebombing of treson obviously the use of the atomic war but we took no prisoners rhetorically in that war and we fought on of a strategic objective the way that the Israelis see it which is defeat the organization destroy the infrastructure and start new now whether if that's the right strategic uh goal or not that's how the Israeli military is fighting it I've heard you in the interviews you've done make that comparison to particularly Japan before but also you know Germany and others uh that were were annihilated in many ways um by the United States after World War II and afterwards actually became important strategic allies and and friends but in this case what I'm wondering is does it make a difference that Israel is the occupying force of the Palestinian territories that that the temperature the water the the climate in fact there are uh Wikileaks documents that show that Israel was only willing to allow Gaza in previous years to to exist on economic barely above sustenance level and so when you kind of look at that and the long Legacy of occupation in the region of Palestinians doesn't that matter in this case and isn't that fundamentally different than the US Japan uh analogy yeah I I agree it is and it certainly may be harsher in terms of the occupations that we did in Germany and Japan but we were ruthless in Germany about weeding down to root and core uh any remnants of Nazi Germany and it took five six years before we even allowed Germany to have its own Army uh again I'm not justifying it I'm just trying to explain it uh and I think that explains to some extent why U Israel is taking such a hard line on all this but there's also another distinction right now Gaza is surrounded by likeminded Arab states uh we did not have that problem in World War II and this is where the analogy fails Germany was surrounded by like-minded uh States like-minded like us same thing with Japan but this issue with Hamas this issue with Palestine clearly resonates throughout the region and that in many ways is where in my mind the Israelis will fail they will fail because they may win inside of Gaza they W may win a strategic Victory inside of Gaza but it's that larger victory that they need throughout the region where they're going to fail because of the tactics techniques and procedures they've been using inside of Gaza Mark you spent a lot of time in the Arab world you know many we we have many common friends in the Arab world and I and I think there's a real tension out there uh over what they're seeing um Israel do right now in response to the October 7th attacks how do they not make revenge against what they're seeing part of their DNA well you can't look at the war in Gaza today since October 7th in isolation there have been Revenge operations the INF fatatas the two INF fatatas the 1947 War um and on and on and on there has been an attempt to um extract revenge or recover the lands from The River To The Sea since the formation of the state of Israel that hasn't worked it hasn't worked for either side and that's why I think revenge can't be the answer there has to be a new modus Fendi that goes beyond Oslo that goes beyond all the other attempts there has to be radical change in the politics in Gaza in the West Bank to resolve the Palestinian issue uh which hasn't succeeded so far I think it's important to look at what was lost on October 7th were we on the verge do you believe of a very different Middle East that would have not only have normalized it between Israel and Saudi Arabia but might have led to the full creation of of a pal inian state with Israel actually acquiescing to that no I I completely agree uh it's unfortunate that the politics in the United States don't permit you these days to talk about the first step which was the Abraham Accords Abram Accords demonstrated that countries in the region could come to an accommodation with Israel and of course the culmination of that which couldn't be achieved during the Trump Administration for a number of reasons was to get Saudi Arabia to join that Abraham Accord uh they were very close it was coming along even Jake Sullivan in his foreign affairs article uh that was published after the attack into Gaza unfortunately for him thought they were on the Breakthrough thought that the Palestinian cause was under control thought they were making progress and thought he was spending less time on the issue I mean just for our audience Jake Sullivan's the national adviser to President Biden but let me ask you something deeper when You' mentioned Jake Sullivan and the president Lloyd Austin Anthony blinkin the Secretary of State are all right now I I think at the beginning of this conflict it was to give Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu a big hug say we're with you emotionally we understand and whisper in his ear and say don't do what we did after 911 don't let rage Define your actions and ever since then almost every comment you see is about trying to get Israel to listen to the US you've just said they should be ignored but does this have an impact on the perception globally of our efficacy and of of American power and and when you look at I mean Lloyd Austin has been one of the most dramatic commentators you know frankly out there saying they're heading towards strategic defeat if they don't change course you saw two Israeli cabinet members come out and and talk about relocating G Gins out of the ter even though that comment which equates to ethnic cleansing is one where the B Administration says in no circumstances would that ever be tolerated and done but still it goes on I so the question is one of the perception of American strength in in a conflict with its Ally not that that gets before you get to enemies yeah two things I'd say first of all I did not say that Israel should ignore it I was just trying to say why Israel probably will ignore it right uh second it's often unfortunate that you get a couple of comments out of the knesset that uh reflect that Hardline approach I would I mean these are cabinet members these are C and cabinet members um but but both they and the knesset pretty much speak for a certain sector of the society look we can get crazy talk out of Marjorie Taylor green we can get crazy talk out of uh AOC but that doesn't mean it reflects the entire policy the state of Israel or the the Congress of the United States uh that said it is Amplified through the media that that's somehow reflects policy but one thing I will note uh if anybody in Israel in the political uh sphere is upset about this they haven't resigned yet so there may be I think there is at worst grudging acceptance within the political class inside of Israel that this is the way to do it is there a shadow war going going on right now between Iran Israel and the us when you look at um a a terrorist act uh seemingly two bombs that have gone off killed over 100 people in Iran at uh Sol mani's grave in Memorial um there's that you also have the hooes that are firing on and and uh uh intervening with uh Red Sea shipping you have other minor skirmishes here and there and from a on a scale of 1 to 10 how were would are you today that this crisis which has been fairly isolated Israel and Gaza could grow dramatically out well first of all I don't think that uh this is any sort of Shadow war that we haven't been seeing for the last well candidly since 1979 right pre October 7th irgc K's force was operating in Iraq operating in Syria training in Lebanon training the houthis so this war has been going on this proxy war being gu Ed and directed by the ks force uh what we're seeing now is just a measure of scale if it was at a two before October 7th it's now at a five the people that you should really ask is the government inside of tan do they want to expand this war or are they a little concerned that their proxies out there are operating on their own uh this would not have been a question if solomani was still alive sulamani was probably the greatest proxy leader in the 20th century he kept them under control if they were trying to expand this war that I could say was at the behest of the of the government in Iran but it may be that his replacement is so weak that these proxies are operating on their own but it is clear that Israel has about seven different fights going on from these proxies and um I'm not necessarily too concerned about the current level of fighting I mean it's tragic that they're attacking the ships it's tragic that there are bomb the Rockets being fired from Hezbollah into Israel uh it is tragic that there are missiles being fired inside of Iraq but I don't think that we've hit the US Red Line uh to either react against the houthis in an offensive way or a dramatic increase in the offensive operations against the hushed in side of Iraq so I think at this point it is it is being contained but if there are Americans killed if there is an American warship sunk I would say at that point Steve all bets are off about a regional War the US has committed to withdrawing an aircraft carrier that had had deployed to the region the Israelis are reportedly pulling thousands of its uh troops from Gaza do you look at that as an inflection point of any kind well first of all the the Ford is being pulled back because it was on extended deployment anyway and it was time to bring them home um that to me shows a measure of uh U Less concern on the part of the us than there was on say October 10th that could of escalation of escalation to me the primary purpose of the Ford was to keep hisbah contained and knew let them know that if you started responding heavily we would respond kind the reduction of the Israeli presence inside of Gaza is not only a reflection of the fact that the fight is moving down to a lower Pace but also you can't keep 50,000 reservists uh inside of Gaza for too long they've got civilian jobs there will be an impact on the economy uh they didn't sign up for a long War so that some people say that they're just getting ready for the big one I don't think so I think it's more that reservists just want to go home so on new New Year's Eve a pretty significant number of rockets were launched by Hamas into Israel um and you just made a comment which I don't often hear in the media that Israel has made less progress against tamas than many may think they have made I I think that's a fair assessment if I were to watch at least the US media that infrastructure uh exists command and control exists and they launched Rockets which is an indication of hamas's ability to continue to function under pretty toxic circumstances so what is your assessment now of hamas's capability and why given the strength and power of Israel has it failed thus far to do more well let's talk about the infrastructure there's 300 miles of infrastructure how long would it take us to destroy the New York Subway system so U that will take some time I think they have made a tremendous Headway inside of Gaza City against the fighters they don't have the leaders yet leaders are going to be the last ones to die um and they're going to plan it that way so I think that there is an expectation around the world that this can be short brutish and ugly fight but with the Strategic objectiv set up by the government of Israel Netanyahu in particular this can't be a short fight it's just physically impossible to have a fight this short Israel a year ago was in deep conflict internal conflict over its own way of of uh uh managing its democracy managing its Supreme Court uh uh controlling or not uh the direction of the court that action has been vetoed has been overturned by Israel Supreme Court I think it's an important part of the story to look at what you think when it comes to um the solvency of of of Israel's own identity in this and what it's trying to hold up whether you think this court action is is important in this equation or not not wanting to present a divided uh Israel in the eyes of the world the example I would use was December 7th 1941 prior to that there was great great uh fighting going on in the United States political fighting between the isolationists that didn't want to get us into a war in Europe U others that felt we should at least provide Aid and assistance to the Brits as we did with lend Le and to the Russians right but as soon as December 7th hit the country came together the same thing happened after December 11th uh I I think you're seeing that in Israel right now that they had the luxury of having these types of democratic arguments uh prior to October 7th but on October 7th they saw an existential attack on their country and naturally um that will bring people together whether it's right or whether it's wrong Wars have a tendency to do that it has a tendency for people not only to come together as a country but willing to sacrifice their own rights for security when you look at what the US says and what the is what what Netanyahu today will accept or not accept by way of looking at the management and governance of Gaza in the future when you look at other stakeholders that's before you even get to the Palestinians themselves you can't Square it no body is on the same page with regards to what happens the day after uh in Gaza who government governs it who rebuilds it Etc and I guess my question is Israel under Ariel Chiron withdrew from Gaza but they controlled everything that went in or out basically and so my question is what would you recommend as someone who's so familiar with states that were invaded governments changed what is the solution that you think from Mark Kim's perspective might work when you look at governance in Israel down the way down I mean in Gaza down the way yeah unfortunately my recommendation is totally um unfeasible infeasible it would be a Arab U military force inside providing security the Arab League would provide some measure of governance it could require the UN for some period of time for humanitarian assistance all of this under the Chapo of the United Nations accepted by the Arab countries accepted by Israel that to me seems to be the optimum way for post-war governance of Gaza and of course billions coming from the International Community a marshal plan for Gaza why is that unfeasible um the politics and the view of the region will not accept that Israel will not accept the PLO it's unlikely that an Arab force would come in and protect Arabs against Arabs I don't think we've ever seen that before um I'm not sure the UN would want to buy into it the only thing I can be sure of is that the International Community is willing and ready to spend billions of dollars for the Reconstruction and any notion that uh any organization whether it's the government of Israel or or any other organization is against the resettlement uh of the IDP inside of Gaza has got another thing coming so you believe in resettlement possibilities no I said just the opposite I said there is no doubt that there will be overwhelming support to get the people back into their houses in Gaza City hanun and in other War torn areas and that the International Community will subsidize that to rebuild the infrastructure that's been destroyed um we've had uh references to to Israeli cabinet members who talk very openly saying the Humane thing to do is to relocate those people um like I've read the UN text and to me it reads as as a war crime is am I wrong I don't think you're wrong at all I think any notion that they're going to turn Gaza into Carthage and salt the Earth that's sounds good on TV but it's impractical immoral and illegal let me ask you finally um Ian Bremer was on our show uh from the Eurasia group and he said uh something we with regards to Palestinians that that you know you can't keep us in a box and pretend that we don't exist you have to release these people from their Siege and occupation this is something Ian said is a fundamental part of any stability equation in the future do you see any possibility of that I do I I don't think that Israel will be permitted if they want to be a respected member of the International Community to allow the rhetoric of Gaza being an open air prison to continue and I don't think the International Community will support that in the least um but I think it's also important to talk about occupation because people seem to get it wrong when you talk about occupation do you mean the Israeli occupation of Gaza of the West Bank or do you mean the occupation from the river to the Sea there are many my my colleagues overseas still believe that the UN establishment of the state of Israel is illegal occupation and they will not stop the axis of resistance until the Israelis are swept out of that country well important and sobering discussion General Mark kimt former US assistant Secretary of State thank you so much for being with us thanks for having me Steve so what's the bottom line Israel is is a superpower in the Middle East region but the way it's imitating how the United States lashed out after the attacks of 911 will lead to the same dilemma that America faced all powerful but powerless Israel has failed to use its power to shape Better Lives for the Palestinian people over the decades and their boiling frustration is always right under the surface so now after so Much Death and destruction what does Victory even look like what is solved the destruction of Germany and Japan which we discussed don't apply in the case of Gaza and the West Bank when Israel controls what goes in and what comes out and every facet of daily life in the occupied Palestinian territories what's clear is that so far no one not the political leaders in the region not in Europe and not in the US have figured out how to stop the cycle of a Palestine that is either forgotten belittled Left Behind or put under siege and that's the bottom line [Music]
