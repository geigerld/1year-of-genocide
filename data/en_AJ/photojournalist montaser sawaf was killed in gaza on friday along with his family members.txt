members of his family let's speak now with one of his friends and colleagues hin kdari who joins us on the line the phone line now from De abala in Gaza hind of course we talk to you every day several times every day in your role as a correspondent talking about what's happening on the ground we'd just like to talk to you this time about your experiences uh as a journalists in a war when all around you your friends colleagues and fellow journalists are being killed and and wounded and monasa as I say was a friend of yours first of all can you tell us what happened to him first of first of all I would like to mention that the only or the first friend I lose in 60 days he's maybe the third or the fifth very close colleague that we lost M stayed in the Gaza Strip in the neing area um and refused to evacuate with us to the South because his his his family was was injured so two of his brother brothers were injured Ed in an air strike when they were working covering on the Gaza Strip and and he chose to stay with his brothers because it was before The alifa Invasion and and the the the situation was very critical and he was trying his best to find a doctor to do a surgery for his brother so he stayed in Al hospital because it was operating at that time so then um what happened was St in Gaza he he he covered a lot of of of of of story a lot of pictures and especially after all the destruction that happened in Gaza he was one of the few journalists who took those photos m a couple of days ago was was was was killed with an air strike on like on his house in front of his house where he was he was with his brother and his cousin he was injured he he bled for 30 minutes and there were no ambulances and he died because there was no one to rescue him or say it must be just so hard it must be so hard hind do you recall do you recall can I ask if you recall what your last conversation with him was do you remember that well the last conversation he texted me like a couple two hours before he he was killed he told me that oh my God you have a new t-shirt because he knows that we evacuated with two shirts and he on on on on my Instagram story wearing a new hoodie but I did not have time to to answer him I did not have time to reply back to his text he used to text me every single day I'm alive with a happy smiley emoji and I was always telling him take care M we love you we we believe in you and and stay safe but we feel so sad that we were not able to go to the north to give him the last goodbye to even bury him we don't know if who buried him where is he buried we don't know anything and it's not only M it's his brother too and weeks before this target his father was killed and other family members were killed he he was working after his whole family was killed when they targeted his house M was a very nice person he was very kindhearted he was always like initiating to do a Ste tea coffee sandwiches when we were stuck in Gaza working before we evacuated he was a very kind hearted person and everyone loved him and there's a very uh famous real on his Instagram feeding kittens he was this person who cares about everyone even animals and kittens and he was a very beloved person and and we're looking we're looking at some of the photographs of his on the screen right now I me it must be it's so emotional isn't it and we do appreciate you just explaining how it is for you and it's so hard yet you carry on doing this important work and your fellow journalist too and as he was too can you tell us how it is for you as you said about doing this work under such intense pressure and immense personal risk it's very hard for us and it's heartbreaking every single day we wake up on explosions we barely sleep we barely have a couple of of hours sometimes we sleep from the amount of like we're we're very tired I think you heard an explosion this is like what we are hearing all the day but at the end of the day we feel that we need to continue we feel like we need to report we need to tell the stories there are a lot of stories that have been voices that have been silenced that have been killed but we're still here and we will still we have the ability to carry the message of all of these people it's very heartbreaking and and and we're dehydrated today we did not have any chch in the market for anything to keep us standing and going on but it's it's it's fixed now until now we had zero food we only have had like couple of tea water all of the situa all of the like surrounding situation is hard but there's something that's keeping us going on I don't really know what it's it's this something thing is we are always like negotiating and talking with each other like how are we still covering how are we still editing how are we still doing all of this job and there's something that's motivating us every single day to keep on telling the stories and we believe that we're very important and we hold a very huge weight on our shoulders to carry the message of all of these millions of people in Gaza right now have you ever thought of giving it up I mean nobody would blame you if you did and and just sort of seeking your own safety I think me for me as h no I I don't I won't give up I don't think like I'm going to give up I'm very passionate about what I'm doing we lived very hard days in Gaza we went through this Sal being displaced and we have been displaced for more than than three or four times right now and now the Israeli forces are calling us to evacuate to the South but we are in the South but with all of this like being worried about our families being worried about ourselves continuous explosions there's something letting me not to give up and I swear I don't know what's this but I love Palestine and I love Goda these people and I love my country and I think this is the only thing that's keeping me going despite everything and despite the danger and despite the risk and risking our lives but to be honest like after all of this destruction and after all of this killing I feel like there's no meaning for life anymore and is this I want to spend the last minutes and spend my life reporting even if it's going to be like the last thing I'm going to do in my life I'm dedicating this and I'm dedicating my life to Palestine and most War journalists you know have a way out of where the war is taking place you know to find some respite but you do not uh and you continue to tell the story of unspeakable Terror that would otherwise not reach the world we appreciate your work and and your time now thanks for joining us
