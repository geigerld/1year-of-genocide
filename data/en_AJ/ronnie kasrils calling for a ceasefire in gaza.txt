my name is Ronnie kols I'm a South African uh I served in the Liberation struggle all my adult life I became a minister in Mr Mandela's government growing up in Johannesburg in the 1940s from a Jewish immigrant family um I was very affected by the Nazi Holocaust but I began looking around as I grew up South Africa and I couldn't bear seeing the way black people were treated the sharpeville massacre took place in March of 1960 and I felt then that I had to act my life changed and I got deeply involved in the struggle to liberate South Africa where you have one oppressor group that perpetuates repression over other races in order to maintain their Supremacy and to perpetuate the system and that's a part it so it can be applied anywhere in the world and it has been in apartate Israel a settler colonial state originally and an apartate State as well just like South Africa so you're talking about 75 years of aort at Israel from 1948 in which they through Terror and violence and massacres and instilling huge fear into people they pushed 700,000 or more Palestinians in their ethnic cleansing to clear the territory of Palestine this is genocide and we see in this crisis of so many many deaths through a bombing campaign an assault with tanks and artillery reducing 2/3 of the housing to Rubble it's absolutely Butchery it's abominable and we the world is in fact standing up make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
