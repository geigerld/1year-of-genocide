Israel bombs another school in one of the worst attacks of its war on Gaza yet it says it will attend ceasefire Talks brokered by the US Qatar and Egypt next week but Hamas has a new leader since the assassination of Ismael Han so what are the chances of a deal this time this is Inside Story hello and welcome to the program I'm sarel vaner each day a new horror for the people of Gaza the bombing of a school killing more than 100 Palestinians is the latest Israeli bombs struck as renewed diplomatic efforts for negotiations are intensifying brokered by Qatar Egypt and the United States it's hoped that talks will resume this week previous attempts sought to ceasefire the return of Israeli captives held in Gaza and an exchange of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel but since the last major negotiations broke down there have been big political changes the head of Hamas in Gaza Yahya senoir has been elected its overall leader replacing Ismael Han who was assassinated in tan and President Joe Biden is no longer in the US presidential race the contest now between Donald Trump and comma Harris so what are the chances of success for a renewed International diplomatic push for a SE ceasefire and what are the biggest obstacles we'll be discussing the situation with our guests shortly first though this report from imin Kimber an Israeli attack on a school in Gaza kills more than 100 Palestinians during morning prayers an air strike launched as Qatar Egypt and the United States call for another round of negotiations to end the violence that has killed more than 39,000 people and injured over 990,000 since October and to stop the risk of a major regional War the expansion of the war has become a serious possibility if the International Community and the concerned countries do not move immediately and effectively to stop the war crimes being committed by Israel but accusations of war crimes had no impact on a reception recently given to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the United States where he met President Joe Biden vice president Kamala Harris and her rival presidential candidate Donald Trump he was given 50 standing ovations as he addressed Congress no indication of any desire to Hal Israel's war and the chance of an escalation has increased since Israel assassinated a senior hezbo figure in Beirut and the head of hamas's political wing and one of the group's main negotiators Ismael Han in tahran many Saw His killing as a major blow to the talks according to Media reports in Israel Israeli negotiators believe Netanyahu is also stalling attempts at a ceasefire for political gain as he faces calls to step down yet Israel has confirmed they will attend a new round scheduled for August the 15th but now they will be negotiating with an organization led by yahia sinoa formerly the head of Hamas in Gaza sinoa is widely considered Hardline and believed to be the Mastermind behind the attacks on Southern Israel on October the 7th sinir was previously imprisoned by Israel and has faced assassin attempts on the table is likely to be an already established framework based on a three-stage ceasefire in the United States the presidential election campaign is intensifying and Democrats are hoping if a ceasefire negotiated by President Joe Biden is agreed it will help his vice president and Democratic nominee kamla Harris's chance of winning and with Biden being nicknamed genocide Joe by critics over his role in supporting Israeli military during its War Harris is also facing press at this rally protesters heckled her forcing her to respond now is the time to get a ceasefire deal and get the hostage deal done now is the time and the president and I are working around the clock in Gaza Palestinians suffering bombardment displacement hunger and and disease can only wait to see if this latest attempt at a ceasefire becomes a reality and With Many Nations alarmed over the threat of a regional War a sense of urgency over the coming attempts to end the horror in Gaza is acute imag in Kimber Al jazer for Inside Story let's bring in our guests from rala is Mustafa baruti Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative from Tel Aviv is Gideon Le columnist with the har rett's newspaper and author of the book the punishment of Gaza and from Boston is Ramy hurri a political analyst and distinguished public policy fellow at the American University of Beirut thank you very much to all of you gentlemen for joining us I want to start discussion with the exact same question to all three of you which is the mediators have been working on ceasefire negotiations since November without anything to show for it do you believe that this new push for for a ceasefire can get somewhere Mustafa let's start with you no I don't think it will get anywhere as long as Netanyahu and his fascist government are in power and as long as the United States Administration refuses to exercise any serious pressure on Israel Netanyahu will continue his genocide in Gaza and will continue trying to push the region into a regional War he is a very dangerous man and he knows very well that the end of this war is the end of his political career Gan unfortunately I couldn't agree more with my friend drob baruti namely because the main obstacle is netan and he did not change his mind we will discuss it later what are his motivations but it's very clear he does not want a deal now and maybe not in any time he wants this war to continue and as long as this is the case all the Goodwill and all the mediators can continue to spread promises and requests nothing will change netan Ramy do you think there could be perhaps a deal at the end of this new push I agree with my friends and colleagues that we shouldn't expect anything to happen given the reality of the Israeli government and the American government who are the the main obstacles but I also you know after 45 years of following this stuff um this issue closely you you always have to wait and see if anything changes down the road the only thing that makes me want to uh kind of suspend judgment a little bit is the internal political situation here in the United States we we have an unprecedented situation where the Palestine issue Gaza in particular the Israeli genocide and the American funding of it and arming of it in particular they are suddenly on the domestic political electoral map we don't know if they will have an impact or not but things are evolving very quickly in the domestic American political scene and and Gaza is if it's not Central it's certainly a critical element in that changing uh environment but the evidence of how the US has behaved for the last 10 months and the last 40 50 years suggest that there we should not expect anything to happen because the United States um is enthusiastic about what uh Israel is doing in Gaza okay so listening to all three of you uh you've mentioned Netanyahu uh both Mustafa and Gideon have mentioned Netanyahu as an obstacle to peace and all three of you uh I believe have mentioned how important the US role is here so let's start with Netanyahu we have to cover both anyway but let's start with Netanyahu um Mustafa you see no change in his position policy or inclination to negotiate since the beginning of this war correct absolutely not on the contrary he's more determined to continue his policy especially after the Improvement of his status in electoral electoral polls I think he's relying on the fact that the not only he has a fascist government but the Israeli Society itself is moving uh unfortunately in the direction of fascism and the fact that 69% of the uh people who have who participated in a recent poll said that they support assassination of Palestinian and and and libanese leaders even if that blocks the possibility of getting back the Israeli prisoners is an indication of that uh more than that I think Netanyahu is implementing a strategy he has been talking about for for for decades he wants genocide because he wants ethnic cleansing of Gaza the only explanation of his policy in Gaza is that he still hopes and dreams about ethnic cleansing of the whole population of Gaza by making Gaza unlivable today's terrible Massacre that the Israeli Army committed in one of the shelters one of the schools one out of 80 schools that were attacked in the same manner is a very clear indication of that but more than that Netanyahu still hopes that he will push the United States into a war with Iran he wants to destroy Iran through a war in which the United States itself will do the work this is his dream and unfortunately the United States Administration is doing nothing to stop him from this very dangerous course you mentioned at the beginning of your answer netanyahu's improving status in uh polls and Gideon that is something I wanted to ask you I was quite surprised when I researched this conversation right preparing for this show to see that just a day ago Israeli press published a poll in which Netanyahu is now ahead of Benny gance first time I believe since October 7th and his leud party if elections were held today or tomorrow according to this poll which was published in maiv um leud would be the number one party in Israel all this teaches you serial that it's the story of Israel not the story of nany the support of Netanyahu and even the protest the boundaries of the Israeli protest which was quite devoted and quite powerful for while but it had very very clear borders and it never crossed them almost never crossed them namely we don't oppose the war we don't condemn the crimes we don't protest against the mess killings we don't protest against the starvation and the and the and the destruction all those things create the situation in which netan does not have a real alternative in the outside the world people only think that once we'll get rid of netan Israel will turn into the paradise that we used to dream about no my friends Israel is by its vast majority supporting what's happening in Gaz and standing behind it it is true that netan makes it worse but do you think that any alternative will do it differently I have my doubts and as Mustafa just me mentioned there were some evidences for this reason in any case netan is Israel and Israel is netan when it comes to the war when it comes to the aparte and when it comes to the occupation it is different when it comes to Tactical questions to questions of of of maners the question of of his behavior but this is irrelevant what we Face here is quite a one front of Israel want this war to continue and this is unbelievable and unprecedent so Ramy then let's take it over to you um we've have both Mustafa and Gideon telling us that Netanyahu is an obstacle to peace and he pretty much has Israeli Society broadly speaking behind him um even in light of of the anti-government protest that we saw that lasted for months even in light of that Netanyahu is actually improving in terms of his popularity his electoral Outlook etc etc right so so what is there anything that could compel Netanyahu to change his stance then in theory yes intense pressure from the United States to cut off arms um go to the IC you know do all these terrible things that that are terrible for Israel but that are good for the rule of law and for righteous Behavior by human rights uh obeying citizens all around the world uh but but that's not going to happen the United States was making small small little rhetorical adjustments mainly Kamala Harris saying softer things at the same time saying Israel has the right to defend itself but the problem here is deeper than even I would say than what Mustafa and Gideon are saying and and I know they agree with me but uh the problem is Zionism the that Zionism has always wanted to achieve these goals get the Palestinians Out Create a Jewish state and then see what happens this has always been the Zionist philosophy and they see a chance of achieving it now they're going ahead with it in the West Bank and Gaza and East Jerusalem and everywhere um and the world is doing almost nothing it's quite extraordinary so the conclusion is that the that the majority of Israelis support this Zionist genocidal apartheid racist Colonial takeover of all Palestine with increas extreme brutality to civilians and the parallel conclusion is the Western Democratic free world as they call themselves are eagerly supporting this they're doing nothing to stop it uh there can be no other the evidence Ramy can I jump in for a second because you say the root cause of this is is the the underpinning beliefs of Zionism but I want to push back against that just a little bit because there are movements within Zionist within Zionism uh I think almost everybody on the Israeli political stage would would call themselves zionists but they don't all believe the same thing and they don't all believe that Palestinians should be dealt with in the same way so Gideon perhaps I take this uh to you do do do you agree with what Ramy was saying that really the root cause of this is Zionism yes I feel myself agreeing too much here but no other choice but there are new aners and I want to elaborate on this there are the right-wingers who admit that they are f who admit that Zionism is only about Jewish Supremacy who admit that the Palestinians have no rights whatsoever between the river and the Sea and who admit that their vision is to somehow either get rid of the Palestinians or leave them in the same status without any rights on the other side the other Camp the what we call the left is Zionist or or the Zionist left or the central left they are more sop icated and therefore I see them as more disturbing because they cover it up they don't admit it they want to occupy softly they want to make it in a friendly way they would meet again and again with a bu in Endless peace conferences they would declare that they in favor of the two-state solution even though they know that there are no chances anymore for any viable Palestinian state that they will promise the Americans that they are people of peace and they will not stop talking about peace and continuing to occupy exactly like their right- Wingers only in a softer way and you choose which one of those two you prefer the one where you what you see is what you get or the one who mislead you now for decades and decades promising all kind of promises and doing nothing we need to reopen the chapter of the US and American pressure uh Ramy signaled at the beginning and so did Mustafa how important this was uh this it's not breaking news we've been saying for months that really the only country that has any real significant leverage over Israel is the US uh we also know that the US continues to fund Israel Mustafa pointed out that they've just released another $3.5 billion dollar worth of uh military funding uh for Israel in its war effort uh they're also obviously also selling the weapons and providing weapons Ramy is there you're saying that there are rhetorical very minor differences between Biden Harris and within under the Democratic tent in the US is there anything uh any reason to believe the us is going to change its policy anytime soon uh the the quick answer is no there's no evidence all we have are uh little hints uh small little Nuance change changes in tone uh from kamla Harris and her vice presidential Pig um and things like that but what we do have for the first time ever uh is a Democratic party that is very scared that its Gaza policy supporting the genocide and doing nothing to pressure um Israel into a ceasefire May cost it losing a couple of Swing States especially Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin uh and and this is what terrified of we don't know if this is going to happen because the trouble now is that there are so many new uh emotional dimensions of what's going on especially with the with the new Democratic uh candidates that there's a bit of euphoria uh and this will die down in a week or so the election the camp uh Convention of the Democrats is coming up 19 to 22 August the key uh signs will come out of that convention if there are elements in the program the the platform that kamla Harris puts in because she then can control the Democratic party's position she can't do that now this is one of her weaknesses but if there are real changes talking about uh arms embargo holding up Aid going to the ICC implementing the American laws about you can't give sell arms to people who deny other people's human rights these are all clear Israeli violations of us and international law if there are any clear signs are going to come out the Democratic platform we shouldn't expect anything before August uh 22 but there but the other thing that's fascinating as public opinion so Ry let's let's pause that for a second because that raises an obvious question and and maybe I'll ask this one to Mustafa if the US and if you provided you agree with this premise that the US isn't about to change its its policy in any major way in the short term if that is so why did the US table once again uh a a new push for a ceasefire if it knows it is not going to compel Israel to agree to one well uh before I answer your question I have to make one comment about what was said before which is that uh I totally agree that we will not see peace in this region without the ending of the settler Colonial Zionist project uh and that you cannot be a Zionist and be Democrat you cannot be a Zionist and be called left that's impossible because Z mean means racism and what we see here is different levels of racism but it's all racist it's racist because these people don't believe that Palestinians have the right to be in their own country and they don't believe that Palestinians have the right for freedom and they don't believe that Palestinians have the right to be equal now talking about the new push of course the United States would prefer if this war could end without upsetting Israel uh and maybe they hope through this kind of action uh to to achieve something some kind of pressure on the Palestinian side to accept Israeli conditions which is of course impossible but on the other hand uh I must say that uh this is not going to stop Israel United States will not go in the direction of imposing sanctions on Israel and without sanctions on Israel nothing will change but there are factors that will push Israel the first factor is the fact that it is failing in achieving military goals the fact that it is failing in eliminating Palestinian resistance the fact that it is failing in imposing its control on Gaza the fact that they are also suffering from huge human Lo human losses the largest ever I mean I mean with the exception of maybe 1973 War uh they they they have had thousands of people who are injured or killed this is a factor but the other very important factor is that Israeli economy is now suffering from very serious damage and uh I think everybody knows now that Israel has very big deficit that the cost of this war will reach something like $70 billion that major parts of the Israeli economy are falling apart and there is a risk of a regional War which is not going to be a picnic for the Israeli soci they have us funding so perhaps the economic concerns and economic fears might be allayed by that no because the United States has already given is with this new package $23.5 billion for military equipment and weapons I don't think that the United States is ready to give them $50 billion to fix the economy I don't think so and I think this will have very serious impact on the Israeli side and but at the end of the day we have to we have to say that real the the real goal if we want Israel to change if we want to stop this genocide if we want to stop this terrible war crimes that are happening on the ground the world must impose sanctions on Israel must impose boycot on Israel Israel's Israel's case today is no different from the the the aparti system that was in South Africa at one point of time and Israel is now even practicing a much worth upper tide so what we need is sanctions what we need is Boycott and that is the only language that Israel will understand in terms of international Behavior we have four minutes left I want to make sure we discuss the the last part of it as I see there are three main things we've discussed Israel we've discussed the US their positions what's changing and what's not changing more importantly we haven't discussed Hamas um Mustafa back to you on this what's Victory what does Victory look like for Yahya sinir the new overall leader of Hamas I think for sinir victory was achieved on the 7th of October and for him now but I mean now given that we're talking about this renewed push for a SE what what he wants is ceasefire I think that's what Palestinian movement wants ceasefire to stop the suffering of the people don't forget Israel has killed already 50,000 Palestinians including 10,000 who are under the rebel we have 93,000 injured people many of whom will die because Israel has destroyed the whole medical infrastructure people are suffering from lack of food people are suffering from horrible humanitarian conditions we Israel is now conducting biological warfare on the people of Gaza we have 72,000 cases of infectious hepatitis we have cases of menitis we could see cholera tomorrow we could see even potis so it's a very dangerous situation the end of the war is the demand and that's what everybody wants including sinir the end of the war withdrawal of Israeli Army from Gaza and allowing us to fix this horrible horrible disaster that Israel has caused the worst manmade humanitarian crisis ever Gan this may sense like a bit of a strange question but uh Israel publicly officially wants to kill sinir much like it killed Ismael Han do Israelis see a contradiction in the fact that we're talking about ceasefire negotiations um and we all know Israel wants to kill The Negotiator on the other side it killed already you don't have to go far isma Ania was a negotiator and Israel killed him which might be one of the most foolish actions that isra ever done not to speak about lack of legit legitimacy Because by the end of the day Ania was not a armed person I'm not sure he ever hold a gun in his life but in any case Israel killed him and Israel wants to kill Sila because for Israel assassinations is a policy clouded by by most of the Israelis supported by most of the Israelis who are really enthusiastic about those assassinations it's reminds them the James Bond films and they never ask about the consequences of those assassinations so in aever iseli will not see any any contradiction today we negotiate with Sinai and tomorrow we'll kill him and it will be legitimate Ramy Last Words the Israelis since the 1930s have killed British officials Palestinian uh national leaders they killed PLO leaders they've killed anybody that they feel is challenging them um in Palestine and they will keep killing as long as they need to if nobody stops them but all the killings have only brought Israel to the most dangerous position of its life in the last century it's now surrounded by five or six non-state Arab militant Arab actors armed actors who are very powerful more powerful than any of the Arab countries that fought Israel Israel is being isolated around the world um the US support for it is declining Stead even among Jews so it's in the worst position it's ever been and all it does is keep doing what it knows how to do get the Palestinians out of Palestine kill them incarcerate them lay Siege to them imprison them torture them do all the terrible things and they'll keep doing it as long as nobody stops them with the same results that's why there has to be a massive International intervention in a political manner that defines and contains Zionism we've accepted to live with a Jewish majority Israeli State many times Palestinians have the Arabs have the Islamic world has they're not interested uh the Zionist philosophy and the fascinating thing is the Zionist philosophy didn't start with Jews it started with Christian fundamentalist extremists in England and the United States in the 1860s even before Herzel and the idea of Zionism so we have to get to the core of this issue which is the collusion between Western powers and uh Zionist forces to create this zombie killing machine this Unleashed Frankenstein monster of death that Israel has become and we see all these pictures every day uh children without heads and feet without bodies uh and nobody's stopping it so there has to be a decisive moment when this stops and we shift to trying to live in peace with everybody inshallah and that is the time we have for today I want to thank all our guests Mustafa baruti Gan leevy and Ramy thank you twoo for watching you can see the program again anytime by visiting our website alo.com for further
