Bashar is Al jaz's senior political analyst who's with me here in the studio so a lot of claims made by the Israeli Israeli military in the last hour or so they're basically saying that their assault in the AL shiffer hospital was completely Justified and apparently have hard proof to show the world well they they keep showing us these guns right which is kind of baffling why would Hamas leave the guns and not anything else it it sounds like or it seems like a scene from the Godfather leave the guns take the canoli which actually sounds comical but it's it's actually tragic that the Israelis think that this actually works the fact that you there you have these Hamas Fighters militants whatever and the only thing that protects them is their guns but what they take everything and they leave the guns behind just for remind of viers what they claim to have uh found this is directly from the Israeli military they say that they found guns ammunition grenades a and a flack jacket so no no captives obviously that's the main objective for the for the Israeli military no massive network of tunnels and and and the other things that they showed are are so ridiculous it's I don't know if it you know worth commentary for example they they found a a calendar on the wall in Arabic and the military spokesman was saying you see uh these are the names of the of the Hamas Fighters and their shifts and what it actually said is Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday nothing else in Arabic so they are showing this but presume is evidence but it's actually humbug there's they don't have anything to show for that justification for the genocide that they've carried against Gaza and for the bombings of the hospitals and their vicinities and for their attacks and for the collective punishments making 36 hospitals out of service which actually led to the death of countless people thousands of people because of their policies based based on uh uh some sort of a justification with no shred of evidence and now and this is very important for our viewers around the world to keep in mind that as they brought in these boxes into the shifa hospital the last few hours you know in we saw them on camera bringing box boxes in I can only think how they are staging a scene now under the hospital of what seems to be a Hamas presence I mean now they can set up a stage of what is it's near impossible for anybody to independently verify what the Israelis are claiming right now and I guess we'll never really know because by the time anybody's allowed into the Gaza Strip the whole scene will have moved rapidly forward absolutely and and more than that 10 days ago Hamas uh proposed independent Committee of sort to come in to the hospitals and to check for themselves by the United Nations I mean we've seen for example the head of Unicef making it into Gaza and so on so so why not just send having sent an independent commission to look into what's going on guys but the Israelis didn't want it the Americans didn't want it they kept talking about evidence evidence that no one have seen clearly there isn't much of an Evidence and now we see it and for me it just brings back the memories of Iraq war weapons of mass destructions Weapons of Mass destructions there were no weapons of mass destructions and there is no Hamas headquarters under the hospitals it's all a madeup uh justification for them to carry on with their war crimes unfortunately that justification has led to the loss of life on a huge scale Maran thank you very much for that Mar Bashar there
