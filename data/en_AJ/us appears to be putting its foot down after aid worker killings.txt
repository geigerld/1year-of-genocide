as Mike Hannah joins us live now from Washington DC Mike so there seems to be a distinct change of tone and a hardening of the language in how President Biden is dealing with the Israeli leader what can we read into this Mike well very much so uh for the first time since Israel began its war on Gaza the United States is now beginning it appears to put its foot down uh the language used it is said in the conversation between President Biden and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu included the words specific concrete and measurable steps for Israel to take if it does not take So within hours or days as the White House puts it then the US will be reconsidering its policy towards Israel now what this is exactly means that's not clear the White House will not be drawn on what policy changes are being contemplated uh but the National Security spokesman in the uh White House John Kirby made very clear that this switch in attitude is directly connected to the killing of the seven food Aid workers earlier this week uh he says very specifically uh that this is indeed the case now there's a personal element here President Biden is acquainted with the owner of the world Central Kitchen Jose Andres and certainly this appears to have disturb the president intensely uh including the fact as well that among those seven food Aid workers killed is an American citizen so now you've got the US pushing into a totally different position in terms of persuading Israel to increase its protection of civilians but more than that President Biden in his phone call called for an immediate ceasefire uh to allow for the delivery of humanitarian Aid to those in Gaza so this is a significant shift in the US position whether it transforms into policy changes whether it makes assistance to Israel conditional well that's something that the White House will not comment on at this stage all right Mike Hannah live for us there in Washington Mike thank you well attacks by Israeli forces are continuing in the southern city of Rafa despite the area earlier being declared a safe Zone the latest strike killed at least seven Palestinians including three children funerals have been held for the victims west of the city Rafa has become home to more than half of gaza's population after many were forced there from the north more than 33,000 Palestinians have now been killed by Israel since the War Began including 14,000 children enough put an end to this Injustice for 180 days children have been bombed and there were daily killings enough where are the rights of children where are the rights of women where is UNICEF these are the goals of Israel it does not have any plans to end this war its targets are children and women there is no safe place at all what safety there is no safety at all in Gaza there is not one meter or inch of land that is safe they displaced them to Rafa thinking it was safe but even tents houses everywhere is being bombed there is no safety Al jazer hanim Mahmud has mourn now from Rafa in southern Gaza been very consistent with what we have experienced so far since the beginning of this genocidal where there isn't fact no safe Zone across the Gaza including the safe zones that largely designated by the Israeli military where everyone was uh ordered sharply to evacuate to to avoid being bombed but ended up being killed and bombed inside the areas that were uh designated safe Zone including Al safe area in the western part of the balah andun and city of RA but almost if we what we see in the pattern of Israeli response after every resolution or action or demand by the United Nations and its uh different agencies including the international court of justice is a more more resurge of the air strikes and Air Raids carried out relentlessly across the Gaza so it'll be interesting to see what is the Israel response uh to the demand by President Biden within as Ellen pointed out within the coming 2448 or maybe 72 uh coming hours but so far in overnight attacks the Israeli military carried out Relentless air strikes targeting more residential homes causing further civilian casualties seven people from one family and we're seeing the same exact pattern of attacks on largely civilian population civilian defenseless population side residential home with these unpredictable Fallen bombs seven people reported killed and many other injuries and and causing further internal displacement for people at the surroundings uh area
