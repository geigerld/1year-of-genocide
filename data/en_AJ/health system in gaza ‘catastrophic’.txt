Israel's Relentless bombardment has forced gaza's healthc care system to the brink of collapse more than 77,500 people have been injured since the onset of the military campaign in October only six of the strip's 36 hospitals are functioning and only partially the health Ministry has recorded a million cases of infectious diseases and more than a quarter of gaza's 2.3 million residents are on the brink of famine UNICEF estimates that a northern AA one in three children younger than two is malnourished we have with us uh James Smith who's a British doctor who traveled to Gaza with Med medical aid for Palestinians between December 2023 and January 2024 joining us from London welcome to Al jazer we appreciate your time if we start with the latest developments uh look there was a recent attack in central Gaza just a few hours ago uh we're hearing that uh 36 people were killed because of bombardment on Family Home and these people the dead and the injured have been taken to AA hospital and that is where you worked I understand uh during the months that you were in Gaza from what you've seen is Al AA Hospital able to cope with bringing in more injured people H how is the hospital dealing I mean I think what we need to remember is is that the the health system collapsed in Gaza back in uh late October of 2023 um and it hasn't recovered since and and and that's because the the supplies the resources um the the specialist Staffing and so on required um have either not entered into Gaza or where or where such sort of Commodities and resources have been made available um it's impossible for people to work um in a context of such extreme violence and insecurity um the hospital is barely able to cope I I heard from a colleague yesterday who wrote a very short message to and he simply said the situation is catastrophic um they have very very limited means to provide care to patients uh and patients are presenting with some of the most horrific trauma related injuries uh and also non-trauma related Health Care problems that I have ever seen like like what I wonder if you can just elaborate on what you saw so we would see children and adults on a on a daily basis often multiple times a day with um severe multi-trauma related injuries um often children with um traumatic amputations of of more than one limb um children and adults with horrific full thickness Burns um all of these um trauma related injuries require prolonged Specialist Care which simply isn't available um at the current time at the same time we were seeing hundred hundreds of children presenting to the pediatric department every day this was back in early January um children with diarrheal illnesses uh complex respiratory problems um all sorts of conditions that again require um immediate medical intervention and whilst you were there um what sort of Aid did you see coming to AA hospital and perhaps other areas of the Gaza Strip and you mentioned a moment ago that that you were in touch with a colleague just yesterday from from Gaza are they telling you about what sort of Aid is now coming into the Gaza Strip so I haven't heard this from from colleagues directly but but certainly during my brief time in Gaza um Aid was was um minimal at best um as as viewers will know there hasn't been a day since October 7th that we've come anywhere near the requisite 500 trucks of humanitarian Aid need has increased so exponentially in that time that we're talking about thousands and thousands of trucks that are required on a on a sing on a single day uh to bring in clean water nutritious food Essential Medical Supplies uh shelter and so on um we saw trucks parked up in Rafa for the better part of a sort of half kilometer to a kilometer um unable to to Cross or waiting to cross um and on occasion we would see very very small convoys of of of trucks moving from the south towards the north of Gaza it wasn't clear where they were going but um it was clear that the volume of of of humanitarian assistance they were were were carrying was negligible at best and in terms of I mean you know we speak to people over and over again from the Gaza Strip and and and doctors like yourselves who who just say that hospitals need absolutely everything at this point but but from what you saw what's most desperately needed for the hospitals to be able to to function what's most desperately needed first and foremost is an is an end to the violence and and Healthcare and humanitarian workers have been consistent about this from the outset uh that there's a saying that that that that that was particularly prominent during the Rwandan Genocide um which goes that doctors cannot stop a genocide um so you can resource a health system um to to to a state of almost Perfection but but but you cannot um adequately respond to the needs uh of the people under these current conditions um we have healthc care workers um Palestinian healthcare workers that have been working under these conditions for more than five months now they are completely exhausted many of them are profoundly traumatized they're also trying to look after their families at the same time um we need additional U medical support we need um staff to to work alongside them and to be directed by them we need essential Commodities at times we're talking about the absolute Basics um surgical gors to clean and and and pack wounds um simple analgesia to treat pain um we as as you've mentioned we're talking about absolutely everything that is needed at the moment uh in order to maintain the most basic level of of functionality and and let me just ask you one final question while I have you with us um James Smith I mean we see now uh the the Us and other countries uh sending Aid by sea building that Pier off the coast of Gaza we've seen these air drops that have taking place do you think that they replace the need for access to Gaza by Road and what's your reaction uh to these moves no they absolutely don't replace the need for for Access via Road this is a perverse distraction and and no humanitarian organization should play into this we're talking about effectively a humanitarian Alibi whereby ongoing um political uh uh neglect ongoing military violence is disguised with uh the the the sort of the bare minimum of of of humanitarian support um it's it's it's not even worth discussing this and and and and really we need to be pushing one for an end to the violence and two for um the the the most significant surge of of humanitarian support uh by land into Rafa uh and and Via other means um as soon as as as is possible okay uh James Smith we thank you so much for joining us from London and giving us your perspective thank you
