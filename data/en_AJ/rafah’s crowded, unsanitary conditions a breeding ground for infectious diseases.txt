well the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees unoa says that diseases could spread quickly among the displaced population of Gaza as temperatures start to rise they are saying the shortages of water and the warming temperatures could lead to a health catastrophe in the strip it's issuing another appeal for the safe access of humanitarian Aid to the area well Han Mahmud joins us now from Rafa in southern Gaza and so there is this very important warning about the spread of disease and infection but conditions are already uh so difficult and catastrophic in the shrip are we already seeing signs of a a Public Health crisis yes absolutely and already happening during winter time the cold weather the flood that took place in certain areas particularly evacuation Zone where a flood was more often happening the spread of diseases and the contamination as people are are crowded in very very small uh spaces in evacuation Zone and also in residential homes that are are are pretty much providing a very uh a a strong environment for the spread of not only uh diseases that can be contained but also infectious disease that going from one place uh to another uh but also we have the destruction of Waste Management installations by this intense bombing campaign the the destruction also of medical uh waste disposal uh centers across the Gaza Strip just restricts the the process of collecting and and this collecting of medical waste disposal and other waste particularly Solid Waste there are reports confirming close to 300,000 tons of of solid waste across the gust and it's equally bad whether in in winter time or right now as the the weather is getting a little bit warmer in each passing day the pass D were very very unusually hot in in over crowded RAF City where reports of the spread of of a strong odor of solid waste in in the roads and all the the rubble fill roads and particularly very close to evacuation centers right in in the roads and close to hospitals that has led to the spread of infectious diseases there cases documented by the health ministry as well as the wh of the spread of hepatitis A and other contamin and other infectious disease particularly among the children and women the most vulnerable group in this War uh happened to be uh from women and children who are in constant need of medical attention and proper medical attention but so far given the the situations and the lack of medical supplies and the inability of the medical staff to uh to intervene and provide life saving uh support and life-saving intervention the situation are increasingly becoming very difficult and risky right now as the weather temperature is it changing in the meantime population that can continuing to face air strikes tell us about what's been happening in Rafa overnight yeah well the destruction of Waste Management installation are the the direct byproduct of the ongoing intense bombing campaign because we're seeing when a residential block or residential area being targeted and destroyed it just causing great deal of damage to the surrounding area including public facilities hyi hygiene's infrastructure and it create this multi-layer problems and misery that's been going on for the past 6 months but and the top of that we we look at eight workers being the target uh not this time of overnight attack where one Aid worker Belgian uh development agency uh and his son a seven-year-old son were killed inside a residential home they were Sheltering in but there's in then the past 45 minutes constant gunfire uh from the naval forces at the shore of Gaza uh directly targeting areas at the moas evacuation Zone the western part of the central area in addition to the uh confirmed report we're getting of the Red Cross facility in Gaza that has been targeted and partially destroyed with three people were killed these people were inside the Red Cross facility itself Sheltering in fact we heard theyve been Sheltering inside the facility for the past couple months and since the Israeli military keeps hurting people from one place to another due to the intense bombing campaign hanim Mahmud thank you so much
