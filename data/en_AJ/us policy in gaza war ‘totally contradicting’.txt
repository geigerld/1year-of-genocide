okay well let's bring in Luciano zakara he's an associate professor of golf politics at katar University thanks again for joining us here in the studio first of all if we can start with uh what Patty was talking about that there despite what the US says I mean they've really given a strong indication that they actually invested in this war continuing uh rather than trying to bring it to a close well actually what is showing is that the United States facing a lot of uh um contradictions on one hand on the other hand there a lot of people that is not happy with how us is behaving in this in this particular context it's the second time that the United States approve emergency aid military aid to Israel in during the along this conflict meaning that they are not sure that the Congress will pass that because even within the Democrat Party there are a lot of people that they are considering that the US should rethink the overall relation with Israel and the inconditional support to what is doing so he showing on one hand that there is some change public opinion in the US politic I are changing opinion but the US cannot deviate from that uh long-term interest and long-term Alliance that has with Israel and with the support of Israel wherever it happens yeah I guess the point that many people have been making is how is selling more deadly weapons to Israel to kill thousands of Palestinians within Gaza how is that in the interests of US National Security well that's that's the whole point we don't understand that this is helping the us considering that is doing the US in the region is not providing United States more support in the region but on the other hand more backlash on what they are doing and this double standard is is been raised by many many many people even different initiatives that United is trying to to do like having a Coalition in the Red Sea uh is not getting the the support that he expected from the Arab countries more Arab countries will try not to engage in direct uh negotiation with the United St in different aspect that have to do with security as far as the United States keeps this double standard pressuring Israel supposedly and on the other hand still providing GS yeah we've also heard in the last few hours that South Africa's launched a case accusing Israel of genocide at the un's international court of justice how significant is that or is it more of a symbolic move do you think it's symbolic but significant on on on on some aspects uh South Africa itself suffer from apart hate so being a country that suffer from apart considering that what is doing Israel is wrong in terms of the history of South Africa is very is relevant in terms of giving a message to the whole International Community if it is practical we don't know I mean the international court of justice is not H the particular court that decides about genocide or war crimes is the other court yes but in the other court Israel considered that has no jurisdiction at all it's not even signatory of of those agreements it's a good way to start a process that is already there I mean uh many fights were were already submitted to both International court of justice and international criminal court against Israel from 2014 onwards nothing has been decided yet mainly because Israel consider that they are not abiding with that yeah and I guess it is a way to keep the international pressure on Israel and the United States as well South Africa has been very prominent and vocal in leading the condemnation of Israel do you think that others the Arab states should be doing more along the lines of what South Africa is doing here I they truly believe yes that they should be doing more I mean even Latin American countri I'm from Latin American background so Latin American countries have been very vocal more vocals African and Latin American count than Middle East countries uh themselves so I think it something can be done that despite the fact that the Arab leaders have been traveling visiting different Capital trying to gather uh diplomatic uh support to to different initiatives mediation etc etc but I think that these kind of legal measures can be also start from the Arab countries okay thank you so much for your Insight we really do appreciate it this Luciano zakara thank you
