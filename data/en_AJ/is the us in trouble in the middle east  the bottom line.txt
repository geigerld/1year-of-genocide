hi I'm Steve Clemens and I have a question are the wars we see today from Gaza to Ukraine a sign of decline of American influence and Power in the world let's get to the bottom line more than 7,000 Palestinians have been killed by non-stop Israeli bombing since the shock and awe attack of Hamas on October 7th when about 1,400 Israelis were killed and about 200 others were taken hostage the United Nations has been warning about a huge humanitarian catastrophe with millions of people innocent in this conflict living under constant shelling with no food electricity water medicine or fuel to keep the hospitals and ambulances running but the UN which has lost about 30 of its own staff in Gaza has so far been ineffective US President Joe Biden says he won't call for a ceasefire or otherwise interfere in Israeli military plans even as fears mount for a wider conflict in the region and in Eastern Europe the Ukraine Russian conflict grinds on also with no end in sight so what are today's raging conflicts telling us about shifting Global power is America still a nation whose positions matter to the rest of the world or is it leaving a power vacuum that's being filled by other forces today we're talking with Charles cupon a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations professor of international Affairs at Georgetown University and author of the end of the American era US foreign policy and the geopolitics of the 21st Century Dr cupin thank you so much for joining us this is a World and places in the world where American power used to matter and I've just been reading your book again and wondering whether the contraction of America in the world is somehow creating these conditions you know I think there are are two big developments Steve that are making the world feel Topsy Turvy making the world feel like it's gone upside down one of them I think we saw coming and that is the diffusion of power right we used to live in a world dominated by the United States and its Democratic partners that represented say 75% of global GDP and we're now heading into a world in which power will be decentered in which the number one power in the world within a decade or so will probably be China India maybe number two Indonesia is climbing the ranks Brazil getting stronger and stronger and that this is just leading to the return of rivalries that come with multiple centers of power the other thing that's happened and I think many of us did not see it coming is the weakening of the liberal anchor of the global system and in particular the political weakening that we've seen here in the United States with the political Center in the United States hollowing out with il liberal populism on in rise in both sides of the Atlantic and this in some ways hampers the ability of the United States and its Partners to Anchor this inevitable turn this moment in which uh there is an inflection point a shift in the global distribution of power to a much more multi-polar what you could call a polycentric world so that these two things are combining to create a real sense of disorientation within the Israel Hamas conflict now uh President Joe Biden has refused to call for a ceasefire refused to say he's going to intervene in any way in what the Israelis are doing we've also refus to call for a ceasefire in the Ukraine Russia conflict and I like Americans to have a realistic sense of how that's perceived around the world and that there are other major powers and I'll you know mention turkey and erogan on see the world differently and are we in a situation where America's lost the ability to be the great hegemonic benign power and now other nations in the world are organizing against it as it picks one side or the other in these conflicts you know I'd probably distinguish carefully between the war in Ukraine and what's happening in in Israel and the the war that Israel is in the middle of car caring out against Hamas in Ukraine I think what we've seen is a situation in which Ukraine is suffering a bald Act of aggression by Russia and in which the United States and its allies have agreed to help Ukraine but don't have boots on the ground and in the end of the day the US has said this is Ukraine's war ukrainians are fighting and dying Ukraine makes the final call about what it's War aims are and if the ukrainians want to keep fighting and try to get back Crimea and try to get back every inch of Ukrainian territory that's their right but I do think that much of the global South is not taking sides despite the fact that this is a bald Act of aggression and I think that is in many respects a consequence of a world in which many emerging powers are hedging in which China is now the lender of First Resort in much of the global South in which two-thirds of the countries in the world trade war with China than they do with the United States and so a country like India like South Africa Nigeria Brazil Indonesia they don't want to take sides in what looks like a new era of east west rivalry and as a consequence they're sitting on the fence even though I think this is a war that is very clearly a war of aggression against Ukraine in which countries at least ethically and morally should band together against Russia in the case of Israel's war uh with Hamas I think it's it's more complicated uh in the sense that the Israel Palestine conflict is one in which there are diverging opinions about morality about eth ethics about legality about human rights that have divided the United States and many other parts of the world for for quite a long time and I think that's what we're seeing play out here I think given the nature of the atrocities that Hamas carried out on October 7 Israel is seen as having a right to defend itself and having a right to respond with Force how this conflict plays out however will have a big impact on how the rest of the world reacts whether civilian casualties are kept to a minimum whether Aid Flows In to Gaza in the form of fuel medicine food whether we see an effort to arrive at some sort of reasonable peace process at the end of the conflict right now we're in the middle of it it's proving to be a very divisive bloody tragic event from your experience do you think Israel can go through the steps at wants to do right now in destroying Hamas in the way it's doing it and not have this conflict grow um far more uh significant in terms of numbers and scale well I think President Biden has has got it more or less right and and walked to Fine Line in the sense of supporting Israel going to Israel in the middle of the conflict providing military assistance to Israel but at the same time being very explicit and saying don't be blinded by rage don't make the same mistakes that the United States did after 911 where we intervene in Afghanistan and Iraq and Libya and Syria and in many respects uh produced much more chaos than stability and I think it's a wise warning to Israel because Israel is headed into a densely populated Urban environment under the best of circumstances there will be significant casualties on both sides the United States learned the hard way in Iraq that military force is is good at destroying things but not very good at creating desired political outcomes so I think that Israel right now is trying to figure out how to balance its desire justified in my mind to dismantle Hamas with the reality that it's going to be a tough war and it has to play the long game and figure out what Gaza will look like afterward what it's relationship with Palestinians and the broader Middle East will be like when the dust settles we have Wong ye right now as you and I are talking in Washington the foreign minister of China he said he believes that is Israel's actions have now gone beyond the level of self-defense and response but is he as you just said essentially making a play to the global South and again taking advantage of this moment to maximize China's position of looking like the good player in the world you know I think China is a is somewhat ambivalent about the war in Ukraine and now the war that we see in the Middle East in the sense that the Chinese have risen to a s to become a significant player on the back of geopolitical and geoeconomic stability and even though they've sided with Putin and supported at least nominally Russia's war against Ukraine I'm not sure that they see this as a net gain for China and that's again because this is leading to Global fragmentation it is leading to economic decoupling and it is intensifying China's rivalry with the United States and the west but I think you're right Steve that what China is doing here is in some ways attempting to stay out of these conflicts yet at the same time exploit them to increase its standing in the global South to play the role of the country that's standing up to Western hegemony and in some ways I think it's it's irresponsible in doing so because it is aiding and abetting Russia's aggression against Ukraine and rather than trying to play a more constructive role in the Middle East whether is helping to negotiate the release of hostages figuring out how to limit damage getting humanitarian assistance into Gaza it's the something to in some ways exploit the issue to try to raise its profile in the global South uh and in some ways I think as a consequence its position is going to further inflame the tensions that we see out there between the West the United States on the one hand China on the other Charlie I want to play a sound clip for you from Secretary of State Tony blinkin let's listen heat water electricity for children for the elderly for the sick these are President Putin's new targets he's hitting them hard this brutalization of Ukraine's people is barbaric so I'm just sort of interested in one the hypocrisy of the moment you know talking about these same devices being used to turn something off and are not being able to talk about it with regards Israel and then trying to help the other side why their response has been so pathetically small well you know I think that the United States has made clear from the beginning that it has done its best to get the border crossing to Egypt open to get Aid flowing has been discussing with Israel how it prosecutes this war as we were speaking about a few minutes ago Mr Biden said very clearly don't mistake the same don't make the same mistakes we did don't be blinded by rage so I think this is a a work in progress but given that uh the the attacks on October 7 were over the top were atrocities now you have women children grandmothers kidnapped being held hostage in Gaza I think one can understand to some extent Israel's rage and Israel's response but I do think that there is a middle ground here and that involves a careful but strong military operation against Hamas leadership against Hamas Fighters against the tunnels the weapons Depots with at the same time efforts to protect civilians to get food fuel water medicine into Gaza so as to diminish and minimize the humanitarian emergency that is inevitably unfolding when Hamas decid decides to use its own Palestinian Brethren as human Shields I guess my question to you is about the tyranny of inertia and the vested interests that build up that don't want to see progress on these you know fragile geostrategic hot points is that part of the game we have to accept that we're always going to have certain nodes in the world that continually erupt like this well you know as as my friend and colleague Richard hos put it a few days ago in the Middle East things get worse before they get worse uh and I think the message here is trying to build peace in the region trying to get Rosa between longstanding adversaries is very difficult business I take my hat off to President Obama for trying to reset the relationship with Russia for attempting to decrease the animos it with places like Iran and Cuba and he did to some extent succeed and to some extent he didn't succeed but I do think we have to keep trying and Steve we know from history that peace does break out right the French and the Germans were killing each other for centuries you now drive from France to Germany and you see no border crossings the United States has a relationship with its neighbors in which the prospect of war is Unthinkable not in the realm of the possible pockets of Peace do emerge and so I think when it comes to the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians when it comes to the relationship uh uh of the United States and China we have to keep trying to push things in a positive direction we know from history that the the default position in international politics is competition is rivalry and in some cases is armed rivalry but we all also know from history that when you work hard enough you can overcome that inevitable uh feeling that things are slipping away this is one of those moments those historical inflection points where I think we could go either way we could see the 21st century slip toward geopolitical competition deglobalization and liberal populism or we could look at the moment that we're in now and push the pendulum back in the right direction at this point I think it's too soon to tell which way we're going to be heading President Biden's National Security adviser Jake Sullivan just published a 7,000 word article in foreign affairs uh and it's focusing on the future of the world in America's place in it one of the lines of of many uh is that the world is becoming more contested and the United States cannot talk only with those who share its Vision or values and it made me wonder whether or not as you sort of look at what Jake Sullivan is trying to communicate is this a moment of realism where America is finally beginning to understand the limits of its power and capabilities that is in in fact going to begin talking with other players with with which it may not get along in a different because I haven't seen that as part of of the Biden administration's Direction certainly not in the Trump Administration but wonder whether you think the limits on American power are finally beginning to shape the way we think about what we can do in the world well you know I would start by quoting the first sentence in in Jake's very interesting article and that first sentence was nothing in international politics is inevitable uh and I would take issue with that analysis because I think some things are inevitable number one change in the distribution of power right we go back to the 1700s and we saw power in the world shift from the East to the west and Europe and North America together have been at the top of the Heat leading the path for quite some time we now see Power beginning to shift from west to east and from north to south that's going to make the world more diff difficult more unpredictable more uncertain the United States is not going to be able to call the shots in the same way that it used to we're going to have to get used to a multi-polar world we're going to have to get used to pluralism and ideological diversity because that's the world that we're headed toward that seems to me to be inevitable that having been said I would agree with Jake that there's a lot of room for taming that world and channeling a more decentered World in a positive direction but it will take working across geopolitical and ideological dividing lines we now live Steve in a world that is more interdependent and globalized than ever before many of the challenges that we need to face oh both as a country and as International citizens require broad-based Global cooperation and that means working with countries with whom we may not share the same principles and the same values I think the Biden Administration got off to a more ideological start than was probably um advisable democracy versus autocracy with us or against us now I think it's realize that it needs a more pragmatic uh a more practical approach I do think that behind the scenes the United States has been reaching out to China we've seen a steady set of efforts for of cabinet officials to head to China Jake Sullivan has twice in the recent past met with the Chinese leadership I think there's a sense that we don't want to go down the rabbit hole of a new Cold War let's see if we can't find ways of working with the Chinese to meet Global challenges even if we may disagree with them about human rights about democracy and even about geopolitical issues in East Asia let me just ask you finally in political science we learn about particularly in foreign policy the continuity typically of policies from one Administration to the next Administration regardless of political party but it seems like that world is gone and particularly when you look at a country like Iran and if you were basically to say in your calculation that we should sit down and talk to Iran we've had a zigzag in those policies do you think as you look at the F the situation in America right now which is part of that Topsy Turvy Dimension that you started with at the beginning do you suspect that we're not going to have continuity in American foreign policy any longer that we're going to continue to see zigzags and instability and the way we approach and engage the world well Steve you know the this zigzag and erratic statecraft that you're referring to is new uh if you go back to the Cold War really beginning with FDR 1941 Pearl Harbor Democrats and Republicans came together and there was a broad ideologically Centrist bipartisan compact that stood behind a steady brand of American statecraft those days are gone mainly because we've seen the hollowing out of the political Center in the United States and as a consequence when power changes hands in Washington from Democrat to Republican you get wild swings in foreign policy I think that is likely to continue depending upon who wins the next election simply because there is a fundamental ideological cleavage along partisan lines about America's role in the world for me I think the key here is rebuilding the American political iCal center from the ground up strength in the United States starts at home and I think key to our future both our domestic future and our ability to play a purposeful and effective International role is rebuilding bipartisanship rebuilding consensus that is going to take getting American working Americans back up on their feet well we'll have to end it there Georgetown University professor Charles cupin senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations thank you so much for joining us today Steve it's been my pleasure to join you so what's the bottom line beneath all this analysis Global strategy and US support for Israel and Ukraine and Russia testing the west and the role of non-state actors beneath all of that are real people and real families one of our colleagues here at Al jazer the bureau chief in Gaza just lost four members of his family after an Israeli air strike hit what Israeli official said was terrorist infrastructure while DD's family had already fled Northern Gaza as the Israelis had warned people to do but they were killed anyway after fleeing South this is real while has lost most of his family and there are thousands of other innocent people on both sides of this conflict who've lost their families this month yes we should be thinking through policies and Global crises and asking how we got here but sometimes it's just time to give our sincere condolences to those who've just lost loved ones and that's the bottom
