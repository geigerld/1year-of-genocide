Israel declares war on Hamas and orders a total Siege of Gaza with no food or electricity after an unprecedented attack by the Palestinian armed group the Israeli Prime Minister has vowed to destroy hamas's capabilities but at what cost and is there a risk the war could spill over to the region this is Inside Story [Music] hello and welcome to the program I'm FIB batibo Israel's defense minister has ordered a Complete Siege of Gaza he says Palestinians in The Enclave will soon have no access to electricity food or fuel the territory has been under Non-Stop bombardment and hundreds of Palestinians and Israelis have been killed since Hamas Fighters managed to infiltrate the Southern areas of Israel on Saturday Hamas says the attack is a response to more than 70 years of occupation and a 15-year blockade of Gaza Israel has responded by formerly declaring war it's the most serious escalation in decades but why exactly did this new War start and where does it go from here plenty to discuss with our guests but first this report from saril on the events of the past few days in the early hours of October 7th Hamas launched dozens of rockets from Gaza into Southern Israel the attack has been called an unprecedented operation the outcome of this battle is not yet revealed to the enemy the Israeli occupation forces have yet to learn how massive this operation is once they realize the severity and outcome of it they'll regret it to our brave Fighters across the occupied territories you've proven that you have the resolve this is your day to March forward by October 8th Hezbollah joined the war a senior official says his Fighters will continue to support Palestinians our history our guns and our Rockets are with you everything we have is with you Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to win the war warning gazen residents to leave their home all of the places which Hamas has deployed hiding and operating in in that Wicked City we will turn it into an island of ruins I'm telling gaza's people to leave those places now because we will take action everywhere as October 8th came to a close the people of Gaza had suffered their deadliest stay in 15 years Israeli air strikes Hit The besieged Enclave from all sides killing nearly 300 Palestinians we are bearing the brunt of this attack uh we have been uh witnessing uh bombings in on residential buildings every five minutes uh the uh explosions are rocking uh every place in Gaza is targeted now no place is safe I wish I could be a normal child living with no war no Rockets so that we can return home safely hundreds of Israelis have also been killed and it's thought that at least 100 have been captured and taken into Gaza as the coming October days unfold it's unclear how and when this war might end but the loss of innocent civilian life will likely continue Sara Gil for Inside Story well let's bring in our guests now for today's Inside Story in ramala in the occupied West Bank is Mustafa baruti Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative in Boston is Ramy kurri author and distinguished public policy fellow at the American University of Beirut and in London Daniel Levy president of the US Middle East project he's also former Israeli negotiator and adviser to the office of former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak thank you all for being on Inside Story Mr Mustafa barotti in ramala if I can start with you there's a lot of concern right now about what might come next after this surprise attack by Hamas uh Israel has said there'll be no food no water no electricity to Gaza because of this attack how worried are you about what might come next we are absolutely worried and uh what you've just described no water no electricity no supplies means that Netanyahu is conducting an act of total Collective punishment against the Palestinian population of Gaza against two .2 million people but more than that this fascist government in Israel and I insist on using the word fascist is threatening ethnic cleansing of 2.2 million people how could Netanyahu tell 2.2 million people living in Gaza a very small area of no more than 140 square miles that they should leave their homes where should they go to he wants to throw them in the sea where should these people go there is no safe place at this very moment in Gaza massacres are taking place no less than 570 Palestinians have been killed so far mostly and probably 100% civilians including more than 100 children and this will continue Netanyahu promises that he will bombard every house in Gaza how could the world accept this I must remind you that 70% of the people of Gaz today the 2.2 million people are refugees who were ethnically cleansed from their land in 1948 by the Israeli troops and now they want to ethnically cleanse them one more time the basic question here why do we why we are in this mainly because Israel refuses to end its occupation mainly because Israeli establishment refuses to end its enslavement of the Palestinian people in a system of aparti that is much worse according to all human rights organizations than the aparte system that prevailed in South Africa at one point of time this is a situation that nobody can tolerate and nobody should tolerate and instead of the United States forcing Israel to stop these massacres they are encouraging them to attack more and more the Palestinian people we'll come back to the US role in all this in just a moment but I want to bring in Daniel Ley into the conversation uh Daniel the Israelis are saying right now that this is a response to hamas's Brazen attack on Israel a few days ago which saw hundreds of Israelis killed as well but how is uh a Siege of Gaza a Complete Siege of Gaza with no food or water to Palestinians which uh Mr baruti rightly describ described as collective punishment how is that going to ensure security the security of Israel very simply it isn't very sadly is these are heartbreaking pictures one's heartbreaks to see what has happened and and and one trembles to see what is happening now in Gaza and what Wayne well transpire over the coming days but the sad truth is that that position espoused by the Israeli leadership is precisely what got us here and so it means they have learned nothing and I know that these are the most difficult days to for those for the thinking to to be different but the history didn't begin three days ago and Mustafa baruti just pointed out who who are these 2.2 million inhabitants of Gaza why are 70% of them refugees until Palestinians have security Israelis will not have security that is the equation that is the intertwined fate of these two peoples and if Israel thinks that there is a military solution then we are condemned to reliving this kind of conversation again and again and again but I I hope and this may be a polanish hope that people will begin to ask themselves is this the only way every day Palestinians live without the most basic security predictability of Life Israelis woke up to a trauma on the weekend but they have to start getting into their heads that if Palestinians are going to be denied their most basic rights you know you have a very credible designation that the crime of aparte is being committed uh in terms of Israel's rule over the Palestinians if that's the reality in which Palestinians live then across geography across history people who live under those conditions if all other avenues are closed to them take up armed resistance and okay you know the most frustrating thing today Folly if I may just in one one additional comment the most frustrating painful thing we have been warning policy makers for years that if every nonviolent Avenue is closed if you're not going to hold Israel accountable if you're not going to challenge Israel to change its policies at the UN at the IC CC through sanctions with how you sell your weapons then you are leaving only one outlet for Change and war is the worst thing Ramy kurri your thoughts about what Daniel and Mustafa baruti have said what is your reaction to this evolving situation and what do you think Led Led us to this point today well I totally agree with Mr F Daniel as usual um I will add one more dimension I'm B cambri near Boston in the United States going back and forth to be in them at least but watching the events from here for the last couple of years has clarified uh certain issues that I think are really important and the the the span of time that that Palestinians have suffered in the way that mustan Daniel had described um is 50 70 years since since 1948 but it really goes back further than that and what happened was when the British started in 1915 the colonial process of of stealing Palestinian land and giving it to the Zionist movement which was a very small movement to make up pain that Jews felt in Europe because of anti-Semitism and pgms um this started a process in which Zionism Jewish people Israel whatever had Primacy in this land uh and continues today and here from the West we see the United States uh sending a naval task force now prepared to involv in the fighting if need be or to help uh Israel so the the fundamental dilemma uh which is that the Israeli Zionist movement has never acknowledged that Palestinians and Israelis have equal rights that is the fundamental Point we've acknowledged that Palestinians have recognized it in documents and agreements and their actions but the Israelis have not so the the the Exile of the Palestinians now is about 10 years longer than the ancient Exile of the Hebrews and B Exile people fight back before I come back to Mustafa I just wanted to pick up on something you said Ramy about the Americans and they have are deploying the Americans are deploying in the Mediterranean it's not just sending arms to Israel as they usually do but a employment in their words to contain the situation but that's going is it going to contain the situation or is it inflaming it more well from the American perspective is that for me yes the the uh from the American perspective this is designed to send the signal to Israel that we're with you if you need assistance with there mostly in terms of supplies and Logistics and stuff but it's also from the American View signal to Iran the American Media and political establishment is totally obsessed with Iran uh Iran and China are now the threats in the world um and they will do anything to play up that threat and it just it's really a demonstration of almost Mass hysteria uh and we see it played out in the media in politics and by the way the media coverage in the United States also reflects something really really terrible I I I want to to find journalism school in the United States I'm constantly in touch with the top journalists in schools the way mainstream media is covering this uh uh situation if that was judged against the standards that are taught in American journalism schools they would get an F they would be thrown out of school okay uh let me come back to uh Mr baruti uh on the question of the Iran obsession that Ramy raised there some news reports have suggested that Hamas couldn't have pull this on its own couldn't have done this on its own and that it had outside help what are your thoughts about this and why shouldn't Hamas get help from any country Israel is getting the utmost help from the United States which is providing Israel with the most sophisticated military equipment and is covering up for Israel for having 200 nuclear heads uh European countries are supporting Israel United States is supporting Israel Israel has a an amazing network of support all over the world so why shouldn't Hamas get try to get support from somebody else I think it's a it's a very unreasonable question do you expect this do you expect this support from from outside countries to Hamas to continue and to become more visible no let me explain here there are two issues first of all Palestinians are not relying on anybody the big qu the big lesson they've learned we learned especially after the normalization of Arab countries with Israel is that we should only depend on ourself we should be self-reliant we should resist with our own abilities and that's exactly what's happening today but on the other hand the issue of Iran is usually is is is is reminds us with the Israeli Behavior always they always try to find a country to blame and claim that Palestinians are followers of that country first it was the Soviet Union then it was Egypt then it was Syria then it was Iraq now it's Iran maybe tomorrow it will be aeran I don't know but the reality is that and and the other aspect of this is that they say that they will make peace with Saudi Arabia and with Bahrain and with the Emirates to that's in question it would seem this this event and this new war might put that on hold don't you think the normalization with the sou absolutely yes absolutely of course now actually one of the reasons of what's happening today is that Palestinians felt that their cause is being marginalized and Netanyahu went as far as going to the United Nations and carrying the map of Israel including annexed West Bank annexed Gaza and Annex the Golan Heights as well as East Jerusalem so the message was clear and Netanyahu and smotrich said it no place for Palestinian state so what do we live in a state a situation of enslavement let me ask you why by which law in the world a country like Israel which is occupying us is declaring war on unoccupied territory it's amazing that this is allowed to happen Netanyahu in my opinion is a criminal he is ready to do anything to save himself he is ready to kill Palestinians and Israelis I know that he's taking now the risk of killing Israeli prisoners who are in right why is he doing that he doesn't care about people he cares about himself about saving this is the most opportunistic criminal leader ever in the Middle East Daniel Daniel leevy let me get your thoughts on that on the end game here for Netanyahu and this Israeli government I know you were on the inside but with a previous government but you might help us understand what the thinking is right now in Israel what is the end game you know with this new conflict in Gaza is it to reoccupy Gaza or is it more than that with your permission F if I may just comment on um a couple of points raised because I think the other thing that these events remind us is that the Abraham Accords and the normalization and the talks Mustafa just referenced this is not making peace in the Middle East because this is not between Waring parties this is a lie that the Americans have told themselves and told the world and it's a problem when you get caught up in your own lies because you lose eye contact you lose touch with reality the normalization Accords don't address what the problem is they address something else Al together now I think Netanyahu is probably saying to himself I do something spectacular I get through this militarily but what Israel is faced here what we have seen is a staggering failure of deterrence of intelligence and of the military and I think it would be a mistake if I may to suggest that the problem is Netanyahu his government has been focused on the judicial overhaul you know people will remember there were these weekly protests against what they were pursuing legislatively that the problem is that they've been focused too much on the settlers in the West Bank and they haven't paid enough attention to Gaza and this narrative exists in Israel I think that's the easy go-to place but it ignores what I think is a far more fundamental Malay and decomposition within the system because Israel felt and here's where the American peace comes in Israel felt the Palestinians we've got them they're easy to manage the world will let us do whatever we want to the Palestinians they don't need to be seriously we we can when there are periods of quiet we can Fritter those away by just doing our worst never trying to take any political initiative because they don't even recognize the core root problem here of Palestinian dispossession and so the dismissiveness the hubris means that Israel says we've got the most amazing surveillance systems and they're not paying attention that actually in asymmetric Warfare you don't need to go toe to to Toe with your adversary you need to be able to do other things and America here is the greatest empowerer enabler of that hubris because America tells Israel we have your back now when America goes looking for opportunities to demonstrate that its huis trips it up when it invades other countries it can always Retreat back home it's surrounded by Mexico Canada and water when Israel indulges in this kind of hub it has an existential problem and I tend to think that the days of occupation Deluxe may be over okay let's bring uh Ramy in on that Ramy do you agree do you agree with what Daniel just described there he thinks the days of occupation may be coming to an end as a result of this attack and the ensuing war in Gaza yes I think it's becoming clear that the dimensions the nature the longevity and the meaning of of what Hamas has just done and continues to do there apparently still Pockets inside Southern Israel where fighting is going on the consequences of this are enormous and we won't really see them for some days or weeks uh but it's definitely clear that uh the the nature of Palestinian governance and docility has been shattered the nature of Israeli uh doctrine of military force and mowing the grass and starving uh Palestinians that has to come to an end because it's backfired on them it doesn't work the nature the idea of of Israeli superiority and invincibility uh has been Shattered by the way I would suggest to American Urban police forces who are still looking to Israeli police training to think twice having seen what just happened now uh and the nature of American and Western British and other support for Israel and anything it wants to do for instance blocking the ICC investigation that the change that has to happen is that the invisibility and powerlessness and vulnerability and docility and suffering of the Palestinian people since 1915 at the hands of British supported and then later American supported zist colonialism that has to change into a situation of a negotiated peace where the people of Israel and the state of Israel and the Palestinians and their people and all the surrounding states all live with equal rights we've made this offer the Arabs have repeatedly made this offer the Palestinians have signed on to it Hamas even agreed to Goat when he entered into negotiations uh that's the answer is to to end the invisibility of the Palestinians but and let me ask you this because you talked about this a little while ago the the question of normalization how is this going to play out regionally in the next few weeks of course because we've had some Arab countries that have established relations with Israel the UAE for example the biggest country in the region Saudi Arabia was reportedly on a path to normalize relations with Israel that as we've said might now be on hold but where does this leave the other countries in the region Visa V the Palestinian issue and the Palestinian people when you look at Arab countries you have to look at leaders and you have to look people the leaders do what to do to stay in power to make money to have an end with Jared Kushner uh and this is what they continue to do uh the people of the region not just the Arab people but Iran turkey other people of the world if you look all over the world public opinion support equal rights for Palestinians and Israelis we're not talking about throwing the Israelis out of the Middle East we're talking about living with the Israelis and Palestinians with totally equal rights and resolving the Palestine Refugee issue which was the beginning and core uh of of of this problem so the normalization things that go on U are pretty meaningless Beyond uh some uh Stock Exchange price increases from companies owned by people in uh leadership positions in the Middle East and in North America so I would not to worry too much about it um because SCE of what Hamas has done and the implications that we will see coming out of popular support for U what what hopefully might translate into a new political arrangement in the region that does recognize the equal rights of Palestinians and Israelis that that Force which will have immense support among Arab publics will spill over uh into the leaderships okay Mr Musafa baruti let me come to you now and ask you about a point Ramy raised he said that this these events of the past few days will no doubt change the nature of Palestinian governance now interestingly we've heard very little from the Palestinian Authority in the last few days why is that because uh they have had the wrong line and they are marginalized now and Israel also made sure to marginalize them as much as possible and they look irrelevant and they are now at a crossroad either they join their people and support the right of the Palestinians to resist and engage in action that would lead to Unity of Palestinians around a program of struggling for our rights or they will be marginalized completely and uh I think what we need now is Israel now is forming a Unity government what we need now is a unified leadership with all Palestinians together the Palestinian Authority should put aside not only secur security coordination with these occupiers but also they should put aside uh the internal division with Hamas and accept accept that we are all in one unified leadership and prepare the ground for Democratic free elections and let the people choose the leadership that they want I was gonna make one more comment go ahead Daniel I think it's important to point out FY that as we're talking we're seeing the uh Europeans and others threatening to cancel their aid to the Palestinians and and I think it's important in that context for people to realize that the West on this question is doing itself such a disservice if it wants to be taken seriously as a normative actor that in other spaces talks about international law talks about the rule of law and on this question it's not that the rest of world supports the specific action this weekend I think when you see the images you recoil from that just as you shudder at what is happening to the civilians in Gaza but if you're going to uphold international law if you're going to claim that mantle you do it consistently and that means you cannot indulge Israel's violations every day of international law you cannot indulge the war crime that Netanyahu has just promised to commit in Gaza you can't have it both ways and you cannot pretend that you are indifferent or be indifferent to what has happened to the Palestinians for day after day year after year decade after decade thank you so much thank you all to all three of you for a great
