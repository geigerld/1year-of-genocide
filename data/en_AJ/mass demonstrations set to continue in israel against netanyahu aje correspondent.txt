aljaz Hamas alut is monitoring developments from the Jordanian Capital Aman because reminder the Israeli government has banned aljazera from reporting inside Israel so hamda you've attended many of these protests yourself what is your takeaway after today well this is certainly a shift in how Israelis are viewing their anger against Israel's government look for months we've been covering these demon ations we were previously on the ground listening to family members of captives expressing how tired they were of netanyahu's inability to secure a deal but now it's a little bit different the tide has shifted and that's because of the captives that were retrieved their bodies rather from Southern Gaza over the weekend now according to Israeli Army intelligence those captives were still alive just a few days before and according to leaks within Israeli media and from Hamas officials a lot of those captives were actually going to be on a list to be released within the first phase of a ceasefire deal that never happened so the family members of captives are blaming Netanyahu directly for their death saying that he is the reason why there hasn't been a deal so there's been a lot of anger and we've seen these demonstrations in unprecedented numbers especially in Tel Aviv around 300,000 people there on Sunday half a million across the country that same night and police police for the first time using stun grenades to disperse the crowds police mounted on Horseback trampling demonstrators and remember there was also a labor strike called by the most powerful and largest Labor Union within Israel which was a rare move during wartime so the tides are certainly shifting but it's still unclear what kind of effect it's having on Netanyahu hni in the face of that popular anger the Prime Minister doubl down on keeping troops along the Gaza Egypt border the Philadelphia Corridor and that as we know is possibly the biggest impediment to getting a ceasefire deal done Netanyahu claimed that Israel needs to stay there for security reasons needs to keep troops along the corridor but his former Defense Minister not his a former Defense Minister Benny Gans just said actually know Israel doesn't need that for security purposes very publicly tell us more well that's right Netanyahu doubling down in a press conference on Monday saying that Israel Presence at the Philadelphia Corridor to ensure there is no sort of weapons smuggling from Egypt is critical if there is a deal but Benny gance remember a former member of the unity government a former member of Israel's war cabinet that was dissolved after he decided to leave and step down because of disagreements with how Netanyahu was handling the war so Benny gance is essentially saying that he's a former Defense Minister he's a former military Chief of Staff he knows how the Army Works he knows what they need and it's not a presence at the Philadelphia Corridor it's not an occupation there that there could be other mechanisms in place to ensure that the weapon smuggling perhaps doesn't happen but that troops on the ground are not needed and this is very publicly from someone who has said that everything Netanyahu is saying up until this point is wrong and also a lie hamda salut reporting from Aman Jordan thank you very much hamda make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
