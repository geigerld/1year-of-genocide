okay we're just going to break into that now and uh we're going to cross uh live to the UN where ambassadors from Arab nations are holding a joint news conference about the uh situation in Gaza we're going to listen to that in just a moment reminder that about 18,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October let's listen YC group and Arab group presented the resolution uh through United Arab Emirate and this resolution got 13 vote and has been uh uh has been uh uh voted by against by United States uh we decide to request the reception of the 10th emergency uh emergency special session in general assembly and we meet today the P President of General Assembly and it has decided that this session will resume this afternoon at 3:00 and we are here to to give you some information about the the the the latest ongoing situation in Palestine and we are what we are going to do in this special emergency session and I give the floor right now to Ambassador Riyad in order to give you more detail on the situation have the floor uh thank you very much brother cidi Muhammad the chair of the OIC uh as we told you last week we will keep you informed and we will keep meeting with you and we are doing that uh after last Friday when we had an unprecedented number of co-sponsors to the draft resolution from outside the council 103 countries uh unfortunately that draft was defeated by casting a veto in spite of the fact that 13 voted in favor immediately after that we had consultations among the groups uh co-sponsoring this effort and uh decided uh to send a letter to the president of the general assembly from the chair of the Arab group and the chair of the OIC uh uh requesting the resumption of the 10th emergency session and we are very grateful that the president of the general assembly uh cooperated with us very quickly uh during the weekend and with his staff and circulated as you know a letter to the membership of the United Nations during the weekend indicating that he will be convening the resuming the 10th emergency session Tuesday after afternoon today we also uh uh uploaded uh the uh draft resolution which I am sure that you are now have seen it uh and uh we are collecting co-sponsorship to that draft resolution and then the number is very high it could very easily you know uh approach the 100 but more importantly is the countries that will vote in favor so we are in full mobilization mode we will have another emergency meeting for the OIC group because all the Arab countries are members of the OIC so it is a combined you know meeting at 11:00 in order to strategize for full mobilization of having the largest number possible of countries voting in favor and it looks promising our effort is to bring an immediate ceasefire I call it a humanitarian ceasefire as the SG calls it is okay uh and in our resolution the one in the security Council which was defeated and the one that is before the general assembly for voting on it uh this afternoon it also refers to the letter of the SG invoking artic 99 in which he asked among other things for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire There is almost a global consensus on that call uh some of us were able to see even a demonstration in front of the US Mission with a huge sign calling for a ceasefire now so this is where we are we had a meeting uh uh this morning with the president of the general assembly was was a very productive meeting we talked about the details of how the session will unfold uh the voting on the draft resolution will start at the beginning because we anticipate that there will be a long list of speakers the subject is urgent the fact that we are meeting on Tuesday after the veto on Friday it indicates that the situation is dire and we need action and we need it as quickly as possible so therefore we are not going to have a long debate and then vote at the end which is customary but now we are going to dis you know vote on the draft resolution at the beginning and then you know to continue with the debate and the president of the general assembly informed us that when we have a spell over it will be taken on Friday when the general assembly very appropriately will be uh you know uh commemorating and celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights so that the situation is a massive tragedy for human rights particularly for children and women in the Gaza Strip so the continuation of the debate during that appropriate time is very ve very befitting now uh as you probably know there might be some amendments from those who are still insisting to politicize the subject and they are not satisfied with everything else including what the SG says and what lazarini and others say they insist to try to politicize a humanitarian resolution uh we are determined that we will not allow such amendments to succeed we will oppose them we will will defeat these amendments we were hoping that no amendment to be introduced and to vote up and down on the draft resolution itself which calls mainly for a humanitarian ceasefire uh at the end of the day we believe we will prevail with almost the entire International Community in calling for a humanitarian ceasefire as the Secretary General is calling for as all un agencies working on the humanitarian field are calling for as the Red Cross the International Red Cross in which the president will be in the occupied Palestinian territory again uh uh you know in the next few days uh calling for uh let me just give also a small footnote we are grateful for the effort of our brothers and sisters uh from United AR Arab Emirate led by uh Her Excellency uh lenina nbe who came up with a brilliant idea as I said before and invited a large number of Security Council Members they visited Rafa and the Alish yesterday they listened to briefings from Mr lazarini and Mr Tor wiland along with our minister of health and our minister of social welfare and Senior officials from the Palestinian and the Egyptian red crescent uh I I don't know if my brother Muhammad has some details to share about that visit but we are waiting for the readout from you know uh Ambassador Lana nus uh whom should be here I think in a day or two along with her colleagues who um made that trip to uh Rafa that is a significant trip that is a gesture that the great majority of members in the security Council who voted in favor of the ceasefire made that trip it's symbolic but it is very important and we appreciate that uh if you have questions you can ask them yes thanks Ambassador um when you had the last vote in the general assembly in October there were 14 countries that opposed uh the humanitarian truce and 44 that abstained do you think seeing how the situation has deteriorated in these weeks since the last vote that you will bring some of those uh persuade them to change their position to vote for the humanitarian ceasefire and what will a large number say to the International Community a large number of support uh and do you think it will send a message to Washington I think it will send a message to Washington and to others you forgot to mention the most important number which is the 121 actually 122 that you know were supportive of uh that draft resolution our expectation that this time it will be higher than that number and we hope that it will be higher by a significant number but we don't want to go to to go ahead of ourselves let's wait and see how the general assembly would react let me also add if you compare the draft resolution before the general assembly in comparison to the one on 26 of October the resolution that you refer to uh number one in this resolution it calls for a ceasefire humanitarian ceasefire while the other one it talks about steps that lead eventually to a secession of hostilities so that that is a significant difference the other one so that if some of you to ask me the question is it binding or not binding the language that is in it it it Demands a ceasefire and that is the language that was used in the security Council demanding from anybody from the United Nations whether the general assembly or the security Council it is much poor more powerful than calling for and therefore it should be looked at as binding in that sense definitely if the great majority of the general assembly demands an immediate humanitarian ceasefire there is no explanation to that sentence or that provision other than it is binding and Israel has to abide by it and those who are shielding and protecting Israel until now should also look at it this way and therefore act accordingly Mr Ambassador uh one of the Amendments uh uh addresses the issue of um uh detainees uh or hostages but in the same time we see that Israel has um detained a lot of Palestinians during this operation in Gaza and also in the West Bank so why don't you also add a language that addresses this issue because a lot of Palestinians have been detained you know there are many other uh very important elements that could be uh added to any resolution but we will not lose focus from the most important issue which is demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire now that is the most important issue if we are derailed from that objective and start trying to amend in this direction on and that direction and politicizing the uh uh draft resolution then we will not reach an agreement the Security Council is a good example the security Council tried several times to agree on a language but because of the politicization they did not succeed the only time they succeeded in 2712 when they made it completely humanitarian resolution they succeeded so for those those who want to learn from the behavior in the security Council and in the International Community Common Sense would say avoid controversial issues avoid naming names and concentrate on the demand of stopping this war stopping this Carnage saving lives saving the lives of our children in the Gaza Strip and the wom and the civilians and the vulnerables this these are the most important elements everything else we could deal with it later on but that's not the time to deal with it we need to stop this war and we need to stop it now as the Secretary General indicated so that un you know uh agencies can perform the the noble duty of reaching everyone in the Gaza Strip and giving them humanitarian assistance to save lives those who were kill killed May God you know take care of them and he will but those who are still alive it is our duty to save them and to keep them alive so that's why we will not lose focus from the main uh subject and all those who are trying to be clever or blunt in terms of derailing us from this you know objective will be defeated although we appeal to them not to play that game and let us vote under draft resolution as is the essence of it is immediate humanitarian ceasefire the last question thank you ambass aler English my question for you is you've mentioned that the resolution holds stronger language and you're hoping that this will put more pressure on Washington to lead to what will be a stop to the fighting what is your message to the Palestinian people who worry that similar to previous resolutions Israel might ignore the resolution currently at the ga today the Palestinian people are so angry and frustrated and no one should blame them and if they are upset and angry with all of us and the UN and the International System no one should blame them they are right in that outrage and anger when you have now we are approaching 20,000 Palestinians killed 70% of them children and women and not counting those who are under the rebels and more than 50 50,000 injured and 2/3 of the buildings in the Gaza Strip destroyed and cannot be used for living in in such you know facilities and all the hospitals are almost you know uh cannot function they're out of work and also that people do not have food they do not have water they don't have medicine we have so many relatives we call them and we ask about X or Y and Z and they say they die and we say why were they killed from bombardment some were killed by bombardment others they are dying because of lack of medicine and so on and so forth the tragedy is so beyond comprehension so that if they are angry and frustrated and they curse all of us beginning with me I understand and they are right and we are wrong our duty is to try to save the lives who are still alive by having this res resolution adopted and by forcing Israel to comply with it and those who are shielding Israel to comply with the global consensus calling for uh ceasefire Ambassador Riyad manur the permanent Observer of Palestine to the UN he said quote our effort is to bring an immediate ceasefire the situation is dire Christ joins us live now from the UN Krist what can we make of that address well this is Ambassador Riad Monsour of the Palestinian Authority attempting to Rally support for a resolution that will be put to a vote before the general assembly later today uh a resolution very similar to one that was vetoed in the security Council by the United States he said that he is in full mobilization mode and he was appearing ing there with Arab ambassadors and ambassadors from Islamic countries as well who've called for this vote in order to build up pressure for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza noting that it's what the Secretary General of the United Nations has called for uh noting that the humanitarian situation humanitarian deliveries are not able to keep up with the growing demands of the people in Gaza who are uh suffering from a lack of food and Medicine uh this is the attempt to show Israel and the United States that there is global support for this humanitarian ceasefire and they're hoping to get uh more than the 103 co-sponsors that they already had for the security Council resolution in the general assembly saying that they were optimistic that a vast majority of countries would sign on it would take two-thirds majority for the resolution to pass and I should say that there are some uh amendments being proposed one uh by the United States which complained about the uh Security Council resolution that it didn't specifically condem Hamas for the attacks of October 7th some language uh to that effect uh being proposed by the United States as an amendment uh that will be voted on before the full vote in the general assembly later today however uh the Ambassador saying that the most important thing was to keep it simple uh to focus on the need for a ceas fire and get as many countries on board as soon as possible Christen slimy thanks very much indeed for that
