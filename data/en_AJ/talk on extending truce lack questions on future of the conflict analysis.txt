Kut who's an assistant professor of public policy with the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies he's also a specialist on conflict resolution and international Aid welcome back to Al jazer so who do you think is calling the shots right now when it comes to uh the ceasefire and and what happens next uh it's a very complicated question Darin I think everyone has has a say more or less in this very what can I ask you then is the ball in someone's courtt or or do we not know that I think the Americans have the leverage for sure the US the us is the key player here I mean there have been some reports coming out that Netanyahu surrendered to pressure from the US to enable this truth to happen so the Americans they hold the the stick let me put it this way um uh so yes I think if their involvement is key the qataris and the Egyptians of course the mediators are very important here and uh and let's hope it it gets extended you know it's that's that's the thing the thing is to to stop and uh I mean because there are two two things that are going right now one is the release today and if and whether it will actually happen and then the other thing of course is whether that ceasefire is going to be extended and you know what I mean and there's also a missing element here also a third one which I would uh like to discuss further it's the lack of any political parallel political track you know to talk about the big issues because everything is is connected to each other so when we say the Israelis want to extend the truth at the same time they have this these conflicting goals of topling down hamas's rule Hamas will be nervous so it will try also to hold to its grounds so the discussion is missing the the elephant in the room which is what's next because the political track for the Palestinian Israeli conflict or the is is it has to be discussed now because for example I mean this war happens in a context of a Palestinian split the Palestinian Authority in ramala is very nervous they don't want to take over over Gaza in in during the split you know because Hamas is still there no one no one wants no one wants to see a Civil War in in Gaza for for instance so will Israel manage will is manage to topple down Hamas rule in Gaza or not so far there's so many big questions but what the International Community should focus on is why not to open a dialogue on these matters again which is the entire Palestinian split question and the the peace process again because these go in parallel with with the truths and and with also the option or the goal of toppling down Hamad or whether or not Hamas has a future in Gaza but there is no discuss I what you're saying but um are are both the the Israelis as well as the Palestinian sides ready to uh talk about these uh these these big issues right now I mean we heard from the Israeli Prime Minister just about 24 hours ago when he visited the Gaza Strip and he said we're ready to continue this war yeah but but we also we read uh Joe Biden's op piece in the Washington Post where he's he says he's committed to a two two St Solutions what does this mean in his opinion a two-state solution it means Palestinians has to have will need to have a United leadership and an independent state as well so how is he going to achieve this or what comes first really I don't think anything comes first in this situation there has to be a third track a paril track where these things should have should be discussed now and there are rumors that in some in some in some countries some Arab capitals and countries there are already discussions on these scenarios on the future of Hamas whether Hamas will accept a partner in the Gaza Strip or not but these are all critical issues I think if if if we have some clarity on them like let's say if Israel realizes that the the goal of topping down Hamas is not realistic which I don't think it's realistic then then this will might give an opportunity for the truth to be prolonged and then we we we expand the discussion on the bigger issues right so and and there the US and International Community has to push for this we don't wait we don't keep this war between prolonging a truce or ending a truce or or or restarting the war but we open a third parall track where we say let's discuss the big elephant in the room which is the Israeli Palestinian conflict the Palestinians and their future stat look one thing that is being discussed in the US is in fact and this is according to the Wall Street Journal American Media reporting that some members of Congress are now voicing support for putting conditions on Aid to Israel in order to limit civilian deaths in the war particularly the one Democratic senator Chris Murphy said that uh that he was open to this idea of placing conditions is this unprecedented it is it is of course it is and I see it as a very positive sign I mean it's a change in American in the internal American politics Biden is nervous as well I mean his popularity is is under questioning here you know because of what the Americans see the way the way this this brutal War has has been managed and the US's blind support to Israel I mean you see so it's I think this is a critical time even for the US Administration so it and it could be an opportunity for them as well if they're serious about pushing for the peace agenda the big big elephant in the room then they should immediately open a parall track on this big question and start a discussion with Hamas and fat and Israel as well I personally don't believe that topping down Hamas is an option unless Israel wants to reoccupy the entire G Gaza Strip and then he here we are talking about a big transfer scenario as well population transfer to Egypt I don't think it's realistic it's happening so the Israelis also are in a very narrow angle here so they have to meet in the middle and the Americans the US Administration has a big role in this game all right thank you so much tamed for the time being tamed there
