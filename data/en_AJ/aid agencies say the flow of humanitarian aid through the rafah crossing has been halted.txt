on the humanitarian situation in Gaza and in Rafa in particular let's now speak to Richard Brennan who's the Regional Emergency director for the Eastern Mediterranean at the World Health Organization wh he's joining us from Cairo thank you for joining us Mr Brennan uh Rafa as we heard there had been the only Crossing in Gaza not controlled by Israel through which much needed humanitarian aid went through and also from which were injured and sick people were transported out of the Gaza Strip what impact do you see the of this Crossing having on the people of Gaza well it makes a a disastrous catastrophic situation far worse um as you rightly indicate I mean we hadn't been getting enough Aid into uh Rafer into Gaza more generally o over the last few months uh I mean all assessments have been that Aid has fallen well short of of what's required and now our main Crossing Point has been closed off uh meaning that food Essential Medical Supplies water and sanitation equipment are now far less accessible to the people of Gaza but then as you rightly say um also the evacuation of critically ill patients uh We've struggled to get medical evacuations out consistently from Gaza uh today we're expecting to evacuate 140 patients uh but now that Lifeline is is closed off um to patients and of course it's not just the movement of um supplies and equipment in and patients out it's also the movement of uh humanitarian Personnel in that is now been paused yeah uh we we've heard that hospitals in Gaza uh in particular are in a a really difficult situation having to operate on a on a quota system for drug uh drug uh supplies and Drug uh distribution if this medical doesn't get in how long can these Health Care Facilities the remaining ones that are functioning how long can they go on for well we have done some contingency planning and we've prepositioned supplies uh we've actually had to move a lot of supplies from our warehouses in Rafer up to uh the middle area um so uh you know we can probably get by for another few days or a couple of weeks but what you said I think is is vitally important uh of the 36 hospitals across Gaza only 12 of them are functioning and there are partially functioning only three of those hospitals are in uh in Rafa serving that population of 1.4 1.5 million people that you mentioned so and they're only partially functioning now your your correspondent said NAA Hospital which is the largest of those hospitals has stopped functioning we I I had not heard that we had heard that it was still continuing to function but doctors and patients were starting to move on um that would be absolutely catastrophic if that were the case it's it's the main referral Hospital in Rafa right now it's usually only a 100 bed hospital I was there two months ago um it had over 300 patients at that time more recently it's had upwards of 600 to 700 patients so now because of this incursion uh access to that hospital um is extremely limited now for for patients for ill and injured uh and uh if it's if it's starting uh to um close uh close services that that makes things absolutely Ely disastrous for the people of RAF a pier we understand is being built uh to get humanitarian supplies into Rafa because as we've seen the border crossings the land Crossings uh are are closed off and this pier it said will be operational in the coming days do you see that having an an impact will will that help and who's going to be Distributing the aid once it comes through the pier how will it all work from what you understand yeah no it's they're very good questions I mean I think the general sense from the the humanitarian agencies is it will have a very very modest impact uh we won't be able to bring in supplies at scale um it's generally going to be used for for food Aid primarily for for bulky items uh we don't see it at this stage as being the best option for bringing in medical supplies the land routs are by far the most effective and efficient ways of of bringing Aid in and uh there are still a lot of unknowns as you've indicated there once the supplies have been brought in from the peer then how uh how are they're going to be stored and distributed we still don't have all those details so we continue to advocate for maintaining uh adequate access through the land Crossings they're absolutely vital thank you so much for talking to us Richard Brennan Regional Emergency director for the Eastern Mediterranean at wh joining us there from Cairo thank you very much for your time thank you very much thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
