more now on the war in Gaza a funeral has been held for two people killed during a raid by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank Let's cross now toita Ibraham who's joining us live from the jalone refugee camp north of rala in the occupied West Bank and can you just give us a sense of how people are feeling there as they're having to lay to rest even more of their own yes we've been seeing people here coming to the camp where prayers are being held now before taking the two bodies to the cemetery here at Al jalone there is a lot of fear amongst some of the residents we've been speaking to they say that the Israeli soldiers entered their homes ruined their stuff the kids were telling us specifically that they were uh scared it's not easy for children here to admit that they're scared of the Israeli soldiers there's a sense of defiance here amongst the community but nevertheless when you see large troops entering the refugee camp throwing tear gas bombs entering homes uh ruining the contents uh of these people's house you can imagine how that basically kills their sense of safety let's not forget that this is not something new for Palestinians living here at Al jalone refugee camp Israeli raids are very often and so there's a lot of frustration they believe that the world is leaving Israel with open hands to do whatever it wants and we've been seeing those Israeli rates increase in the occupied West Bank the part of the confrontations that has been going on here in the refugee camp where in this area over here we are going to try and show you some of them but basically U Israeli forces are armed they have tear gas they have live ammunition uh rubber coated steel bullets but when you talk about the Palestinians you're talking about people who are not armed and and are often just basically fighting back with rocks towards the Israeli forces to kind of prevent them from uh uh invading the camp it's there are so many narrow alleys and women were telling us that they were scared that uh that the Israeli forces have entered during those alleys and as well as that we've been seeing many Palestinians go to the hospital to check on those who were wounded as a result of those confrontations and n given all of this tension given the uh Israeli military escalating operations and intensifying the Crackdown is this threatening to spill over into I guess even more widespread violence indeed the West Bank has already been inflamed let's call it we've been seeing Israeli forces raid towns and cities for two years now killing Palestinians we've seen some armed groups uh operating uh committing attacks against is isi soldiers and Israeli settlers already but since October the 7th the tension has been much much higher we're talking about more than 1,000 Palestinians who have been detained by Israeli forces we're talking about more than a dozen on average of raids per day here in the West Bank we're talking about also the number of those who have been killed 95 Palestinians just since October the 7th so you can imagine uh how people are feeling here and also when we talk about Janine we've seen the use of aial strikes without any ground troops invading uh Janine those uh air Fighters sorry those air Jets and then bombing and strucking a two Palestinians inside the mosque so when we talk to Palestinians here they say this is a dangerous escalation they say they're worried they're scared that what's happening now in the besieged Gaza Strip is making its way here in the occupied West Bank
