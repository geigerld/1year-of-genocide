is is increasing well let's take you now straight to Tel Aviv where as you can see the US Secretary of State Anthony blinken is standing shaking hands right now with the Israeli defense minister yav Galant now blinken has been in Tel Aviv meeting with a number of Israeli leaders today we know he's just met with Galant but as you heard from our correspondents earlier he also had a meeting with Netanyahu ahead of his statement to the knesset now this is a return visit to Israel for Anthony blinkin he's been on a diplomatic tour of the region speaking to a number of leaders from different Arab countries trying to pursue some us diplomatic efforts in the region as we see this war in Gaza and Israel continue now Anthony blinkin we do expect um will address the media very shortly alongside um Mr Galant we have also been hearing much speculation especially in the Israeli media that shortly after after Secretary of State Lincoln's visit that we may well see US President Joe Biden also set foot in win for the people of Israel we will not stop the war for the Israelis in our side and and and their side we will reach every place and we will win in this war thank you Mr Min you know our deep commitment to Israel's right indeed its obligation to defend itself and to defend its people and in that you have and always have the support of the United States thank you thank you the well a very brief media call there as we saw the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin um alongside Israeli defense minister yoav Galant shaking hands another strong show of solidarity there from the US as the US Secretary of State continues his tour of the region he's rounding up today uh let's now bring in Hanan ashrawi she is a Palestinian leader and an activist and also a former member of the Palestine Liberation organization's executive committee she joins us now from rala Dr asrawi let me start by asking you a little bit about your reaction to what you've seen um from us diplomacy over the last week or so especially the rhetoric we've been getting out of the White House um we had one of our um correspondents and also our analyst earlier talking about how that's shifted what do you make of us rhetoric around this war well I think they started by swallowing hookline and sinker the Israeli version of reality which was entirely doctored which was entirely false they immediately accepted this uh version and they immediately started repeating mindlessly even all these stories about people beheaded and children being killed and women being raped and so on which climed not just the uh Public Image but also American policy in many ways now we know the US is the absolutely committed to Israel and is Israel's closest Ally in terms of Defending it and not just defending but partnering with it this time they went too far this time they H maintained the enabled Israel they pushed as well they sent in Two For Heaven's Sake two aircraft carriers and warships and so to do what and then not only that but the the mainstream media in the US picked up this uh approach and they ended up maligning the Palestinians giving Israel a free hand to continue with its War Of Destruction and they said Israel has the right to defend itself which became the refrain that every other Western Country repeated in the meantime the Palestinians were demonized dehumanized excluded Ed and everything that was done to us particularly in Gaza this brutal murder the killings the massacres and U clearly was was condoned and was aided and Abed by the us then I think the truth came out sorry you I I want to ask you about a comment that you made because you've described what's taking place in Gaza right now as being close to genocide I know the University where you a trustee you published a statement calling for international intervention in your mind what does that look like well I think when you have genocide that the party committing genocide has to be stopped first of all immediately and then has to be held to account instead of being encouraged and as as I said supported and aided and ab bettered genocide is taking place in front of everybody I mean this is no secret you are seeing the bonds coming down selling whole buildings four universities were totally destroyed the rest are in Gaza the rest are also damaged Beyond use uh whole buildings 60 families and more have been eradicated uh you I don't want to give you the numbers you know them 10,000 injured 3,000 killed 1,3 some children and there are 1200 still rubble and under the rubble you have 500 children that cannot be rescued so in many ways this is a situation that is an unfolding clear genocide with uh Gaza being uh totally closed off no water no food no medicine I'm sorry to interrupt you Dr asrai I want I want to get clarity from you on what you mean by International intervention what would you like to see as I said I would like to see intervention in terms of first of of course I'm not going to see armies coming and fighting Israel and putting enter it but at least holding Israel to account by saying this has to stop otherwise there is a price to be paid there are consequences to your actions when we talk about international law yes you have to abide by international law but Israel's impunity has become a pattern the demonization and dehumanization of Palestinians is the other side of the coin of Israel's impunity and elevated status as Beyond accountability so this has to happen and people have to tell them govern instead of jumping immediately the way the Europeans and the Americans did and justifying Israel's genocide and and giving support political ability and and so on they should say that is speaking of government I'm sorry Dr asrai because I do want to to cover a little bit about the Palestinian political Dynamics with you now as well I want to ask you about the statement that we saw today by abas because an earlier version of his comments included explicit mention of Hamas saying that hamas's policies and actions do not represent the Palestinian people but as we can see that's been removed what's the relationship like now between the PLO and Hamas well there has been a rift for some time since 2006 207 uh the West Bank and Gaza have been politically separate not just geographically separate hamash remains as you know Hamas is a political movement a party that has both a military and a political weight and they've been in a state of rivalry if not Conflict for a while even though Hamas did run for elections and did win uh the majority uh seats I wouldn't say votes uh in in 2006 but still the issue is uh that right now you cannot just abandon uh the Palestinian people by adopting the language that Hamas did this and therefore Hamas deserves it and therefore the people who are oppressing Palestinians are Hamas this is the latest by the way refrain from the Europeans and and Americans that this is what Hamas did to the Palestinians not this is what isra Israeli occupation and bombing and shelling and Siege and destruction did to the Palestinian people so I'm not going to uh try to to parse what Muhammed Abbas did he was under tremendous pressure at first he resisted the pressure from blinkin and Biden to condemn his own people and then he started it's a tital he's trying to say the right things not to offend others and at the same time he knows that his own people are smarting that the Palestinian people are traumatized they are in pain and they are not willing to see the Palestinian fighters of whatever faction being maligned or denounced by any Palestinian let alone any Arab Dr aswi I do want to ask you a little bit about about the prospects for the future too because amid all of the pain and the suffering and the anger and the Vengeance in the early days after the Hamas attack analysts were speculating that this potentially could restart and engagement around a peace process that the dynamic had shifted that this could be an opportunity do you agree are you hopeful is there any hope to be found here right now I don't well we don't want a peace process what we want is an end to this first a process alone has been ongoing for years and years and we became victims of a process in which Israel had a free hand to do whatever it wanted so let me say it's not hope that I see I see right now pain Devastation destruction mass killings genocide but at the same time I think that the the public let's say public is Shifting that people are beginning to see what Israel has done that all the lies that they fed the mainstream media and the the governments have not really uh been been swallowed by people of conscience by public opinion and we're seeing thousands and tens of thousands of people demonstrating protesting supporting Palestine so in a sense there is a gap between the Western governments and their own people and it's amazing we always used to say it's in the Arab world that you have a gap and that the leaders do not listen to their people now it's very clear that countries like the UK France Germany the US are not listening to their own people are not in tune with public opinion and don't understand that this cannot continue so the dynamic yes is Shifting and that's why now they're backtracking a bit they said they didn't see these burnt children or whatever beheaded people and so but they I mean they look ridiculous Frankly Speaking because this is a case of a dog of a tail wagging the dog very clearly whatever the US says to Israel Israel says we do whatever we want just continue supplying us with weapons and with money and with unlimited support and swallow our version and our narrative whole this is what's happening now Ln openly indeed we'll continue watching that that visit by Anthony blinkin very closely to the region Hannah asrawi there a Palestinian leader and activist as well as a former member of the Palestinian Liberation organizations executive committee thank you so much for joining us here on Al Z Dr aswi you're welcome my pleasure
