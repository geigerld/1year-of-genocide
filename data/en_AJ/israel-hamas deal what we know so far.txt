it's 1300 hours GMT that's 300 p.m in Gaza Qatar has confirmed Hamas and Israel have agreed on a temporary truce in the besieged territory this development comes after weeks of negotiations mediated by Qatar alongside the US and Egypt the Israeli government approved the deal after a lengthy cabinet meeting and despite divisions among ministers the polls is expected to start on Thursday morning but prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the agreement does not mean the war will stop and a statement released by The Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the social media platform X says the state of Qatar announces the success of its joint mediation efforts undertaken with Egypt and the United States between Israel and Hamas resulting in an agreement for a humanitarian pause the starting time of the pause will be announced within the next 24 hours and last for 4 days days subject to extension here's what we do know about the deal it involves the release of 50 Israeli women and child captives in exchange for a temporary 4-day Seas fire Israel is willing to pause hostilities for a further day for every 10 additional captives released by Hamas under the deal it's believed about 300 trucks of humanitarian Aid including fuel will be allowed into the strip during the 4 days Israel has agreed not to fly drones for 6 hours a day in the north Hamas was concerned Israeli air operations would be used to gather further intelligence during the temporary Seas fire also in the agreement we believe about 150 Palestinian women and children will be released from Israeli jails Israel has made it clear no one convicted of murder will actually be freed well during the temporary ceas Israeli media say Palestinians who fled to Southern Gaza will not be allowed to return to their homes in the North and the most depressing part of all Israel says it will resume its bombardment as soon as the temporary truce is over mersan Basin is a former Israeli negotiator who's now the Middle East director at International communities organization he warns some complications might arise from implementing the deal the deal isn't done until it's done and there are so many complications that could be involved particularly with regard to the ceasefire opportunities for either side to shoot at the other opportunities for Israel to collect intelligence information I mean just imagine what would happen if the Israelis suddenly discovered the location of yahir or other leaders from the Hamas command would they wait or would they go and take action if there are Palestinians from the north of Gaza who are relocated in the South now decide to use the next five days four or five days to try and go back to their homes and there are parades of hundreds of Palestinians walking by foot are the Israelis going to allow them how will they stop them um we we know that when Hamas will release the hostages they will probably use multiple convoys of identical Vehicles while Israel will try to trace the location of where these hostages might have been held there there are all kinds of difficulties and complications that could happen we have to keep our fingers crossed and pray that it all goes smoothly because if it does there could be a fifth day and a sixth day not all the women and all the children are being released and not all the women and children prisoners are being released so there's an opportunity to add on to the existing agreement without having to renegotiate something new which will be again more difficult well we have correspondents across the region covering the story Zan basravi is in Naas in the occupied West Bank Rory Chalin is in occupied East Jerusalem on the political divisions in Israel but first let's start with Hashim aabar he's here to discuss the Diplomatic side of things so Hashim there is a a big question of course we understand this truce is supposed to come into effect tomorrow that's at least what's being reported but according to what you understand from the K mediators was there a specific time fixed in this truce deal the that is the general consensus that it is going to happen tomorrow they do understand this is a crucial moment extremely the most delicate and this is this explains the cautious optimism that you can see in the statements made by senari officials when when you say this is what they this is you're talking about Kat officials this is what Kat officials understand right exactly and the and and the cous optimism about the first few hours of the deal are going to be the most decisive moment okay hang on hold that thought I'm going to come to you in a minute about the but since we've got you on the point of when this starts I think it's an important question on the minds of of a lot of people Palestinians waiting to see if they'll get some relief and also perhaps families of Israeli captives let's bring in Rory challeng as I said he's live for us and Rory what I want you to reflect on what Hashim said was that's the understanding of the K mediators is that the general understanding and the signals we're getting from Israeli officials is that this truce is going to start tomorrow is everyone on the same page here or not in other words Rory yeah they're pretty much on the same page that tomorrow is going to be the first day in which you will see a lull in the fighting as to exactly what time that's going to occur well the Israeli media has been reporting that they think it's going to be about 6:30 am local time that's slightly different from what Hamas uh have been saying which is they think it's going to be happening at about 10:00 a.m. local time so a difference of you know a few hours but still tomorrow morning tomorrow a.m is when pretty much everyone thinks that this is going to kick in in Earnest you have also of course the the timings for the first release of of captives and when that's going to happen there is a belief that that we might see a list being produced by Hamas of the first 10 or so captives given to the Israelis and that again tomorrow you might see the first uh captives making their way back to Israel okay that's a good point I'm going to come to Zan in a moment but Hashim I want you to pick up on the point you were just about to make about the first few hours are crucial what happens there now if you see the statements made by the Qatari officials qatar's prime minister and the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and also mammad who is the top negotiator in the Qatari team that has been negotiating this deal they're basically insisting on the need for this to move forward saying that the path forward is going to be extremely delicate for a simple reason as we speak now and this is according to a senior Hamas official the list of both the captives and the Palestinians prisoners have been exchanged so Hamas is looking into the final list as we speak now before saying let's go ahead and this is the same thing for the Israelis when they officially announced the seiz fire this is where it gets extremely extremely delicate you have the southern part of Gaza and this is where some of the most important movements is going to start to happen when it comes to members of Hamas taking the captives all the way towards a certain point to be handed over to I because I can see hash and we're getting into the process which I do want to get into in a minute but you touched on an important point there about looking through the lists agreeing on those names we got got to bring in Zayn cuz Zayn is standing by life for us in Naas and understand Zayn when Palestinian prisoners are released they're going to the West Bank right that's the understanding how crucial will it be that the those who are released are the are the people that the Palestinians are hoping will be released I mean Sammy what you're talking about is a numbers game that is not in favor of any of the Palestinians either on or off the list we've been speaking to members of uh family members of those that have been held from nablas eight of the names on the lists that have been making their way between the Israelis and the Palestinians eight of them are women from Nablus the total number of women being held in Israeli custody is around 89 only 33 names of women are on that list and even out of those 33 it has not been confirmed to any of the families by the Palestinian prisoner Society or any other official body whether they will definitely be released or not so here it's a waiting game we've spoken to people who are pessimistic they've been here before with other family members you can trace generational trauma in the occupied West Bank across the occupied territories in the sense that multiple generations of people have been imprisoned in Israeli jails they've been here before and they say they won't believe it until they see it we've spoke to others who say they're very very optimistic we were just in the home of a woman named t 29 years old her parents say that her uncle was in prison when she was born that's how she got her name taher meaning Freedom or to set free and she will if she gets out be meeting a niece who was born when she was in prison okay so it is a very intrinsic issue people being in prison in prison is a very intrinsic issue for Palestinians across a very sensitive issue obviously on the Palestinian Street Hashim back here in the studio take us through the process what the QI mediating team understand is the process what's supposed to happen who guarantees that everything goes by Clockwork the qataris the Egyptians and the Americans are going to be the main guarantors of this deal and this explains why for example Samy since yesterday we saw only one statement from the Qatari government we saw the spokesperson also talking praising the deer but staying very cautious because they do understand it is going to none of them are there on the ground right and you were just beginning to say talk about people being released from one point in Gaza um handed or moved further north I mean what is the mechanism for that they have they they have their teams operating for example in the rafah crossing it's going to be a crucial point in this agreement they will be liasing with the Egyptians who will play crucial role in the Handover of the captives and they are leing with the American at the same time so this is what is happening and this is why Samy briefly why it is an extreme one perhaps of the most delicate operations that we we we're going to see Hamas is insisting on no fly zone in the southern part of the country of of Gaza Strip for a reason they don't want to see Dr drones flying over detecting the the movement of their own people and they're insist on have they got that guarantee from the understanding that you of the officials that you've spoken to with the Kat mediators that there will be no AAL activity in Southern G I tell you what they say it's a fast moving fluid situation we'll only take it the moment it starts officially kicking in there is great deal of anxiety although there's optimism there is great deal of anxiety because of the complexity of this operation what is happening Sammy is this you will see the movement of the pris of the captives and the prisoners you have to ensure that the northern southern part is going to be no fly zone uh a data a 6-h hour dat time no fly window that starts from 10 a.m. to 400 p.m. according to Hamas senior officials just a while ago is a necessity for the movement of the people otherwise this is not going to work okay that window you're talking about is in the north of G in the hang on stay with me here Rory I want to bring you back in those sorts of details from your understanding from the signals we're getting from Israeli officials has that been agreed to no fly zones in the South 6h hour Windows of No Fly zones in the north and what about the legal process let's not forget all of this Clockwork uh mechanism that I'm chatting about with Hashim does that take into account the legal process that Israel is going through in order to clear names for release well I mean as Hashim was saying there a lot of this is being worked out kind of in a very short space of time and so legalities are the kinds of of things that aren't really being necessary at the moment you basically have two governments well at least you know these government and uh Hamas trying to work out what is acceptable uh for both parties what is acceptable for uh people as well now in terms of uh releasing of prisoners uh that has to go through a certain amount of vetting of course and the names that the Israelis have of Palestinian prisoners who are going to be part of this deal yes they need to be looked at and the Israelis have to uh be you know comfortable that these people are not serious serious offenders uh and by that you know the main criteria has be put on it is they cannot be murderers but there are people uh mainly women who are in that list who have been accused of attempted murder uh stabbings and the like and there are plenty of teenage boys who have been accused of throwing stones and rioting and and lesser crimes like that so essentially the main criteria for the Israelis on this is no murderers to be included in that list of course on the other side when it comes to legales of the captives that Hamas is going to be releasing well Israel has no control over that essentially Hamas will come up with a list every day of 10 of their captives women and children and they will give those to the Israelis and the Israelis would except effectively take those uh captives back as and when they're released by Hamas but they don't have any control over who exactly is going to be released at what time right so this is clearly a a very much a process that will be working day by day it sounds like right Hashim what about Aid what has been agreed do you know or do we know from you when you speak with the cuty mediators how many trucks will it include fuel I spoke a half an hour ago to an aid worker from the Palestinian red Cresent who said her understanding was fuel will not be allowed to go to hospitals what are you hearing it it has not been decided yet tuno he one a senior Hamas official just a while ago he said that they are expecting to see 200 to 300 trucks Crossing into to Gaza on a daily basis including trucks that are going to be a trucks carrying fuel that has to go everywhere including hospitals on that they're saying this Hamas fish telling you that's what they're expecting or that's what's been agreed this is what they are expecting it's not been finalized and this explains why Samy as we speak the reason why you're getting this sense of uh uh cautious optimism about this deal is that even when they agree tonight this is where we think the final agreement about the tiny details will be made tomorrow they will go to go to the ceasefire each pretty much concerned about what's next one final thought here Samy since yesterday it's the top leadership of Hamas which is coming publicly talking to the media about the details of this agreement why they don't want to be seen as gumblar it if fails massive destruction in the in the Gaza Strip huge loss of life you cannot come out to the people and say we have a deal and then come back to them two days later and say it totally collapsed they they do understand it's going to be an extremely delicate situation situation for just let's briefly go back to zann because zann you're in the West Bank when we talk about the needs of the Palestinians from your discussions with Palestinians talk us through what their needs are when it comes to food fuel I mean we're talking now about 2 to 300 trucks I think that's about half what the daily average was before October the 7th right that is correct people continue to tell us that the obvious absolute atrocities being carried out in Gaza their friends their families people here feel very connected to what's happening there they say that what they watching happening seems absolutely impossible to Fathom and out of control and the help that needs to be going in simply is not enough and will not be enough going forward anytime soon what has been cleared through the UN through the Israeli government to go in through the Rua Crossing whatever the delivery means it is an absolute trickle compared to the help they were receiving before the bombardment started and absolutely not enough compared to what they need to receive now when you speak to people here in the occup West Bank they say that their leaders haven't been doing enough they say that the International Community has failed them and they say that no matter what happens next even if their conditions improve as long as there is this Israeli Chokehold on the occupied territories as long as Israel is able to do whatever it wants in Palestinian communities be that in Gaza or in the occupied West Bank something common we've heard from several people is they describe a sense of incomplete happiness so even if they have their families back with this prisoner exchange even if they are able to move forward somehow their happiness will remain incomplete as long as these atrocities in Gaza continue to be carried out all right let's thank all of our correspondents Hashim aabar here in the studio we've got Zayn of course and Rory thank you so much for coming together and pooling all of your Collective knowledge and contacts and insight into this try and help us to understand exactly how things are supposed to unravel going forward thanks so much
