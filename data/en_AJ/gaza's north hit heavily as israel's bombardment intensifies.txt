returning now to the situation in Gaza and Israel's bombardment of the Palestinian territory has intensified in the past few minutes especially uh the bombardment of central Gaza let's bring in Tark abazo who's in canun is that's in the southern part of the Gaza Strip what what are you hearing about what's happening uh in the center of Gaza of Gaza tar yes uh the center of Gaza has witnessed a massive Israeli campaign of air strikes that targeted different SES Central the Gaza Strip considered to be the main vital uh area in the territory uh this area considered to be very densely populated even after the evacuation of thousands of people to the southern areas of Gaza Strip people there have uh running glow on uh different kinds of uh fuel uh medical supplies and even food and now they are witnessing massive uh Israeli air strikes just we uh we clearly see uh the videos released from the central Gaza Strip as the lightening up of every single corner of the Gaza Strip in the central areas in terms of the Israeli Relentless attacks as well uh the these attacks continued and every single hour day and night uh targeting civilians and even destroying uh residential houses and even civil infrastructures now the main concentration for the Israeli latest attacks concentrated on destroying backies attacking United Nations shelters and they are also trying to destroy and to wipe out every single shape of life in the uh Central areas and Northern areas of the territory as well in order to force citizens there to evacuate to the southern area so they can have a kind of flexibility in terms of the military acts in the in the inside the Gaza STP so the Israeli Relentless attacks also continued led to the cut off of communication Network and it's really affect on the ability of uh medical uh services and even the ambulan Services they don't know either where is the location of the attack and the the citizens are forced to bring victims by using uh their own uh their own uh ways of transportation just before uh the uh previous uh coverage I just so uh a man bringing one of the victims by using his own Carter bulled by a donkey to the uh to the hospital here Naser Hospital due to the absence of communication so ambulances cannot really get an access to the uh targ areas TK um very important that you mention there Communications because we've heard from the Palestinian telecom's agency which has said internet services uh have been cut across Gaza again is that happening throughout the territory or is it just in the areas that are under intense bombardment right now uh Central Gaza well we are away from from the Israeli bombardments from Central Gaza Strip we are in the southern areas and meanwhile we lost connections to uh communication networks and both companies that are running in Gaza Strip and even what about the areas that have been massively bombarded there is no any shape of communication there we Face such a great difficulty in ter in terms of communicating with our relatives our friends and our beloved ones in the central areas of the Gaza Strip in order to check how they are within the Israeli Relentless attacks that really uh cause catastrophic consequences and deterioration in their life aspects there so they cannot really uh contact us and we cannot really know uh the number of casualties the uh the locations of the attacks and even the Palestinian Ministry of Health are facing is facing such a a great difficulty in terms also of identifying the places of targeting in order to send ambulances to deliver and to take uh uh wounded and victims resulted from the Israeli attacks as well if you're just joining us on Al J it's just gone past 17 GMT that's uh 700 p.m. in the Gaza Strip and in the past half hour or so there've been intense Israeli air strikes over the Gaza Strip uh unusually intense Israeli air strikes uh especially on the central part of the Gaza Strip as our correspondent TK Abu AUM has been telling us uh we are unclear as to what specific areas in central Gaza is being are being targeted right now by uh Israeli forces uh but T worth perhaps reminding us what what is uh there right now in terms of our population because of course the Israelis had told Palestinians living in the northern Gaza Strip to head south why are they targeting these areas specifically specifically in the center of the Gaza Strip and what do we know about the concentration of the population there right now did a lot of people heed that call to move South or yes uh people there are facing uh such uh great danger and very uh deterioration in their Liv's aspect so uh they uh they are they are really re reluctant to evacuate because they are really desperate and afraid of being bombarded as what happened to different civil cars and ambulances vehicles that had been largely targeted throughout the evacuation from the Northern areas to the southern areas of the territory and meanwhile they don't have any plac shelter to go uh to reside in you are talking about the United Nations shelters have become overflooded with residents who were displaced from the houses we are talking about more than 600,000 Palestinians were evacuated from the houses and also the hospitals and the its vicinities are very overwhelmed with displaced people so it seems that even the relatives houses United Nation shelters and even hospitals become very crowded as even the population in the southern areas has been doubled due to the evacuation waves that had been carried out since the early beginning of this round of fighting so the people who are remaining till now in Gaza they don't have any option they are very limited in terms of the ability to move uh as Israel is expanding its military ground operations and both linking growths uh to between the North and the South of Gaza Strip and every one of them is afraid to lose his life and even if he was forced to leave his house under severe circumstances he is forced to walk for long distance in order to have access to the southern areas of Gaza it's been 30 days 30 days of Relentless Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip and in the last few minutes it has intensified even more especially in the central parts of Gaza and what we've seen TK in these last past 30 days is that no area in Gaza is safe hospitals have been targeted refugee camps we saw three refugee camps targeted today including the largest one in Gaza which has been hit several time by is Israeli forces that's uh completely true uh a lot of uh refugee camps have been targeted hospitals United Nations shelters uh we are talking about uh that every day more than 100 of Palestinians have been killed on a regular regular daily basis due to the Israeli relance attacks and we're talking about more than 2,000 Palestinian are still messing under the rles that the civil defense team are not able to evacuate them to due to the uh lack of equipment and sophisticated items that can help them to evacuate those people from under the rles and some areas in in the Gaza Strip ambulances cannot really have an access to so its citizens are forced to bring the victims uh uh by carrying them on their Carters bued by donkeys or by animals and sometimes they might bring them by using their own body and they are are holding them at the hands and to bring them in the hospitals on foot in order to receive treatment due to the Israeli Relentless attacks what is happening on the Gaza STP is beyond compare and unimaginable guys we are talking about every every single hour we have a new bombardment a new uh a new bad news we receive a new loss for our friends our colleagues and even our relatives in different areas of the territory the Gaza Strip is W is witnessing catastrophic consequences as the uh spokesperson of the World Health Organization and uh the clar that the Gaza strep is very is witnessing massive deterioration and must be a cease fire or an end to the round of fighting between Palestinian Fighters and the Israeli occupation forces okay T for the moment thank you very much let's bring in another of our correspondents on the line from Central Gaza now safwat Al kahut who's in d albalia safwat what has been happening in central Gaza in the last hour or so we've seen some heavy heavy Israeli air strikes over that part of the Gaza Strip yes from uh the central area of Gaza where we are now we we can hear heavy explosions taking place uh from in the southwest of Gaza City and extended up to the central area uh from what we understood that clashes severe clashes are taking place between the fighting Palestinian fighting groups and the Israeli troops who storm uh the G Gaza City from the three directions these explosions and these bombardments coincided with a complete cut out uh of internet and fular uh networks all over the Gaza Strip for the third time in less than 10 days so now um the people all over the Gaza STP are unable to communicate with each other especially following every every Israeli air strike as they have been using to uh to do uh to check their relatives and with their families who are deployed and displaced in different places all over G so uh saf what you say severe clashes between Israeli troops uh and Palestinian Fighters these would be uh the Israeli ground troops uh who've conducted this ground incursion it's been a week now since the ground incursion began but we're seeing at the same time uh a number of air strikes so it would be a ground operation supported for the Israelis at least by uh air power hello hello yes saat can you hear me can you hear me yes I can hear you yes yes now I can yes I was asking you about the clashes you say severe clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinian Fighters presumably this would be uh part of the ground operation the ground incursion that Israeli troops began uh a week ago now into Gaza uh do we know do you know what specific areas uh this ground incursion and these clashes are happening at look the Israeli tanks and troes entered the Gaza City and the Gaza Strip from three three different directions the first one is from the north of the Gaza Strip uh they have even crossed B hanon and B Laha The Villages of the north of the Gaza Strip now they uh or in the last three days let's say they have been stationing at uh the outskirt of Gaza City uh and at the outskirt of the shatti refugee camp which is adjacent to Gaza City and from the uh the the south east and the south west of Gaza City from uh four Direction three directions uh in the last three days the Israeli troops and tanks have not achieved any more advanc advancement uh since since the last time they entered Gaza they cut the road the main road called Salah that links Gaza City with uh with its North with the rest of the Gaza Strip and now they there are a few tens of meters from the other uh Coastal road which is the other option for the people to leave Gaza and they open the fire even for anyone who try to cross from Gaza uh to the southern area of the Gaza so still the clashes are still taking place at the same three uh points or location that the Israeli tanks and the Israeli troops have been stationing for almost three days uh the Israelis as from what uh we understood uh they tried several times to uh to achieve or to push the tanks forward towards the town but they have been confronted by severe clashes with the fighting groups we have been receiving videos released by the fighting groups showing uh showing them exchanging the fire directly face to face with the tanks uh at the same time uh some of the tanks have been moving from the Eastern side of Gaza City towards the western side which is the the coastal road to isolate completely the Gaza City from the southern area or from the central area of the Gaza Strip until now the same the same point for almost three days yeah so clashes you say at three different locations particularly in central Gaza and the objective of the Israeli military is to cut the territory in half of course isolate the north from the south you talked about uh Hamas and the Palestinian Fighters uh pushing back and and the fact that you say Israelis haven't been able to make that much of an advance how are the Palestinian Fighters able to hold out able to push back these Israeli forces the Palestinian fighting groups have been preparing themselves for the for the Israeli Invasion from the beginning and that's why they have dig a network of tunnels underground and from the the pictures or the videos that the fighting group they have been releasing and sending to Media Outlet uh showing the fighting groups coming up uh coming up from tunnels that they built uh to uh in in specific places that they have been expecting so they come up from these tunnels and fire their projectiles or the exchange the fire directly with the with the tanks that's why we the these tanks have or the troops have been re uh reing in different places and locations uh still all these places and the areas that the Israeli uh tanks and troops have been entering and trying to pushing to push forward they confront they are confronted by the fighting fighting groups who seem to be well prepared for this movement and uh we expecting these Israeli movements including tanks uh troops so the Israeli uh Army the Israeli figh targets they uh they adopted a new tactic which is the scotched land uh every time they they want to push forward the the tanks that's why lots of air sites lots of uh buildings have Destro to pave the way to the tanks to push forward but still again the fighting groups are still able to come up from the tunnels that they built and uh carry out direct exchange of fire with the tanks who are inside the Gaza step so massive Israeli air strikes saward as you say and as we've seen on our screens over Central Gaza uh in the last hour so this as Israeli ground troops try to make an advance as you say but that's been uh held back pushed back by the Palestinian fighters on the ground there as all of this has been happening we heard and and saw earlier today Israeli forces are telling residents of Northern Gaza uh to to head to the South for safety but as we've seen in the past three weeks there have been so many incidents of of civilians being killed as they fled is there anyone who has attempted to move South and and how you know you Central Gaza right now safwat how populated is Central Gaza today still as this massive Israeli bombardment happens on that specific area of the territory right now many people they tried uh or they have been trying to leave the Gaza Gaza City towards the South despite that the south is not safe anymore or or there is lack of all the humanitarian needs but still people because of the H bombardment in the Gaza City and in the North they tried to flee or scave through the coastal line but the the Israeli tanks who are close to this coastal line they open the fire at many people there and we saw the pictures of the people of the Buddies big buddies uh and deployed in the coastal line we know about even same number of people who are at Salah street but none of the ambulances is able to go and and bring uh the bodies or carry the bodies of the deck people yesterday the said they give or they said that people can leave um they give three hours for the people to leave from Gaza City towards the South but when people tried to cross Salah the point that the Israelis said people can leave through they opened the fire at the people there so people went back today the same some people we we know about some people who tried to go and they were they were uh they couldn't take any anything with them except their uh ID and they had to carry their ID in their uh in their hand and this remotely the Israelis were uh watching and waiting for those who are allowed to cross and so on but still this is very limited number of people because there was fear that they could be targeted or they could be shot by the Israeli uh the Israeli troops who who hold a checkpoint at Salah certain point at salahadin Street to control everything and every movement okay safat thank you very much for that update safat Al calut on the line there from d albalia in central Gaza where there's been intense Israeli bombardment over the last hour several air strikes huge explosions over Gaza City and Central Gaza as safat was telling us there this is uh happening as a ground incursion of Israeli troops is also happening in that same area and the Israelis seem to be uh using air power to support their operation as we've seen telecommunications the internet has been cut off according to the uh Palestinian telecommunications agency the internet across that whole area of Gaza has been disconnected and and people haven't been able to reach out to family members who live in that area of Gaza
