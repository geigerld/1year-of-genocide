close to the alifa hospital and the Palestinian Health Ministry is warning that the hospital is just hours away from running out of fuel completely well to talk more about the situation there is Dr Ahmad malati he's a surgeon at ala Hospital good to have you with us sir um how long is it until you run out of fuel completely thanks we're already running out of fuel you know what's like last night everything was in dark we had nothing open except for the Emergency Department the icus and the theat but the main generator is not working I don't know what the people are do they know they keep asking the same question is it going to run out it's it's run out it's more than a month now that we have been under this full blockage with nothing coming in Gaza and there is no even nothing in just showing that it will come so the situation is that we run out of the main supply of fuel what we run they will call us they said they have theater because I'm in Bur unit it's an isolated unit the moment I finish operating on the bur patients they just know that around midnight or something that they just stop the electricity on the building and they keep it only for the ICU beds so it's very critical the situation we reach it's something that is going to happen at one point imagine I think around 70 ICU patients on ventilators the UBS we have won't run more than two or three hours and then all the ventilators will just run out and then at one point you will find all these people with you know no ventilator so it's like killing you know all these patients the neonatal ICU the patients on critical care the theaters will run off we had a moment where we have to use our mobile phones to operate in other hospitals it happened that even the mobile phones were the main source of of of light for the operation so it's very critical situation we are running out of fuel there is no Supply coming if not this hour the next hour if not today will be early morning so it's happening now it's not something we are just warning well have been warning for days and weeks that this is going to happen and we are very near to this moment where we will say okay we run out of these things everyone will be killed here in this ICU in the hospital so I just judging that at least 100 people will be killed because of the run out of fuel so it's about 100 people you say are going to be killed as a result of running out of fuel how many people are there at the hospital between both patients and those trying to seek some sort of Refuge there so it's not less than 50,000 people in in a shifa hospital around 2,500 will be the patients and then the others are people coming seeking the you know the the safe place or assuming the safe place here so we are talking about at least 50,000 people here in shifa hospital and around 200,000 in the whole hospitals of Gaza where they are relying on this electricity it's very critical again you know the water we have been drinking for the last two weeks I say it's unhealthy I don't know the taste of it how does it look like we don't know if it's healthy unhealthy where it does it come from but we we never got any proper fresh you know uh water drinking water for the last two weeks yesterday we couldn't get any food from the hospital sometimes they give us some meals uh for dinner they told us today we're not getting any meals in the hospital we went outside there is no bread in the hospital the main bakery near the hospital was bombed with the solar power and their main tank has been bombed so it's very critical there is no food easily available we rely on the cans the water supply is very minimal because it's realizing that let me ask you what happens forgive me for interrupting you but when fuel is absolutely critical to this that that much is is clear when that fuel Runs Out do you have any options available to you and the staff about what to do with the patients who are going to be most affected by the fuel running out so we have been already doing this is I think the government has told all the petrol stations not to give to sell any of the petrol so if you go in Gaza I won't find any Petrol in the stations because they kept it for the hospitals and so this was the plan and then again for the last I think two weeks we have been on this smaller generator but at one point even these small generators they were run out of fuel and then we will go back to the manual things what we called ambo bag instead of ventilator but again the monitors are related to this the investigations we do the lab all the machines in the laboratory the blood bank thing uh everything is Rel to electricity you can't just get the people a 100 Year back and just in one thck that so you will lose everything it's not like we have a solution for this it's a very complex thing when I have the electricity not running here you can't write down even the no in a proper way the ventilator machines and then you have the oxygen supply which is related to you know there's oxygen pump in the hospital station which needs electricity to be run off so the oxygen won't reach there and then you have the vacuum machine which is very important and critical for the patient to do suction for anything you know in their respiratory tract or just any plugs happen so that's needs oxy electricity as well so it's not there is a magic solution to solve all these issues together the laboratory will just fill up Dr Ahmed MTI we appreciate it we appreciate of course that you and your teams are very very busy but we're grateful to you for talking to us at this time thank you very much indeed
