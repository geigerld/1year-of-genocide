now Israel's Military Intelligence Chief has stood down after saying that he takes full responsibility for the laps in Security on October the 7th let's get more on this breaking news story with Bernard Smith he's an occupied East Jerusalem so militarily the heads have started to role so yes Aron haliva is the head of military intelligence Decades of experience and was in charge on October 7th when Hamas launched that assault into Israel uh the most devastating assault that Israel has uh has happened in Israel since the country's foundation in 1948 now we now know that since then the reason that was allowed to happen was largely because of a spectacular failure of military intelligence we now know that for up to a year before the Hamas attack on October the 7th the Israeli intelligence had had hands on a document that pretty much detailed how October the 7th would pan out we know that spotters Israeli military spotters in the towers around Gaza have been reporting for months that they'd seen activity in Gaza that looked like uh Hamas and other fighting groups were rehearsing preparing for some sort of attack on Israel all of that was ignored it was all ignored because there was a belief We Now understand right at the top of military intelligence and conveyed and held by the Israeli government that Hamas did not want or was not in the market for looking to attack Israel it was more interested in governing Gaza well we now know that that was not the case and Aon haliva is the first well he accepted responsibility I think about a week or so after October the 7th but has stayed in post during the war in Gaza he's going to stay in post now in fact until a replacement has been found but he is the most senior leader to resign he's called in his resignation for a national Commission of inquiry to be established into what led up to October 7th to highlight and expose the failures the government has yet to do that the government says it wants to concentrate on the war in Gaza but many accuse prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu are deliberately prolonging that war because he also does not want to face up to any responsibility he might have for October the seven I'm sure we'll be hearing a lot more of this in the coming hours for the moment Bernard thank you Major General Aaron haliva is the first senior Israeli figure to quit following the hammer attack well let's bring inar sh he been following events with us here from the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies interesting departure at the top of the Israeli military brass quite interesting yeah it's uh somebody had to take the fall for sth of October I think it's quite high level in terms of the the top of the military intelligence uh although the the the issue was was more of the intelligence cycle because they had the information they had the they saw the preparations the these preparations were reported by Junior um intelligence analysts uh but it was not uh it did not reach the top Ross because it it was thought that it's not significant enough and what they're seeing maybe Hamas is willing to do something like that but it's incapable of doing so so it was an underestimation of the capabilities of the Kasam battalions in terms of the sort of prism in which we view Israel and how it likes to be viewed by the International Community it's under quite some pressure really now we're hearing of this military uh uh General uh being removed or or resigning but also a battalion also being sanctioned by the us there is pressure and a little bit more pressure yeah absolutely but the the that Battalion particularly the 97 Battalion of the kar Brigade of the 900s Brigade uh it's a sort of a Battalion in a semi- Rog Brigade uh it's not the first time um it was accused of U beating uh a Palestinian American citizen who after that died after a heart attack which uh made uh which this was in January 2022 so the US was sustaining pressures since then and demanded that uh uh some sanctions get applied to this uh or discipline get applied to this uh Battalion particularly and the Israeli response was uh was that we're going to deploy this Battalion this infantry battalion uh from the West Bank uh to the Golden Heights so put them under the northern command um it was done on paper but we're not sure if that actually happened they stayed in the West Bank and after the 7th of October they were deployed uh in Gaza and uh apparently there there are some quite a few violations that were recorded there as well so that increased the pressure uh to do something something about about this Battalion in terms of the overall viewing of the Israeli military at the moment whether it be the West Bank or Gaza do you think the spotlight is more on them now not just by the United States but by by the EU for example I mean if America's going to put some sanctions on this particular Battalion normally the EU follows suits as well oh absolutely after all this this level of Destruction uh this levels of multiple allegations against Crime for for crimes against humanity um that level of force concentration Firepower concentration in areas that are U civilian areas widely populated with uh with women children elderly uh after all this so you'll probably have some significant political pressures on on the Israeli government uh but historically the Israeli government has been quite defined in resisting such pressures and uh acting according to their plans which does not include the uh human rights uh reservation of the Palestinians for sure we should see what happens in the coming for the moment Omar thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaaz
