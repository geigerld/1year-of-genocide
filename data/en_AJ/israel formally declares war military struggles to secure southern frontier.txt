we have a team of correspondents covering all angles of this story TK Abu AUM is live for us inside Gaza Muhammad Jam Jun is in West Jerusalem Charles statford joins us from Tel Aviv and Imran Khan is in rala in the occupied West Bank I want to start with you TK who is live in Gaza what's the situation where you are it's heading into the evening in Gaza how are residents preparing for another night of strikes uh well uh right now the uh Israeli drones are covering all the sky of the Gaza Strip looking for the next Target as gazans are waiting for the new Israeli attacks over their houses and their infrastructure from time to time the Israeli Naval forces are destroying main Coastal roads in order to crack down any possible infiltration attempt to the Israeli adjacent Coastal uh towns um terms of the Israeli uh let's say crimes against Palestinians the uh victims of Palestinians today are increasing and one of the most prominent victims that were uh killed today by the Israeli air strikes is abua Family inuz inuz Village Eastern of kanun governate Simply the uh family has been wiped out from the Civil registry uh more than 22 members were killed oh my gosh uh sound of explosion right now explain just what's happening where you are cuz that certainly sounded very close to you uh now uh we have heard a sound of explosion inside uh the Gaza Strip uh actually this explosion uh was uh widely overhead in the uh on the in the Gaza Strip uh till now uh we cannot really uh locate the place and the location of the uh of the uh explosion or the bombardment simply because it's absolutely dark and uh we cannot clearly see here in a very good way but you can generally hear uh throughout the background that the Israel restarted again launching air strikes against Palestinians inside the Gaza Strip it's important to mention that Abu Daka family has wiped out from the Civil registry more than 22 members were uh killed by the Israeli occupation uh Air Forces uh seven of them were children and till this current moment civil uh teams are trying to evacuate six members who are still stuck under the reels of the destroyed house uh simply it becomes so obvious through the uh Israeli policy of targeting that Israel does not knock the door it directly hits civilians uh amed's uh International uh neg negligence about what's happening in uh the Gaza Strip and Amed uh no clear mediation to stop the conflict conflict erupted between uh the Hamas movement and the Israeli occupation Army yeah t the Israeli Prime Minister has been warning people near the Gaza Strip to evacuate but that's certainly not a possibility for many Palestinians is it uh Main in fact B Palestinians uh have already evacuated the houses especially Palestinians who are living close to the borders in eastern areas uh they received different notice and messages on their C from the Israeli occupation forces informing them to evacuate their house before being targeted and act oh my gosh another explosion in the same place it seems uh it was little bit over here um if you need to take let us know it's okay it's okay it's a bit far away but it's over here at night uh it's important to mention that uh Palestinians now are displaced from their original houses now into the owner schools inside the Gaza Strip which turned into safe shelters uh for them meanwhile uh a school today has been hit by the Israeli air strikes without making clear uh let's say uh differentiation between uh civil and militans uh generally so uh the Gaza Strip situation is detroying and there is an explosion as you can clearly see on the back ground L it's going to be a little bit heavy right now it's absolutely high you're going to right now overhear it I think this building has been leveled to the ground uh throughout an air strike that had been carried out by the Israeli Air Forces this is the night inside the Gaza Strip everything turned upside down the lives generally derating due to the wide range of attacks carried out by the occupation forces oh my gosh okay T we're going to leave it there and we'll cross back to you throughout the evening it certainly sounds like it is a dynamic situation we're seeing live pictures from G and given it is the night time it's difficult to see but we are seeing the sky being lit up by air strike so thank you so much for that comprehensive coverage that was TK Abu AUM in [Applause] Gaza and yumna Al visited an area where civilians have been seeking shelter in Gaza currently here at one of the unwa schools where more than 2,000 people have taken this school as shelter the people that are in this school have moved from their homes that were uh across the or adjacent to the Israeli gazam borders now they have all moved here some of them moved uh late last night while others came here this morning also some of the families that we have met have had their homes destroyed and that's why they had to come here to the honor schools for shelter H had told us that it has prepared 44 schools in total 44 schools and shelters all together across the Gaza Strip for the displaced families they have also said that over 22,000 people have been displaced and are now taking shelter in their schools these Palestinians families have experienced the beinging of their homes and the displacement many times before some families here say that this is not the first or the second or even the third time those people who have their homes adjacent to the border every single time there is any kind of escalation they are forced to flee their homes because there are they are afraid of artillery fire they're afraid of the uh air strikes that uh bombard their homes as the uh first bombardments take place we're bringing you these pictures from one of the 44 un schools available for the Palestinian displaced families across the Gaza [Music] Strip muhamad Jam jum is standing by for us in West Jerusalem hello there Mo the cabinet as we were reporting on at the start of the show has approved the declaration of war talk us through what that means yeah that's right Emily and yeah let's just try to take this step by step right now to explain to our viewers where we are when it comes to this declaration of war of course we heard yesterday from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that basically he said the country is is at War then you had the cabinet meeting the cabinet approved the declaration of war that means that the Prime Minister and the defense minister can essentially make decisions going forward without having to consult the cabinet when it comes to every specific action what happens next is that this goes to a specific committee within the country's Parliament the knesset uh that committee will vote on the declaration of war they will well it is expected they will approve the declaration of war and then after that at some point POS possibly later in the day tomorrow uh we're told that the Prime Minister will go in front of the knesset in front of Parliament and will then declare that the country is officially at war that essentially formalizes it Le formalizes it legalizes the war declaration going forward now um there's a lot of concern as to what this means going forward uh you have a lot of people here that are concerned about what exactly is happening uh with Israel's border with Lebanon and how much tension there is the many people here expect that after this declaration of war um is formalized in the knesset that at some point there will be a ground Invasion into Gaza so that's another concern right now uh you also have a lot of people speculating about the possible political ramifications for the Prime Minister um the fact that something that's considered to be such a huge intelligence failure occurred on his watch that's something that people think that he's going to have to reconcile with at some point now at the moment you are seeing signs amongst the political classes here that people are going to be essentially rallying around the flag uniting you have members of the opposition who have offered to join a Unity government with the Prime Minister you have the Prime Minister who has also said that he's willing to uh to look into these overtures uh moving forward so a lot of moving Parts we're expecting to hear a lot more details in the hours and the days to come Emily Muhammad you've been speaking to a number of people on the ground what have they been saying so Emily throughout the day I've been speaking to people in occupied East Jerusalem and in West Jerusalem and they are still very much in a State of Shock as to what happened people throughout the day telling me that they never thought they would have seen something like this take place uh in a country where the security services are considered to be so vaunted they have such a rep reputation for thoroughness uh many of them have asked How Could An intelligence failure like this have happened at a time like this uh they are just still very much processing what happened uh they are saying many of them have told me that they believe that what happened was far worse than what happened during uh the Omer war in 1973 uh and they're very worried about what exactly is going to be happening next Emily Muhammad thanks so much for the update Muhammad Jam Jun there Let's cross to Charles traford now who's in Tel Aviv for us Charles what's the situation from a military perspective we're hearing there was a substantial there is the chance of a substantial ground invasion of Gaza well yes that's uh what all intimations certainly from the Israeli military are suggesting we know in the South South certainly of of Tel Aviv um our correspondent throughout the day has reported seeing tanks and heavy artillery moving towards uh the Gaza Strip we uh also know that there could be tens if not more than that hundreds of thousands of Israeli soldiers that are certainly either being put on standby that are or moving in that direction we know what a complicated operation it could be also let's not forget um you know the amount of Israeli soldiers that were lost during the 2014 uh invasion of Gaza but all by all intents and purposes it seems as if some sort of ground offensive could well take place indeed a sea offensive as well an offensive from the sea and we just heard those incredible air strikes those thuds those attacks that are ongoing in Gaza as well so you can only imagine the sheer Terror of the more than two million gazans that are often described as living in the largest prison in the world meanwhile the situation here in Tel Aviv has been quiet for the majority of the day um but there is a very strange atmosphere here the streets are virtually empty businesses are closed um and Israelis and Palestinians living here are are are very concerned about any kind of escalation we visited um one of the sites where one of the 150 um Palestinian launched missiles landed in the center of the city uh last night that hit a business completely destroyed it people very distraught one woman saying that she was utterly horrified by what was going on and the level of suffering being experienced by both sides in her words she said but at least I have somewhere to hide so um there is a great sense of sort of trepidation here as indeed all indications suggest that there is going to be some very sizable Israeli military response in Gaza and as you mentioned we're already hearing and seeing that uh this evening Charles the death toll has risen considerably today Sunday to more than 650 Israelis including the deaths of dozens of people at that dance party in southern Israel essentially right near the Gaza Strip how is that attack being received that that such a surprise attack could happen as I say people are in an utter sense of a sense of shock they want answers they want to know how such an attack could have happened and as we heard Muhammad alluding to there you know they want answers from the intelligence service they want answers from the military um there is increasing video evidence of huge great gaps in the security how could Hamas Fighters um penetrate that fence seemingly broad daylight with uh with such ease military analysts here in in in Israel will say that um the military had left their guard down in that area it was obviously the Yum kipo holiday they also points to the fact that a lot of Israeli military resources from Gaza have in recent months been redirected to the occupied West Bank um and and that could have have have caused what has has turned out to be such an unprecedented and massive attack but yeah the pictures coming out of Southern Israel are absolutely shocking and and having a huge effect on the morale of Israelis and the Palestinian Israelis that live in in in this city the South you know seeing what was reported to be 200 bodies at that party um near the G strip uh having having been found we've seen pictures today of firefights gunfights happening um on on the roads as we understand um Hamas Fighters that have um taken control of houses in some of these settlements reports of them taking hostages family hostages inside some of those houses we've seen long lines of burnt out vehicles that have been attacked I mean Israelis of of this generation of the Young Generation and older Generations have never seen anything like this happen so uh yeah it is a a great sense of shock and a great sense of trepidation as we go into another night it would not be inconceivable certainly with respect to Tel Aviv if there was not um another uh missile strike from Gaza as I say 150 or so missiles were fired towards uh towards Tel Aviv last night so it's going to be very interesting but there are a lot of very afraid people right the way across this country and the occupied territories um as uh as day turns toight on the second day of this war Charles thanks so much for the update Charles straford live for us in Tel Aviv and as he was saying that we can actually see some of those air strikes happening as we speak as we go to air in Gaza it's difficult to see I we thought we were going to go to those live pictures but we'll now cross to Imran Imran Khan is in rala for us uh Imran have we heard from the Palestinian Authority at all today which is Sunday there's been several negotiations that have been going on uh between the International Community and the Palestinian Authority for uh on the Palestinian Authority's part what they want to do and they're negotiating with Egypt right now is for Egypt to open uh the Raffa border crossing which is in their territory into Gaza so they can get in humanitarian aid for those that need it the most also they're uh very clear though when they're talking to the International Community saying that this is a result of the occupation and uh a result of the fact that the International Community simply hasn't put enough pressure on Israel to lift at the siege of Gaza to uh stop uh the occupation of the here in the occupied West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem uh in fact but here uh where I am I'm love right now but generally across the occupied West Bank uh it's been a show of support uh for hamus a general strike was called that was the first thing and legal offices were shut government offices were shut schools uh have been shut shops have been shut anything that might make a society function and simply closed down I'm just going to get out the way and show you this is the quietest I've actually seen ramala in a very long time now sporadically throughout the day there have been uh protests uh showing support for Hamas uh within Manara Square which you can just see down there you speak to people here and what they tell you is very simple if you treat people like animals you shouldn't be surprised if they fight back now this fight back has taken uh the people in the occupied West Bank by surprise they didn't think they would see anything like this in their lifetimes but they are coming out and showing support for Hamas and it just goes to show you uh that that feeling is actually something that's been seen not just here Ina but across the occupied West Bank now what the Israelis have done within the occupied West Bank is they've actually shut roads down so for example you can't get from Bethlehem to rala you can't get from Janine to Naas you can't go from Village to Village the Israelis have effectively turned it into an archipelago of separation and that's a deli move on their part we traveled into R yesterday we were stopped at the ofair checkpoint uh whilst they tried to figure out whether I was actually going to be allowed uh in to ramala so that's what's going on right now but like I say Emily the day of strike and the show of support uh for Hamas all right we appreciate the update as always Imran Khan in rala for us
