from the moment the aid trucks appeared the tank and drone began to fire at the people gathered the people who went to get food for themselves and their children they started shooting at them there were many dead and injured I went to get a sack of flour for my parents we are very hungry we don't have food or anything they fired shells at us they attacked us they shot at us there is no food there is nothing we want flower to eat they shot the little ones they humiliated us and in Gaza City at least five Palestinians have been killed in an air strike in the aun neighborhood repeated attacks have caused widespread destruction across the area Al jaz's isul reports I'm standing in the middle of alun neighborhood it was one of the most densely populated areas in Gaza City it was invaded by the Israeli forces on two occasions during this war before the land offensive the area was carpet bombed for days killing and injuring hundreds today dozens of dead bodies remain buried under these ruins and dozens more are still lying on roads there's massive destruction large scale Devastation as the pictures show houses leveled buildings burnt down and infrastructure destroyed destruction on a massive scale Beyond any description our homes were destroyed this is all that is left of my property this the last time I called my family was 5 days ago they told me the situation was dangerous I asked them to leave they told me snipers and drones were all around and they couldn't leave I do not know where they are killed or buried underneath debris I appeel to the Red Cross the whole world to help us remove this Rubble to find where our families are Columns of smoke are still seen rising from buildings which were set on fire by the Israeli forces they've destroyed every aspect of life in the Gaza Strip even depriving people of the possibility of returning to their homes my family and I were at the home and all of a sudden we were showered with missiles and shelling it went dark and we were deafened we kept calling out to one another our neighbors too started shouting three of their sons were killed and one of them had his head blown off his body these are some of the dead bodies recently recovered from under the ruins in the neighborhood most of them are women and children killed inside their homes as the Israeli missiles and shells fell on their heads residents and civilian defense teams hand in hand are hoping to find any survivors under this multistory building we are doing our best to recover dead bodies and hoping we can find any survivors we found some trapped underneath Rubble they'd been there for 10 days without food or water by the grace of God they're still alive there's large scale Devastation carpet bombing followed by a land Invasion there has been the intentional destruction of homes infrastructure and every aspect of life in the Gaza [Music] Strip the US has announced it plans to begin airdropping humanitarian Aid into Gaza president Biden also says he will insist that Israel allows more Aid trucks into the strip Mike Hanah reports from the White House at his meeting with the Italian Prime Minister President Biden announced that the US was going to begin Aid drops into Gaza this in conjunction with the Jordanian Air Force these are likely to be M meals ready to eat of the Halal variety uh he also said as well that he is insisting that Israel facilitate more roots and facilitate more trucks this is what he had to say in addition to expanding deliveries by land as I said we're going to we're going to insist that Israel facilitate more trucks and more routes to get more and more people the the help they need no excuses because the truth is Aid flowing to Gaza is nowhere nearly enough now it's nowhere nearly enough innocent lives are on the line and children's lives are on the line and we won't stand by and let until they until we get more Aid in there we should be getting hundreds of trucks in not just several for the first time President Biden also raised the possibility of opening up a marine Corridor to get Aid into Gaza on the question of the ceasefire well he's continued to walk that one back he said a few days ago that he expects a ceasefire to be in place on Monday next week this would allow the release of captives in Gaza and the release of of Palestinian prisoners however he said in the past 24 hours that might have been a bit too optimistic uh that time frame now appearing to expand but he says the US is continuing to work towards such a ceasefire also working towards one that is more longstanding a matter of weeks rather than days and then another element introduced creating a dynamic which would allow for more lasting negotiations about a long-term agreement bye Cana I'll just here Washington Dave Harden is the managing director of The Georgetown strategy group a Washington DC based consulting firm he previously served as USA Mission director to the West Bank and Gaza he joins us live from Washington DC Dave un officials have warned that at least one quarter of the population in Gaza that's around 576,000 people that they're one step away from famine unless urgent action is taken so how effective are airdrops as a means to get much needed Aid to a popul population that is suffering through this humanitarian catastrophe I think Aid drops are an inefficient inexpensive and not particularly effective way of meeting that overwhelming need that you just described I mean each airdrop is going to have about two truckloads worth of of goods of assistance and I guess it's going to be a high altitude air drop so that the US Air Force and the crew aren't in harms well and so they're going to drop you know some cargo from 30,000 ft or something like that into into Gaza and really what needs to happen is just more Crossings and more trucks need to come through every single day Dave President Biden said that the US would insist that Israel facilitate more trucks and routs to get more people the help that they need he also said the aid that's flowing into Gaza is nowhere near enough but the US continues to press is Israel to allow more Aid in they've done this for a while now and at the same time Israel continues to get weapons from the US so as long as that continues does Israel actually feel it has to comply with us requests to allow in more Aid I think the United States looks weak uh and it's it's frankly very disappointing to me I feel like the aid drops are symbolic um and designed in a way to appease maybe the domestic base um the United States has the leverage to have the Israelis open open up Aras and former Crossings like uh Carney and Nal and sufa expand K Shalom and expand uh Rafa and the saladine gate which is what Hamas used to use with Israeli uh permission years ago so the fact of the matter is the United States has the ability to to compel Israel to open up more Aid uh into this very small Enclave um and by not compelling the Israelis to do this we are putting our assets and our people at risk and by the way we're we're also potentially creating more harm and more chaos in Gaza assuming that these are high altitude air drops Okay so we've talked about the fact that the US is saying they're going to start airdropping Aid into Gaza Biden also has said for the first time that the US was also looking at the possibility of a marine corridor to deliver large amounts of Aid into Gaza how feasible is that and how much help might that provide in the long run I mean again really the the answer has got to be opening up the existing or The shuttered Crossings the along the Israeli Gaza border I mean the Israelis control that space and they can open it up a marine channel in is better than an airdrop but there's still an enormous amount of force protection that would have to be behind um that ship and that protection and then you would have to control the beach head to make sure that it's not chaotic and that there's not violence um and stampedes and Desperation for people and so simply getting more food in from multiple channels is the answer to deconflict this all these other ideas Marine you know Marine Landing or high altitude air drops this is not in any way getting to the CR of the matter all right Dave Harden managing director of The Georgetown strategy group great to get your perspective thanks so much for joining us in Al jaer thank you thank you
