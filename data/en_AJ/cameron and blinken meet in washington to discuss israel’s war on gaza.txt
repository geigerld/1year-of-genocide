the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has called for greater quantities of Aid to get into Northern Gaza in particular and these sentiments were echoed by the British foreign secretary David Cameron as the pair held a joint press conference just a short time ago in Washington DC we're looking at a number of critical things that need to happen in the coming days including opening a new Northern point of entry for assistance into Gaza uh using ashdod on a regular basis maximizing the flow of assistance from Gordon um as well as putting in place uh a much more effective deconfliction mechanism with the humanitarian groups that are providing assistance uh just yesterday more than 400 trucks were cleared to go into Gaza and that is the most since October 7th in any given day but what matters is results and sustained results and this is what we will be looking at very carefully in the days ahead we want to see 500 trucks a day we want to see the water switch back on we want to see Ash DOD and a northern Crossing Point opened and crucially we want to see this deconfliction because getting Aid to Gaza on its own isn't enough you've got to be able to get Aid around Gaza and as we saw with the tragic killing of the world Central kitchen workers unless you have that deconfliction other things like that could um happen we have Mike Hannah joining us now from Washington DC so Mike the two men speaking in Washington just a short time ago obviously there was a lot of focus on the war on Gaza um what was the takeaway message from that press conference when it came to Gaza and Israel well the primary message was that both the Secretary of State and the foreign secretary are in complete accordance on the situation in Gaza they are both arguing for more humanitarian Aid to go in they both Express the hope that Israel will meet its commitments to allow more humanitarian Aid into Gaza and they also agree though that Hamas is a stumbling block to getting a negotiated ceasefire or pause in the ongoing conflict uh ignoring Israeli intransigence in the matter and on the issue of arms to Israel once again complete agreement both the US Secretary of State and the British foreign secretary saying that arms will continue to Israel despite concern among many particularly here in the United States about the way in which these weapons are used so certainly complete agreement between the two politicians at this news conference and um the Secretary of State made some interesting comments when it came to the ra um operation because we heard earlier today for the prime minister of Israel saying that he has a date for The Invasion but the Secretary of State saying that the US uh that date hasn't been communicated to them how are we to understand that well it is a slightly complicated situation because in past days this Secretary of State said that Israel had been asked to uh communicate with the us about any potential operation in rougher and even to go so far as to discuss how it was going to preserve civilian life during such an operation but now from what the Secretary of State said it appears that this is no longer the case uh making very clear that uh Israel has not consulted the US in any way on its operation in Gaza even though as you point out the Israeli Prime Minister says it is going to go ahead so there appears to have been a shift in impetus over here where at One Stage the US was asking Israel to let it know about its operation in Rafa and also how it was going to carry it out at this stage it appears that the US is not expecting anything from what the US Secretary of State said from Israel with regards to any operation in Rafa all right thank you Mike Hannah thanks for that update from Washington DC make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from
