First, but the sequence that happened was that the occupation forces initially bulldozed the journalistsâ€™ tent. Later, a foot force descended and fixed the place with lasers and snipers. We were forced to surrender ourselves due to fear that the occupation forces would commit a massacre, execution, or even direct shooting, given knowledge or the presence of a slogan on this room.  Since this room belongs to journalists, we were forced to surrender ourselves and go outside. The occupation forces forced us to take off our clothes completely, kneel on the ground and place our hands above our heads for about an hour in a very cold and bitter atmosphere. The occupation forces handcuffed our hands and blindfolded us, and we remained in this state.  About three hours from this morning until the evening hours until the military intelligence units of the occupation army arrived to work on investigating the journalists and even those present in this field. We found the moment we left the room in which we stayed for several hours in a cold atmosphere, stripped of clothes, handcuffed and blindfolded, almost to the ground.  For an hour in this situation, without mercy from the occupation forces or even giving us some of the clothes that they forced us to take off, some of the crews or the working part of the crews were interrogated, while it means that I succeeded in helping this elderly man and getting out of the complex so that no one would come to me.  Investigation, and there have been great efforts to release the working crew until this moment. This means that the conditions are difficult, and the occupation forces are largely stationed inside the community, and there is violent bombardment, and there are a number of structures that were destroyed.
