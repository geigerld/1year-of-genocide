now we understand that the next speaker is going to be Israel's ambassador to the United Nations gillad eron let's President distinguished colleagues we are gathered here in this Hall today as a result of a resolution called uniting for peace sadly this emergency session has nothing to do with peace every member State here today who is convinced that we are about to discuss yet another round of conflict in the Middle East another dispute between Israel and the Palestinians is wrong the October 7th Massacre and what ensued has nothing to do with the Palestinians nothing it has nothing to do with the Arab Israeli conflict or the Palestinian question this is not a war with the Israel is at war with the genocidal jihadist Hamas Terror organization only it is the law abiding democracy of Israel against modernday Nazis these are the facts Hamas do not care about the Palestinian people they do not care about peace or dialogue Hamas is only one goal to annihilate Israel and murder every single Jew on the face of the Earth their origional Charter makes this very clear I'll read you a few lines Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it another quote there is no solution for the Palestinian problem except by Jihad another quote the day of judgment will not come about until Muslims fight Jews and kill them friends on October 7th it became clear to the entire world that hamas's Charter was not a compilation of empty words it was an action plan an action plan imagine a bright sunny day clear skies music in the air young people are dancing a rave a Concert for Peace yes for peace it is really it is early morning on the holy Sabbath the sun is just reason to Mark a new day it is also a festive Jewish High holiday Sim T Sim t means the joy of the Torah where we celebrate the book of books our Holy Bible and then in one Split Second this idelic Eden became hell on Earth the peaceful morning air was pierced with the whale of Rocket Sirens thousands I'm telling you thousands of Hamas mortars and Rockets rain down indiscriminately on many Israeli cities and Villages but the Rockets were only covered for the pogram the pogram that followed Barbarian Kamas terrorists invaded Israel from the sea the land and the air they came with one purpose one purpose only to savagely murder every living thing they encountered Hamas Nai murders went from house to house with hit lists a thoroughly planned willful premeditated attack they brutally murdered civilians in their beds they drove pickup trucks with machine guns yes we all remember just like Isis and fired blindly at hundreds of young people at a concert 300 300 were burned alive or butchered in that concert much of what remained were clumps of Flesh and bloody limbs parents had to bring their children's toothbrushes for DNA so they could figure out whose limb belonged to who these Kamas monsters raped women and children parading naked girls that they raped and buddied that they defiled through the streets of Gaza while thousands and I'm telling you thousands you can see the footage Jered and cheered the Savages tortured small babies just like the Nazis Kamas terrorists removed infants from their cribs yes we have it on video swung them repeatedly against the ground until their skulls became a pulp children were murdered in front of their parents and parents in front of their children I've seen a video of a terrorist filmed by him by himself who tossed a grenade into a bomb shelter with a father and his two young boys inside the father was killed instantly and the two boys ran out of the shelter screaming that their father is dead and that they want to be dead too all this is occurring believe it or not as the monster who murdered their father calmly helps himself to the contents of the family's fridge yes no horror movie compares to the pure brutality that Hamas carried out no [Music] none AIT man a 22y old from kibuts b and a paramedic for Mend David adom Israel's Red Cross she dedicated her life literally and you will understand why to saving others when the Hamas monster invaded the kibuts Amit ran to the clinic to treat as many wounded as she could for hours hours amid work nonstop trying to save lives she knew these sadistic terrorists were outside her Clinic because she heard the gunfire but she stayed there she was committed to saving lives not running away finally the terrorist burst into her Clinic and put a bullet a bullet through her brain she was AAG David ad paramedic the Israeli Red Cross in uniform but that didn't stop these Savages this is how the rescue teams found a ambulances were set on fire not one many dozens of mend David ad medical teams were in intentionally targeted on their way to tend to the wounded and many other par paramedics were murdered barilai Hospital in my hometown City ashalon in Israel suffered direct hits from Kamas Rockets Not For the First Time Kamas has been deliberately firing rockets at it for years for years intentionally yet not a single condemnation of this barbarity has been mentioned here not here not by the security Council not by the Secretary General and not by this absurd resolution it seems that hospitals and Medical Teams only need to be protected as long as they are not Israeli the hypocrisy is beyond belief beyond belief the brutal Isis like Monsters abducted over 220 hostages from Israel and dozens of other countries including babies babies children persons with disabilities the elderly and Holocaust Survivors kir bibas kir bias is n months old N9 months old and he is being held right now in Gaza as a hostage 9 months old what what barbaric terrorist can do such a thing and together with him 30 other children 30 other children we saw hamas's brutality in Israel I cannot begin to Fathom what Horrors the hostages are enduring right now as we speak here 20 days have gone by and Israel is still counting her death dead it tookes weeks to collect all of the bodies some bodies are burnt like pieces of coal it is almost impossible to identify them countless burned bodies have been found with Ash in their throats meaning they were still alive still alive when lit on fire intentionally by the Hamas terrorists a clump of chars human remains that was burned beyond recognition was found at first the medical person Personnel couldn't figure out what they were looking at yet after a CT scan it became clear that they were two spines not one two spines bound together with wire one belonging to an adult and the other the small spine of a child so just try to imagine that parents that parent feeling as they and their child were Burning Alive Burning Alive the painful screaming of the love of their life was the last thing they heard the last thing do you not think it's unbelievable that this resolution here today and this session are not solely focused on hamas's atrocities when reading this resolution Kamas seems to be missing in action the drafters of the resolution claim to be concerned about peace yet the depraved murders who initiated this war are not even mentioned in the resolution not even mentioned they see each one of you as puppet they write a resolution completely devoid of any content related to the situation they assume that you have already for got and who it is that is responsible for the inhumane violence and they just expect you to support it automatically this resolution is a disgrace to your intelligence a disgrace it is unfathomable that such a resolution one that doesn't even mention Hamas could possibly be voted upon here let that sink in please distinguished representative Representatives Kamas carried out atrocities the likes of which we have not seen since the Holocaust yet unlike the Holocaust where the evidence we have is mostly black and white photographs and soundless footage here the proof is in high definition because some of it is from yes security footage but much of it is from the cell phones and GoPro cameras belonging to the Hamas Nazis themselves many may be asking why did they film their sadistic violence well I'll tell you why very simple they filmed it in order to terrorize the Israeli public to release these videos and put fear in the hearts of the citizens of Israel by the way this is what IST do they terrorize I have seen much footage over the past weeks that will be seared into my mind forever but there is one sight that I keep on seeing when I try to sleep in the video one can see a terrible injured civilian blooded yet alive laying on the ground as a Hamas Savage screaming Allah abbar repeatedly pummels the man's neck with a garden hoe in order to decapitate him the man on the ground is an agricultural worker from Thailand he's not Israeli he's not Jewish he was merely alive trying to make a living for his family but he was decapitated with a blunt gardening tool horrifying Israel is not at war with human beings we are at war with monsters here is the my mission distributed and will continue to distribute QR codes with a direct link to files where you can see this horror and many other Kamas atrocities what you see here are not pictures from aitz but Israelis raped butchered and burned alive this is not aitz this is Hamas there are no words in the English language in any language to describe the evil that we all just witnessed and the reason it is not describable is because it has no place among humankind over 1,400 have been slaughtered thousand injured and over 220 hostages are being held right now by Hamas Isis terrorists to say that this is Israel's 911 would be an understatement proportionately the death toll of this atrocity is 15 times bigger than 911 by the way our enemies are not 7,000 mil away they are 7,000 ft away in our own backyard so for this reason reason Israel's mission is to eradicate this evil from the earth eradicate Isis was the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and Hamas is the Islamic State of Gaza so just as was done with Isis Hamas must be no more our goal is to completely eradicate hamas's capabilities and we will use every mean at our disposal to accomplish this not for Revenge no not for retaliation no but to ensure that such depravity such atrocities never occurs again Israel is at the Forefront of the war on radical jihadist Terror and if Israel doesn't succeed in obliterating obliterating hamas's Terror capabilities the whole world will pay the price hamas's genocidal ideology just like Isis alqaeda or the Ayatollah regime inan of Iran is not just about destroying Israel you all know it it is ultimately about world domination world it is about bringing the Jihad War to the soil of each and every one of your countries they will not stop until they murder all of the infidels as they call us colleagues for the past 16 years the International Community and the UN have have been complacent to hamas's Terror buildup in Gaza complacent the world has kept its head in the sand as Hamas embedded its missiles and Rockets deep within and under the civilian population of Gaza it it accepted an absurd reality that a law-abiding democracy could live side by side with cancerous genocidal terrorist that fire tens of thousands of missiles indiscriminately at our civilians unprovoked we have seen that nothing can change hamas's genocidal ideology not sadly not the rehabilitation of Gaza not economic incentives not any promise of a brighter future the UN tried many of you tried but everyone failed everyone failed and you know why because nothing can change a genocidal ideology nothing there is only one solution to cutting curing a cancer it is is the evisceration of every cancerous cell the International Community has P poured billions of dollars into Gaza and it all went to hamas's war machine it went to its Subterranean city of Terror it went to its missile manufacturing facilities and you remember 18 years ago Israel unilaterally withdrew from all of Gaza we withdrew from all of Gaza Kamas could have invested the international funding it received into building power plans water desalination plants every other civil infrastructure but no instead Hamas exploited every inch of the Gaza Strip for their violent goals because to Hamas gazen civilians are nothing more than mere Cannon F human Shields who in death become pwns for hamas's lious propaganda campaign Hamas is counting on you they are certain that despite the terror and Massacre the UN will still come to their rescue and prevent Israel from defending itself friends Israel is on a rescue mission a res resue mission to save our hostages to save our future and to save the people of Gaza from their Savage tyrants a rescue mission and colleagues the rescue mission can end quickly now it can end now no need for complicated empty resolutions it can end now should Hamas put down their arms return our hostages and turn themselves in this war will end without one more shot being fired not even one why do you not unite and call on Hamas to do this if the drafters of this resolution truly wants want peace if they truly want an immediate solution then why do they not demand this of Hamas Instead This resolution does the exact opposite of finding a solution the exact opposite rather than promoting peace it only ensures more violence it should be ca uniting for Terror not uniting for peace Israel has been attacked and continues to be attacked this is a fact right now in the sou south from Kamas and in the north from kisala meanwhile the resolution calls for an immediate ceasefire a ceasefire means giving Kamas time to rearm itself so they can Massacre us again this is not speculation they will do so you all know this any call for a ceasefire is not an attempt at peace it is an attempt to tie Israel's hands preventing us from eliminating a huge threat to our citizens but the resolutions distortions go even deeper than that Hamas the terror group that started this war I reiterate is not even mentioned not even once in fact the only hidden reference to these barbaric terrorists can be found in calls on both parties both parties this is a false immoral comparison between the law-abiding democracy of Israel and and genocidal jihadist and the drafters are counting on the fact that each and every distinguished representative here will BL blindly go along with their Ploy this resolution is an insult to your intelligence and the only place this resolution belongs is in the Dustbin of History the Dustbin of history but colleagues this resolution is not the only thing here today that is detached from reality in a short time a representative of the evil regime that trained funded and armed Hamas for the October 7th Massacre will address you the Ayatollah regime of Iran has the blood of thousands of Israelis on its hands it has the blood of hundreds of thousands of oppressed Iranians of ukrainians of Americans of emiratis and so many others on its hands Iran is known as the world's number one state sponsor of Terror and for good reasons it's a completely it's completely natural that the foreign minister of this brutal regime should be the speaker following the resolution drafter the country with a Nazi ideology of annihilating Israel publicly says stands in solidarity with its proxy Hamas which shares the same Nazi ideology and aims for our destruction this is completely understandable indeed M days ago he spoke with the leaders of Hamas and its twin terror group Palestinian Islamic Jihad praising them praising them for the slaughter and today he is here to fill your ears with poison indeed uniting for peace uniting to butcher every Israeli to pieces this man the mass murderer or any other representative of the terror regime in Iran has no place at the UN let alone in the family of of Nations it is a moral stain on the UN and the values it was founded upon distinguished colleagues this week the UN celebrated its 78th birthday yet looking at this resolution and the honorary guests hosted here today in this Halls this organization has shown that it is so broken so morally corrupt that I do not have high hopes that it will make it to 90 let alone 100 I'm just a realist today serves as the clearest proof that this body is bleeding its relevance legitimacy and justification what we are witnessing today is a desecration a desecration of what the UN was meant to be following the horrors of the Holocaust this institution was established to prevent atrocities from repeating themselves yet in these very Halls we have perpetrators of the most grotesque human rights violations and crimes against humanity who also exploit their power and so-called members of the family of Nations only to single out low abiding democracies such as Israel if this organization wants to maintain any shred of legitimacy it is imperative that you please distinguished Representatives no long longer play along with this farce of anti-israel double standards vote against this biased resolution stand on the right side of History don't stand with the genocidal jihadist committed to your destruction rise above internal political considerations and do what is moral and right Mr President Israel will not stop fighting for the truth even if we Remain the sole voice of reason in these Halls Israel will continue combating the genocidal terrorist committed to our destruction we will not rest until Hamas is obliterated and our hostages are returned home and we will bring them home I will conclude with a moment of silence for all the victims of hamas's atrocity if the supporters of this resolution choose to ignore the victims in their text I will pay respect to their President you're watching ala we're bringing you live coverage of an emergency special session on the protection of the Palestinian civilian population at the general assembly of the United Nations we've just heard from the Israeli ambassador to the UN gilad Adan giv a very powerful and emotive uh speech of the Arab and some hallowing stories of what happened when Hamas Fighters attacked Southern Israel on October the 7th he said this resolution has nothing to do with peace this is a resolution being brought by Jordan on behalf of several other Arab Nations we're about to hear from Jordan in just a few seconds gilled eron also said that October the 7th masaco was nothing to do with Palestinians he said Israel is at war with a genocidal terrorist organization he said he said Hamas do not care about the Palestinian people he described on the October 7th that Hamas Fighters came with a purpose to savagely murder every living thing they came into contact with
