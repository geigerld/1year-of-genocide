Mustafa bouti who's the Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative and a former Palestinian information Minister joins us now from rala we're talking about the day after but it's really a question of how long the day after lasts this buffer perimeter of what around 1 kilometer uh say the Israelis inside Gaza of course to prevent a repeat of October the 7th they say what's your thought there is no military value whatsoever of this procedure but the real actually the real intention of this is to shrink Gaza size we have to remember that Gaza is only 362 square kilometers with 2.3 million people living there it's the most densely populated area in the world and now the Israelis want to cut off a big part of it no less than 15% it would go up to 25% of that little place uh uh annexing it practically to Israel uh and this would be perceived only as an act of ethnic cleansing of the whole population that lives in this very important part of gasa strip it is an act to destroy also one of the most important agricultural areas in the in the in the place and you would be effectively next to Israel is that the Israelis say no one will be there there'll only be mines in this area to prevent people crossing and they say they need it to maintain security yeah an nexted land would and with mines that's what they want to do they want to move their B forward borders forward into Gaza destroying the lives of the people of Gaza and that is of course very dangerous and it should not be accepted and it should not be allowed add to that another important factor in my opinion their talk about AER zone now is a in a way a recognition of their failure they failed in the all their military goals they failed in enforcing to toal ethnic cleansing of Gaza they failed in in destroying the resistance in Gaza they failed in imposing their domination in the area and their occupation uh these these methods of thinning Gaza as the ex foreign minister book about Cohen uh are not going to help anybody and I think the whole International Community must take a very strong stand against this violation of people's rights and of Human Rights and of the integ of Palestinian land and talking about the International Community of course the United States disagrees with the concept of a buffer zone but Anthony blinkin the Secretary of State saying that there may be scope for transitional Arrangements what does he mean by that do you think Mr blinkin is only acting as a as a lawyer for Israel and he's playing games with his words when he says transitional he means he's giving Israel the permit to do this and the transitional will be become permanent if the United States was serious about its position they would tell Israel stop that and end it and don't do it they would at least tell Israel to stop the Seas to the the attack on Gaza and to have a real serious permanent ceasefire something that the whole world wants and the only country that is obstructing now is the United States of America I don't believe Mr blinkin and I think he's maneuvering and playing games to support the Israeli intentions you say that if the United States was serious about it all they need to do is tell Israel to stop but isn't Israel operating on its own accord and just ignoring what anybody else says or thinks no they can't ignore the United States because if the United States St says that they should stop they will have to stop they cannot live without American weapons they cannot live without American money they cannot live without American diplomatic support the United States is a participant unfortunately in this war and as long as they don't support ceasefire they become participant in the war crimes that are happening in Gaza it's very serious very serious Mr bouti appreciate your time thanks very much indeed Mustafa bouti speaking to us there from ROM thank
