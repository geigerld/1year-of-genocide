deadly attacks across the Gaza Strip since Dawn let's go straight to our correspondent tar abazo who's live from darab Bala in central Gaza uh T you've just been to the scene of that attack in the inat refugee camp tell us about what you saw and heard well basically for have just returned from the site of the attack that the Israeli fightings have targeted Al jauni school which is a un run evacuation Center in anarat refugee camp now as from the first moment I entered the school I just observes a tremendous amount of Destruction in fact being inflicted to the place uh piles of rles are scattered around the area people are looking for anything in order to use it again after the destruction I show the missile that had been stuck in the ground after the strike where eyewitnesses have confirmed that at least uh 13 Palestinians have been confirmed killed in that strike where people were waiting for food at the moment when the attack was carried out by the Israeli fighting Jets also those eyewitnesses confirmed that the strike has been carried out without any sort of warning and basically this is not the only attack on evacuation centers especially in aarat refugee camp we are talking about 13 evacuation centers being targeted since July which is an absolutely a very so rink surge in terms of the numbers of evacuation centers being targeted by the Israeli fight idots and we need to remind our viewers that this these areas have been tolded by by the is military for Palestinians to go there in order to seek refuge and at the same time Israel claims that it has been used as a center a command centers by Hamas Fighters but the did they did not provide any sort any shred of evidence so far to prove their claims and at the moment the uh people there are experiencing really horrific and tremendous amount of shock that they are no longer can feel safe even in you are run shs indeed we have heard that at least two un employees two unra employees have been killed in this attack the pictures that we're looking at on our screen right now are quite devastating I mean from the scene it looks like there's still many people that could be buried under the rubble of those buildings there TK uh talk to us about rescue efforts right now how are those shaping up is it likely that uh there could be survivors from this attack well as soon as I uh got to that location I was really uh shocked by the numers of emergency workers who were looking for any one is under the rule they have been digging using their barely hands due to the lack of civil equipment and they have been say and they have been confirming that they are struggling in order to find any Survivor their attack has caused a great deal of Destruction the the emergency workers search operations have come to an end they have picked up more than 13 Palestinians uh being killed with patches of casualties being transferred to both hospitals but this emergency workers said that Israel is still upscaling its military strikes on all evacuation centers on the North in the central area and in the far south of the strip even they have expressed their Inner Fear about their complete Ina unsafe environment that are working inside in order to look for survivors right the Israeli Army has issued a statement claiming that its forces uh targeted Hamas control center command and Control Center and as you've said tck it's not the first time that Israel has claimed this when they've targeted these civilian areas and not the first time they've targeted nerat refugee camp tell us more about this camp in particular in this area of Gaza and narat campas is a sort of a structure being in fact established in 1948 in order to host Palestinian refugees and it's a very battered camp with uh huge numbers of houses being built in a very heavily built up neighborhood this Camp has been under very Relentless Israel attacks since October the 7th people have been killed in the homes and their evacuation centers and even while they are sleeping without any sort of warning the the the anoar refugee camp was so adjacent to itar Corridor where its nor part has been completely under repeated Israeli attacks as a part of their ongoing operation to expand the narim corridor and to guarantee that there is no any sort of military threat could be imposed for the Israeli operating troops in Zim area and at the same time families there have been repeatedly expressing their concerns about the possibility of the military encour for anuar refugee camp and to be Supple from other parts of the strip which means that the lives of thousands of Palestinians will be at a really high risk which means that those people are under Relentless and constant threat of death this is the Grim reality there families even have been moving from the northern part of Gaza to anarat after gaza's wedding in order to find some sort of safety but with the expansion of the Israeli military operations to the South the entire strip has been the theater for the Israeli military operations tar thank you very much for the update there on this latest Israeli attack on the Alat refugee camp in central Gaza where at
