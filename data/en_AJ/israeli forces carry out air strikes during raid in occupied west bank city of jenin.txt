and Janine was hit by an Israeli air strike during a raid overnight the Israeli Army says troops also located and destroyed a tunnel used by fighters in the area three people have been killed in the West Bank in the last 24 hours Charles Stratford was outside the camp where a cleanup operation is now underway did you join us on the edge of the refugee camp here in Janine I'll just ask Marino our cameraman to to pan round and show you the level of Destruction caused here this was caused by one of those military grade bulldozers that the uh Israeli military used to such devastating effect during these raids and there doesn't seem to be certainly according to the locals that we've spoken to in this neighborhood there doesn't seem to be any reason why this should have happened um they saying that there were no clashes there were no kids throwing stones it was literally according to them a bulldozzer came in here and started ripping up this road now of course this is often called by rights organizations by the Palestinians themselves a form of collective punishment some people are even saying that it's a bid by the Israeli military to try and turn the civilian population against the armed resistance groups that are in this town Janine has long been one of the centers if not the center now for the armed resistance groups from various different factions and you see the men walking around the streets now increasingly less during daylight because these Raves have become so much more frequent so much more intense over the last few weeks since the beginning of the war on Gaza according to the hospital here there were at least three people killed in last night's raid at least 11 people in hospital uh with injuries two we understand in a critical condition but um there were also talks of air strikes here on Janine now we've seen IDF the Israeli Army have released pictures of these air strikes to be clear these are what seem to be targeted drone strikes using small but very deadly and very effective explosive devices and targeting individuals in and amongst the small streets that uh that make up the camp that's not to say that there haden't been larger air strikes using drones here previously in the previous couple of weeks there was a mosque that was taken out and a number of people killed in that attack but yeah the B Top Line is is that this stuff these kind of raids now on Janine and various other towns across the West Bank are increasing in frequency and increasing in intensity as well so yeah there is a lot of tension here a lot of fear amongst the civilian population the civilian population of course that have suffered the rigors have suffered the pressures have suffered the dangers of the occupation for decades and in the build up to the war this place was very much Janine was very much the focus of attention by the Israeli Army as it tried to take out the very many fighters that that that are in this town but as I say things have got a lot worse since the beginning of the war and we can fully expect that we're going to be seeing more raids more destruction more arrests and more deaths in towns like this in the in the days to come
