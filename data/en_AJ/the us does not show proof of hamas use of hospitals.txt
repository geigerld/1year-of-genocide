the US says it is confident that Hamas was using the alifa hospital as a command center and now the supposed proof totally confirm without any doubt at the state department shrugging off the scant evidence I'm surprised when I hear people saying oh there were only 10 rifles in this room it's a hospital it's a hospital there shouldn't be any assault hold on there shouldn't be any assault rifles at a hospital know at the Pentagon also still standing by the undisclosed intelligence it says it has hi you keep talking about the intelligence in the past TPS that you believe the intelligence believes Hamas has used hospitals do you have intelligence that they currently are I have only the intelligence that I read out the downgraded intelligence that I read out yesterday um or sorry I'm I'm sorry on Tuesday uh past tense present tense don't want to parse out words here but we know that Hamas has been using the hospital the alifa hospital and other hospitals in Gaza um I'm not going going to get into more specifics on you know what they're doing now whereabouts all of that we know that the IDF has taken control of alifa hospital um so I don't have more to to share with you on that front it matters because under international law you have to have proof that is uh combatant is is currently right then in that moment in the hospital in order to strike yeah again when I read out the downgraded material we felt very confident that Hamas was using that hospital um to conduct his operations this is what they found while the Biden Administration is trying to downplay the lack of evidence presented to the public experts say it could have a decisive impact on the future of the war this is really a turning point because if it turns out the Israelis are wrong I think the pressure is going to be on them to have a ceasefire which is a good step because it will Stop The Killing at least temporarily while we the diplomats can work out some sort of arrangement at the Pentagon briefing there were about as many questions on US troops being targeted in Iraq and Syria as there were on this evidence so while the Biden Administration might not feel much pressure from the American Media when it comes to his allies that might be a much different story if Israel can't come up with actual proof that Hamas was in the hospital Patty Kain Al jazer at the Pentagon make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
