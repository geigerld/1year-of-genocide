well a White House delegation headed by vice president kamla Harris's National Security adviser Phil Gordon has arrived in Tel Aviv for more on this let's speak to our White House correspondent kimy halad and kimbley so tell us what more do we know about this delegation what are their goals in Israel yeah well the delegation is comprised headed up by the national security or really the uh person who is overseeing that policy for the vice president KLA Harris and as you mentioned his name is Phil Gordon the vice president was accompanying him as they met with Arab leaders over the weekend she since returned to the White House but he has carried on to meet with his Israeli counterparts and the reason is because there is a desire of the United States to work with the Israelis to begin those discussions on what the post Gaza conflict in terms of Israel's war on Gaza looks like in terms of governance so uh the United States has one idea Israel has another and they're trying to kind of work on what would be a future and of course include the vision of the Palestinian people as well we know that the Palestinian people at least some of them aren't wild about the Palestinian Authority being in charge uh the Israelis are not wild about that idea either the United States thinks a revitalized Palestinian Authority might be something worth looking into or even some sort of International type governance so these are all conversations that are going to be lengthy but the White House believes it's time to get started what about the overall position of the White House of the administration of the ongoing assault on Gaza well we've certainly seen the position of the White House shift from the early days in the early days uh specifically after October 7th when there was the attack by Hamas in Israel what we saw was a very angry White House that really said nothing more than Israel has a right to defend itself and use very harsh language towards Hamas now what we're hearing is something quite different given the high number of Civilian casualties in Gaza in fact the strongest words coming from the Secretary of Defense Floyd Austin who said that failing to protect civilians d drives the civilians into the arms of the enemy meaning Hamas uh what we've also heard is the words of the vice president who have been quite strong as well where she said there is an unequivocal responsibility of Israel to follow International humanitarian law something that we on Al jazer have been reporting Israel has not been doing in its military campaign and also she said the scale of suffering has been devastating so this is very strong language from the vice president uh it's clear that she has a vision for what post uh the post conflict should look like and in fact she spelled it out she said that it should have no Force displacement no reoccupation no blockade no reduction in territory but also the last note is that there Gaza should not be used sort of as a staging ground for uh any sort of future uh as the White House calls it terrorist activity so uh the White House has some views they're trying to work with the Israelis on that but it's clear the shift now is there is a priority I'm protecting civilians in Gaza Kimberly thanks for that Kimberly Hut there at the White House let's take this on we can speak now to Steven zunes who's a professor of politics and international studies at the University of San Francisco and joins us now live from there uh Stephen great to have you with us where are we at with the us at this moment do you think over G there and and what's happening right now and what will happen afterwards and and how is the US Administration shifting its position according to how the public views it as your correspondent noted there's been a notable shift in rhetoric whether that's going to have any impact on actual Israeli actions is another story uh the Biden Administration is responding to increasing outrage among the American people that our country is essentially aiding and abetting war crimes on a massive scale I mean the polling data is is quite extraordinary I've never seen any quite like it that uh you know nearly 70% of Americans believe there should be a ceasefire total ceasefire including uh nearly uh 85% of of of Democrats and similarly a majority oppose uh US military uh additional US military aid to Israel and so the um administration of course is scrambling uh to try to um uh appease public opinion given that there's been a a notable impact in the polls about Biden's popularity around this indeed uh he is currently losing to Trump in a hypothetical race today and it it comes in large part because of a major drop in support from young voters and Progressive voters from Arab Americans from American Muslims key constituencies of for the for the Democrats so he is perhaps for immoral reasons but at least for political reasons uh there has been you know a pushing for Israel to uh comply with International humanitarian law this is developed potentially into an election losing issue yeah exactly exactly we've seen for example in 1968 when the Democrats uh nominated a pro Vietnam War accounted Hubert Humphrey a lot of Democrats stayed home in Nixon e to Naro Victory similarly John kery in 2004 um supported the Iraq War a lot of anti-war people stayed home were voted third party and again Bush ended up getting reelected narrowly and indeed it was Hillary Clinton's support for the Iraq War uh that Trump and others kind of hammered on that led to her narrow loss in 2016 so we've seen before how when Democrats go against their constituencies on issues of War and Peace especially when we're talking about large scale civilian casualties there is a political price to be pay Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli Prime Minister is seemingly wholly detered deted and focused in continuing the destruction and the devastation deaf to these appeals apparently from the US Administration what other pressure can the United States bring to bear on Israel to you know move more in their Direction and ease off I mean theoretically there are any number of things the United States could cut off military aid until Israel agrees to stop attacking and agreed to allow for the establishment of a viable Palestinian State alongside Israel or at least to freeze the settlement expansion and the Rampages by the uh far right West Bank uh uh Jewish militia there um or you know they could recognize the state of Palestine as over 130 other countries have been and then bring it to the United Nations as and to to put sanctions I mean there are a lot of things the United States could do but these aren't even in the cards indeed um you know the administration is is using emergency powers to bypass Congressional and public oversight for the to for to release stockpiles of weapons including Hellfire missiles Buster busting bomb bunker busting bombs I mean the very weapons that have been responsible for the horrific uh civilian casualties I mean almost reminds me of uh Reagan in and during the 1980s saying to our to our Central American dictatorships we were supporting you better be better careful on human rights while you know continuing to provide the uh instruments uh that that allowed them to continue the slaughter yes the implications of this war spread far and wide Stephen we're going to leave it there but appreciate your perspective Stephen Yunis zunis I should say speaking to us there from San Francisco thank you
