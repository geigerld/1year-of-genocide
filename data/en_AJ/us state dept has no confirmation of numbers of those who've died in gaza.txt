the US National Security Council spokesman has been holding a briefing at the White House let's bring in our White House correspondent kimy hit joining us from the White House so what did he have to say yeah uh the the what the uh National Security Council uh spokesperson John Kirby had to say specifically uh really was a followup on that shocking comment that President Joe Biden made in the Rose Garden on Wednesday where he essentially said that he didn't believe the number of Civilian casualties now more than 7,000 with uh more than 3,000 children being killed in Israel's war in Gaza saying that uh he couldn't trust the the ver or verify those numbers to be uh precise and uh the bottom line is is that there were a number of journalists that not only challenged that uh but also called to question the insensitive nature of the president's comments and so uh there were repeated questions about that to which the uh spokesperson defended repeatedly saying that the Biden Administration will not apologize the president will not apologize for making those remarks also saying that they believe the numbers are not reliable and they also while they believe that there are many many families that have been affected they double down on the claim that Hamas is a terror organization and as the result they believe that these are false numbers and so therefore they give them no credibility now uh with respect to the tragedy that we here at Al jazer have been experiencing with the uh death of the family of our Al jazer Arabic uh Bureau Chiefs family uh I asked the uh spokesperson John Kirby specifically about that and whether Al jaaz journalists are being targeted among the many journalists that the center or committee to protect journalists says is now more than 24 journalists who have been killed just since October 7th trying to cover this conflict uh the spokesperson said uh his thoughts and prayers go out to those that are grieving but he denied that alaz specifically is being targeted in fact uh he said just the opposite when I asked him directly if in fact Al jazer was being targeted he said that uh he valued the the work that we are doing and he said that uh he would not in any way uh underscore reporting here in the United States that uh says that there have been attempts to silence our network but that is exactly what has been reported here in the United States that the Secretary of State Anthony blinkin uh reached out to the katari government asking us to tone down our coverage what I can tell you is that that was flatly denied in the White House brief in room just moments ago by John Kirby and also he flatly denied that Al jazer is being targeted specifically for its War coverage okay Kimberly we appreciate that thank you so much for that update from the White House
