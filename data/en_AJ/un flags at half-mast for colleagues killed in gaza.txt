now the United Nations is flying its flags at half staff and will observe a minute of Silence on Monday to honor un staff killed or wounded in Gaza this was the scene outside the office in Bangkok on Friday the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees unra announced that 101 of its employees had been killed in Gaza since the start of the war and this is the United Nations University in Tokyo these scenes will be repeated at un offices around the world on on Monday the organization has confirmed the number of deaths of its staff is the highest killed in any conflict since the UN was formed in 1945 well let's speak to Juliet tumor who's un's director of communications she's joining us from occupied East jerusalm Juliet good to have you with us again on Al jaer so 101 unra humanitarian workers killed in the Gaza Strip since October 7th tell us about who they were and how your work has been impacted yes uh these are our dear colleagues and our dear friends more than 100 of them have been killed they were mainly teachers but also School principles one doctor a number of Engineers support staff uh people who were in charge of safety for example um many many of them were killed um with members of their families some were killed um while they were on their way to bring bread for their families it's it's a global day of mour for the United Nations as we remember those colleagues and we pay tribute to their service at Andra how has your work on the ground been impacted by by these deaths and and the injuries that your uh colleagues have sustained this is uh only one challenge that Andra is facing we're being hit uh from different directions the war itself is definitely one challenge the SE and the tightening of of The Siege and the restrictions that we have on the number of trucks that we are able to bring in very very little no fuel fuel is running out for Andra the largest humanitarian agency and then the the shelters I mean we're close to 800,000 people now taking shelter under the very same flag that is being lowered around the world this morning they came to the those un facilities under facilities in search for protection and for safety yeah you you talked about The Siege and uh the safety o of uh people who have sought shelter at un schools schools that have been bombed so what what is the focus of your work right now given these uh difficult conditions on the ground The Siege in in Gaza City The Siege around hospitals there what are you focusing on right now look on our facilities that were impacted we can confirm that more than 60 6 Z have been impacted most recently yesterday one of our guest houses where we have staff sleeping and staying in in the Gaza Strip um that they received three direct hits um yesterday morning and we were very very lucky because it was just uh an hour and a half after our staff left that guest house and went to work so um this is increasing and 70% of those facilities that were impacted happened south of w Gaza so in fact in the middle areas or in areas like kanun or RA in the South it's an indication that nowhere in Gaza nowhere is safe not the north not the middle and not even the southern areas our Focus right now is to provide assistance to those families who came to seek refuge and protection under the very same un flag that was lowered this morning yeah as you say nowhere is safe and many Palestinians were told to move from the north to the South for their safety uh I I know that some of our colleagues had to move have have your colleagues from unra also left the Northern parts of Gaza City and all these areas which are under heavy bombardment and are now in the South yes yes many many of our staff uh 13,000 of them many were forced to flee as part of the forced displacement of the Palestinian communities across the Gaza Strip so they are like the rest of the communities however they many many of them are still there many many of them are still serving and providing to the communities under very very challenging circumstances and we also had staff who were there when the Exodus happened over the past few days of mass populations moving forced to flee forced to flee their homes in Gaza City and in the north and they reported scenes that resembled very much the 1948 War people arrived after walking on foot for hours dehydrated and exhausted right when you when you see Juliet what's happened over the past five weeks the death toll of more than 11,000 the mass Exodus as you say newborn babies being removed from their incubators did you ever imagine it would reach this level it's unprecedented on all levels it's unprecedented not only uh operationally for us it's extremely challenging but the death toll the death toll including among our colleagues and and and staff at at anra the challenges that we're facing in terms of the very very tight Siege the restrictions that we have on our operations and the fact that we don't have fuel it's a very simple thing that we need to have so that we can drive our cars and trucks and Reach people with the assistance they need even that we don't have Juliet thank you very much for taking the time to speak to us Juliet tumor is the spokeswoman for unra the un's refugee Agency for Palestinians live there in occupied East Jerusalem
