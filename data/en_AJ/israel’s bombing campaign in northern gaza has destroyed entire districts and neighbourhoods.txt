hello again you're watching Al jazer a reminder of our top stories this hour halfway through a 4day ceasefire in Gaza and a second group of 39 Palestinian Prisoners has been released from Israeli jails there've been tears and joy as families and loved ones welcome them home 13 Israelis and four Thai captives released by Hamas from Gaza are now back in Israel this is the second group to be freed in the prisoner exchange deal six are women and seven are children children at least eight Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank it happened as Israeli forces carried out an overnight raid in the city of Janine Israeli military vehicles blocked access to two major hospitals let's get an update from on the ground in Gaza now hanni Mahmud is there for us in KH unun in the southern Gaza Strip so hany this has been a uh a relief on some level for people in Gaza from the fighting just tell us what's been happening there this has well despite the this relief that is felt by uh the vast majority of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and and despite the the calm the relative calm and peaceful uh night the the Palestinian are still expressing frustration over the fact that this ceasefire is incomplete it's it's it's somehow unfair given the fact there's 1.5 million evacuees still in the southern part who are unable to go to the north to check on their home to see if they are still is standing uh some of them have have relatives who were stranded and and were in in their homes when they got bombs they wanted to take this opportunity and have the ability to go to the northern part in Gaza City just to look for those uh Missing trapped and deceased bodies under under the rubbles and give them the proper uh the proper funeral procession and pay the respect and and and offer the the prayer uh for them but that has not happen yet increasing Their Fear of of permanent displacement in the sun part in on on the first day of the ceas fire group of evacuees attempted to go to the northern part but they were unable as they were shot at at an area established by this really military called the ceasefire line they were shot at with live ammunition and tear gas two people reported killed and multiple other were were injured there is also still a sense of of deprivation among Palestinian when they look at the number of humanitarian aided trucks allowed into Gaza and when when compared to the level of misery and suffering caused by the sheer amount of Destruction and and when you look at the wiped out neighborhoods completely particularly in in the northern part they think it's they are still deprived of those essential humanitarian Aid items that could help them deal with the with the destruction and this this disaster of life as they know it uh there is a hope right now that this ceasefire despite its fragility and we saw last night when the exchange of of hostages and Palestinian detes was held up for several hours it it just underscore the fragility of the Sea Fire and and and sent waves of concern that this might not last or it will was going to come to an end shattering any possibilities of of extension after the the four the four days for a lot of people yet it's an opportunity to uh Embrace their their loved ones and and relatives whether they are evacuees with them or here in the sun part or uh they are still in the northern part still communication doesn't help them to get hold of of all of their relatives and and that's another a a problem and increasing the trauma and the stress that the reason people are not picking up their phone is because they they're either dead or uh they are their gun missing hany Mahmud lifers there in Khan Unice
