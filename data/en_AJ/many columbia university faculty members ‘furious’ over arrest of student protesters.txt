protests against Israel's war and Gaza are growing at universities across the US these are the scenes at Colombia University where students are camping out despite dozens of arrests on Monday students from Massachusetts to California are calling for universities to cut ties with us companies that profit from the war Kristen salumi is joining us from outside Columbia University so despite the arrest Kristen more protests absolutely it's a bit quieter today than it was last night when the campus was uh very animated and loud and uh there were rumors of the encampment being cleared yet again and demonstrators showed up outside of the campus as well as on the campus to support the cause of uh ceasefire in Gaza today you can see behind me there's still a massive police presence here there's barricade set up all around the campus uh to try to keep things calm and uh we are joined Now by a professor a faculty member here a lecturer basam Kaja who is with the law school thank you so much for coming and giving us the latest information uh I know dozens of Faculty came out on Monday to support and protest the arrests of the students uh do you think they represent the majority of Faculty here it's hard to say if they represent the majority but the number of Faculty are really Furious that the University president made the decision to call New York City's Police Department Department onto Campus Police Department the history of brutality um this was made opposed to the Senate University Senate that objected to the this happening um we are really Furious um 100 of us came and stood on the steps a few days ago to protest this decision 54 members of the law schools permanent faculty wrote directly to the president objecting to it and so there's quite a bit of anger Among The Faculty even among people who don't support the protesters of the fact that the New York City Police Department has brought in against what is essentially a peaceful protest students camping out on a lawn yeah you mentioned the Columbia Senate who is involved in the Columbia Senate and there were some rumors of a censure resolution against the president shafik because of the way the police were called in is that correct what's the latest there yeah so the university Senate is made up of Faculty students administrators um the president is required to consult the Senate prior to bringing in the police she did that the Senate rejected it and she went ahead anyways um by all accounts now she is up for a centure by the Senate and I think that reflects the extent of the anger on the campus uh against this decision uh Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson due to visit the campus this afternoon he's going to meet with Jewish students and speak to the media about what he calls the rising anti-Semitism on college campuses um would you agree that there is rising anti-Semitism I think anti-Semitism has no place on our campus we need to be very clear about that at the same time we need to be clear that advocating for palestin human rights is not in itself anti-semitic and I would encourage speaker Johnson to go to the camp to meet with protesters there many of whom were Jewish I saw them holding a Passover sedor there a few days ago um and I think if he's going to be speaking with Jewish students on campus you should make sure to speak with all of them that people resenting all of views on campus and the governor Kathy hokel has been here as well um there's been concerns raised about the National Guard being called in is that something that you're hearing what are what are students talking about feeling and are do you feel the commitment that they're going to stay um despite this 48 hour deadline the students many of them are committed to staying in the encampment there's been a lot of rumors swirling about the New York Police Department the National Guard coming back in um looking around it seems very difficult to justify that again these are students peacefully camping out on the lawn when I've been there most of the time they're studying and so the idea of calling in troops to a campus uh where again this is a peaceful protest just seems way above the mark in terms of what's Justified here the school has been very vague when they've raised security concerns about what it is they're talking about and it should be a very high bar bring in police on your own students awesome thank you so much for joining us and giving us the latest here I'm sure we'll talk to you again soon uh you heard it there from a lecture here at Columbia University this is where it all started this latest wave of college demonstrations that we're seeing expand across the country with uh the University of Texas uh holding a sit in uh the Brown University now also has an encampment on their campus uh and about a dozen others at least across the country now with Pro Palestinian rallies taking place Kristen Simi talking to us from New York
