hundreds of people have been taking part in a pro peace rally on the streets of Tel Aviv the demonstrators are calling for an immediate end to the war in Gaza it's been organized by standing together a Grassroots organization including Jewish and Palestinian Israeli citizens our correspondent Sara kyat is at the protest and asked standing together as co-director what they hoped to achieve we are moving from one city in the other in Israel Palestinians cities and Jewish cities in Israel and mixed cities in this um demand of us to end this war to achieve a ceasefire agreement that will allow to bring back the hostages the Israeli hostages from Gaza and that will end the killing of innocent people in Gaza we understand that this way of Wars one war after the other has achieved nothing it achieved only destruction and death and more hatred between the people and we are here to say that only a way of Israeli Palestinian peace ending the occup achieving a reality of equality and freedom and Independence to everyone on this land only this will achieve security to me as a Jewish Israeli Citizen and we here to say that we are combining our hands Palestinian citizens of Israel and Jewish citizens of Israel and only by working together we can build the power in our society to also change the society to also build what is necessary to be a majority that demands space here in Israel and Palestine and who do you think is actually going to be listening to this when polls in Israel are showing that there's an overwhelming support for uh the war in Gaza you already had some people heckling you uh just earlier saying shame on you we have troops being killed what do you what how much do you think you can achieve in getting that message how will you convince the masses uh for a political solution moving forward away from the deaths and destruction so we are growing the movement is growing standing together is a Grassroots uh Jewish Palestinian movement in Israel that has been growing since the war started because of our message of alternative to this war of Israeli Palestinian peace of ending the occupation and we understand that we cannot take the moral High ground and lecture you know to people and tell them no no no you're racist or you're fascist no we need to talk about also the interest of Israeli citizen to end occupation to achieve security this way of controlling millions of of people millions of people that are not Israeli citizens Palestinians living under the occupation of Israel cannot bring us security it can only bring us resistance and violence and we see where it led us well earlier on Thursday hundreds of young Israelis attended another rally near the knesset in West Jerusalem demanding the government do more to secure the return of captives being held in Gaza the protesters set out on a March from Tel Aviv on Sunday Israel says that mass is still holding 129 captives taken on October the 7th while all this is happening on the streets Israel's war cabinet has been meeting muham Salu joins us now from occupied East Jerusalem so as we say the cabinet is meeting do we know anything about the particular agenda for that meeting Israel's war cabinet convening this evening with a few items on the agenda the first is actually discussions for a katari proposal for a deal to release Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners now the mosad chief David Baria is said to be in this meeting to discuss the details of that proposal but also on the agenda what was supposed to be discussed this evening between prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his War cabinet they were supposed to talk about what's going to happen the day after the war as Israel refers to it quote the day after Hamas however there have been several objections among netanyahu's own Coalition within the government itself to have these discussions and Israeli media is now reporting that the Prime Minister has succumbed to that pressure and those discussions will not happen just yet but it was previously reported that these discussions were just supposed to be preliminary and no decisions were going to made there's been Fierce opposition by members of the far right specifically Ultra nationalists within netanyahu's government like bet smotr and itamar benir who have been against some of these policies that the war cabinet has been maintaining throughout this conflict SMR and benir are also not part of the makeup of the war cabinet and they had previously demanded to be part of it because they had been objecting to some of these decisions that Netanyahu and other officials were making but still they are not part of the war cabinet but they are still part of netanyahu's government Coalition and if they left that Coalition it could supposedly fall apart so there are a lot of different pressures Netanyahu is under but this evening there is internal political pressure between him and his own government H thanks very much indeed for that update the
