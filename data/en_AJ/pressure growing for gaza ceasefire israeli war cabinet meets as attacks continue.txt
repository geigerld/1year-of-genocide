thank you for joining us we begin in the Gaza Strip where Israeli attacks continue even as talks ramp up inside Israel and internationally around the latest plan to end the war a divided Israeli War cabinet is meeting to discuss the latest plan the US president has said it was proposed by Israel prime minister Benjamin netanyahu's far-right ministers have threatened to topple the government if he agrees to the deal in Cairo Egypt has told Israel that it must withdraw from the Rafa border crossing to allow it to operate again Israel took military control of the Crossing on the Palestinian side just over 3 weeks ago while Israel has banned Al jaer from reporting from there so we are joining Sarah hirat who is in Aman Jordan so some mixed messages from the Israeli cabinet about the plan to end the war Sarah are we likely to hear a definitive response after this cabinet meeting today certainly Folly we know that they're discussing this deal at the moment that's certainly what uh the Israelis are saying and we have been hearing from uh people in the government in the last couple of days since Joe Biden put that proposal forward uh first of all saying that it was an Israeli plan because there was some confusion as to whether this something was that the US had pushed or whether the Israelis had pushed this forward but also uh the Israelis saying the Israeli government of course and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu uh that they will there will be no permanent ceasefire at all until they get rid of Hamas however they have also said that they have agreed to this three-part phase plan which was they're saying was one of their ideas um and also they're saying that in those first six weeks of this uh ceasefire deal if it was to happen of course um they would negotiate with Hamas and then potentially go on to the second deal but at the same time they're saying that they have to get rid of them completely not just militarily but as a governing body in the Gaza strips I'm not sure how they expect to do that in 6 weeks however we have heard from the defense minister y Galan who's been saying uh that they are much weaker Hamas and that they continue their operations in ra but take a listen to what he had to say because this is crucial the security establishment under my instructions is preparing the governing alternative to Hamas while we will isolate areas remove Hamas operatives from these areas and introduce other forces that will enable an alternative government that will also threaten Hamas well as you heard there he's talking about isolating areas and then he said that they will remove Hamas people from there and introduce forces in into that instead who are those people we still don't know and this has been the big biggest uh problem that not only avalant has had with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu but also War cabinet me me but Benny Gant who put an ultimatum saying that you have to have a postwar plan but also International pressure because they feel that the Israelis don't have a plan they keep on talking about getting rid of Hamas but what next that's the biggest uh question and certainly uh some confusion it seems as to this deal whether it will take place or not and even if it does take place will they ever get to phase two it seems unlikely according to the Israelis thank you Sarah for that Sarah hyat reporting their live from Aman Jordan because again the Israeli government has banned Al jazer from reporting from inside Israel so we have to do it from outside the country well let's now speak to Gideon Levy who's a columnist with the Israeli Daily Newspaper haret he joining us from Tel Aviv thank you so much for being with us asara said there a great deal of confusion from Israeli leaders why is that the case the Americans are insisting that this was an Israeli plan all along why is a nany government not owning up to it there is something very enigmatic in the air ever since Friday evening and I guess that we don't know the full story or there is no Story the fact is that President Biden claimed that the plan that he had represented is an Israeli plan proved by Benjamin nany nany speaks ever since then in two voices one in English one in Hebrew and in both cases he's very vain he's not very clear about the the right Wingers said immediately obviously that if n will agree to this plan there is no government so I think netan is being pushed now to the moment of truth in which he will have to decide yeah continuing the Bloodshed continuing the war or continuing this government and what do you think is likely to decide as you said there's a great deal of pressure on him uh Benny Gant as we've heard has threatened to quit the Coalition if he didn't agree to day after plan for Gaza but the extreme farri right members of his party are also uh threatening to quit I mean can the current Israeli government survive if Netanyahu accepts the steal and if he rejects it then what happens it can survive for the short run but netan is thinking for the long run if to judge netan until now he will choose his career over the benefit for its own country for his own country and he will reject the deal I don't see him stopping the war now and without stopping the war there is no deal let's face it I don't see him doing it what about the pressure from Washington uh you know we we've heard uh Netanyahu has been invited to speak to the US Congress in Washington everyone wants him to accept this deal in Washington not not just the Biden Administration but also the powerful Jewish Lobby APAC do you think that might make a difference if this external pressure from Washington ramps up I don't know about what pressure are you talking about he just gets benefits he's invited to the Congress what kind of pressure Biden had a wonderful plan on Friday night presented a real wonderful plan it was just missing one sentence and the sentence should have been if Israel says no arms delivery to Israel will stop at one but he didn't say and therefore I don't see any American pressure I see advises I see very soft words through Israel and Israel is continuing with its War well certainly a very pessimistic Outlook you paint there thank you so much Gideon Levy for talking to us on AES here thank you fory make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
