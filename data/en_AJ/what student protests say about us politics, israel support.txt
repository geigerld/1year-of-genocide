well student-led protests and encampments against the war in Gaza are continuing for a second week in the US they demanding their universities drop Financial ties to Israel we have a team of correspondents covering the story for us in the US in a moment we'll be live in New York with John hendin and with Phil lval in Chapel Hill North Carolina but first let's go to Ellen Fischer who was at the George Washington University in Washington DC where students from at least eight universities have joined a fourth day of protests and Ellen's usually uh uh quiet there on campus on a Sunday but that's certainly not the case there today well it it's quiet at the moment simply because there have been afternoon prayers and what we saw were people who are Muslim coming out for the prayers but also being surrounded by a protective Cordon of the hundreds of people that have come here of course it's the camp behind me that you can see uh where they set up a camp in the very early hours of Thursday morning and they've now been here going into 4 days joining me live now is Sophie who is one of the students who was here right at the start and is still in the camp first of all Sophie what are conditions like for for you guys in the camp and in the tents yeah so right now we've stayed strong we are barricaded off by Metro Police and the GW Administration so we have been told that once we leave we are not allowed back um so we are stuck with in half of University yard right now but we have wonderful tents honestly we have had so many resources coming in from the community we have food everyone's been saying they've been eating the best they've had in in a while here we have for the hot weather like many things we have um a medic tent the administration is not allowing a medic to actually come in now um and be there for the students but we have Medics outside on the streets with the community we have just a an amazing amount of resources inside we've seen from the the University Administration that they've suspended some students that they've threatened others that they could lose their housing or possibly not even graduate how big a decision is that for you when it comes to deciding whether you stay or whether you go yes University repression has been just absolutely horrible but every student in here is so committed to our demand and to telling the world that all eyes must be on Gaza right now and that we are here for the liberation of the Palestinian people and what is a suspension what is a an arrest when there's a genocide happening we're all so committed here and I stand alongside my peers who have been suspended who have lost their housing their their food in like their security to food from the University and everyone here has the same we're all in it together and there's just like such an inspiring bring level of commitment within the encampment Sophie I know it's not an easy decision to make uh to come and do these interviews but we appreciate you joining us live here in Al this afternoon thanks very much indeed that's Sophie who a student one of the we think about a dozen or so people who are who are still in the camp here at George Washington University and all of those like Sophie are saying they are not leaving until their demands are met by the university and people are aware across the world of what's going on in Gaza okay thanks so much Ellen Ellen Fisher for us there at George Washington University let's stay with the story and bring in John hendin now who is at City University in New York and John this protest site in particular remains under constant threat of being shut down can you just explain exactly why that is okay so what is the Nar that's right that's part of The New Normal here these camps are becoming more or less uh permanent structures you can see right now there's a teaching on there are Orthodox Jewish people here who are in support of the protest and they have established this camp in part by keeping police out and they keep out anyone who is not a part of this protest they recently ejected a an Israeli Army soldier who had said that he he had been in Gaza fighting for Israel tried to engage the crowd and they tossed him out as for the police presence I'll show you why that's such a concern if you look over there you can see that's a police light pole it's a portable one they can put up there's one at each end of the street and that's in case police want to come in here and sweep the area you can see campus police in the background in that car they they're a constant presence but when they approach here the students form a line and they do not allow them to cross that line so they've so far kept campus police out the is that because this is a City University the mayor Eric Adams who has been critical of the protesters could call in police and sweep this area and that's what the students are concerned about so far that hasn't happened but it is the constant threat every day here at this Camp okay thanks so much John John hindan for us there at City University in New York well we're going to go to Phil LEL who joins us from Chapel Hill Inc where local activists and supporters will join University of North Carolina students for a rally at their encampment first of all can you just explain how large that protest has has grown so far there well you know in the last few minutes actually it started to grow fairly substantially and we're expecting over the next hour two hours for somewhere in the region of as many as 500 people according to organizers made up of those who are here already also activists also people from other universities because this is being quite heavily promoted on social media let me just show you what's here now I mean these people here this is not a spring popup uh protest these people have been here now since Friday they actually have been given permission by the university to stay here but there is one caveat and that is they are not allowed to erect tents because that then violates University policy some students have got around that got around the letter of the rules by erecting the tents but not putting the roofs on or they've put out full blowup mattresses with pillows and they're very much saying that they will stay here for as long as they want and there are three universities involved in this you've got the University of North Carolina here in Chapel Hill you've got students at Juke University nearby and North Carolina State University in Raleigh and I'm going to bring in one of the activists now Tamer uh Tamer thanks very much for joining us uh if you move position for me just explain to me first of all what is it that you guys feel is the end like what what would you want to achieve we want to achieve more of a communic uh Coalition building and getting the word out we explain to the University of North Carolina admissions uh the administration our demands and we've been very clear about them but we were not listened we were not met as a Palestinian American woman who is from Gaza and who has lost over 350 people I am tired we want to make an impact we have people around the Raleigh Community Chapel Community Greensboro everyone coming around and saying divest divest from supporting Israel products divest from funding um Israel um like study abroad divest from taxing from Israel because because we can't get free uh school or free healthare but Israel can get all these things I for one as a student I have student loans that I need to pay and I always wonder what what am I going to do with them if I'm not able to have the same like opportunities as you know Israel has like free healthare and free um schooling and you mentioned some of those local universities but we're seeing like scenes played out at universities across the country what kind of support are you drawing for them and are you in touch with the other universities yes we are we have our national SJP um chats we are in touch through social media and Instagram um we work closely with our River Duke University um and we also work with North Carolina State University we are despite all of our like you know differences we work together to build Coalition um we lean on each other we help each other out we are we bring food we provide supplies um something that happened in the very first day that was very momental is that we had Muslim Students praying um our ritual prayers we had Jewish Services it was um Passover and the next following day it was Setter so we were all engaging together so change we need to start changing the narrative that this encampment is not anti-semitic we have people who are from the triangle Jewish voice for peace we have people who are rabbis religious leaders who are also ad advocating for um a ceasefire and for a free Palestine because this is not just a genocide that is going on for 100 days these are kids like like I said I am from pza I have families that are affected and just doing this encampment is just an example of if we can stay for 3 Days laying on the floor with silian bugs and itchiness then we can extend the same gratitude as people who are in Rafa who are are not able to get any form of Sanitation who are not able to even eat not even to have a proper bread these are the things that we need to look for and to use as an example from especially in the UNCC campus that despite all the Privileges that are happening in our campuses we can set aside and Camp indoor outdoor sorry thank you very much for that I really appreciate it so that is the situation here at Chapel Hill uh but as I say the protest is expected to get underway in around about 2 hours and up to 500 people expected here okay thanks so much
