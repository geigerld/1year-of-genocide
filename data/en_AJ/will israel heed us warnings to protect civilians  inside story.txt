the Israeli Army has been expanding its attacks in Central and Southern Gaza nearly two months into this conflict the US has used some of its strongest language to date warning Israel to protect civilians but just how long can this war go on for and what would a victory look like this is Inside Story [Music] hello there and welcome to the program I'm Laura Kyle Israel's military has resumed its fullscale attack on the Gaza Strip launching air strikes on hospitals and crowded residential areas nearly 16,000 Palestinians have now been killed since early October that figure is Rising by the hour The Limited number of Aid trucks going into the strip and nowhere near enough to meet the needs of millions of desperate people and after nearly two months of War Israel's biggest Ally appears to be changing its tone and warning against civilian deaths in Gaza US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin says Israel risks a strategic defeat if it doesn't do more to protect civilians it's a sentiment being shared by other senior us officials so what's behind this sudden warning from Washington we'll put that to our guests in just a moment first this report from f a clear warning to Israel from its most important Ally us defense secretary Lloyd Austin made his concerns clear if Israel doesn't do more to prevent civilian deaths in Gaza its war is doomed to fail in the long run you see in this kind of a fight the center of gravity is the civilian population and if you drive them into the arms of the enemy you replace a tactical Victory with a strategic defeat so I have repeatedly made clear to Israel's lead leaders that protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza is both a moral responsibility and a strategic imperative just days earlier the US Secretary of State also urged Israel to adjust its strategy more than 15,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza and shortages of essential supplies are making life there nearly impossible I made clear that after the pause it was imperative that Israel put in place clear protections for civilians uh and for sustaining humanitarian assistance uh going forward while Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted his forces have failed to minimize civilian deaths he places the blame on Hamas Israel accuses the armed group of placing its military assets in civilian buildings without providing much evidence Hamas wants to kill as many Israelis as possible and has no regard whatsoever to Palestinian lives every day they perpetrate a double War crime targeting our civilians while hiding behind their civilians embedding themselves in the civilian population and using them as human Shields Israel's bombing campaign has reduced entire neighborhoods to rebel and displaced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians many in the International Community including the UN Secretary General have called on Israel to rethink its strategy and do more to protect civilians now with the US its closest Ally joining the chorus it's not clear yet if Israel will change its tactics vincon Mahan for Inside Story well let's bring in our guests now and in rala Bushra khi policy lead in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel at Oxfam in Brussels Elijah mager military and political analyst and in Cairo Hussein haridi a former assistant foreign minister of Egypt a very warm welcome to all of you Elijah magir these are some of the strongest or are the strongest warnings for Israel to protect civilians that we've heard publicly from the US why are we hearing them now I think it's very interesting to hear that the Americans are taking some distance of what Israel is committing as violating International laws and obvious crimes against humanity and war crimes it is something very good to hear the Israel the American officials saying that the Israelis cannot continue killing civilians and they have to be careful how to bomb Gaza so that is first of all an acknowledgement that Israel is in indeed killing civilians and the result is we have 16,000 people killed of which 70 to 80% are civilians secondly it is why the Americans are saying it and if that uh serves some purposes now it is not serving any purpose because the Israelis continue the war if it this is going to put an end to the military operation it is not obviously because yesterday was the most intensive bombardment on Gaza and what is the final purpose and to my view the final purpose is more of a presidential us campaign because there is no strict position that the Americans is taking to tell the Israelis that they have to stop their war on children and women because this is the only tactical victory that they have achieved so far Hussein haridi as a former Ambassador and from your time in the Egyptian foreign Ministry you've got uh experience of the Diplomatic Machinery between the US and Israel how far do you think Israel is likely to Heed These Sterner warnings from the us at the outset Madame let me express my uh my my solidarity with the Palestinian resistance and with the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and my thoughts and the thoughts of many Egyptians the majority of Egyptians go out for the more than 16,000 Palestinians who died who have died under the Israeli bombardment having said so I guess uh in the not far distant future the Israeli War cabinet would have to listen would have to heed the messages the latest messages coming out of fton whether on the part of you the United States President Joe Biden or the Secretary of State uh Tony blinkin or lately uh General Le Austin the uh the Secretary of Defense I guess the message is coming out of Washington are loud and clear We Are One Step we are one step away from the American Administration calling for a ceas fire when will now the the the question is not whether it would call for a ceasefire but the question is uh probably when it will do so my personal take on the on the positions uh of the senior American officials is that we could in the next few weeks uh hear the world ceasefire coming out of washon okay let's let's just get Elijah back on on that one point there do you agree that we're one step away from the US calling for a ceasefire because that's certainly not on the table at the moment yes we are very far from ceasefire because the israelies haven't achieved any of their objectives this is why I call a so far the Israelis facing a tactical defeat because they claim they have occupied 40% of north of Gaza of which half of it is an open air agriculture terrain secondly we've seen how the Palestinian resistance are inflicting heavy casualties on the Israeli occupation forces and third we've seen every single day the Palestinian resistant capable of bombing different cities and Villages including Tel Aviv and that happened this morning and also we have seen how the release of the captives happen in the heart of the north of Gaza where the Palestinian resistance is not yet in direct contact on daily basis with the Israelis because the Israelis are too afraid to be in contact in a dense area against the Palestinian resistance so achieve a calling for a ceasefire now we are so far away because that means a total defeat for bamin Netanyahu for his right-wing government who threaten to uh offer a resignation if he doesn't invade all of Gaza and kill all Palestinians and then he will go directly to jail it is in the advantage of Netanyahu to continue this war he Express the all differences with the Americans because the Americans understand that this way has exposed the weakness of what used to be called the strongest army in the Middle East and it turned out that a bunch of Palestinian resistant confronting this tremendous Army that is capable of bombarding has a tremendous Firepower but is afraid to confronting the Palestinian resistance on the ground so okay Elijah I'll get back to uh the state of the battlefield in just a moment before we get to uh bog down in that I want to bring in Bushra because we need to get a very clear picture of what we're actually talking about when the US is warning to protect civilians how much civilians need these kind of warnings for Israel to do more Bushra since the ceasefire broke down on Friday we've seen some of the most intense fighting in Gaza and air strikes on the south can you bring us up to speed with what the people there are suffering what they're having to put up with um I first want to talk about the sense of safety that has been completely eroded um namely in children because children form part of half of gaza's population um and and and this sense of safety is eroded because of course it's already eroded from you know six previous military escalations living under a brutal isra you know illegal Siege uh collectively punishing you know uh an entire population for over 16 years uh but it's even more eroded because now uh they have been displaced once twice we know of colleagues who have been displaced up to six times um in the last eight weeks and and uh I have my own uh in-laws that are in Gaza and right now the worry is not just spending hours to find water spending hours to find food um trying to you know adapt to this new way of life with no electricity and no washing machines and no ovens and no gas stoves and no you know uh uh Gaza is you know is not is not was not the Middle Ages uh before the 7th of October it was yes very poor and people definitely depended on aid but people were not uh you know uh making bread in in over wood fires and heating water over wood fires so you know on top of adapting to this new way of life people are having to worry about when is my turn to leave again and and and even my nephews are talking about Mom can you make us a backpack with our stuff on our own um because we never know what happen something might happen to you and I don't want you to have my things with you you know and and he's seven years old so that is the the the the maturity that we're forcing children into uh in Gaza uh and with these uh multiple evacuation orders with nowhere safe to go and with a completely collapsed um uh wash system uh no electricity and no calm lines I think the the mental health aspect Beyond being hungry and thirsty is also something that now is beginning to show um with people just really losing hope and Bush people are being told by the Israeli military to move further and further south this is 1.8 million people in the South already so many of them displaced from the north they've moved two three four times already moving further south towards Rafa towards the crossing towards the border with Egypt what exists in that area for them what infrastructure what shelter what food what water well we're talking about 60% of the entire Gaza Strip um uh being bombarded what we've seen over the last four days we're talking about carpet bombing of entire neighborhoods we already have reports back of wash infrastructure being completely damaged um uh uh shelters having been struck over the weekend as well both in the north and in the South um and and a non-operational health sector I mean we cannot say that the current hospitals that are in the South that are partially operating our operating Health System it's not um uh squeezing people into a place that's uh B basically as big as London Heathrow Airport we're talking about 1.8 million people in an airport just so that I can kind of paint the picture to people who don't really understand how small Gaza is um it's already overp populated it's actually inhumane and actually uh not only makes it impossible to deliver Aid to 1.8 million people in one place uh it's much actually easier when you have shelters all around and different distribution points because you relieve the pressure of one um but you increase the the the risk of disease that which we're already saying where there's already reports of colera uh gastroenteritis is uh spread like wildfire in Gaza right now people are have been sick for the last month my family has been sick and are not getting better because conditions are not allowing for them to get better and squeezing people into into that basically it does not absolve Israel of its um duties and obligation under International actually in fact it is it could amount to a serious violation or serious grave breach of inter humanitarian law forcing people uh into a small uh uh place and also historically just want to add one point historically these kind of safer spaces um or safe zones or you know humanitarian areas as they've been dubbed in the last couple weeks actually have brought more harm onto civilian population than actually meeting their needs so okay it's it's extremely concerning and and husin as you see people being pushed closer and closer to R to this southern part of Gaza which borders Egypt what is the conversation in Cairo as you see this movement of people well of course here in Egypt there is near certainty than one of the uh objectives of the Israeli military campaign or or aggression against Gaza is to push the Palestinians to towards Sinai m and on the other hand the same is taking place in the West Bank in light of the uh harassment by the settlers against the Palestinians everywhere in the West Bank uh to the extent that they have been uh issuing PL pamphlets warning the Palestinians that second nagba is on the way so here in Egypt here in Egypt uh the majority believe that this is the next move on the part of the Israelis the long-term objective of this war against is the Palestinians in Gaza and in the West Bank is to push the Palestinians uh towards Sinai from Gaza and would the Egyptian government would Abdul Fat Al CI ever accept that no uh of course uh for the last eight weeks Egypt uh has has has has been in talks with the American Administration and uh warning against uh the forced displacement of the Palestinians and the American Administration has adopted and has supported the Egyptian position and and and we keep the Egyptian government uh keep saying keep repeating its warning that it won't accept the force displ displacement of the Palestinian towards Sinai Elijah let me just bring you in there because it does seem that we are getting warnings from all sides for Israel not to act in certain ways but Israel doesn't seem to be paying any attention what leverage can be brought to Israel either from Egypt or the us or any of the other countries that are currently giving it a green light this is a very excellent questions actually all the Arab countries are doing virtually nothing to support the Palestinians apart from talking and rejecting what's happening and Israel understands that there is no weight from the Arab countries who have a lot of strength force and leverage cost to play against Israel and against the Americans to force a ceasefire to open a border all the Arab countries were not able to bring through Egypt the RAF Crossing one single truck without the approval of the Israelis who are counting trucks and Counting how many trucks what in the trucks and where these trucks can go and to whom so we have seen the position of the Arab countries extremely weak to the point that there is no cut of total relationship with Israel we only have seen recall of ambassadors that the Israelis understand that at the end of the war all these ambassadors will return to their functions we have actually seen an extremely shy reaction let's let Hussein uh have a chance to respond to that what's your response to Elijah's comments that Arab countries are doing nothing and in particular why can't Egypt open and control the Raffa Crossing itself well we we do do exercise on the Rafa Crossing uh unimpeded uh it's it's a we we are applying our sovereignty on the RAF crossing the Egyptian side of the RAF Crossing because the RAF Crossing has two sides the Palestinian and the Egyptian one so why why are the Israelis so much in charge there then well uh the the the Israelis do shs in order to prevent of course this is an excuse to prevent the smuggling of weapons inside Gaza but did you agree with those checks at this point in time given how much they slow up the amount of Aid that is reaching Gaza as we've heard from Bushra people desperately need more Aid to get in but it is these Israeli checks that are stopping that that's that's right that's right Madam and and that's why we in our uh diplomatic conversation with the American Administration we keep insisting we keep insisting on the absolute need to increase humanitarian assistance to to Gaza to to Gaza and in fact the Americans uh the Americans have positively uh responded to our request and they have promised before the of course the uh resumption of hostilities in Gaza uh they or they talked about not not less than 100 trucks would uh enter uh the Rafa Crossing on a daily basis so our diplom our diplomatic contacts with the American Administration uh is continuing and of course as we as we have witnessed in the last few days the American position Visa the overall situation in the Gaza Strip is evolving and we have noticed that it's it's evolving I'll buy it very slowly it's evolving if I may use this term in the direction that we would like to steer it let's just bring Bushra back into this conversation to again bring this discussion to events on the ground as you can hear from Hussein and the reality is that the tone towards the war towards Israel is evolving but it's evolving slowly it it can't evolve slowly there is no time for an evolution and there's no time for Promises of trucks what needs to happen now I mean the who said that we are at the brink of an epidemic that might kill more people than bombs have um so you know and it's not just about the trucks and the trucks you know is a a small need it's a need but it's about the crossings in Israel being open it's about restoring water it's about restoring electricity from Israel into the strip bringing in trucks of Aid and some flour and some water and some blankets is not enough and does not meet the current needs um in Gaza we're talking about I I I I said it 60% of Gaza being um uh FL into Rubble we're talking about almost 10,000 bodies under the rubble who are you know what about you know buring those um relatives and family members and fathers and mothers um roads are completely damaged even in terms of delivering the aid through truck um is is is a challenge inside we're also having checks inside Gaza um by uh armed troops so uh you know we're in in there's a principle of unfettered humanitarian access um in international law uh all of these are fettered uh to our access as humanitarians were not even allowed in to carry out assessments um to carry out uh repairs uh there's a lot of materials that are not allowed in uh very simple materials like the sheets of a wash latrine that we're trying to get in that's not that's been restricted so it every every obstacle and it's much too slow it's not enough um and really it's it's it's like I said eroding the sense of hope and and safety in Gins and the long-term impact of that uh is also something that we should be considering um you know let's bring back Elijah at this point because I want to get back to what the US Secretary of State Lloyd Austin said he said that the that Israel risks strategic defeat if it doesn't protect civilians more what does strategic defeat look like to my mind it is already a strategic defeat a bunch of Palestinian resistance in Gaza managed to stop the almighty Israeli occupation forces at the Gate of Gaza in a very tiny geographic area and at the end of the day it's not bad that the Arabs are not interfering because it seems that the Palestinians can manage on their own to challenge the Israeli Army this is already something that the Americans are fully aware of because they thinking in a cool head they understand that the Israelis in 50 days did not manage to occupy and control because they need to control it 20% of the uh residential area of Northern Gaza that is a strategic defeat that Israel has lost his image in the whole world and it shows how when you have determined people to stand against the occupation forces no matter how brutal they are Israel has managed in it in its war against the children and the women but not against the men of the Palestinian resistance okay Ambassador har haridi do you believe that Israel has already suffered a strategic defeat or is there time for a turnaround well I guess after almost almost eight weeks of uh constant bombardment uh with the exception of the 7day PS that ended the last Friday they haven't the Israeli AR Army has failed to achieve the objectives that Israel announced or the Israeli Prime Minister had announced on October 7th and he keeps repeating them namely the destruction of Hamas the release of the hostages and to make sure that the Gaza Strip would who then pose a threat to Israeli security nothing nothing of these objectives uh has been realized so far and so the Israelis are in a dilemma and uh they cannot speak of of achieving military Victory after eight weeks of uh nonstop bombardment and the their tanks entering some major cities in in the Gaza Strip so of course the Palestinian resistance the Palestinian resistance is is is showing determination and Sh we have to leave our discussion today uh uh Hussein hii apologies for interrupting your final answer there but we definitely
