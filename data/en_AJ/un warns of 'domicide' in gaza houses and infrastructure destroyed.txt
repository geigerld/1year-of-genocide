gaza's Main Court destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes destroyed dozens of hospitals and nearly 300 schools also all destroyed the United Nations says the systematic destruction of homes infrastructure and everything you need to live amounts to what's called domicide there are two elements to the campaign in Gaza number one you you make the place unlivable by pretty much destroying everything creating only rubble and then secondly you forcibly move people what can that actually indicate well that indicates that there is an intention to actually eliminate those people from that space more than 100 government buildings have been destroyed in Israel's bombardment of Gaza the loss of thousands of documents such as land Registries combined with the bombing of homes jeopardize people's rights to housing land and property with consequences for years to come and many of these records from what I understand actually date back from the ottoman period so I'm very concerned about that these are unnecessary destruction that in international law can only be called as want destruction it's a form of looting part of domicide really in any War when Amar AO a researcher at Oxford University has experienced domicide firsthand in his own City holes in Syria it's also about a lifetime uh struggle and loss so it is about the infrastructure it is about the way of living it is about uh the dignity and the um the belonging and the memory of this community in a place so it's in in a way about erasing all these memories and presence of a certain Community Aus says it can take decades to rebuild after domicide but also to come to to terms with the grief of what was lost especially when places where people once gathered studied or married are gone behind every broken Stone there's a life there's a story there's a family there's a member and I want you to think that this buildings are not only about the physical it's about the people the community their livelihoods Israel's military says it's necessary to destroy buildings as this is the only way to destroy Hamas and it will take several more months but International observers say there is no evidence that Hamas Fighters were in most of the buildings it's bombed and if the devastation continues at this level Gaza may be left completely uninhabitable Imaging Kima alaz make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
