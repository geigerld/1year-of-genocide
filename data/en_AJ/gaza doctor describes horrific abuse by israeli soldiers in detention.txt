[Music] drone an Israeli soldier used a drone camera to check the building before entering as the Drone was flown inside he caught me on camera he told me to come down he examined my ID and all was fine he ordered me to strip then I found myself surrounded by more than 70 Israeli soldiers they blindfolded me and beat and battered me from all Directions They marked an x on my head to mean I'm a Hamas fighter hiding among patients at hospital I found medical staff on the floor naked handcuffed and blindfolded marks of torture and whipping were clearly visible on their backs Israeli soldiers took me to the second floor I found a chair like an execution chair they hung wires from the ceiling they kept assaulting and verbally abusing Mech they spilled food and ketchup on me they hit me with rifle stocks they put me in a corner I was blindfolded and handcuffed Israeli soldiers smashed glass bottles on my head my leg was injured in two places by the broken glass the wounds needed seven stitches then I was moved with other GS and detainees they brought bulldozers and told us you are going to hell we thought the Israeli soldiers were going to bury us but they wanted to frighten us they sprayed us with freezing water on our nak bodies 3 or 4 hours later we moved again on the third day an Israeli officer stopped me because my blindfold was about to fall off then he made me face the wall for 4 hours an Israeli soldier dragged me onto the floor by my handcuffs and hit me with a bat on I heard my arm snapping
