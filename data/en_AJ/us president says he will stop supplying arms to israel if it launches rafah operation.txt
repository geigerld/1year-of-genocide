let's bring you some more now on those comments made by the US president about weapon shipments uh to Israel uh bringing in Heidi Joe castran our correspondent in Washington DC and Heidi uh obviously uh significant comments from the US president he's under a great deal of pressure isn't he from outside of the US and from within it absolutely this this marks a significant shift in the Biden Administration and the US foreign policy toward Israel in that Biden has just told CNN uh that the the continuation of us Aid of uh artillery shells bombs for fighter jets and other offensive weapons is contingent on whether Israel invades the city of Rafa he said that if that goes forth the US will stop supplying those things to Israel that is a a significant turn of events and like you said so yes Biden has been under significant uh pressure knowing uh just how many civilians are Sheltering in Rafa but we also saw this sort of being paved by cabinet members Lloyd Austin the Austin the uh us defense secretary was on Capitol Hill today telling us the Senate appropriation committee uh that the US was indeed pausing at least one shipment of Munitions that happened last week uh he said that there had not been a final determination on whether that pause would be lifted but he also said that other future Munitions deliveries were being considered for perhaps slow walking so these are definitely hurdles that the US Administration is putting in the way between the US weapons getting to Israel and now those words from President Biden himself saying that if Israel again invades the city of Rafa that the US will stop supplying it with those offensive weapons and Heidi it's interesting that you know he should sit down with a major US broadcaster to be so clear about what he's wants to say uh about Israel let me just give one of the quotes you know he says bombs that the United States has supplied to Israel and now paused have been used to kill civilians it's such that is such a huge statement to make I mean we know that he's been against an incursion into Rafa we've heard that from blink we've now heard it again from the Secretary of Defense but to say that the bombs that the US are supplying have been used against civilians is fuel to the fire of Civil Society globally who have all been very critical of the American support for Israel absolutely and that exact turn of phrase that it's us made bombs that are dropping on civilians in Rafa those are the chant that we've been hearing at these protests that are on us college campuses and that have erupted in major US cities even prior to these campus protests so yes you know for for all until now Biden has been peppered with questions from reporters from protesters about when that would ever change and he always sort of dodged those questions he always professed this Ironclad alliance between the US and Israel which by the way was again affirmed today by the US defense secretary the alliance itself is not in question but
