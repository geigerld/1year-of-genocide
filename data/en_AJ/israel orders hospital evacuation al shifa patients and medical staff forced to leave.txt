these Medics were trained to treat patients now many of them are also victims in these dfield wars they are trying to move hundreds of patients because they say Israel ordered them to leave the hospital an allegation Israel has denied most of the patients are in critical condition the medical workers say they are suffocating because of smoke from the continued attacks while they are trying to evacuate they simply don't know where to go because there is no safe place in Gaza so infants and newborn babies are left without oxygen it is nothing but a medieval cave it is no longer a hospital the occupation forces draw the Medical Teams out of the hospitals on the road I can see very appalling scenes dozens of dead bodies scattered all over the road we can't walk among the dead bodies for more than 6 weeks these scenes have been a daily occurence as Israel's Relentless bombardment of residential areas and hospitals continues after days of bombing the hospital's vicinity Israel raided it and released this video with no substantial evidence supporting the Israeli claim of Hamas using the hospital as a quote Command Center but 8 days of constant attacks on the hospital has killed at least 51 patients including four premature babies the fourth newborn baby was killed this morning he died and I myself buried him in the mass grave of the hospital's yard he was one of the last Fallen Martyrs Israel also bombed the hospitals outpatient Children's Clinic most of the death are children and women in this Relentless bombardment the Medics have been forced to do the impossible leave the hospital and leave their patients behind medical staff and all those inside the hospital were forced to leave in a single line waving White Flags before we left we did all we can we left some solutions other IV injection for the remaining patients we hope they will be evacuated many of the victims moved from the north of Gaza to the South an area declared safe by Israel but the attacks came to the South too with no fuel and no electricity dozens of hospitals attempted to withstand the devastating Israeli attacks 651 people have now left Al shifa hospital they hope to be moved to makeshift hospitals but more than 100 who were unable to move due to their critical condition including dozens of infants are left behind with only a few medical workers many wonder if any of them will survive R SAR Al jazer make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
