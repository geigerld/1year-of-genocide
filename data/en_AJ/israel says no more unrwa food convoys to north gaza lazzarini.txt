the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees says Israel will no longer allow their food convoys from entering Northern Gaza where people are dying of hunger director General Philipe lazarini released a statement on the social media platform X stating that the Israeli authorities have informed the UN that they will no longer approve any unua food convoys to the north of Gaza unua has called the decision outrageous and says Israel is making it intentional to obstruct life-saving assistance during a man-made famine meanwhile in a statement the director general of the World Health Organization says blocking unra from delivering food is in fact a nine starving people the ability to survive this decision must be urgently reversed all efforts to deliver food should not only be permitted but there should be an immediate acceleration of food deliveries let's speak now to Sam Rose who's a director of planning at un joins us live from Aman so this order by Israel to not allow any un convoys through to give Aid to uh potentially starving people what are the implications of this the implications are dramatic uh coming after five and a half months of a of a Relentless War the uh an independent Authority warned last week of of imminent famine people are already dying of starvation up in up in the north and this is essentially a death sentence on many of of those people uh I'm here in Rafa not in am man and the situation the bombings are Relentless everywhere but but the situation conditions particularly harsh in the northern Gaza Street where we estimate there are about 250,000 people who've been trapped there for about five and a half months unra is the by far the largest Aid organization inside Gaza so blocking unra from delivering up there as I say just worsens the conditions and is a deliberate obstruction as my B said the commissioner general of un a deliberate obstruction of life- saving assistance uh for a population that is already facing famine and starvation so simp simply more people will die of course you you have had incredibly limited access anyway so I guess this is Israel doubling down on a policy already in place right a policy already in place to restrict access to humanitarian access to the north but we have now been informed explicitly that unro missions to the north we had three planned this week I myself was due to be on one this morning we've been told explicitly now uh that those missions will not be coordinated so that means less Aid trucks fewer Aid trucks to the starving people of Northern Gaza the gravity of the situation is such that the entire Aid Community has to work together to get as much Aid into Northern Gaza as possible and taking unra away from that you're taking the largest actor away from that equation so you starve unra you starve Gaza so we have a situation where we have huge vast quantities of Aid just sitting there and it's really a matter of mere kilometers away from thousands of starving people absolutely there are problems on the border with Egypt there are hundreds of trucks that are stuck there but literally those trucks are are kilometers away on the other side of the border the Eastern side of the Border we have supermarkets we have hydroponic Farms we have all the food all the nutrients all the minerals all the vitamins that we need to put a stop to this when you say people are essentially dying how close do you understand people there are to reaching starvation to actually dying now people people are already dying of starvation we've I can't remember the exact figures but the numbers in the tens in the 20s this situation is already extremely serious it's very very catastrophic reducing the amount of Aid that is getting into the north will just make this situation far far worse and what has to happen here now do you think what has to happen is that there has to be uh pressure put on Israel to reverse this decision there has to be an immediate and a sustained increase in access to Northern Gaza to allow the humanitarian community incl including unra this isn't about unra but unra simply is by far the largest humanitarian organization inside Gaza the entire Aid Community working together to get as much Aid into Northern Gaza as quickly as possible if we do this we can stop this but if we don't do it we've been warning for months what would happen we're now starting to see it happen has Israel given any reason for its decision and tell us a little bit about what the process of approval is uh we are not aware of any reason for that decision we were we were informed three nights on the Run uh that that our mission to the north would not be approved for operational considerations we don't get much more than that but essentially every mission that the humanitarian Community inside Gaza plans for the north has to be communicated has to be coordinated has to be approved by the Israeli authorities to a minute level of of detail uh that happens typically about 24 hours before the missions are due to to happen and we get informed a couple of hours before whether or not it's going to go ahead so the trucks were ready the materials were ready I myself was ready our drivers were ready and we were stuck down are you getting any indication that that any pressure from the United States is is being put on Israel to try and enforce them to allow for more Aid in we are calling on all member states that have influence on Israel to put that pressure on they are the entities that can influence this the United Nations Secretary General was in Rafa yesterday he passed the same message on as of now we're not seeing it having any effect but it's AB absolutely urgent and critical it couldn't be more critical that this decision be reversed indeed all right Sam Rose we're going to leave it there Sam Rose the director of planning atra joining us from Rafa thank
