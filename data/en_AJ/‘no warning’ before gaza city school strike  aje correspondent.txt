Abu he's joining us live from there albala in central Gaza antartic deadly Israeli attacks across the strip killing both indiscriminately and also some targeted killings in the shatti refugee camp yeah that's right Elizabeth the Israeli occupation forces are stepping up the military land and aerial bombardment in the north of the strip in the central area and even F further south in the uh in the southern part of the strip but starting from the north of the strip which has been the theater for the latest Israeli strikes we are talking about an evacuation Center has been targeted it's called H ibraim H Mustafa H's school that has been a place where Palestinian displaced families have been heading to in order to seek some sort of Refuge in the western side of Gaza City we clearly remember that the Army has been attacking evacuation centers and schools in the northern part of the strip killing dozens of Palestinians but the latest attack has killed three Palestinians with patches of casualties being reported and transferred to the Baptist Hospital to get medical treatment but that is the Grim reality that this school has been the last resort for Palestinians in order to seek to seek to and to head to in order to afford themselves some sense of safety but the Israeli Army has targeted this scool without any sort of a prior warning till now the Army did not command on the incident and the attack has been carried out but also eyewitnesses there have confirmed that more air strikes have conducted in a zun neighborhood destroying a number of houses there and basically the the Loud bombardment by the Israeli artillery units could be clearly overhead from their Al balah town where the Army is operating in the Eastern areas of their Al balah but the Army as well has been scaling upscaling the military strikes in the southern part of the city of hunus where right now they they have been operating for for at least a week killing dozens of Palestinians one of the latest attacks has killed uh six Palestinians after their residential house was completely targeted and gaza's health Ministry and has said that at least more than 14 Palestinians have been killed since Dawn today as the bombardment continue to be overheard with no source of respite by by the way Elizabeth the Palestinians here are expecting clear surge of Earth strikes because the Army is still expanding its ground Invasion for the Central Area H hitting multiple refugee camps especially anarat and Al refugee camp in overnight strikes killing a Palestinian mother with its five children yeah it must be terrible ftic to be there and just expecting more strikes um even as these ceasefire negotiations are supposed to be taking place meanwhile T we're seeing reports that more Palestinians have been released from Israeli detention centers what are you hearing about their condition well in fact the uh around 33 Palestinians have been released today from Israeli detention camps and centers in Israeli territories and they have been transferred to the European and nassa Hospital in the city of Han un now uh uh clearly the traces of torture are quite clear on the bodies uh due to the very hard period they have spent in Israeli jails we have listened to what they have been saying uh in terms of the torture believing that they have been going through all sign of physical and psychological uh torture and on the hands of the Israeli officers uh especially and detectives they have been beat they have been brutally beaten by meal pars they have been handcuffed like fold dead and deprived from having access to the uh toilet and even getting a sufficient amount of food and water on daily basis and one of them has said that even when they have informed us that you will today be released they have been beaten on their way uh to the buses that will transfer them to the Gaza Strip so they are leaving a very dangerous uh psychological scars and the the minds of those uh Palestinian uh uh prisoners who were released today saying that other Palestinian prisoners who are still stuck behind the Israeli powers are going through the worst humanitarian conditions ever without any sort of mitigation in terms of the miserable humanitarian Behavior being practiced on them by the uh prisons Authority in Israeli uh territories and they believe that as long as the Israeli Army is still operating in Gaza more Palestinians will be arrested and they said that they were lucky today to be released because they have been dying in Israeli jails yeah we have to remember that them being release means that Israel doesn't see them as a threat in any way which begs many questions around why they were tortured in this way which are of course war crimes Thad thank you very much for your reporting as always that is Thad Abu aom joining us live from De Al Bala in central Gaza
