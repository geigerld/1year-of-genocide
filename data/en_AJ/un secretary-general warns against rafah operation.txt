head of the United Nations an Antonio GES warned that any military incursion into Rafa would have devastating consequences on the Palestinian people who'd first fled there for safety and under the instruction of the Israeli Army a military assault on Rafa would be an unbearable escalation killing thousands more civilians and forcing hundreds of thousands to flee it would have a devastating impact on Palestinians in Gaza with serious repercussions on the occupied West Bank and across the wider region all members of the security Cil and many other governments have clearly expressed their opposition to such an operation I appeal for all those with influence over Israel to do everything in their power to prevent it Gabriel alander joins us now live from the UN and the UN Secretary General with some clear and some might think strong words about Rafa yeah that's right of course he's saying as you just heard there it would be could lead to devastating consequences if Israel goes forward with this military operation in Rafa he said forcing as you just heard there hundreds of thousands of people to flee of course flee where that is the question I think the Secretary General knows the answer to that very well there is nowhere uh to flee to and nowhere safe in in Gaza that's something that he's repeated over and over and over again for months now I think the reason that you heard the Secretary General speak out uh today is because he clearly sees this being a critical moment as these talks continue for the release of captives and a cessation of hostilities that this is a very critical moment right now and that's why he wanted to lend his voice to this it's important to point out again The Wider context here the Secretary General does not speak to Benjamin n Yahoo uh the prime minister of Israel will not accept the secretary General's phone calls they have not even spoken once uh since October 7th it's not because the Secretary General doesn't want to speak to Netanyahu it's just simply that Netanyahu doesn't want to speak to him so this is the way that the Secretary General can speak to the wider world and he hopes that his message is heard uh everywhere that it will make an impact indeed uh the Secretary General was also very clear on a sort of De developing Story coming out of the Gaza Strip these issues of mass Graves which are now being uncovered yeah that's right he's clearly very concerned about this we've heard from the secretary General's spokesperson uh talking about concerns over this over the last week or so but this is the first time we've actually heard from the Secretary General himself uh and he cited 390 uh bodies reportedly being exuded from al- Nasser hospital and now the Secretary General clearly calling for what he said say an independent International investigation with forensic expertise to be allowed into Gaza uh immediately to begin this uh process of an investigation on this Mass Graves to see who is responsible the problem of course is Israel controls access to the Gaza Strip and without Israel's permission it uh is almost impossible to get experts in there but clearly uh the Secretary General is calling on an international inves ation the issue is Will Israel agree to it and open their borders to it and what can the Secretary General do to put pressure on Israel uh to accept some sort of international independent that's a key word independent investigation gab under there at unhq in New York thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
