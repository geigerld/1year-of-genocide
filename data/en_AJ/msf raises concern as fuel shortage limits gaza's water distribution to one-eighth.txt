and Christopher lock here is the Secretary General of Doctors Without Borders joins us live from Geneva good to have you with us so first of all we know that the icj ruling has said that the Rafa Crossing should be open that humanitarian Aid should be increased are you seeing any sign of the crossing being opened of compliance with that ruling no we're not and uh we've been warning about the catastrophe that would be an offensive in Rafa for months now but since the the closure of the effective closure or the total closure of the Rafa Crossing on the 7th of May we are seeing a further strangulation um of the Gaza Strip we're seeing a further Collective punishment to the people of Gaza it is becoming critical in terms of uh fuel supplies um we've had to reorganize our our hospitals since uh since the offensive started in Rafa including closing moving patients from hospitals in the Indonesian Rafa field Hospital the emirati hospital and and trying to relocate to to the nazza hospital in um in Rafa but it's becoming increasingly complicated there as we're finding supply of water uh critical we ourselves have had to are unable to um distribute as much water as we have been able to last week we were um we were Distributing around 400,000 liters of water and this week uh we're down to 50,000 lers of water so 1/8 of what we've been able to do because of the fuel shortages and today the reports are talking about Aid trunks coming through kamam Abu Salim from what we've seen so far does it look like all the aid that is needed will is coming through Karam Abu Salam what I would say in terms of Aid coming into Gaza that's the first step in the equation that's the first part of the equation it's also a question of being able to move Aid around in Gaza and it's also being able to if you are running hospitals like we or like we're trying to it's a question of being able to have electricity fuel water supply it's being able to uh be able to have staff that are healthy are safe are are mentally fit and physically fit to being able to to treat um patients and that's becoming ever increasing um ever complex problem when we come looking into this this horrific conflict which has been going on for months in Gaza now listening then to what you're saying would it be enough simply for Israel to end the offensive in Rafa if the conflict continues elsewhere in Gaza would that create the conditions you're talking about that and allow you to meet the needs of the population or do you feel that there needs to be a complete cessation of all offensive actions in Gaza well as a as an absolute minimum we need an immediate and sustained ceasefire we've been needing that for months but I would go back to I would go further than that and look back at at what the the icj said back on the 26th of of January and in particular as well as the protection of um civilians to make sure that the population of Gaza are not indiscriminately attacked we've also they also ruled at that time in terms of the immediate scale up of humanitarian assistance and that's yes moving uh supplies into an all round Gaza so I would argue that all Crossings into Gaza need to be open but then moving supplies around Gaza and being able to have a situation where you can have humanitarian Aid workers safely treat um people all around the Gaza Strip and we now well over 200 humanitarian workers who've been tragically killed since the start of this horrific conflict in comments posted on the 21st of May a former Israeli Prime Minister naali bannet said Israel has allowed 400,000 tons of food and Aid into Gaza an increase he says an increase of 30% since before the war now I've been listening to what you said today I've been reading the statements by your organization 3 days later on May the 24th that says quote essential humanitarian and Medical Aid has barely entered since the beginning of may do you see any evidence of an increase of 30% of humanitarian Aid and food entering Gaza since October the 7th no and let's let's take a step back here and what what we're what we're seeing here is um uh a battle of communication um as well let's be really clear since before um October 7th the number of trucks the amount of Supply coming into Gaza has reduced since May the 7th when the Raffa Crossing um uh has been uh has been closed we've seen an even further reduction of Supply coming into Gaza but I would reiterate um even though that is we're seeing a strangulation upon strangulation I would reiterate that it is more than just simply bringing trucks into the Gaza Strip humanitarian assistance is a really complex ecosystem of activities that we need to um we need to to legitimize throughout that whole chain it is not just about crossing the border it is about moving supplies around the Border it is about having humanitarian workers who are safe able to treat people able to distribute food safely and to be able to themselves have somewhere to live and we've just seen over the last uh the last few days since the the the raer offensive 900,000 people according to the UN again displacing after having made the horrific choice to have to displace towards uh rafar the alma wayy area having to displace yet again so this is much more than a false narrative about increasing supplies coming into the Gaza Strip thank you very much for giving us your perspective on that make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
