so we begin this newsour with breaking news as a second day of a Gaza ceasefire talks has just ended in Doha mediators from Qatar Egypt and the United States have released a joint statement they say the discussions were serious constructive and conducted in a positive atmosphere technical teams will work over the coming days on the details of implementation including arrangements for the comprehensive humanitarian components of the agreement and those related to hostages and detainees senior official officials will meet again in Cairo before the end of next week in the hopes of reaching an agreement on those new terms while our correspondents are following these developments across the Middle East and the United States in a moment we'll be hearing from Hamas salut who's standing by in Aman Jordan for Israeli reaction first though let's bring in Muhammad jamun who's been following the talks here in Doha Muhammad can you walk us through where we stand at this hour so sirel we have seen a statement that was released by the US qar and Egypt at the conclusion of these two days of ceasefire talks here in Doha now I want to read just two portions of this statement to try to walk you and our viewers through where we are right now one portion says that this proposal Builds on the points of agreement achieved over the past week and closes the remaining gaps in a manner that allows for the r rapid implementation of the agreement another portion says that the US with the support of the state of qar and the Arab Republic of Egypt presented to both parties a proposal that narrows the gaps between the parties and is consistent with the principle set out by President Biden on May 31st 2024 now the reason I wanted to read those two portions is because the language there suggests that the mediators are far more optimistic today than they had been leading into these talks you're talking about brid ing the gaps you're talking about narrowing the gaps closing the gaps that's what these talks were supposed to do when it comes to trying to implement either the framework agreement that had been presented by US President Joe Biden at the end of May and it had agreed to by Hamas in early July or any type of amended agreement that came thereafter now there's still a lot of questions not that many answers at this hour as you said in your leadin to me there are going to be technical teams working on this over the course course of the next week you're going to have another meeting that's going to be taking place in Cairo before the end of next week it does seem right now that there is momentum and that at the moment is a big positive step considering where we were just 24 hours ago when we weren't sure what exactly was going on behind closed doors now there's still so many issues we don't know where they've landed on right now we don't know what's going on when it comes to proposals about who's going to be in the Phil Philadelphia Corridor we don't know what happens when it comes to the number of Palestinian in prisoners that might be released but the language of this statement thus far suggests that the mediators feel that there is momentum right now and there is much more optimism about the possibility of closing those gaps in the days ahead than there was just 24 hours ago zero Muhammad jamj reporting from DHA thank you very much for that let's go to Hamas salut in the Jordanian capital and a reminder that our team is there because the Israeli government has banned aljazera from reporting inside Israel so hamda now that the mediators have spoken everyone's going to be scrutinizing any reactions from either Hamas or Israel is there anything on the Israeli side well some leaks and reports within Israeli media are indicating that there's been some progress made on key issues but that there are still sticking points that remain you have to remember that Netanyahu has had a hardened stance throughout the entire time negotiations have been happening throughout the entirety of this year and in fact since the last ceasefire deal collapsed nearly 9 months ago there's been so much pressure on Netanyahu from not just internationally but domestically from families of Israeli captives who've been protesting his leadership nonstop and you also have to remember that within his own government there are members within his Coalition who do not want to see a deal at all and in fact US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is set to arrive in Israel on Sunday and he'll will meet with Netanyahu on Monday and some reports are indicating that he's expected to be quite tough on Netanyahu in order to try and really get to the bottom of what the sticking points need to be solved so that everyone can enter into a ceasefire agreement on the same term this is going to be Lincoln's 10th visit to Israel since the War Began and throughout these visits he has been tough on Netanyahu he has voiced his opposition and US pressure to a lot of Israeli policy but even though there was all of that pressure from the United States Netanyahu was still seemingly unfazed Hamas salut reporting from the Jordanian Capital Aman thank you very much for that H and Alan fiser joins us now from Washington DC Alan the US is right in the middle of all of this first of all the plan was presented by Biden back in May and this statement that we just got says that the the the bridging proposals right the details they're talking about that's been presented even by the US are you Lear learning anything new either out of the state department or the White House anything at all on your end at this point well of course the thing to point out here is there's no deal until there's a deal so they can talk this up as they have done in in Washington over the last 10 weeks about how both sides are close how they're small gaps how they think they can Bridge it these talks have been we are told comprehensive and they've been intense and they think there is the groundwork for a deal but but there's still some mechanisms to be put in place and that means there is no deal till there's a deal now the idea that Anthony blinkin is going to the Middle East that was talked about last weekend uh Christopher Sheridan who is our white house uh producer he's been speaking to people in the last hour and he has heard from the state department that while blinkin is likely to head to the Middle East it's still not a done deal and that would suggest that he isn't going to go unless it's almost certain that there are going to be signatures on paper and that there's going to be a ceasefire deal put in place he won't fly to the region unless he thinks it's going to happen he may need to go to put last minute pressure on both sides particularly the Israelis because of course you'll remember that when this was revealed way back at at the end of May in June uh the Americans were saying well Hamas should accept this this is this is a good deal and Hamas did and then the problem had they had was that the Israelis didn't and they've been putting pressure on them for the last 10 weeks clearly politically Joe Biden would like this as a legacy issue that he managed to bring some semblance of peace to the Middle East but let me say one more time there's no deal until there's a deal that's alir is Alan fiser reporting from Washington DC thank you very much for that Alan
