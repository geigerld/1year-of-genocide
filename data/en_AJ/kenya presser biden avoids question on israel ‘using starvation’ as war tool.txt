well Our House correspondent kimy Alit joins us live now and a very interesting story this the William ruto's meeting with Joe Biden in Washington Kenyan forces Now set to intervene in Haiti tell us about uh us involvement in this yeah well there's been a long history of security partnership between the United States and Kenya it's it's gone back for a number of issues and in fact this state visit is celebrating the 60 years of diplomatic relations but the two have partnered on combating whether challenges include al-shabab whether it's the houthis even in Ukraine uh so the two leaders believe that combating challenges in Haiti is is a natural extension of that security partnership but it does have its controversies and in the press conference uh one of the Kenyan reporters asked why are you sending uh resources to the fire in Haiti when there's a fire at home and you heard the answer that was given there just a moment ago it believes that there is enough resources and there is a loyalty there to other nations to work and to to assist but uh this is certainly something that is being pushed back by Kenyan opposition lawmakers and also human rights activists at the same time we can tell you that this is a partnership that the United States and uh the uh Kenyan government believe in and we should also point out well there will be no American boots on the ground participating in this along with the 1,000 Kenyan soldiers or rather police officers officers uh this will be backed by about 300 million in American dollars of course uh President Joe Biden had his own agenda for this very important press conference with another world leader but of course there was some persistent questions there about the icc's request for arrest warrants for Hamas and Israeli leaders and of course Washington's support for Tel Aviv that's right as US President Joe Biden continues to try and promote his agenda you have to remember we're six months away from Americans going to the polls to try and and choose another president whether it's Joe Biden or Donald Trump uh these seem to be the options and uh you know Joe Biden is trying to win reelection he doesn't want to continue talking about the war on Gaza or his support for Israel and yet that is what seems to be on the minds of reporters and seems to be the on the minds of Voters and seems to be the protest that are all across campuses in the United States this was about to be a visit about uh promoting us interests in Africa and how this could be combating the influence of China but again what happened was the very first question was about uh arrest warrants as you point out and you Joe Biden's uh support for Israel and the US president tried to dodge the question but he was not able to get away with it completely but he still did not answer the question the question was whether or not Israel was deliberately using starvation as a weapon of war the president never answered that question instead what he did was he referred to a stock answer about whether or not the ICC in fact has jurisdiction uh something that the United States does not believe it does and whether or not uh the US president believes that this even has any merits in terms of an investigation at all again surp not surprisingly something the United States also does not support thank you very much Kimberly hulit make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
