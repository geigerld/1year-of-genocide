and as we mentioned Hamas welcomes the UN Security Council voting to back the ceasefire proposal in a statement the group says it emphasizes Readiness to cooperate with the mediators to enter into indirect negotiations on the implementation of the ceasefire deal and amas says it will continue its efforts to achieve National rights for Palestinians all right let's uh go to Maran bishara he is alzer's senior political analyst he joins us via Skype from Paris Maran um a diplomatic when we've been saying for the United States uh the Israeli leadership still a bit Cy has not publicly endorsed the ceas fire road map Hamas has come out welcomed the resolution Where Do We Go From Here well certainly the United States as the winner uh of this uh day of this uh day at the UN Security Council will be the power that will dictate uh the days the weeks the months to come uh the the pace the phases the stages of whatever negotiations or Dynamics uh are implemented uh in in this issue and I think the United States will be engaging with Israel as it will be engaging with Hamas through Qatar and Egypt and it will decide whether Israel's excuses justifications and OBC are uh well-founded or not uh and as per usual and we've known that the past 30 years of American diplomacy in Israel Palestine is that the United States will continue to play Israel's lawyer Israel's Defender giving Israel excuses while at the same time trying to nudge it to accept uh its ideas but just to contextualize it's really important to do so to do in order to know where we're going we really have to once again shed a light on where where we''re coming from this has been eight years of genocide of war crimes of a total Destruction of um the Gaza Strip sanctioned supported armed and financed by the United States the same United States that until 24 hours ago was supporting the killing of 300 Palestinians in Gaza it's the same United States that simultaneously is a um godfathering a ceasefire proposal that is winning at the UN Security Council so here you have a lesson in geopolitics geopolitics where diplomacy is the reflection of the balance or imbalance of power and the United States has come out on top in terms of the geopolitic of Israel Palestine ever since it sent its armadas on October 10 or 11 to the area to defend Israel as Israel carried its crimes against Gaza it is Israel it is the United States that has imposed its uh military strategic will on the region and now it is uh imposing its diplomatic will it has for eight months opposed any mention of a ceasefire any mention of a ceasefire at the UN Security Council but now it proposed its own uh ceasefire ambiguous as it may be every paragraph of it probably will need another agreement and another set of negotiations but it is what it is this is the world we live in and the United States will be leading the process forward and Maran how pivotal are the next hours and days well they are pivotally in as far as giving momentum to what just happened in the security Council and that's why I think it's quite important your question because I think the Israelis are contemplating exactly that how far can they procrastinate because I think Netanyahu was living in his magical world of carrying war crimes while waiting for perhaps a trump Administration to come forward his clock was different from Biden's Biden's will probably be hoping that Ida Netanyahu gets with the program and accept accepts the deal or maybe negotiate a bit further but probably the Biden Administration wouldn't mind if this government implodes that Israel calls for another election and that the likes of Benny Gans who the poll say will win and he's presumably today Biden's man in Israel if he's elected prime minister you know before the American elections that certainly will be a big win for um the Biden Administration or president B himself so the next few hours are really key in telling us whether the Israelis are serious in or not in winding down this war or to maintain their more of the same procrastination in order to buy time until Biden is out of office Maran Bashar alzer's senior political analyst thank you Maran make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaaz
