Shina low she's a communication adviser at the Norwegian Refugee Council she joins us now live from occupied East Jerusalem thank you so much for your time so the wfp says it's not taken its decision lightly to pause food deliveries to the north of the Gaza Strip as a humanitarian organization yourself who has worked in Gaza can you understand why they've come to this decision you know it's a really tough decision for all of us in terms of of determining where and when we're going to be able to to operate but the conditions right now on the ground for humanitarians are simply unacceptable in any other context humanitarians would be pulling out at this point because it is simply so dangerous and there are no guarantees of the safety of humanitarian staff neither uh because of Israeli targeting of convoys Israeli targeting of police who are there to protect Aid convoys and then of course due to the desperation because because of the lack of Aid that's getting in there's just been a deterioration of civil order in Gaza that's led to to the the charging and and looting of of aid aid convoys as they're trying to make their way I'm sure the wfp did not take this decision lightly but it's but they need to they also have a duty of care to their staff and to the and to the people seeking out Aid not to not to be putting them in in dangerous positions right of course spell it out for us a little bit more the challenges that humanitarian organizations like yourself face when you turn up with a truck full of Aid or several trucks full of Aid and want to get into Gaza what what exactly is going wrong well first of all there are all sorts of logistical hurdles still in terms of getting Aid into into Gaza including uh arbitrary capricious and extremely intensive screenings that are that the Israelis are requiring for any Aid that's entering Gaza on top of that we've seen uh is Israeli protesters blocking the delivery of Aid uh now uh the the UN which is handling all deliveries from Rafa into or from Rafa Crossing into into Gaza they uh were being accompanied by Palestinian police officers but the repeated targeting of police officers accompanying Aid convoys has led to the police no longer providing that assistance that means that these truck drivers are and convoys are are unprotected and that people desperate for Aid are are charging trucks uh in some cases even beating the the truck drivers uh and damaging the vehicles this is the level of desperation just even in Rafa let alone in Northern Gaza where people have been deprived or only in the first month and a half of the year out of 77 planned convoys the UN and and other NOS were only able to to fully or partially facilitate 15 of those of those uh planned missions because of lack of for coordination or or flat out denials by the Israelis you mentioned those extraordinary scenes that we saw earlier this week where a convoy of trucks were met by hundreds of those hungry desperate Palestinians but then the Israeli military started firing on them and we had SE several uh people wounded did it have to come to that I mean that could it have been avoided you know I I really don't understand why the Israeli military was shooting at at uh people desperate people seeking Aid I can't imagine that that any Aid workers would want um people who are desperate and and and on the brink of starvation to be shot while seeking out Aid of course one of the things that we need in order for us to be able to deliver Aid safely is a ceasefire and guarantees of access to all parts of Gaza where where AID workers and those seeking out Aid will will be guaranteed of their safety in terms of the conditions of of those attempted distributions earlier this week it's just simply unacceptable what is your understanding of the food security situation in Gaza now particularly in the north I mean how big a blow is it that we're seeing this suspension of food Aid well as of now children 15.6% of children under the age of two in Northern Gaza are facing acute starvation these are unprecedented numbers prior to October 7th less than 1% of children throughout Gaza uh we're facing that level of starvation and Mal malnutrition so it's it's quite quite severe in terms of Northern Gaza there's limited food getting in there people are running out of even animal fodder to eat uh I was speaking to one of my colleagues today who's in Rafa who's in touch with Folks up north telling us about the skyrocketing prices people paying hundreds of dollars for a few kilos of of flour uh because it because the situation is so desperate in the even in the the South where AID is is more plentiful and and some commercial uh commercial goods are reaching the market the cost of of food has just skyrocketed and and even if people have money they still often cannot afford to to purchase enough food for themselves or their families okay sh uh I really appreciate you talking to us communication advisor at the Norwegian Refugee Council speaking to us there from occupied East
