let's bring in Christian Cardon he is the head of the office in Gaza at the icrc the international Committee of the Red Cross he joins us now from Geneva Christian you just heard blinken there talk about their plan for Aid to and I quote reach civilians in Gaza and them alone how realistic is that given that we're talking about an armed group that many regard as a social movement and and also just how densely populated the Gaza Strip is well this is absolutely needed because the situ that is unfolding at the moment in Gaza is just there are many Declaration of unprecedent Crisis and this is what we can definitely confirm lack of food lack of water lack of access to electricity L lack of medicines and the situation is definitely becoming unturn for the population in addition to that and you've mentioned it in previous report the situation remains unsafe in the South so we have colleagues telling us that in 24 hours they had to leave the nose and actually reach the sou thinking that they could find a safer place but at the moment this is not the case there's still bombing ongoing and so yes humanitarian Aid it's urgently needed at the time and while I'm talking to you we haven't seen this entering into Gaza this will be absolutely key but this is not enough there are many other things that will be needed letting humanitarian actors doing their job today this is not enough the case we have a very limited space in the South but it's very important that humanitarian actors including the icrc the Palestine red PR can access the north too Christian this idea though that Aid will only be given to civilians and that that is possible in terms of Aid distribution is that realistic are you going to be able to have a plan to get Aid into the Gaza Strip and make sure that no one vaguely Affiliated to Hamas or or supports ham Mass receives any of it I think we have to be real very realistic in this situation and and obviously ICC and many other actors we we have a certain experience and although this is uh an unprecedent situation as I said before we are ready we have many AIDS convos that are ready that are on the Move we have surgical team we have additional staff and this is the case again for other actors so it's urgent to let them in when this Aid will come e come come inside the the the Gaza Strip obviously we will do our best to make sure that you know the civilian population those who who be paed in this conflict uh will actually get that Aid first that's that's clearly always the top priority of the ICC wherever we work you mentioned the the danger the ongoing danger there human rights organizations have described the Israeli air strikes as prioritizing damage over Precision we've obviously seen strikes take out medical facilities ambulances now we've heard just in the last last few minutes also this unra shelter people died in a school what protection can be offered to the aid workers who will be doing the Aid distribution I think this is a very clear message that we have reminded both parties the Israeli authorities and the Hamas authorities the first days the first minutes of this escalation we've been very clear on respecting the law of war and this is not a Toopy you know it's extremely realistic it's extremely pragmatic civilian civilian infrastructures should be respected should be spad at all time and and authorities on both Sid should make sure that these infrastructures are keep their nature their civilian nature so yes what is unfolding now is extremely Waring the icrc is in contact with both parties constantly um at the IDF level but also with the Hamas authorities at the highest level making sure that these infrastructures including those that have been left behind can be respected well the icrc your organization works specifically on civilian protection and international humanitarian law so let me ask do you have any expectation any hope that there will actually be accountability for the violations of international law that have already taken place you know for the time being the urgency we've discussed it it's to bring Aid making sure that what's happening now the events that are unfolding and making sure that the parties respect that L yes we believe it's realistic yes we believe that there can be humanitarian pose absolutely there could be a secession of hostilities so that people you know can manage their debt can Evacuate the wounded can actually uh have their food and water access to food water and electricity so yes we believe as humanitarian actor having wor there in the past and in many other places that obviously bringing humanity and also International humanitarian law at the middle of this is absolutely urgent now Christian just before I let you go you obviously mentioned that there are Aid convoys waiting to go in and they haven't been allowed to do so what is the situation like now at Rafa Crossing well at the moment and from what we hear from our team again on on the other side from from the the Gaza sign very close to the to the Rafa Crossing is that obviously that that there is a so many people and and still many people arriving but as I said for a still very unsecure situation and what they can see what we can hear on the other side is that things are being prepared but for the time being the door remain closed and that's the urgency and this is why the ongoing negotiations that are taking place are absolutely vital for the population of Gaza Christian Cardon there who was the head of the office in Gaza at the icrc the international Committee of the Red Cross thank you for joining us on Al jazer we really wish you all the best with your work and your efforts thank you very much
