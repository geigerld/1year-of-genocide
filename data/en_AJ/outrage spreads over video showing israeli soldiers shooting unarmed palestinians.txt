Al jazer has obtained video showing Israeli forces in Gaza shooting and killing two unarmed Palestinians one of the men repeatedly waves what appears to be a piece of white fabric to show that they're not a threat their bodies are then buried by a bulldozer the Israeli Army hasn't commented on the video and we warn you that you may find some of the images in Barbara Ang goa's report distressing these unarmed men are trying to return to their homes in Northern Gaza the only way to get there is through Al rashed Street West of Gaza City and near the nabulsi roundabout Southwest of Gaza City Israeli forces are deployed a Palestinian man approaches the Israeli soldiers he raises a white flag an international sign of surrender and Israeli troops allow him to approach safely meanwhile the other young man turns back to where he came from he too raises a white flag here the first man disappears from view in the footage then Israeli soldiers use a neyar armored vehicle to chase down the young man walking away from them he waves a small white flag at them but the White Flag doesn't prevent soldiers from opening fire on him an Israeli bulldozer arrives on the scene and here we see the body of the first man on the ground in a final indignity the giant bulldozzer shovels the two bodies and buries them in sand and litter the Israeli soldiers attempt to conceal the executions the weab buts of a group of Palestinian Witnesses is unknown Hammer says in any ceasefire agreement the right of Palestinians to return to their homes safely without being shot at by Israeli troops must be included Barbara Ang goopa Al jazer well we have two correspondents standing by for us on this story Imran Khan is in the occupied East Jerusalem but first let's talk to hany Mahmud who's in Rafa in the Gaza Strip and hany good morning disturbing images there of these executions uh is there any reaction to those pictures uh where you good morning yes it's been very very difficult to see the the footage of the two young unarmed osing no threat to the Israeli military forces deployed at the nabul traffic circle that's the southern western part of Gaza City very horrifying scenes of the two men approaching uh the soldiers waving Whitey flags and trying to uh pass by the checkpoint set up by the Israeli military when all the sudden they were shot and what looks like a samary execution and then a bulldozer just buried them after it ran them over buried them just you know an attempt to conceal the crime and just it's not a coincidence that this happened uh to coincide with the findings of the United Nations the rapor uh for human rights in Palestine who talked about the conclusion that they came to of many of the acts on the ground since the beginning of the war constitute in fact a genocidal intense and war crimes a violation of international human rights where civilians and children and people who pose no uh uh harm or no violence whatsoever are being killed and either in their residential homes or or when they were rounded up from evacuation uh centers just uh very difficult scene and it just put a lot of causing a lot of panic and concern for people who are already exhausted and and tired of the situations the living conditions are made very difficult in overcrowded part of the city and and and can't wait to get back uh to uh to their homes in the northern part in Gaza City it's just by this moment right now we can safely say that any hopes Palestinians had after the UN Security Council resolution was passed uh are are being drowned by these horrifying scenes and by the bombs uh that have been caused by the intense Relentless bombing campaign across the Gaza Strip indeed hany let's just um focus on what's been going on certainly over the night and as the sun rises across the Gaza Strip on Thursday where should we be focusing our attention today know H it just it's getting very difficult these days to to to keep up with the ongoing atrocities and destruction caused by the war machine across the Gaza Strip in the the past 24 hours were very difficult here in Rafa City characterized by more mass killing and more destruction of residential homes and livestock farms and agricultural lands and overnight we're look at more concentration on the Central Area an area that's supposed to be safe for the thousand of people who fled the uh the horror of the wars in northern part in Gaza City and also at early hours of this morning an extension of what's going on within the past 10 days around the vicinity of shifa hospital where not only we're seeing the Israeli military causing a great deal of damage to the Health Complex a shifa complex destroying its property and medical equipments and buildings but the fact now it's running are conducting a systematic destruction of all the residential homes we're looking at the entire res itial neighborhood around the shifa hospital that has been destroyed and severely damaged beyond recognition systematic control demolition of homes as well as the uh the ongoing burning of residential homes in the area and what seems to be an a systematic clearance of the area from any signs of life including the health facility complex itself m in Rafa thanks very much Let's cross over to Imran Khan who's an occupied East Jerusalem uh Imran in the past few months while the war on Gaza as far as Israel is concerned has been continuing we've seen some disturbing images none more disturbing than what we're showing today any reaction from the Israeli authorities well just as I was waiting to speak to you we did get a response from the Israeli Army what we did uh was just a few hours ago was send them the video and ask them for their response they've said it very clearly they've said that the video in question is edited and doesn't show the context of the incident a thorough and professional examination is required in order to assess the details of the incident upon receiving the report on the incident it was transferred to the relevant professional bodies for review that's a pretty standard answer for the Israeli Army when we show them anything when any uh journalist ask any questions about what's going on whether it's in the ocupar Westbank or even in Gaza they say we're going to investigate and then they leave it be hoping that something else will happen and the world's media will be ATT uh will be put elsewhere that attention will go elsewhere we've seen this time and time again it's also worth remembering that Israel doesn't prosecute soldiers for any crimes that are committed uh potential war crimes let's use that word uh that term potential war crimes that have been committed whether it's the occupied West Bank or whether it's Gaza Israel protects its soldiers we're not expecting a much more detailed response from that certainly it won't come uh today probably won't come within the next couple of weeks or so probably have to keep on the Israeli Army to try and tell us exactly what they're investigating and how they're investigating but even then all of that is met with an Israeli Army response that simply says and they keep doing this we are investigating Imran thanks very much for the update of course we'll continue to monitor that with you from occupied East Jerusalem thank you
