hany Mahmud is in uh is in Rafa in southern Gaza and now Hy you've we've been speaking about uh continuing strikes in southern Gaza um there are you know concerns of an ongoing humanitarian catastrophe uh and then also we've had this news in Israel ban on Al jazer operations uh inside the country first though I want to ask you about the attack on the Karam Abu Salam Crossing it was a mortar attack and now this Crossing is going to close what does that mean for the prospect of humanitarian Aid accessing Gaza yes well there been confirmed right now the crossing that's km en closure is going to it's effective right now it is preventing a commercial trative from getting into the Gaza it's likely to further complicate the the already uh difficult humanitarian situation across the Gaz is trendly here in overcrowded part of the strip bra City where 1.5 million displaced Palestinians have been Sheltering inside uh the uh inside Rafa City this will just increase the difficulties and this Crossing was used in the past to allow uh the entrance of commercial trucks carrying supplies that were not allowed through the RAF Crossing as part of the humanitarian uh Aid getting into the Gaza Strip This closure came after Israeli military in a statement it said that it responded to more attacks and a barrage of rockets fired at the uh at the uh the Gathering of Israeli soldier of the near YK K Abu ham in the Alan Bri in a statement it said that it targeted the very unit that's been planning and directing attacks across Rafa City the closure is going to further increase the already difficult situations it's interesting to see how long this will continue be as in light of the ongoing blockade on the entrance uh on the entry of humanitarian Aid mainly we're looking at Food Supplies water supplies and medical Necessities are needed uh for a really desperate population either in hospitals or inside evacuation uh centers across the Gaza trip now we were hearing Clips a little bit we hearing clips a little bit earlier on today from citizens in Gaza and I mean you know usually just the the struggle of daily life and being able to survive would mean that uh maybe there isn't much hope in uh political talks that happen from time to time but the voices that we were hearing from today seem to say that they really are uh hoping that the ceasefire talks will produce some respite even if it's temporary uh for them what is the how closely are people watching these talks well as events keep evolving in unexpected way right now not only there are difficulties in Kyo Netanyahu is AD of not sending a delegation to Cairo to further make progress in the talks they ban on Al jaaz office the attacks on K Abu Salim and the closure right now all coming together a prove uh what people have supressed the cautious optimism because they know any sudden turn of events is going to get everybody back to square zero where there's no progress made at all people are torn apart right now they live in the limbo they keeping an eye on the talk they're hoping right now even though this hope is started to vanish now with little by little people are no longer talking about a ceasefire deal in which they can go back to their homes this hopes already vanished the talks right now is a Poss a possible expansion of the ground Invasion to ra city they're getting ready right now they want to move to the evacuation zones designated by the Israeli military despite the frustration that we heard from people that these are not safe Zone because you can't create a safe Zone in a war zone and because of the multiple failures of the Israeli military of giving a clear assurance that these are designated safe zones for people to evacuate to multiple times people ended up getting killed inside the is very evacuation Z so people are not really helpful right now they just want something that keeps them alive as events keep evolving in an unexpected ways all right thank you very much Han Mahmud in uh in Rafa well Bernard Smith joins us live from rala in the occupied West Bank and Bernard you know we began the day I suppose by speaking to hanim mahmuda our colleague there in Gaza about the the area continuing to endure intense aerial bombardments there's also a fear about famine spreading from the northern to the southern part of Gaza and then these Seas fire talks which uh are which appear to be going nowhere uh then came this decision by the Israeli cabinet which met today to impose this ban on Al jazer operations inside the country has there been any further reaction to this have you been hearing anything there in the occupied West Bank uh I haven't heard anything particular about the the closure of alzer's English and Arabic operations here in the occupied West Bank uh yet I mean the reason we are able to be here but we're not broadcasting from occupied East Jerusalem or for anywhere else in Israel is because the ban applies to Israeli domestic territory this is occupied territory and for it to be enforced here there' be need to be some sort of military order from the military governor of this part of the occupied West Bank that is why for the moment uh we are able to be on air here but the ban gives the Israeli government in Israel proper uh permission to confiscate broadcast equipment to cut Al jaer off from cable and satellite companies and to block websites and it's a 45 day long ban which can be continued after after that the cabinet has to vote on it each time uh we understand that Al jazer are Senior Management from Al jazer are looking at the options of a of a legal appeal though to this ban and we've been speaking about the the ceasefire talks mediation efforts that are taking place inside Egypt and we've seen the Israelis playing down any prospects for an end to the war though that continues to be hamas's main demand that there not just be a temporary ceasefire but a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Strip This has always been the sticking point uh from the outset between Israel and Hamas Hamas wanting a complete end to the fighting uh Israel not prepared to offer that we're on the second day now of these of these latest truce talks in Cairo mediated between Egypt and Qatar and the US and there seems to be little sign of any breakthrough Hamas has said again any truce must end the war Netanyahu reiterating again that Israel's aim since the start of the war is to disarm and dismantle Hamas and Israel has not achieved those aims nety has kept repeating that so there's this offer of this temporary truce perhaps a 40-day truce but nothing more than that and the release of Palestinian prisoners and from Hamas you're getting isma Han saying that they are still keen on reaching a comprehensive ceasefire that ends Israeli aggression sees the withdraw from Hamas and a serious deal to free Israelis in exchange for the Reas of Palestinian prisoners remember that the concern from the Israeli side from Benjamin nety who particularly is a a belief from analysts that any prolonged calm in Gaza will imperil his position because it will put focus on his government and his conduct in the war and the far right whom he relies on uh to stay in power has said he must continue with his planned invasion of of Rafa to Target Hamas in Rafa there on the south so that is why we are at this impass despite an enormous amount of pressure from the Americans from the Egyptians and from kataar from The Americans on Israel from the Egyptians and Qatar on Hamas and an urgent question Bernard is the humanitarian Aid the lack of food that is uh getting into Gaza uh we now see the United Nations has spoken about a full-blown famine in the northern part of the territory and that moving uh further south we have already seen many pictures and images of uh emaciated Starving Children this attack this mortar attack on the the car Abu Salam Crossing uh how much concern is there about how the closure of that Crossing Point could affect the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Gaza well the Israelis now say that 10 soldiers were injured in that attack that Hamas has claimed responsibility for on Kum kamam Abu salum Crossing three of those soldiers are seriously wounded and Israel says that has stopped Aid going in to Gaza it's one of the principal ways that Aid is getting in there was some Aid coming in through the North through the ARs Crossing but caram abuelem is a main uh Convoy route already we know that not enough Aid was getting in anyway just a few hundred trucks it near before the war there was 500 trucks a day supplying uh G's aid needs and after that of course those needs have multiplied considerably so no it's going to have a considerable impact on the amount of Aid getting in unless it's possible to get it in elsewhere Aid coming in from the air barely scratches the service there are surface there are drops of Aid going on but it's it's it's really not enough all right thank you so much Bernard Smith in rala in the occupied West Bank make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
