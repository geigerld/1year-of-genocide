mm Kim joins us now from West Jerusalem he's a professor of political science at ban University thanks very much for being with us there's certainly a lot for blinken to be dealing with on this particular visit first of all let's look at the defense Minister's proposal for the day after the war on Gaza what do you make of it uh I see to two strategies discussed yesterday in the cabinet in the war cabinet first there was the security establishment attitude as presented by yav Galant Minister of Defense which is Israel will stay in Gaza Street in in the different locations with different responsibilities uh inside or along a parameter next to the to the border with Israel but Israel will take care on the security and supervise any other operation to rebuild Gaza strep Israel hopes that some someone will take from Israel the responsibility be it an international Consortium or local families Clans hamula the different hamula on different areas do you think jump in there excuse me do you think just do you think that's a likely scenario that someone else is going to come in and work with the Israelis to rebuild Gaza no no no way nobody no institution or state or organization will enter and put itself to be a target for Hamas Fighters managing gorilla war against it what should be done elections general elections to to legitimize the next Administration with without Hamas blessing and demilitarize Hamas but Hamas political Hamas let's say okay nothing can move Israel is Israel is unprepared to what it made in in Gaza the trouble is though we we've already got the extreme right in Israel furious with this particular proposal there's no way that they are going to accept the idea of General elections yeah definitely but also Netanyahu is against and what I read from NE yesterday exchange of blames and shouts in the the cabin the mini cabinet meeting is that netan instructed his followers to attack the gallant and the Army and the chief of staff they made it under netan following netan request the rightwing the extreme right-wing the Jewish Supremacy parties they want to clean Gaza Strip all out to expel maximum Palestinians to Egypt or they started talking about Congo and Latin America and then bring in settlers and build new three City settlements in Gaza street according to them this is the the uh let's say Amendment of the Israeli disengagement in 2005 and the implementation of their messic Redemption ideology this is their view isn't one of the problems here manm that the Palestinians need to come up with their own plan and they haven't why haven't they because the Israel exposed Abu from all its authorities and legitimacy and also Abu Masen contributed to that it's not only because of Israel also Abu maen made many mistakes and Wrongs but also the International Community instead the International Community instead should have state this is the final status agreement this is what we want to achieve and we will we will impose it on you or we will push very hard to achieve it and we are involved we we don't leave you guys fighting guys to to continue fighting we want to to see a settlement there without that nothing will move Israel must be Israel's AR arms must be switched by the International Community okay clim thanks very much for taking the time to join us there from West Jerusalem we appreciate your insights and thoughts thank you
