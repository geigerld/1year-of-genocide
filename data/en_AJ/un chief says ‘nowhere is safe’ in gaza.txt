my special coordinator for the midle East process T venz land will follow with take to the United Nations to listen to the Secretary General Antonio GES speaking now on a meeting to discuss the situation in Gaza was approved in a context of widespread death and whale destruction Unleashed by the conflict in Gaza and Israel according to Israeli authorities more than 1,200 people were killed including cluding 33 children and thousands were injured in the abor acts of Terror by amas on 7 October some 20 250 people were also abducted including 34 children and there are also numerous accounts of sexual violence during attacks that must be vigorously investigated and prosecuted gender based violence must be condemned anytime anywhere Mr President according to the de facto authorities more than 14,000 people have been killed since the start of the Israeli military operations in Gaza tens of thousands of Palestinians have also been injured with many more missing in Gaza more than 23ds of those killed are reported to be children and women in a matter of weeks a far greater number of children been killed by Gaza than the total number of children killed during any year by any party to a conflict since I've been Secretary General is clearly indicated in the annual reports on children and armed conflict that I have submitted to the council over the past few days the people of the occupied Palestine territory and Israel have finally seen a glimmer of hope and Humanity in so much Darkness it is deeply moving to see civilians finally having a respite from the bombardments families reunited and life saving Aid increasing Mr President resolution 2712 and I quote demands that all parties comply with their obligations under international law including International humanitarian law notably with regard to the protection of civilians especially children it is clear that before the paws we witness serious violations beyond the many civilians killed and wounded that I have spoke of 80% of gaza's people have now been forced from their homes the growing popul the growing population is being pushed to this growing population is being pushed towards an Ever smaller area of Southern Gaza and of course nowhere is safe in Gaza meanwhile an estimated 45% of all homs in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed the nature and scale of death and destruction are characteristic of the use of wide area explosive weapons in populated areas with a significant impact on civilians at the same time rocket attacks on population centers in Israel by amas and other groups have continued along with allegations of the use of human Shields this is also inconsistent with International humanity and law obligations Mr President I want to stress the inviolability of United St Nations facilities which today are Sheltering more than 1 million civilians seeking protection under the UN flag Huna shares the coordinates of all its facilities across the Gaza strep with all parties to the conflict the agency has verified 104 incidents that have impacted 82 un installations 24 of which happened since the adoption of the resolution a total of 218 internally displaced people Sheltering in unra schools have reportedly been killed and at least 894 injured in addition it is with immense sadness and pain that I report that since the beginning of the hostilities 111 members of our un family have been killed in Gaza these represents the largest loss of Personnel in the history of our organization let me put it plainly civilians including United Nations personnel must be protected civilian objects including hospitals must be protected un facility must not be hit International humanitarian law must be respected by all parties to the conflict at all times Mr President Security Council resolution 2712 calls and I quote for Urgent and extended humanitarian poses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip to enable full Rapid Safe and unhindered humanitarian access end of quote I welcome the arrangement re reached by Israel and Hamas with the assistance of the governments of Qatar Egypt and United States we are working to maximize the positive potential of this Arrangement on the humanitarian situation in Gaza the pause has enabled us to enhance the delivery of Aid into and across Gaza for example for the first time since 7 October an inter agency Convoy delivered food water medical supplies and shelter items to Northern Gaza especially to four un shelters in jabalia Camp prior to this minimal or no assistant had reached these locations even as tens of thousands of people had crowded there for shelter also for the first time supplies of cooking gas entered Gaza where people waited in lines that extended for 2 kilometers in the South where the needs are dire un agencies and partners having increased both the amount of Aid delivery and the number of locations reached and I express my appreciation to the government of Egypt for their contribution in making this assistance possible but the level of Aid to Palestinians in Gaza remains completely inadequate to meet the huge needs of more than 2 million people and although the total volume of fuel allowed into Gaza has also increased it remains utterly insufficient to sustain basic operations civilians in Gaza need a continuous flow of life-saving humanitarian Aid and fuel into and across the area safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to all those in need is critical humanitarian Partners carried out several medical evacuations from north to south Gaza including to transport dozens of premature babies as well as spinal and dialysis dialysis patients from shifa and alali Anglican hospitals several critically ill patients have also been evacuated for treatment in Egypt hospitals across Gaza lack the basic supplies stuff and fuel to deliver Primary Health Care at the scale needed let alone safely treat urgent cases the medical system has broken down under the heavy case load acute shortages and the impact of hostilities Mr President Security Council resolution 2712 calls for and I quote the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages held by amas and other groups the arrangements announced on 22 November as so far led to the release of a five days of 60 hostages 29 women 31 children held by amas and other groups since 7 October outside the arrangement during the same period another 21 hostages were released this is a welcome start but as I have been saying from day one all hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally until then they must be treated humanely and the international Committee of the Red Cross must be allowed to visit them the arrangement also saw the release of 180 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Israeli jails mostly women and children Mr President Security Council 2712 and I quote calls on all parties to refrain from depriving the civilian population in the Gaza strep of basic services and humanitarian assistance indispensable to their survival consistent with International humanitarian law much more is required to begin to address human needs in Gaza what water and electricity services must be fully restored Food Systems have collapsed and anger is spreading particularly in the north sanitary conditions in shelters are appalling with few toilets and sewage flooding posing a serious threat to Public Health children pregnant women older people and those with weak weakened immune systems are at greater risk Gaza needs an immediate and sustained increase in humanitarian Aid including food water fuel blankets medicines and healthare supplies it is important to recognize that the rougher border crossing does not have enough capacity especially taking into account the slow pace of security procedures that is why we have been urging the opening of other Crossings including Kem Shalom and the streamlining of inspection mechanisms to allow for the necessary increase of life- saving AIDS but humanitarian Aid alone will not be sufficient we also need the private sector to bring in critical basic Commodities to replenish completely depleted shops in Gaza Mr President finally Security Council 2712 and I quote underscores the importance of coordination humanitarian notification and deconfliction mechanisms to protect all medical and humanitarian staff Vehicles including ambulances humanitarian sites and critical infrastructure including un facilities a humanitarian notification system is now in place and is being constantly reviewed and enhanced including through plans for additional civil military experts to support coordination Mr President I welcome the adoption of resolution 2712 but its implementation by the parters matter Partners matters most in accordance with the resolution I will revert to the president of the security Council with a set of options on effectively monitoring the implementation of the resolution I've already established a working group composed of the Department of political and peace building Affairs the department of Peace operations the office for the coordination of humanitarian Affairs and the office of legal Affairs to urgently prepare proposals in in this regard so far it is clear that implementation has been only partial at best and it was woly insufficient ultimately we know that the measure of success will not be the number of trucks dispatched or the tons of supplies delivered as important as these are success will be measured in lives that are saved suffering that is ended and open dignity that is restored the people of Gaza are in the midst of an epic humanitarian catastrophe before the eyes of the world we must not look away intense negotiations are taking place to prolong the truth which we strongly welcome but we believe we need a true humanitarian ceasefire and we must ensure the people of the region finally have an horizon of Hope by moving in a determined and irreversible way towards establishing a two-state solution on the basis of United Nations resolutions and international law with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security failure will condemn Palestinians Israelis the region and the world to a NeverEnding cycle of death and destruction and I thank you
