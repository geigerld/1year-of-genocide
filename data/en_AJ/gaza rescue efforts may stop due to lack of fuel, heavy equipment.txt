and we'll take you straight back to the Gaza Strip where the Civil Defense Agency is giving a an update on recent events let's listen in in a row today we are entering into the eighth month of this genocide War the civil defense team's efforts humanitarian efforts all across the provinces of Gaza Strip have not been halted throughout this genocide War we have performed 37 ,500 missions which is equivalent to 24 years of hard work before the war as a result our heavy equipment and Machinery have worn out and although we are being targeted by the Israeli occupation forces as we lost 39 civil defense members till this hour the Israeli occupation forces continue to torpedo all the humanitarian efforts all across Gaza Strip although the international law provides certain protections to the civil defense teams the Israeli occupation forces continue to violate this law perpetrating killing among our members destroying our heavy equipment preventing us from recovering the dead bodies even those survivors trapped under the debris the Israeli occupation forces continue to Target and destroy the heavy equipment that help us recover the victims and above all we are facing sharp shortage of fuel whereby we will come to a total hold whereby thousands of lives will be lost especially we will not be able to recover dead bodies or survivors from under the debris and as we speak hundreds of victims remain buried under the rubbles and our teams are not able to recover them and these numbers are continuing to rise the lack of fuel exaggerates our problem therefore we condemn the purposal targeting by the Israeli occupation forces where 39 of our members were killed 150 injured many of them suffered repeated injuries on a number of occasions we call on the International Community to continue the Israeli occupation violation and purposeful targeting of our teams we hold Israeli accountable for targeting the civil defense members and all those performing humanitarian Aid am made the total absence of heavy equipment and fuel our efforts will not suffice to meet the basic minimum needs of our people namely to recover hundreds of dead bodies and survivors from under the debris our efforts will be further compared as the occupation forces have left more than 37,000 tons of debris all across the Enclave silenced by the International Community and the United Nations amid the continued crimes and this genocide War by the Israeli occupation forces including the willful targeting of the civil defense and ambulance teams means that the these apparatuses are condemned to execution by the International Community as the International Community remain silent amid the israeli's continued violation we call on the Secretary General of the United Nations and all the international organization to lend a helping hand to the civil defense and all other humanitarian teams within the Enclave we renew our appeal to all the stakeholders namely the world health organizations United Nations and the International Association of protection of civil defense and all other concerned organization to act swiftly in order to allow the unconditional delivery of heavy equipment required for the civil defense teams to operate all across the Enclave namely in the north especially are faced with a massive dilemma namely the floated and wreaking bodies being decomposed under the debris we call in the naal Red Cross to exercise more pressure on the Israeli occupation forces in order to allow the intervention by the civil defense and ambulance teams in the targeted area especially that dozens are being killed and buried under the debris survivors are trapped under the rebels this is a statement issued on this day by the civil defense department of Gaza Strip all right you've been listening to the Palestinian civil Defense Agency they were talking just outside Al AXA hospital that's in daral Bala in the central part of the Gaza Strip uh as a reminder there is fighting going on in the north around jabalia there's fighting going on in the South around Rafa and people who have been fleeing Rafa in their hundreds of thousands have been coming towards the center of the strip which has not made them uh any safer over the last few days as we've seen 14 Palestinians were killed uh overnight in nerat in the central part of the strip all right let's bring in Muhammad El masri iCal analyst professor of media studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies you were listening to this uh with us the the um the Civil Defense Agency really spotlighting how difficult I would say almost impossible listening to them it is to do their job they are the people who go to the blast sites the target sites after an Israeli strike and they try to pull the injured and the dead out of the rubble and they're saying it's become almost impossible right and I I think it's important to take a step back um and think about Israel's larger strategy here uh Israel has a a philosophy an ideology called greater Israel it's a it's kind of a policy uh they want to be able to take over all of the all of the land they believe that all of the land from The River To The Sea should belong to the Jews and it must be purified of the Arab presence One Vision for what the country should be absolutely and it's increasingly popular and is Israelis it used to be sort of unspoken now they're now they're saying it out loud um and that was one of the goals it's quite clear from early October um for this this war they wanted to ethnically cleanse uh the Gaza Strip and part of that involves making life completely uninhabitable um and and that's what uh I think is happening Gaza is now pretty much uninhabitable there was a report released within the last two weeks by the United Nations that said it'll take 80 years to rebuild Gaza um there's just not much left in terms of just infrastructure and and services even if the war ended today uh some numbers on that to your point 70% I think it's the same source as the UN saying 70% of buildings have been either totally destroyed or partially destroyed and uh and and a data point that was just given to us by the Civil Defense Agency they say 37 tons of debris are strewn across Gaza when these buildings are hollowed out or or destroyed right and then you also have the problem of the unexploded bombs which experts are saying will take about 14 years uh to clear uh so those are just those are humanitarian disasters uh wait waiting to happen and so it begs the question you know what next what what is the end game what's going to happen to all of these people and I think Israel's hope is still that Egypt is going to open those Borders or that they will be forced open and that all the gazin will flood into Egypt you know that's so interesting you're not the first analyst who has sat there since the beginning of this war and said even in the early days uh you and a couple of your uh colleagues were saying Israel's goal is to move Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip that hasn't happened all the most somber most pessimistic predictions in terms of the number of people killed Etc have come to pass but the one of moving Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip it I mean it has to the extent that many Palestinians have left those who could those who could either afford to bribe their way way out or were dual Nationals but Israel hasn't actually moved wholesale Palestinians out of the strip that hasn't happened it doesn't happen because Israel hasn't been able to do it Israel does have to operate under certain constraints there are political constraints so one of the things that I think Israel expected to happen uh was that Egypt would would give in and open its borders they started asking this question in October why doesn't Egypt open its borders and take these people in as refugees uh uh Egypt for its part has been completely unwilling uh to do that and we've seen Egypt now within the last 48 hours uh adding its name to this icj case the genocide case um that South Africa brought against Israel uh at the at the world Court um because they're so unhappy with Israel violating these agreements related to uh Rafa which is supposed to be a demilitarized zone Israel is taking it over everything but everything but demilitarized now exactly exactly so um Egypt hasn't been able to uh uh hasn't been willing to open its border and the United States hasn't been willing to go so far as to fully support this kind of mass population transfer that's why it hasn't happened yet Al yeah they have vocally said the us that they oppose it they said there cannot be a reduction of the Palestinian population in Gaza absolutely absolutely but the question becomes if pressure continues to be exerted if Netanyahu gets his wish in December he said he wants this war to go on or he expected the war to go on throughout 2024 so if we're sitting here uh sirel in December or November and we're still talking about a war on Gaza what will be left and will uh will Israel ultimately be able to force the hand of of the United States of Egypt and of the International Community what will be left and how many will be left because there's every indication that Israel has been using starvation as a as a weapon of War it's been accused of doing so there's every objective reason to to to believe that's the case they are they are deciding to block the aid from the Gaza Strip um the UN has said it's a full-blown famine the definition of famine is that people are dying right they're dying because they don't have enough food and if people aren't dying of famine and they're they're dying of the bombs Israel has a Kill Zone policy we're talking about this un worker who was killed uh there were three Israelis W waving White Flags a couple of months ago and they were killed Israel has a Killzone policy that's why all these civil that's one of the reasons why so many civilians are killed there are other reasons of course Israel has this 20 to1 ratio this 100 to1 ratio this kind of calculus for how many civilians it's willing to kill if it identifies a Hamas fighter in a particular area so to your point if the gazin aren't dying of starvation they may be dying of bombs if pull all those threads together everything you've all all these issues that you've just raised what do you think is the endgame because it's actually really hard to see one I mean of course Benjamin Netanyahu speaks of total Victory and victory in his mind equals wiping out Hamas um no one's holding their breath on that right now um what do you think he's actually really aiming to to do then well I think there are multiple things I think he wants to prolong the war as much as possible I do think he wants to eliminate but wants toate the stri think that's a for it's also the of Ben and ands on the um uh in Israel um you know the question and again I said this in the LA our last conversation I don't want to be reductionist about it but so much of this comes down to what the United States is going to do and what they're willing uh to tolerate and that's what I don't have an answer I don't have an answer to that question okay well since you since you bring that up I did say that there was a conversation waiting to happen there right we have a few minutes hanim mahmud's going to be coming up for us from Daryl Bal in just a moment so let's take this minute to have that conversation you said this is going likely going to cost Joe Biden the election that's the most affirmative that I've heard any of our analysts be on that issue well CNN did um a poll not long ago it shows I think it was last week it shows that uh Biden is trailing Donald Trump by six percentage points in the kind of the overall popular vote right now um more substantively though 538 which is a website that does opinion polling they're showing that Trump is leading uh uh Biden in six of the seven swing States there's no path forward for Joe Biden if he doesn't win a majority of those uh swing States so barring something cataclysmic I don't see how you know what the way forward is for the for the Biden campaign but the counterargument I suppose would be I mean Joe Biden May well lose but that doesn't necessarily mean is because of Gaza I believe recent polling shows that uh as far as priorities vot for for voters Gaza in the top five but it's not one two or three but it's enough you see it's it's enough to push those swing voters into the direction of of Donald Trump right we saw this happen at in Michigan Wisconsin and Minnesota and other states where people showed up to the polls at the primaries and just voted uncommitted undecided right so they were protest voting the numbers that we have just from those States would be enough based on the the 2020 election figures would be enough to propel Donald Trump to vict victory in those States so it's very damaging that same CNN poll by the way shows that 39% of college students in the United States are now identifying as Pro Palestinian only 11% are identifying as pro- Israelis those college students are going to vote in this upcoming election and they're going to have a a strong say in who the next president of the United States is but here's my question team Biden doesn't want to throw away this election under no circumstance under no pretext and for no reason do they want to sacrif I a second term right they don't want to throw away this election so I I listen to you and I assume that means they're making a different calculation yeah I mean if you're asking me to make sense of it I don't I I can't I am a little bit I can't make sense of it I'm I'm not the first person to say this in fact it's been months now where other analysts including in the United States have been saying that Biden has committed political suicide and that's the best I think that's the best two-word uh uh sort of description of what's what's happening here now why he's doing that that's anybody's you know best guess at this point I don't have a rational explanation why the Democrat this is for them this is a disaster to have Donald Trump reappear as the president second time over Trump 2.0 it would be a disaster for the Democrats but how can we explain 7 months of complicity uh in genocide as I said in the last interview well I think the first few months they didn't think it was going to cost them politically of course the wind has kind of turned well I I would argue that by about November it was it was pretty clear that this was a disaster not you know forget about the humanitarian side of things for a moment I think it was a disaster for the United States politically and I think we can see that if you go back and read some of the analyses that were published in November so I don't think the Biden Administration is going to have an excuse when it's all said and done they're going to have no one to blame but themselves Mohammad El MRI I I said there was a conversation waiting to happen on that issue right of of American support and why and what consequences it might have I'm glad that we took the time to have it thank you so much thanks okay let's go to Hy Mahmud uh honey you're in De darl Bala just outside the alaka hospital uh we we just heard the Gaza Civ Civil Defense Agency a few minutes ago talk from roughly where you're standing outside the hospital and what they were explaining honey is that this is the one thing that that that stayed with me will stay with me I think the longest they said they've carried out 37,000 missions since the beginning of this war that is the equivalent of 20 years of work at the pre-war rate yes absolutely and it does does show show the uh the the largest scale of of of Destruction across the Gaza Strip and the uh uh and around the hour uh they've been working they've been uh everywhere virtually across the Gaza Strip to areas that that have been bombed or targeted by the Israeli military doing their best and to the best of their capacity uh to provide help support and and help those who are trapped and under doubles or save those who are in targeted sites and and and that that large uh large number of of missions that been H performed by the civil defense crew to show how difficult the situations have been we we spoke briefly after the the press conference just to get a sense of of how they they manage all of this and it's beyond anyone could imagine the the level of of coordination and the the the level of of ability available given the fact that they've been deliberately targeted as well on the ground civil defense crew members the ground have been deliberately targeted by is military more than one time throughout uh the past seven months of this War uh we talked about the the challenges that are uh on every day at any given uh unfolding situation across the Gaza Strip and and the fact that there are evacuation orders from one place to another that has affected uh the uh the effectiveness and the level of response of the civil defense crew member to provide uh a efficient and and and and and emergency uh and a quick response uh to their work on on the ground uh the intense bombing campaign it's one of the things that pointed out as a major challenge uh to ensure safety for for civil defense crew member on the ground it has been quite difficult uh and we see them we we see them either in Rafa City uh or here in there balah within the past few days and and and they work more before that in the northern part and Gaza City under unusually difficult uh circumstances one thing that stands out right now other than the large number of of of missions H performed on the ground is the lack of equipment the lack of a proper Machinery uh they also in terms of Human Resources it has been quite difficult uh for them they lost many of the Civil defensive crew members they resorted into volunteering system and that as well is experiencing extreme shortage right now just given how difficult it is uh they're still uh performing uh a across STP trying to be at every targeted site at the best of their capacity but there is a a a a need a necessary need for help and support for the civil defense uh uh Department Civil Defense crew members on the ground in order to continue performing uh the lack of fuel right now is on top of the lack of Machinery equipment is affecting also the level of response and the their ability to move from from one place to another and to respond quickly to targeted sites yeah and I and I'll repeat what they said that they do this at extreme danger to themselves 39 civil defense Personnel have been killed since the beginning of the war hany Mahmud
