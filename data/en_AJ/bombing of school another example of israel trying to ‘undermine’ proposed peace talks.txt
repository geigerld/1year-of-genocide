let's take a look at the attacks carried out by Israeli forces on schools just this month on August the 1st the Dalal al- mrai Public School in eastern Gaza City was bombed killing at least 15 Palestinians 3 days later at least 17 Palestinians including children and women were killed in attack on alamna school and alhuda school both shelter displaced people in the shik radwan neighborhood west of Gaza City 30 people were killed on August 4th after Israeli war planes bombed Al Nasser and Hassan salame schools in the al- Nasser neighborhood and then on August the8th Israeli planes bombed the Abdul fat hamuda and Zahara schools in the east of Gaza City which housed thousands of displaced people 17 civilians there were killed well the Qatari foreign Ministry has released a statement saying that we strongly condemn the Israeli occupation's bombing of a school in the Gaza Strip we demand an International investigation that includes sending a un team to investigate the occupations targeting of schools we call on the International Community to protect the displaced and prevent the occupation from implementing its plans to forcibly displace them let's bring in Hassan barari he's a professor of international Affairs at katar University today he's with us live from am man Mr barari good to have you with us exasperated I think is what most analysts are by this ongoing targeting of either un facilities or un schools or something that is UN in Gaza where Palestinians are Sheltering or looking for Safe Haven that just isn't anywhere yeah this is you know this is part of the dominicide that Israel has been committing against the Palestinians they've been targeting hospitals and now schools back to back targeting of schools and this is a reflection of an Israeli mindset that wants to make Gaza really hard place to live in and this is also part of the pressure to put in Hamas in order to give in in any future talks uh but at the same time you know we if we put this in in a wider context it reflects the that Israel has been acting in bad faith when it comes to the talks that would be held uh probably in next Thursday uh and we have seen this movie before so every time there was a talk about peace talks and about truth the Israelis would would do something to undermine uh the the effort and I I think this is clear this time that netan is trying to uh um preempt the talks on on next Thursday what do you make of the the lack of international condemnation when it comes to attacks like this we it's not the first time that we're seeing this in 10 months we've seen what hundreds if not thousands of of attacks like this but you know when you have one that say largers up to 100 and maybe a lot more because that death toll will rise with those that have managed to reach hospital but perhaps won't survive it does make you wonder where the leaders of the world are in trying to reign in the attacks that civilians are experiencing in the Gaza Strip yeah so you're right the indifference in the part of the International Community and in action uh these reflect one basic reality that everybody else in the in the world is looking at the United States to do something to step in and make the difference but we know that the United States wouldn't do this for domastic reason and for also their their alliance with Israel so they don't see the Palestinian as the humans uh they talk about numbers of of people who were killed and injured but at the same time uh just if we just see things from different perspective if this happened in in Europe then the Americans would be up in arms condemning and doing something but when it comes to the Palestinians I think they adopt the Israeli narrative in terms of uh um the way they paint the Palestinian as a terrorist group and then should be uh dismantled from Gaza so as long as the American adop this position and this perspective we can see the International Community uh do anything independently and that's why indifference with would continue for time to come uh some might observe these ongoing negotiations as a bit of a political dance really time and time again we keep hearing There's A Renewed push for a ceasefire there are new talks going on and yet just as we also hear that the negotiating parties and the stakeholders are just about to sign on the dotted line Israel carries out another devastating attack that inevitably kills that conversation it's a tactic isn't it it is and every time we uh we argue that we are closer than ever to reaching a deal the Israel would come up with an atrocity that makes things difficult H and we know now for sure uh that Netanyahu is is not really a genuine partner to to any any truth or any peace talks uh he's using this in order to appease the opposition in internally especially the families of the hostages he wants to be seen as if he's doing something or as the prisoner and hostages are a priority for him when we know they are not uh but at the same time he plays into the hand of the ultra National rightwing component of his government and without them he can't really hold into Power H and he listens to them by perpetuating the conflict by um committing atrocities in order to make sure that any negotiations would fail Hassan barari it's always good to speak to you thanks so much for joining us from Aman in georia
