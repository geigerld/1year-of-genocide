welcome to the news ey Israel has Unleashed one of its worst attacks on Gaza since the War Began it claims the target was the head of hamas's military Wing Instead at least 90 displaced Palestinians were slaughtered after fighter jets and drones armed with missiles and bombs pounded their tents in almasi an area Israel said was safe hours after what's described as a massacre Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says there is no certainty that hamas's leader was killed now the bodies of innocent Palestinians are piling up many of them children Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war to achieve his goal no matter what the cost even a mounting civilian toll so let's H now from Israel's primee Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about that assault in southern Gaza the state of Israel through the military and chabak has conducted today an attack on Gaza in order to eliminate Muhammad and his Deputy RAF salami until now we are not 100% sure that they were terminated however I promise you that in any event we will reach every Hamas commander and leader Muhammad ad is a killer he's the man number two in Hamas chain of command he is the man who planned and led the October 7th Massacre as well as other terrorist operations he has the blood of many Israelis on his hands well thatu has also insisted that military pressure is the only solution to bring the captives home ham salute has been following those developments in Tel Aviv from the Jordanian Capital Aman Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is speaking at length in a press conference about the attack on the alasi area just west of Kan yunes that killed at least 90 Palestinians he said that this was an attempted assassination of hamas's military chief of the alasam brigades but the main point that Netanyahu was trying to make here is that he cannot say with 100% certainty if D was killed in this attack however Netanyahu says that just the attempt sends a message to the world he also pointed out that until all of the goals of the war are achieved the fighting in Gaza will continue even if there is a ceasefire I will not step away a single inch from The Proposal that was put forward by President Biden we will not any conditions however at the same time we will not allow Hamas to move away from The Proposal Hamas has requested 29 changes to the proposal however I told them that I shall not allow even a single change this proposal was blessed by President Biden and I insisted on four conditions that are already mentioned in the proposal now the attack on El maasi he said he approved after getting information from Israeli Security Services about if there were any captives being held in that area Israeli Security Services said no secondly he wanted to know about the types of Munitions that were used and about the collateral damage that would happen as a result Israel typically uses this justification for the killing of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip specifically for these last nine months saying that they are going to Target Hamas officials or Hamas sites without giving the evidence or the proof and then we see the reality on the ground of thousand hundreds and thousands of Palestinians who've been killed as a result of this Israeli policy now Benjamin Netanyahu maintains that the ceasefire negotiations had started up again because of the increased military pressure by the Army but again he says that the war will continue until he achieves what he calls an absolute Victory ham salut Al jazer am now the Israeli government has banned Al jazer from operating in Israel and that's why we're reporting from from neighboring Jordan now Hamas says Israel's claims are false and baseless earlier I spoke to the member of uh the group's political Bureau Basim name he talked about the current pace of ceasefire negotiations we should not discuss is he alive or dead because these are the Israel claims and allegations uh himself he is not sure if he achieved the target of their attacks uh but I can say that based on what Dr KH Haya he is the head of our negotiations team in his interview with Al jaaz Arabic he confirmed that Mr Muhammad our brother our leader Muhammad is now hearing and witnessing Netanyahu uh press conf and laughing about these uh claims and uh uh allegations okay so after the al- masasi attack then sir where does this leave the ceasefire negotiations as far as Hamas are concerned I think it is now known for everyone uh Hamas the mediators uh a most of the politicians especially in the Western countries the leaders know that Netanyahu is planning every day how to sabotage the Anan to reach a cir uh exactly if we can remember that on May May 6 when we have uh conveyed our message uh of acceptance to the uh prop you brokered uh proposal by the mediators on the same day he stormed RAF and attacked ra and cuite RAF cring the same attitude he has uh adopted every time when we near to reach a seare either he is creating new ideas new proposals new uh thoughts new or he is committing a crime inside G that that certainly the Israeli Prime Minister's position so I'm just asking you regardless of what's happened to al- masasi are you still willing to be part of the conversation are you still willing to talk about a ceasefire are you still actively engaged in those talks talks first of all now there are no active talks we are waiting for the Israeli response this is what we have received from the mediators that they have discussed with the Israeli delegations in Doha uh our remarks and our ideas about the latest uh proposal which is Biden's proposal that we have accepted this proposal but we have some remarks and now we are waiting for the Israeli response well let's bring it Al jaaz senior political analyst M Bashar joins us now via Skype from Paris hi marn I mean what was your impression of the Netanyahu press conference because one commentator we've spoken to uh on Al jazer in the last few hours said it was just really aimed for the domestic audience well I'm not sure about that it's much more than that it was I directed a domestic audience he's trying to project an image of Charisma and confidence but it was also uh directed at uh the United States the Arab world and in fact the world in general that Israel has an obstinate arrogant uh and rather inhumane leader a kind of a modernday musini what we have today is a fascist leader in Israel who could kill some hundred people including many children and uh not even uh blink once the capacity of this man to be so delusional as to think that he is uh basically winning or serving Israel's interest by killing more children by creating all kind of obstacles to a ceasefire including piling up the road to a ceasefire with the bodies of Palestinian children that kind of a leader that kind of a delusional leader that remains to be unpopular in his own country with over 75% of Israelis rejecting his mandate this man is proving more and more to be inhumane delusional and ultimately foolish but it also comes with arrogance and the kind of arrogance where you know he feels at ease lying to his teeth with every statement he says we need to know in the end of the day and that's the American needs to provide the answer do the Americans also agree with Netanyahu that there should be no end to the war is that what the American proposal is that no end into the war that is that Israel can continue to kill children each and every day that in fact Netanyahu is sticking to every aspect of Biden's initiative with all these killings in Gaza is that what's going on aren't the Israelis creating new obstacles so again that how the obstinate that delusional continues to lie to his St it was very telling Maran that he made it very clear that he didn't share information on this particular attack on al- maasi with the US for fear of leaks and Hamas hiding as he said it back in the tunnels what does this really tell us about the trust deficit between Tel Aviv and Washington DC there's no doubt that Nat is trying to run the clock on Biden and there's no doubt that Netanyahu is not listening to what the Americans are saying and the Americans are not putting any pressure on the N government already uh President Biden lacks the political Capital necessary to put pressure on Netanyahu and as we know and as we've heard from netan himself he's preparing himself in a number of days on the 24th of July to address both houses of Congress I think if I'm not mistaken to for the fourth time that we make him the first leader ever to address both houses of Congress so a leader that is basically accused of war crimes a war criminal in fact uh who the IC is trying to you know uh get him uh for his war crimes is received in Washington with open arms so you could say or he could say that you know he needed to do this uh secretly within Israel but in the end of the day there is some tension arising to the surface between Israel and the United States we understand that the Biden Administration despite its uh unconditional support to for genocide over for some seven months or more it is now uh you know uh more tuned to winding down the war as it were but not Nan Nan has a personal ambition has ideological ambition political ambition to continue with the war and as I said he's just going to continue to pile up the road to a ceasefire with the bodies of Palestinian children I mean we need to think about that so just for a moment here while we're talking about all the complex political issues about siire the man just killed 100 people today I mean shouldn't that matter to the rest of the world he claims to have done it in order to Target this one man but this is certainly a war crime there's absolutely no doubt about that well there isn't any doubt perhaps in the mind of the Egyptians they are mediators and all of this uh Maran and you know there are news wires dropping as though they have been after that attack on alasi saying that the Egyptians are putting the talks on hold the mediation on hold because and we quote Israel isn't serious it's more than yes it's absolutely true it's not serious but it's more dangerous more Reckless than that because you have a a fascist government head by a fascist musolini and the new Israeli DOI right or B as it were this Netanyahu fascist character right that is ready to kill not just tens of thousands but judges from his sentiment about continuing an endless war he wants to kill hundreds of thousand people he wants to ethnically Clans Gaza this is certainly not to the liking of the Egyptians who are trying to work out some kind of a settlement on their border with Gaza with Palestine the Egyptians who have had 45 years of a peace agreement with Israel understand very well and they are the moderate right in all of that Friends of the Americans friend of Israel and so on so forth and they're really getting crazy with netanyahu's recklessness and and Butchery in Gaza and that's what it is it's a one Massacre after another it's a total Butchery that cannot be to the to the liking of any Arab leader and it's really shameful Shameless for the Arab leaders for the Palestinian leaders to be silent while hundreds of people are getting killed every day while children pile up the road to the so-called ceasefire we'll leave it there for the moment Maran uh M Bashar there our senior political analyst thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
