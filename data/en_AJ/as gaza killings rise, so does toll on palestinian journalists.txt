as the death toll in Gaza Rises so does the toll on Palestinian journalists in its annual report the committee to protect journalists said 99 journalists and media workers worldwide were killed while doing their job last year they include 72 Palestinian journalists killed by Israeli forces that's nearly 75% of the worldwide total last year was the highest number of recorded deaths of journalists since 2015 and the period with most fatalities since the organization began documenting them in 1992 and even when they're not on the job Palestinian journalists living in Gaza face the risk of Israeli bombardment the Gaza media office says at least 126 Palestinian media workers have been killed since Israel's War Began journalists working in Conflict areas are protected under International humanitarian law Palestinian journalists accuse Israel of repeatedly violating that law and of killing colleagues who are telling the world what's happening in Gaza well we can now speak to jod Ginsburg from New York who's the president of the committee to protect journalists thanks for your time with us on Al jazer so as I just read out uh your your report uh the statistic is is that more than three4 of the 99 journalists and media workers who died worldwide in 2023 were killed in Israel's war on Gaza I mean this is a very very depressing statistic and really illustrates how deadly this war has been on journalists and particularly Palestinian journalists absolutely this war is unprecedented in terms of the threat to journalists we documented 77 journalists killed in the Israel Gaza War 72 of those are Palestinians and what's important to remember about this particular war is that Gaza and journalists are the only journalists able to report on what's Happening inside Gaza International journalists have not been able to get in they've not been allowed in except on very very controlled um trips that are overseen by the Israeli Army so we are entirely reliant on those journalists who are risking their lives to bring us this story and um in your mind is there any uh doubt that journalists are being targeted in this war we're investigating at least a dozen cases where we think that journalists have been deliberately targeted we've seen the case for example of Isam abdah the reuter journalist who was killed on the Lebanese border there have been a number of independent reports indicating that he was clearly wearing uh uh he was clearly wearing press Insignia he was with other journalists in an area known to be an area where journalists operate um and yet was targeted by Israeli uh by an Israeli strike and and there are a number of other cases that we're looking into as you were just saying the the Vas majority of the journalists 72 uh were killed in in the Israeli attacks on Gaza look there's been a lot of criticism sort of over double standards do you think that the global reaction would have been different the outrage would have been a little bit more if um these were Western journalists for example Israel has long been one of the most divisive uh divisive countries to cover I've been a journalist for 25 years and and that's long been the the country the the issue that has divided International media International politicians more than anything um so it's S unsurprising I think that we've seen a hesitancy to come out publicly in support of our journalist colleagues in Gaza who are doing work that the International journalistic Community is entirely reliant on to bring it the information uh to bring the public public information about the war inside Gaza so as the president of the committee to protect journalists are you disappointed that there have it been more calls louder calls of enough is enough of the killing of these journalists and as you're saying in some cases the targeting of them I am disappointed frankly at the lack of public solidarity that we've seen I think it's really important that we let our colleagues inside Gaza but also in the region know that we stand with them that we're there to support them so that we can make sure that that the Press freedom and journalists are protected not just at this moment at this crucial moment in Gaza but also globally at a time when journalists are under threat everywhere what can more can organizations like yours do I mean the the I know that you've said that the cpj has raised concerns about the apparent targeting of members of the media by by Israeli forces besides uh raising concerns I mean what more needs to be done now what type of action needs to be taken well it's very important that these killings are thoroughly investigated and that those responsible are held accountable we're still in the middle of a war so we don't expect those investigations to take place now we're pushing for international mechanisms to make sure that those are properly investigated uh we can use mechanisms including icj the international uh the ICC um un bodies there are a number of bodies that we can use to push for this um unfortunately Justice takes a long time and we don't expect that to be to happen immediately but we continue to do the work of documenting the painstaking work of documenting that will hopefully provide the evidence that can be used when these cases uh are fully brought to investigations all right Jody Ginsburg thank you for joining us from New York thank you
