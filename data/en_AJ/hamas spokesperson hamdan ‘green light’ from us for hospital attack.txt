want to bring Russell s in now he's alzer's senior correspondent and you've covered the Middle East extensively give us a sense where we're at in terms of this conflict compared to all the other conflicts that we've seen just how much has this escalated well first this is quite different did this divers from the previous U Israeli attack on Gaza in terms of its scale so now what we seeing we're simply talking about the transfer of the population over 2 million people this is that this is something that has repeatedly been uh been said and publicly announced by many of the Israeli officials that they want Egypt to open up Rafa border crossing not only for the humanitarian Aid to arrive indeed actually for more than 1 million Palestinians to pass through that Crossing border crossing and to siai so simply they talking about the the the the the population transfer this is quite a new element in this sense and also in terms of the scale of the violation is definitely much much bigger than the previous ones that we have seen in 2021 in 2018 14 and and and before so but here um what we can see is the the the the the the Israeli operation is now not only trying to deter Hamas but rather to make Hamas to to make um the the the Gaza as an inhabitable city a city that people cannot leave anymore so it's indirectly also forcing people out of Gaza in that sense because we have seen tens of towers uh the the the the health facilities including Al Al Baptist hospital that just has been hit and we're hearing that at least more than 500 people have been killed the roads are now collapsed the whole infrastructure is is simply being leveled so a city that is definitely not not going to be suitable to live in so in the directly they're trying to now the the the scale of the destruction is just trying to make Gaza turn Gaza into a city that is simply inhabitable for the people so in that sense it's not only a punishment as well and what we can see through the way that Israel is conducting its attacks it seems that they want a Gaza without Palestinians and also inflicting the fear the constant fear and Terror here that actually Gaza is not a safe place not for Hamas but for all the civilians that eventually they can see how a Gaza without Palestinians and definitely that is putting a huge pressure in the regional actors on the regional actors particularly Egypt in that sense okay Russell I want you to stay with me because joining us on the phone now is is senior Hamas leader Asama Hamden hello there Asama you have Emily anguin and rill s here on the desk with you first of all I'll ask you a question what's your reaction to the strike on the hospital this evening well it's clear that the Israelis are committing a crime a crime War when you talk about the hospital we are talking about more than 500 Palestinians were killed they are all civilians we are talking about most the children and women who believes that the hospital is a a safe shelter for them while Israel is bombing Gaza uh I I I believe that this strike will not take place unless there was unfortunately a green light from the United States everyone understands that Lincoln had spent yesterday night with the cabinet for five uh more than 5 hours and tomorrow everyone is expecting President Biden to visit the region and to have a meeting in in in am with Arab leaders uh King Abdullah president CCE and mahmmed Abbas it's clear that they are preparing the land for something to tell everyone that all the needed uh all the needed steps have been done to evacuate Gaza which is which will not take place I believe the Palestinians themselves will not leave uh and the Arab countries will not accept that uh uh I have to say we are watching we are seeing a war crime not from the Israelis but also committed by the Americans they are rizing Israel they are sending weap for is in ama so here there have been some of the allegations particularly reported by the Israeli media that actually it was a Hamas rocket that uh let just uh hit the hospital well uh let's let's say that that two points the Israelis have talked about killing the civilians and now they are killing the civilians by themselves showing the whole world that they were lying and at Point everyone knows and watches what hamash Rockets are doing in the isra in in in the cities of bistan andon and and T Aviv there is no destruction like this happening there so if someone wants to claim that it's a he had to show us where that happened other other places the third point and now we are investigating to bring out the pieces of the Rus which was uh which targeted the hospitals we know the American weapons we know the pieces of the American weapons and everyone knows that in 2014 is attacked the schools and the centers of the Ona they claimed at that time that Hamas was using those places as as the places to to to to launch rockets against Israel the honor investigated that the UN investigated that and they've said clearly Israel was lying Usama so um there have been some reports that Hamas is ready to release the the the captives if Israel stops its attacks can you confirm that well abua spokeman of ala brigades have said that clearly we could considered the people who were taken not from the military of Hamas from others if they were not soldiers they are even they they are guests and we will release them when the war is over because we can't guarantee their safety he said that in public it's not a secret and I think some some uh media are using that because they they are they expressing that by their their own way nothing new in the issue we believe that uh uh no one can turn the attention from the crime of the Israelis by talking about other issues the main issue now is the the the Holocaust which is taking which is taking place in GZA we are talking about uh before that Massacre we were talking about 3,000 Palestinians who were killed 1,000 Palestinians who who under the destroyed houses now you you are talking about more than ,000 Palestinians are being added in one strike that shows the the is humanitarian catastrophe is is just now unfolding in Gaza no question about that but what's your condition of releasing the Israeli captives well it's clear that the Israeli War prisoners uh will be released in a prisoners exchange if our prisoners were released from the Israeli jail that that's clear and everyone knows that from day number one so uh Usama um um president Mahmud Abbas has just cut his travel to Jordan he was supposed to meet uh American President Joe Biden there but now he cut his his his trip there and he's coming back to ramala as the streets are now um protesting so do you think that there's a chance of a kind of reconciliation between Hamas and PLO or could these open up an opportunity for somehow for two parties to communicate again well it's clear that we have started that in in Cairo uh before the last attack against Hamas and we are willing to have a Reconciliation between Hamas and fat and I believe what is going on now in the Israeli attack and in the politics uh will bring the Palestinians together back because blink ideas were clear there will be no Palestinian state in West Bank if you want the Palestinian State you can have it other places is West Bank is for the Israelis those are the ideas which was told by blinkin to mahm Abbas and I think Biden will say nothing more than this coming back to ramal under those circumstances is a is a step in the right direction and I hope that we can build on that and we will do our best to build on that to unite the Palestinian against the Israeli attacks against the Israelis Israeli government who is working hard to get rid of the Palestinians they are not talking about transferring the Palestinians just only from Gaza they have talked clearly SM Rich B fear they've talked clearly about deporting the Palestinians from West Bank and they were talking about deporting them to build more C Usama just coming back to the the the the issue of the captives there at least are you ready to to to to release the non military civilians that are now captive in in in in Gaza do you have any condition for that well Abu have said clearly the spokeman of Bri sorry of Alan brigades that we consider them as guests where we will release them as soon as the wars ends to guarantee their safety without conditions okay thank you we're going to leave it there Russell s thank you very much that was Asama Hamden the senior Hamas leader Asama Hamden there okay um Russell just while we're waiting to cross to Washington obviously plenty of developments this evening that we need to break down and something quite significant that we've just heard from the heras leader indeed saying that he or they are prepared to release the civili cilian yeah captives was that your understanding captiv unconditionally but not he's not talking about the the those who are the solders or military personnel so what if anything do you think that would Pro will what if anything impact wise will that have on the current situation look at on October 7th so simply Israel had the moral High Ground because it was attacked by Hamas but day by day Israel is losing that ground and now people more and more coming forward and uh raising their voices uh about what uh Israel is doing in in in Gaza and so Israelis have been very much building up on the civilians that are now captive uh in Gaza and if Hamas releases that probably that is also going to give another momentum to to to to to to to the people who are not protesting against Israel so in that sense probably this moral ground is shifting from one side to another and if that happens so Hamas probably will have the opportunity of saying that this is happening just between the Armed Forces not that that they're not targeting the is Israeli civilians this is an argument that Israel have been has been building up on so in that sense simply just militarizing the issue and is losing the moral High Ground there okay wrestle s we'll cross back to you for your further analysis throughout the evening
