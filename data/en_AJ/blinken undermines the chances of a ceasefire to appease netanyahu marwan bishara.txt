Maran Bashar is Al jazer senior political analyst he joins us now by Skype from London are the discussions moving into a different phase yeah you could say that I think the United States um bridging proposals turned out to be more of a betrayal proposals betrayal of their own role as mediators not that they have been uh honest Brokers by any measure but they had to maintain some uh some form of appearance of objectivity of neutrality some form of it so that the process would be credible so that they can get away with whatever they could get away with but at this point in time watching blinking do what blinking does best is appease Israel walk in its footsteps defend it justify it now he's calling netanyahu's so-called red lines or a version of them bridging there's nothing bridging about that I've never seen something of a gap uh getting bigger than under blink I suppose Hamas now finds itself yet again in the position of accusing Israel and particularly Netanyahu of not being serious about a deal while at the same time not wanting to be blamed for the failure of these talks absolutely that's why it finds itself once again uh being cornered uh it's once again being trapped and it's mostly because of the United States because we know where Israel has been throughout this process they are against the ceasefire they're against the permanent ceasefire but the United States kept polishing the Israeli position and and revering the Israeli position so that it will be acceptable uh somehow passable especially through you know Egypt andq and so on so forth and every time the Hamas the Palestinians made concessions accepted another American dictat is the Israelis added new conditions to it and forcing the Palestinians to accept yet more concessions but at this point in time after so many concessions been done you know the whole point of a ceas fire is no longer there now we're really talking about a pause whereby Israel's captives are released and Israel's resumes the war whenever or uh as it wishes this is this is a terrible terrible development for those who you know at least wanted to see this and and believe me I'm a very realist person in in foreign relations and I can see that diplomacy is the continuation of War by other means I mean I understand very well that Israel and the United States think that they won this war and that they have to impose their dictat but I also understand there was a genocide the past 10 months and that that the only way you can deal with genocide 10 months later is to give people a break not 5 months break but just to give them a damn break to let them reconstruct their lives to let them live in peace for whatever time but not just to keep uh trapping them again and again in order to rec carry the genocide that that they've been carrying in a region that is so qualify and speaking of the region Maran how would a stalemate in the negotiation or a collapse in these talks affect Iran and hezbollah's calculations does it make an attack more likely particularly ahead of November absolutely absolutely I mean because they've committed to it not because I think so I mean they've really committed to it and uh some unknown spokesperson said if there is a ceas fire or there's real talks for a ceasefire well it's going to be hard for us to hit so probably this thing will be postponed perhaps indefinitely but if this is all turned out to be one big betrayal not bridging and if it's all one big trap uh for the Palestinians and for Iran and Hezbollah well then something got to give eventually and believe me I mean I don't know what Iran is capable or not capable of what is willing to do what it's not willing to do how much it's ready to go out there and risk its own National Security I don't know right or the same goes for Hezbollah and Lebanon but wherever can hit Israel and the United States now in terms of their credibility in terms of their arrogance in terms of their uh uh stuck upness you know I think everyone is just going to be drooling in pleasure over it because the way they've been handling this genocide the way they've been underlining the way they've been covering up for each other it makes any attack it makes any explosion any implosion it makes any Outburst to be almost forgiven able although I and countless other people like you and so on so forth we all just want peace and security we would want some stability we want some Freedom we want the end of genocide a real permanent ceasefire but if they keep playing these game these very very Reckless and dangerous games and if Lincoln keeps covering up for Israel you know the way he does with with such you know well I know some words should not be used but be that as it may this could lead to some serious consequences if not today later on okay well thank you very much Al jaer senior political analyst Maran bashara make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
