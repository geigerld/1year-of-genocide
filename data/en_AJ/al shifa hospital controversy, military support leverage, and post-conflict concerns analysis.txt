joining us live from Montreal Canada is Middle East analyst muan Rabani can I start by asking you this because you recently wrote that the United States is an active and complicit partner in gaza's Killing Fields and that the Biden Administration are proud even boastful of its role do you think that Still Remains the case given the change in US rhetoric surrounding the Israeli operation around Al shifer hospital I think that's certainly the case I mean we only have to look at what American officials were saying yesterday when Israeli forces were on the verge of invading the alifa hospital uh compound you had the spokesperson of the US National Security Council John Kirby coming out lying through his teeth with a statement that us intelligence had confirmed information that there is a Hamas command and control center underneath alifa hospital this wasn't bad intelligence he knew he was deliberately providing falsehoods to the media in order to justify and support an Israeli invasion of a Palestinian hospital so I see no reason to uh revise my assessment in any way I just wonder to what extent I should just add if I may I should the result of this of course is that um the Israelis today have treated us to the most dramatic moment in television since Heraldo Rivera broke open Al Capone's vault uh in the 1980s and found absolutely nothing yeah I just wonder how dramatic um the Israeli military the Israeli government needs things to get for them to be able to declare at least a strategic win what does success look like for them do you think I don't I don't think they have a idea of what victory looks like I think the one thing that the entire Israeli leadership appears to be United about is that there needs to be an orgy of Revenge that they need to achieve a Palestinian body count which is many times higher than was the Israeli body count on October 7th um and I should add you know a very typical um Israeli Israeli Warfare uh maneuver so you know whether they managed to eradicate Hamas overthrow its government these are all things they would like to do I think both the Israelis and the Americans recognize that it's beyond the capacity of Israeli Ground Forces so what do you do you make the Gaza Strip unfit for human habitation you destroy civilian infrastructure you raise entire neighborhoods or towns uh to the ground and you kill um thousands and thousands of people and thereby hope that in future um uh these people who you've colonized and brutalized will be deterred from ever raising their heads again you get the sense that the United States is carefully watching the clock when it comes to all of this of course the US default position is to back Israel politically militarily but we are noticing very subtle attempts to get Israel to moderate its campaign they clearly seem to have failed how long can the US let this unbridled violence continue well I don't think that the United States yesterday giving in is giving Israel a green light to invade a shifa hospital suggests that the US is is pressing Israel to moderate its campaign I will however say this and it is speculative um but as you know um the United States has been negotiating through Qatar uh to examine the prospects of a prisoner exchange through which um civilians and dual Nationals and American citizens would be released by Hamas and others holding them in the Gaza Strip Israel has thus far rejected um this proposal it may well have been the case that the Americans told the Israelis we will Greenlight your invasion of an shifa hospital and if you don't find anything we then expect you to sign on to this uh prisoner exchange uh deal and and let it go through again it's speculative but that may well be the case if that is indeed the case we could be entering a a wholly new phase in this conflict um muan Rabani thank you very much for your analysis thanks for joining us thank you
