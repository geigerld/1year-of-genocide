we begin in Gaza where entire neighborhoods have been reduced to Rubble at least 1,100 Palestinians have been killed during a Relentless campaign of Israeli strikes gaza's sole power plant has run out of fuel and medicines and essential supplies are also running out humel s has more from Gaza a woman gives her baby a final kiss before she's or he stucken away to an early grave one glimpse of the tragedy spreading through Gaza since Saturday Palestinians are bearing the brunt of War on a scale they haven't seen before there's been no let up in the Israeli bombardment of The Enclave on Wednesday these aerial shot charts show the extent of the devastation Israeli air strikes have reduced buildings to rubble and sent people scrambling for safety homes and businesses destroyed phone and internet services cut and water and electricity supplies interrupted we were residents of what was once alarama the entire area was level to the ground this is total destru total Annihilation hundreds of Palestinians have been killed and thousands injured graa hospital is one of the roughly 20 hospitals in the Gaza Strip and it's at full capacity it doesn't have enough staff or medicine to treat the number of wounded another worry is a lack of fuel to operate the generators Israel's total Siege means no supplies can enter Gaza look behind you along those streets and alleys hundreds are killed and buried under the debris we have been abandoned by the Arabs the whole world is watching in silence tens of thousands of Palestinians have lost their homes but they have nowhere to go the border crossings with Israel and Egypt are closed food and water supplies are running low meaning not only they are facing the threat of bombs and bullets but also of hunger and thirst with entire neighborhoods r and fears of an Israeli ground Invasion Aid agencies are calling for humanitarian corridors and for regional and international intervention yid Al jazer Gaza T Abu AUM is inside Gaza for us and it's just gone 1 p.m. there it's almost a complete blackout behind you can you just explain what it is like that who still has power and how people are coping well uh the after the run out of fuel for the O uh Power Plant station inside the Gaza Strip in terms of generating electricity Gaza right now as you can see behind me right now is uh sink in darkness that uh the majority of areas in Gaza Strip uh doesn't have any kind of electric current so it means that uh the the catastrophic conditions of the humanitarian aspect inside the gasa strip is dictating at the same time now the majority of Palestinians are depending on some alternative sources of energy that might be also uh run out of uh of service during the coming hours as the crisis continues as well uh now in this hard the the humanitarian conditions gazers are trying to invest in every single source of energy or even source of food supplies to be used as long as they can in order to avoid more deterioration in their conditions now obviously in regards to power especially in the in the coming days what is the greatest concern looking ahead from this point on well the growing concern for the majority of gazans that the continuation of uh borders and uh borders shuttering and the prevention of the inry of the humanitarian AIDS and even the basic needs for Gant for living could be the the worst shadow that Palestinians are really afraid of and the majority of them are facing a looming of a humanitarian crisis that will even be deteriorating of the current situation will goes on and will go on and the majority of human rights organization and even the World Health Organization has called The International Community to open humanitarian corridors to help Palestinians in their condition so as the as the crisis continues inside the Gaza STP Palestinians are in a great fear full of frustration and depression in terms of the ongoing crisis of the enclaved territory after 5 days of of living uh with this of bombardments from Israel into the strip I mean has that impaired Hamas at all from being able to launch its own rockets and return all right uh uh oh my gosh it was so close for us that way this explosion has been right now here uh inside the Gaza strip after the Israeli warships had launched uh bages of uh let's say uh strikes in the uh towards the uh Gaza uh city as well now let's come back to the original question that is does the Israeli strike affector in the Hamas movement ability to uh to keep launching rockets in fact uh the at 900 a.m. at 9:00 p.m. tonight uh the uh the uh the Palestinian Fighters launched dozens of bages of Rockets towards the Israeli settlements uh own retaliation to what is happening inside the Gaza Strip and from time to time we can hear even the sound of the Rockets firing from the Gaza Strip towards the adjacent settlement of Israel okay thank you so much uh for that that is TQ Abu AUM for us inside Gaza thank you Maran jalani director general of Palestine red cresant Society joins us now from rala thank you very much for taking the time to speak to us here on Al jazer now I understand first of all a number of your people were killed today can you explain exactly what happened where they were and and how they were killed yes thank you uh these are the the darkest days for the medical teams and specifically for Palestine red crescent emergency medical volunteers and staff today we lost four four of our colleagues three of them got a direct hat uh while they were attending to some of the injured ER in the jabalia area the fourth the fourth person went to attend to a a number of people who were injured and who needed medical attention and we had in this case we had coordinated this Mission with with the international Committee of the Red Cross we were given the green light to go ahead to that area because it was on the border area in the east of Gaza mhm while they were attending and they were putting one dead body into Into the Dead bags one of our Medics was shot straight in the back and through the heart and obviously he he we lost the fourth person in less half in less than half an hour this is a very very tragic situation our people are stressed out they are exhausted and we have never seen such atrocities we've never seen such a deliberate targeting in this manner of medical missions who are fulfilling a humanitarian assistance to the people who need ex that's exactly what I wanted to ask you about do you believe it is deliberate targeting cuz I IM that your your people are uh wearing you know very obvious medical uh red cresant Society uh paraphernalia that makes them easily identify identifiable as medical workers a true our cars are clearly the signs the emblem that is protected under international law is visible from land and air that we have the we have numbers on top of the cars the ambulances and pcas cars who are communicated to the Israeli authorities a there is no way to mistaken the teams the medical teams with their protective emblem their their vest their uniform our cars obviously and confuse them with anything else but this is not an isolated incident we have reported since the beginning of of this uh this crisis in the last 5 days more than 30 violations not only in Gaza but also on the West Bank including live bullet fired at our ambulances we Face harassments we Face intimidation our teams are beaten up our teams the guns are pointed to the faces of our Medical Teams at checkpoints there are so many violations against those paramedics in every Mission they try to go and help those people the sick and the wounded and these are deliberate and we have communicated this to all International organizations we have complained we have raised the issue of the of the protection of our teams and the necessity for the the the conflicting parties to respect international law and respect the mission of our Medical Teams now we know First Responders uh the first to run into the face of danger but does this make you rethink or make your teams rethink doing that in in this scenario when you do feel like you are being deliberately targeted believe me after the killing of those four people this was the worst moment in in the entire history of our society in the entire history of this long conflict our people were devastated they were crying they were hugging each other and they didn't know what to do except to wipe their tears and go out again and face those atrocities this danger this total IGN ignorance of or ignoring of the international law and of the medical missions we we have raised this issue with all International organizations the pro the problem today is Israel and the Israeli authorities are not listening to any not only not listening to the anybody there is no mechanism at all to coordinate medical missions so they shut off all the international organizations including International Committee of the Red Cross including the United Nations when we ask them how can we coordinate so that our teams are protected how can we coordinate so we can reach to areas where there are so many dead bodies in the street and they say the Israelis are not responding at all and this is quite tragic and these are considered war crimes to Target Medical Teams yes to Target civilians and to leave them under the rubble and to leave the injured without any possibility of access to them Maran we really do appreciate your time and explaining the situation as it is for you and and your people working in uh quite remarkable circumstances that is Maran jalani director general of the Palestine of red Cresent Society thank you so much thank you well Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reached to deal with the leader of the opposition to form an emergency wartime Unity government eleras H abdalhamid is in West Jerusalem and joins us now now uh hter can you just explain a little bit more about this war cabinet that was set up earlier today and uh what power what control it will have over Israel's military well the agreement that was reached between prime minister Netanyahu and Benny Gans who's the leader of the national Unity opposition party is to form what is called an emergency Unity government now within that emergency do Unity government there are two different forums or committees there what is could be referred to as the war cabinet and that is uh a restricted uh committee it is a prime minister nanahu Benny Gans the opposition leader the defense minister yuav gal and then you have two more people who are Danny Eisen c and a former Israeli ambassador to the US who are also sitting on that committee but as uh observers now I think why the formation of that gives prime minister Netanyahu three people who actually have extensive military uh knowledge because whether it's Benny Gans or Danny as in code both of them were former Chiefs of Staff and Benny Gans as well was defense minister they will be in charge of the war all the the important decisions of the war the everyday planning of the war you have then a larger uh a larger Forum which is called the um political security cabinet which includes all the members of the ruling Coalition the defense and intelligence establishment added to that Benny Gans and some members of his National Unity party so you have these two together the that is it it has several benefits that Benjamin Netanyahu has his coalition government but the very few members of that government have actually military experience so he stands all to gain from bringing on board the the opposition leader and picking his brain basically on what to do next it also gives the Israeli public the idea that at the moment these politicians who are usually at alls remember this country had five elections in a span of four years only just a week just days before the this uh War started that they were still having bitter fights they were weekly demonstrations against um the Prime Minister Netanyahu and his ruling Coalition well at the moment the idea is all this has gone We Stand United in this time of Crisis something many Israelis would tell you they wanted to see because at the moment we are in this phase two the the clearing of the bodies the the death toll of what happened on the first day of the attack is now sortly kind of over the next phase is being prepared and many think that that would be a ground Invasion okay thank you so much that is ABD Hamid for us in West jerus m a rocket fired from Gaza has hit a hospital in the southern Israeli city of ashalon no casualties have been reported Hamas has launched a barrage of rockets targeting ashalon most of them were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome defense system but there are reports of damage to some buildings in the city for more on this Muhammad Jam Jun is in ashdod southern Israel and uh Muhammad what's the latest you're hearing about these security incidents in the area in the the South there Tom let me walk you through uh the various security alerts we've been hearing about the last half an hour to an hour um you have had rocket Sirens going off in several different towns and cities and communities in southern Israel bordering the Gaza Strip among them are n where we also learned from the Israeli Army that there had been an incident uh an exchange of fire between Hamas Fighters and and Israeli Army members the Israeli Army says that there were three Hamas fighters in a vehicle and that an Israeli army tank fired upon them and that threat has been thwarted we are trying to get more information about that we'll get those details to you as we have them another area where there have been Sirens heard is stot and another one is the city of ashalon which you mentioned in your intro to me of course there had been those rocket strikes that hit ashalon which is about 10 to 15 kilometers south of where we are here in ashod so a lot of tension in that area of course a lot of people very concerned about the fact that there have been more reported incursions in various areas in the South today by Hamas Fighters we've heard about fighting going on between Israeli Army members and Hamas fighters in places like zakim which is about 3 to 4 kmers north of the Gaza Strip so a lot of tension still at this hour about if there are more incursions or if there are the threat of incursions by Hamas fighter in these areas so right now even though where we are here in ashod where we did hear rocket Sirens earlier in the day the tension has lessened here but further on South much higher tension at this hour and a lot of security security incidents going on as we are as we have been informed by the Israeli Army thus far with with so much going on how are people reacting to it there Tom I can tell you that everybody that I've spoken with the past couple of days in these areas in the South um they are still dealing with a huge sense of shock many of them telling me that they have not yet fully really been able to process the enormity of what has happened what has transpired over the course of these last several days since Saturday um one of the things uh that is that is seems to be um helping the people that we're talking to here uh is the fact that they are seeing uh more and more members of the Israeli Army being mobilized to the South you could be anywhere in these areas and you see what a mass mobilization it is going on you see uh Army members you see reservists you see police in all of these areas you see them being transported you seeing D you seeing them driving driving themselves by car to join up with their units uh so there is this sort of rally around the flag effect that's going on and so even the people that we're speaking with that are still shocked and concerned about what's going on they are coming out a lot of the time and showing their support for the troops that they are seeing whether it's by offering them water or food or even sometimes blaring music uh I mean there have been real scenes that we've come across at times of really heightened tensions the past couple of days where you will see Cars full of settlers coming to intersections where there are members of the Israeli Army and members of the reservist and they will blast their speakers and get up on the roofs of cars and dance it's it's a very jarring thing to see at a time of such high tension and uncertainty everybody we've spoken with say they do believe that an invasion a land uh invasion of Gaza will be happening at some point soon they don't know exactly when of course the Israeli Army has not announced that but the people we're speaking with do believe that is going to happen at some point quite soon Tom okay thank you so much Muhammad we really do appreciate you painting the picture there for us and what it is like in southern Israel thanks well Israel's military says it's recaptured some areas near the Gaza border the village of kafara was among the communities hit hardest when Hamas launched its military operation on Saturday as Charles statford reports from the scen dozens of bodies have been recovered Israel's military says it's is back in control of kafar AAR one of the many villages near the Gaza border where Palestinian Fighters got in but soldiers are nervous about more infiltrations and Hamas gunmen hiding in the surrounding Fields heavy machine gun fire close by and the bodies lying in the trees begin to appear Palestinian Fighters and then amongst the destruction of their homes civilians soldiers lift the body bags on stretches to a waiting truck there's still grenades there's still bodies in houses and slowly slowly we're now clearing these communities whoever survived this is already out of here still counting the bodies dozens weapons lie amongst the rubble a destroyed paraglider on which one of the fighters flew in the broken Security Fence one of dozens of places breached what you're looking at there is one of the breach points through which Hamas Fighters came into Israel there's been a lot of Destruction here in the village of kafar AAR we've seen a lot of bodies and the military tell us that they are not only Hamas Fighters but foreign workers and many Israeli civilians the road to nearby stot is littered with destroyed cars and more bodies close by the smoldering ruins of a Cosmetics Factory destroyed by one of the thousands of rockets f from Gaza and suddenly The Ripping sound of another approaching barrage filming keep filming keep filming stop shelter we've been in contact with somebody that lived through that nightmare we need to kill them we need to strangle them otherwise it will continue we can't go back to giving them food water Building Material really we should not give them these things the buildup of military equipment near the border continues as Israel vows Vengeance for an attack on a scale it has never suffered before Charles stford Al jazer kafar AAR okay let's look at some of the headlines today across Israel the newspaper Israel H focuses on political leadership saying the current government is conspicuous by its absence it highlights former prime minister gamir going out to meet soldiers in the 1973 Arab Israeli War and says the essence of leadership is to be on the ground with the people a columnist for the haritz daily has taken his criticism one step further Z barel describes Benjamin n yahu as a gang leader and reiterates the paper calls for the prime minister to resign the Jerusalem Post focuses on warfare It quotes an officer who says the Israeli Army is bombing entire neighborhoods in Gaza to hit Hamas positions but he says the campaign is not the same as Hamas targeting civilians on Saturday for Israel he maintains there is always a military Target but we are not being surgical well similar arguments are made in the online publication waa it's carrying an interview with the general who says civilians are not targets but also that no warnings are given when forces are targeting an enemy now a journalist for the online magazine 972 questions a report widely circulated on social media on Tuesday alleging Hamas Fighters beheaded babies in kafar AA in a post on X Oren Z says the Israeli military spokespeople he interviewed at the site could not confirm the reports and support from the White House is also on the front pages The Times of Israel interviewed US national National Security Council spoke spokesman John Kirby who says America shares Israel's deep fear and anger now underlining the unconditional relationship between the two countries Oman Bashar Al jazer senior political analyst joins us once again on Skype from Paris and M what do you make of some of I guess the critical reaction from the Israeli media what stands out there for you well clearly at this point in time um there's one or two brother sober media Outlets notably harit the most professional newspaper in Israel um you could you could call it the New York Times of Israel uh and it has a number of colonists and and reporters that tend to be critical of the Netanyahu government and tend to give a better more uh Fair coverage uh of the uh of the occupied Palestinian territories and I think Z bared is one of their uh senior uh commentators for a long time he was editor of the Arab Affairs at the newspaper and I think he does reflect uh a certain criticism a certain critique of prime minister Netanyahu that is um is not widespread for the time being I only heard mhi yon a former head of intelligence who also shared uh it's vel's appreciation that Netanyahu is a failed leader and the last thing he should be is a war leader uh because certainly this whole thebuckle under happened under his watch and there's a major accusations built on the idea that even Egypt uh has warned uh Israel of uh of the coming attacks but uh because Netanyahu refused to let uh the intelligence Chiefs to come into the cabinet meetings and update them on that that basically Netanyahu failed not only to stop this thing from happening he only should have known about it at least from the Egyptians and at Le he did nothing about it the overall sentiments in Israel as you know is more or less rallying around the flag for the time being accepting whatever government there is as long as they can provide some sense of security and take revenge uh for the attacks in uh last weekend and you would see people rally on the FL around the flag and you would see the likes of Gant and other joining the government as long as War continues but I think sooner or later Netanyahu will be held accountable for his Fiasco aside being held accountable for on all these other in corruption charges that he's indicted for now I want to read you a statement from Hamas which has just issued this in the last hour or so it's rejecting allegations that it committed crimes against women and children saying and I quote some Western media Outlets continue to spread Zion and slander and L about our Palestinian people and their resistance which falsely and slanderously promoted allegations that members of the Palestinian resistance beheaded children and assaulted women without any evidence to support their lies and claims Hamas strongly condemns the baseless allegations now M what do you make of that obviously the pr and media battle is going to be pretty vital here and we're already hearing and seeing plenty of misinformation being spread what if anything do you think can be done about that well you know uh we live in a world of web and the virtual Realties nowadays when it comes to information is more important than the actual reality and as soon as some news reports I think including one from the Los Angeles Times that came out about the beheading of the baby they've been retracted from the more professional press but I think they took a life of their own uh online and and then there is no stop uh to their mutation and proliferation especially by those who do intentionally want to spread disinformation or those in Israel and the United States who are making the case for wider War beginning with land invasion of Gaza uh there is or seems to me my reading of the media in general and some of the media pundits who are uh Towing the line of the Israeli line and the Biden Administration line seems to be making this false uh uh false comparison false in equating of Hamas with alqa or Hamas with Isis talking about 107 like it was 911 and uh talking about beheading of babies and quoting the likes of President Biden when he says the sole uh reason for hamas's existence is to kill Jews and that they have a slick PR like Isis all of these rather false statements uh tend to uh inflame the souls and bring back uh that comparison to 9911 and to the invasion of Iraq and I think in in the most tragic and saddest of ways I think some of the media pundits and some of the people in Israeli government and outside it are trying to recreate the atmosphere that was uh predominant prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq I think they're preparing uh the atmosphere among Israelis American others for a more dramatic more escalation that could also involve the Americans whether it is in Lebanon or elsewhere because now as you know we have an East we have a a Naval Strike Force and American n in the East Mediterranean and I think all of that is not only wrong and misinformation on all of that it's also a tragic repetition of a huge fiasco of the 2003 war on against Iraq on again on on false pretense and here we go again they're building the case for Iraq for for another war in Palestine perhaps Lebanon and against Iran under false pretend moan if I could briefly just change teac a little bit the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has uh just jumped on a plane uh to head to Israel what impact do you think his visit will have and how big a role is the US going to play here and the the days and weeks and potentially months ahead I was stunned uh and I'm not easily stunned uh by President Biden's speech yesterday it seemed to me that he and today secretary blinkin were uh repeating uh word for word uh the kind of uh sound bites we hear from Netanyahu Netanyahu has a very particular style of talking of in s bites and inflaming the souls and I think uh President Biden used some of the same uh you know uh sound bites that basically disinformation from prime minister nanaho I I will even go further to say that I have I have a sense that prime minister netan is manipulating the American president and his secretary of state into escalating and into deploying a huge and modern new Naval Strike Force in the East Mediterranean and the idea that he could actually talk them into giving green light to Israel to the Netanyahu government this very radical rather fanatic Neo fascist government to do whatever it takes as long as it takes in Gaza and Beyond that's just a call for war crimes that we've already seen happening the past 72 hours but even widening the war towards land Invasion and perhaps opening another front in the north against Hezbollah and perhaps even going beyond that because the idea of this warning and ultimatum that Biden gave and that linkoln repeated today about you know if anyone thinking of taking advantage don't right any you could expect any sort of escalation between and Israel to happen could be initiated by Israel or by heah God knows right in the coming days and that could basically draw in the United States into another Regional War now just quickly this is the administration this is the president American president who only recently assured us that he is the president who's going to end the forever wars in the Middle East that he pulled out in humiliation out of Afghanistan because he's a man of his word now he wants to start another Middle East war after the 2003 Fiasco in Iraq that would be a big mistake okay Ma we really do appreciate your Insight thank you so much that is Maan bashara uh senior political analyst for Al jazer the Israeli Army is trying to calm fears after a false alarm sent people Nationwide scrambling for [Music] shelter the warning sirens rang out across Northern Israel and flares were fired at the border as people across the country were told to seek shelter over a possible aerial infiltration from Lebanon the Army now says the Panic was caused by human error well Ali hasham is in the town of maahan in South Lebanon near the border with Israel and there've been plenty of moving Parts here with alerts and fears that there had been an incursion uh from Lebanon into Northern Israel can you just recap for us exactly what happened and and where things stand now well we moved to nakura which is also on the borders um well today was a very hectic day it started with an hasah attack on Israeli troops on the borders mainly in DEA Village on the borderline according to the pictures we saw from hisbah it seems that there was a direct hit with guided missile um now following that Israeli started shelling The Villages surrounding the borders and um there were two people injured now later on this alarm came and there were these reports about uh planes paragliders Crossing towards the other side of the Border however there was no uh genuine reason to understand why this alarm is coming out because uh none of these parag gliders were seen uh with with with eyes uh also at the same time these paragliders the the alleged par paragliders did not uh engage in a battle or in a fight on the ground so later on it was uh clarified that this is not right however the Israeli Army continued to uh launch uh uh floods in the the Skies of South Lebanon also U burning the bushes around the borders in order to deny any Fighters a kind of a cover just in case they're trying to infiltrate uh the border so it was it was a hectic day for for the Israeli troops on the Lebanese side and this uh clarifi the situation whereas the tension is Moun day after day so in comparison with yesterday when Rockets were launched and hamas's alasam brigades claimed responsibility or the day before where a group from Islamic Jihad infiltrated the borders and engaged in a battle with the Israelis today was a bigger day and it seems that this tension is going to continue it's not going to stop and at least from what I understand this is going to continue as far as the uh campaign on Gaza is going to continue and Ali what are the military capabilities of hisbah I mean I know you've covered many of the conflicts that they've previously been involved in what sort of Firepower could they bring if they were to get fully involved in this well over the past 13 years the last the last time heah engaged in a war with with Israel was in 20 6 and then there were only 2,000 Fighters mean professional fighters on the border with maybe tens of thousands of uh Rockets however now in 2023 hisbah says that they have a tens of thousands of Fighters and the number of their Rockets isn't known however what we know from Israeli claims and even from he's uh statements that they have Precision uh uh missile long range missiles relatively uh and these missiles are able to U hit any any spot in in Israel and this is the main issue the other the other side of the of the picture is that he's Fighters over the past years engaged in battles in different terrains whereas they were in Syria they went to Yemen they went to Iraq so the experience they accumulated over the past years is is big and and that's why also Israel Israel is so concerned now heah is not the only uh party now in South Lebanon with the new factor of the Palestinian factions alasan brigades and Al brigades fighting from leanon as we saw in the past few days okay thanks so much for that Ali that is Ali Hashim for us in the south of Lebanon well the first shipment of US military aid has arrived in Israel this comes after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who promised to escalate the bombardment of Gaza President Joe Biden has expressed his full support for Israel US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has left on a diplomatic Mission to Israel he gave a brief statement at Joint Base Andrews before departing the United States has Israel's back we have the back of the Israeli people we have their back today we'll have it tomorrow we will have it every day we stand resolutely against terrorism we've seen the almost undescribable acts committed by Hamas against Israeli men women and children every day we're learning more and it is simply heartbreaking not since Isis have we seen this kind of depravity and we will continue to stand very resolutely against it uh when I'm in Israel I'll have the opportunity to meet with prime minister Netanyahu president Herzog uh other senior officials uh I look forward to seeing our Embassy team uh as well that's been doing terrific work during uh these difficult days um we're determined to make sure that Israel gets everything it needs to defend itself to provide for the security of its people already significant military assistance requested by Israel is on the way that's on top of everything that we've been doing uh for years including with the memorandum of understanding that was negotiated by President Obama uh to make sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself okay Patty Khan joins me now from Washington DC and we we have a bit idea now of the military aid the US is sending to Israel but what is blinkin hoping to achieve by going himself well by going himself it's simply a show of support a show of solidarity uh and he also I think is going to be having discussions about the next step forward so his plane is wheels up now and then he's going to be in Israel for those meetings in the morning we expect he'll also stop in Jordan the big question I'm looking for is if they add a stop in Egypt now after covering a policy officials here in Washington for quite a while one thing I look for is when everybody is on the same page with a statement that they repeat verbatim we've now heard from the president from the secretary of state from the National Security adviser the National Security spokesman saying that the difference between Hamas and Israel is that Israel follows the laws uh that govern conflict armed armed conflict and there's been a lot of criticism uh of from some of the administration because they haven't urged Israel to show restraint but what we're seeing now is them talking about they want a civilian Corridor that would that's where Egypt comes in theyve all been talking repeatedly over the last two days even more so today about how they are engaged in high level talks to make that happen because obviously the laws of war say you can't Target civilians civilians can't get out of Gaza because they are trapped there so that Corridor I I think is one way they're signaling by using that statement that is Israel follows the rules of law would it could apply to that quarter but also the total blockade of Gaza that is a war crime that goes against all of the Gen Geneva Convention the laws of war so it's could be a subtle hint to Israel that they're going to want to see some moves in that direction and uh Petty blinkin also talked about trying to get a safe passage opened up for civilians uh in Gaza to to somehow get out what did he say about that he said that these are long difficult complicated discussions and that you he was asked of the Israel is holding it up and he said I'm not going to get into that but it's very clear that that is now a priority of the administration when it comes to the idea of Munitions it's a concern here in the in DC because remember the US has been supplying massive amounts of artillery and ammunition to Ukraine and there have been questions even before this happened in Israel as to whether they were going to be able to keep up the supplies I've been speaking with Pentagon as my in my role as defense correspondent and officials there still say off camera that they are confident that they can meet both needs they talk about having global stockpiles all over the world but they've been really vague about what Israel is going to ask for the only thing they've been specifically saying is Munitions that go into the Iron Dome air defense system but if there is an incursion uh by Israeli forces into Gaza I can tell you that street to street fighting in densely populated areas is very much a disadvantage to Israeli forces so if they are going to be talking about that you'll likely see requests for things like better body armor night vision uh you know Small Arms ammunition so being very vague about it but we'll try and find out some more okay thank you so much uh Petty that is petty khim for us in Washington DC at the United Nations rad manur the permanent Observer of Palestine to the UN called on the International Community to help the Palestinian people there has to be a humanitarian intervention in order to uh to avoid uh a looming catastrophe and humanitarian massive crisis in the Gaza Strip we will continue with these efforts with everyone uh I understand that the Arab uh uh emergency ministerial meeting just concluded few minutes go in Cairo we will study what the outcome and see how we can fit all these things with our activities and our contacts with all concerned parties here at the United Nations we hope very soon that the International Community led by the SG led by the security Council will rise up to the to their responsibilities and begin with the process of sending humanitarian help and assistance to uh the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip ranzi is live for us at the United Nations and as we heard there the Palestinian ambassador to the UN calling for humanitarian intervention I mean How likely is that to happen at this point in time well at the very least we do have some breaking news for you about the responsibilities of the UN Security Council that the Palestinian Ambassador there just mentioned in the last few minutes we just heard from a source that Brazil brail who is currently holding has the presidency of the security Council has circulated a memo to the other members of the security Council saying there will be a security council meeting on the current conflict on Friday at 300 p.m. local 1900 GMT we don't know what the format of that meeting will be we don't know whether it'll be open or closed we don't know who will be allowed to attend or who will be briefing it but the security Council will have another meeting on on this conflict in on Friday following their closed consultations that we saw on Sunday beyond that as far as the United Nations and its responsibilities are concerned we do have some movement from the Secretary General of the UN who for the first time called for water and food to be allowed into Gaza now and that is a that's movement from his statement on Monday when all he would say was he was distressed by news of the the the the the um the renewed Siege on Gaza with with electricity and food which was you know some conation as a result because clearly this is completely in violation of the Geneva conventions proportionality and so on so now at least the Secretary General is calling for food and water to be allowed into Gaza now so movement there and also movement from the security Council a meeting will be held on Friday at 1900 GMT okay thank you so much for that update we really do appreciate it that is shiha pranzi for us at the United Nations well m zi joins us in our studio in Doha thank you very much for for being with us once again now we heard a little bit about the Diplomatic efforts from Palestinians do you believe that they're going to be listened to by the International Community or are they going to fall on deaf airs do you think there is no doubt the Diplomatic effort started in the last 24 hours there's a lot of criticism from the Europeans um even for the first time we start hearing from Washington that talking about international law talking about behaving as a state respecting international law um these are new terminologies in the last uh few days I think there is from what they are watching on what happened in Gaza the the level of the damage and destroying happened and the the casualties and all of this is pushing the International Community to do something and that's the reason I think I think plinking in in the region is not only just to please Israelis is Al also to pressure Israelis because because he knows and his administration knows that uh nyaho government did not listen to their advice to avoid such an an incident so basically I think there is an a diplomatic effort will continue to at least to open a gate for humanitarian Aid to get to Gaza m z thank you once again for for explaining the situation thanks so much well Israeli settlers have killed at least four Palestinians in attacks on a village south of nablas in the occupied West Bank the Palestinian Health Ministry says Israeli forces have also killed a 16-year-old boy near hibron 29 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank since the War Began on Saturday well hundreds of Palestinian workers from Gaza are stranded after they were dismissed from their jobs in Israel they were left at checkpoints near the occupied West Bank on Saturday and are unable to return to their homes Imran Khan reports from rala cut off from their homes this has become a makeshift home for some Palestinians from the Gaza Strip it was a local government building designed for sports and arts it's now a camp for displaced people there isn't a person here whose family hasn't been touched by this war my brothers and cousins called me and told me my son was injured a few hours later they called again and told me he was killed I want to go see him his mother is in Egypt for medical treatment she's stuck there and I'm stuck here he will be buried and I won't see him my other two children are Sheltering in schools alone others tell us they have lost multiple members of their families most don't know if they'll have a home to return to these men were employed under an agreement Israel made with the Gaza labor Ministry which allowed a set number of people to work in Israel it was a good deal for Israel businesses got cheap labor and could circumvent labor laws the Israeli government could say it was doing something to help Gaza but on Saturday employers acting on Israeli police instructions were told to take them to checkpoints at the occupied West Bank before that happened we are told some were interrogated and assaulted by the Israeli Security Services a claim we cannot confirm the influx has taken the Palestinian authorities by surprise and they woefully unprepared we need to maintain the health Factor very importantly in this location we are talking about as we speak 550 this number might just rise to a 700 or maybe a thousand because people are keep they are keeping pouring once they are discovered inside Israel handed over to the Israeli military and they they are just simply left after being beaten and humilated on the checkpoints to find their way to this to this shelters everyone here is watching the news on their mobile phones but unlike URI they're not watching for the news they're watching their homes being destroyed in real time they can't get home and there's nothing they can do about it Imran Khan Al jazer r is back with us in the studio just watching that story what do you make of that how big an issue is that going to be in the in the weeks and and months ahead people not being able to earn a living it is a big issue because basically we know that thousand thousand of G of gazan people they are working inside Israel and they have sort of permissions to work in Gaza in in inside Israel and those people now um they they they are they are humilated by by by the by Israeli side but more importantly the Israeli economy is losing them as well so it is both sides are losing actually of course the humanitarian side on and Gaza is pushing those people to feel more sad more disconnected with their families and they pay a heavy price they lost their job and they lost their families as well that is a very sad story and this is one of the ramification of this conflict yeah we just want to go back a little bit Anthony blinkin the Secretary of State for the United States is flying to Israel as we speak he mentioned before he took off that talks are underway but haven't fully developed at this stage into trying to open up a safe passage for civilians within Gaza to somehow get out how vital how important is that and what would be some of the the uh the blocks to that actually happening do you think you know we know that the only gate now is open is is with Egypt so so basically the only opportunity is to to work and coordinate with Egypt so they can get some humanitarian Aid to Gaza or actually there are thousand of of of sick people they have to go also for medication so I think the the debate has started already is how to open that I would say uh Communications and allow some uh food and and and water to get to Gaza and the issue is how can you sustain this is about sustainability it's not only just getting it one time you need to keep it running especially we know that at least in the last three days the water is cut theity is cut so the suffering is increasing rapidly basically yeah and it doesn't look like it's going to get better anytime soon only only going to continue getting thanks so much thank you we've been keeping across the extensive damage caused by Israel's rocket attacks on Gaza over the past few days Israel began their strikes on Saturday following the start of an operation carried out by Hamas the images before the attacks are of different locations within Gaza in May this year now gaza's old city is one of the areas which endured heavy damage from these attacks these are images of damage to the Susi mosque inside the Shanti refugee camp close to the coastline well Palestinian photographer MZ Aiza gives us a glimpse of the sheer Devastation in some of the most iconic neighborhoods of Gaza I'm here today to show you the massive destruction that happened to the the most beautiful areas and strip in City as as you can see uh I'm speechless I don't know what to say I don't know what should I say but believe me it's the most sadness that Gaza ever had oh my God oh my God it's like a whole Square more than 15 15 to 20 hav got demolished not destroyed demolished okay uh I want to talk a little bit uh muu about what you think is going to happen now that the power has been cut off how quickly are things going to deteriorate in Gaza um let's imagine hospitals how they will function you know you can't imagine there are a lot of a lot of medicine they need to be put in in in a fridge that's that's the basic things you have a lot of people are you dying and you need you need to make sure that you know this you know the places to to keep them are are are are basically fine so there are a lots of limitation a lot of pressure is happening now you need to make sure that you know there is enough food for those who are in hospital the number of casualties more than five around 5,000 and those are staying in hospitals they need to be feeded they need to water they need uh uh medicines so the the issue is deteriorated quickly actually and the more or the the more exity will be cut the the the problem will be actually adding adding more to the people suffering and will and I I would I would I would say that we will we will have more impact on people's life as well in terms of getting humanitarian Aiden who who Bears responsibility for trying to get that in does that fall on the UN un is involved they are support because if they coordinate with Egypt governments will work with Egypt and there is a talk about Al arish airport which is close to Gaza and this basically they will send all the humanitarian Aid there and then get it from Egypt to uh Gaza so United Nation is involved Egyptian government is involved I'm sure there are other governments they will be involved in getting all of this humanitarian aid but the issue is you know they they need to do this quickly because because the suffering of the people is increasing rapidly because of all of these um attacks on on civilians and and and buildings where there is no military targets yeah thank you so much we really do appreciate your time and your insight into this developing situation that is maub zeri uh director of the gulf studies Center well stay with us we have much more on the developing situation in
