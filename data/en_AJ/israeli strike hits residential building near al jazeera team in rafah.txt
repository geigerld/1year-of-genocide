going to try and take you back to Gaza right now where there was reports of an explosion T abum is there and T understand that happened quite close to where you and our team are working talk us through what happened yes Samy that was completely too close to our location in arafa this area that is supposed to be as a safe Zone we have been uh sitting everyone was uh walking peacefully subtly a very loud sound of explosion top place as we have as we have heard the sound of the Israeli missile while it was hidden toward its Target where it had destroyed a residential building just a few away from us few meters and where a number of residents have been killed and others have been wounded and we are uh we have get an access inside the hospital as the victims and the injuries have been turning up to the hospital I've seen a a a very uh young Palestinian girl being injured severely injured and uh another woman which her face was fully covered with the blood and others who had been completely uh uh let's say filled with blankets just to be away from documenting due to the fact that they have been killed by the Israeli Earth strike now this area is very densely populated that this strike had been carried out in where every single house in Rafa just only to know that it's very gently populated full of evacuees as well now this is not only the first attack that had been carried out in the vicinity of Al Kuwaiti hospital but previously a very similar attack took place at the back ground of our reporting right now where residential building has been flatten alongside with another agricultural land now as you can clearly hear at the background that the ambulances were are now moving to the location of targeting to evacuate more victims from under the RO rles as the rescue operations continue but the first injuries and victims had been transported to the hospital by the civilians in the areas who had rushed to the location of the targeting to evacuate them informing the Palestinian Ministry of Health about the exact location and of course this targeting will rise the number of the death toll and the uh also casualties especially that the majority of them as we have seen are civilians young children and women as well and paric just to be clear this is not an area you've just in the last few minutes or hours moved to this is an area you've been reporting from frequently I understand it's close to uh Hospital mosques civilian buildings and so on right yes Samy this is a very uh a busy area where in this area we have the AL kuti hospital and a MOS a mosque adjacent to it as well as there are different FR United Nation run shelters in the area where evacuees come here for some water uh filling uh process that is very close to the hospital and these attacks continue as now I'm receiving more confirmation by our sources on the ground that the number of Palestinians being killed by this air strike has risen to seven which means that more death toll has been recorded within uh this attack now as we have been also seeing throughout at the backr right now that Palestinians have been gathering around the hospital just to see if their one of the Beloved ones have been killed or injured in this air strike as more evacuation uh uh waves had been started to reach Rafa in the South where in every single land in every single House of of houses in Rafa there are a lot of people who are taking shelter on their relatives houses just to be safe as Israeli forces had ordered them before to remain inside now uh this is considered to be a rush hour and we have right now been hearing the some sounds of people who are bringing uh the injured people and the victims right now and those people right now are bringing an elderly person on uh healed by a number of residents to Al Kuwaiti Hospital those people have volunteered to bring them Amed The increased number of uh injured people and also victims now the rescue of efforts been made by residents and by the Palestinian Ministry uh is ex is increasing and right now A man bringing a young girl being injured right now it's very young girl uh to the alaiti hospital to receive a treatments right now what we can see is that the majority of the victims and injured people are young children girls and women Amed more intensifying of the Rat of the Israeli military attacks in Rafa this area that is supposed to be a safe zone for two 2.3 million Palestinians Amed ongoing uh Israeli bombing acly territory and this isn't the first time you've been close to an explosion just take us through what life is is like not only for journalist but for people yes Sammy uh in fact what we have seen during this attack that life in Rafa had completely turned upside down with the plank of an eye where everything was going well was going normal there is no any kind of bombardment but we have observed a number of Israeli military surveillance to drones hovering in the sky of the Gaza Strip and right now we have more victims more victims it seems that it's a young uh woman had been now killed or injured to the uh and taken to the hospital to a treatment after for medical check and these kinds of attacks continue but what we have clearly observed before the time of the attack that there are a lot of surveillance drones on the sky of Rafa in particular in the area that we are in just make a kind of complete uh uh military check then they have now targeted a residential building that contains uh dozens of Palestinians who have been living peacefully and right now with the destruction of this house uh the situation had become much more exacerbated as more injuries right now are turning up and arriving to alaiti hospital hital through out the help of civilians in Rafa all right thanks so much t
