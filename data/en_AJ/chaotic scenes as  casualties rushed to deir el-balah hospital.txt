the Israeli Army has ordered Palestinians Sheltering in gaza's southern city of K yunas to move to the so-called humanitarian Zone in alasi but Israeli forces are conducting intense air strikes around K yunas making it impossible for people to flee the evacuation order comes after Rockets were fired into Israel from Gaza on Friday for the first time in a month they landed in the southern city of Ashkelon and an Israeli air strike has targeted a house east of Kan at least 14 Palestinians have been killed in the attack in the town of abasan their bodies and the injured have been taken to the already overwhelmed Nasser Hospital let's bring in our correspondent Han mmud he's joining us live from De Al Bala in central Gaza hany we have been looking at frantic scenes of patients being rushed to hospitals after deadly attacks yes the past 15 minutes have been quite chaotic here at the hospital as it it just in an instant of a span of a few minutes the scene in the hospital turned from a very quiet into as you see is quite chaotic right now and overcrowded the over the over the uh the courtyard of the hospital is overcrowded with people people were actually rushed from the shelter that is nearby the hospital that's an evacuation Center that the western part from the hospital all the way here and also the displaced population inside the hospital at least three three bombs fell on this shelter the number of ambulance almost every single ambulance vehicle here including civilian Vehicles rush to the site as we were told this is an overcrowded shelter with many displaced families were inside when the attack happened we literally we literally seen children coming in pieces shredded inside wrapped in in White in white sheet or inside a plastic bag thn into the hospital the ambulance are still bringing more more of the injuries more of the casualties from the shter that is nearby the explosion was quite loud it shook the area uh as it felt more of like a quake bombs that fell on the shter we don't we don't know exactly how many people but the ambulance keep rushing keep keep this being dispatched to the shter and bring back more of the casualties that at least a thousand people were inside this shelter that's the the estimation that we have it also has many of the tents that were set up at the vicinity of this school now evacuation centers and areas are designed this way people try to set up their ttin near to each other they have comfort when they have their own family members around them or people from their neighborhoods from where they were displaced but as you see here the scene that's a crying mother right here at the ambulance just look at look at the casuals here trying to identify if any of the family members who were in the school are inside this vehicle yeah Hy it sounds like you have really been witnessing unspeakable uh scenes of Devastation of unspeakable injuries uh where you are and we have been watching those live pictures from from where you are the last 15 minutes and what we are seeing now an ambulance coming in hundreds of people around it patients being brought into the hospital we have been watching those scenes ambulance after ambulance getting to that hospital uh for at least the last 15 15 minutes hany can you tell us about um the attack that you are talking about you're saying it it took place on a shelter is this the same as the attack in the town of abasan well right now what we're getting confirmed report that inside this shelter is a field hospital and it was directly hit by one of these bombs so they were already patients inside this field Hospital in the shelter trying to get medically treatment they were injured or killed in this attack and this is the the the the part of the psychological warfare there is nothing there's nothing or no place safe here not even a field Hospital inside the shelter there you buy definition both of these locations are humanitarian and should be protected by humanitarian international law but we see in those Relentless Israeli air strikes targeting the shelter where displaced families have been Sheltering inside for the past N9 months and now what we're hearing is the field Hospital inside the shelter itself was was targeted and many of the patients who were inside are among the casualties arriving uh to the hospital H it's shocking to see the number of ambulance that's been being dispatched to the area including civilian Vehicles bringing injuries back to the hospital this is the pattern of attacks not only in in in kanun in Aban or other areas of Eastern khun but we've seen this pattern of attacks inat a few weeks ago where multiple schools in the span of 10 days were attacked and bombed by Israeli air strike that were carried in the middle of the day or during the night leaving hundreds of people killed the vast majority of them were women and children and just as of now just looking at the the number of casual looking at the the people arriving here inside the ambulance we're looking at completely 100% civilian population women and children people who are not injured they're fully covered with the dust of the bombs and the buildings and he can see that's already a de person brought from the hospital and rushed out for barri but also we seen children and women and elderly soaked fully in blood with their clothes apart from the bodies that arrived in pieces fully shredded inside the hospital this is the same exact pattern that we' seeing over and over this is in no way a collateral damage this is intentional this is deliberate a a shelter full of of displaced civilians displaced families a build house with the kind of Technology employed in this war there is no way to make mistake unless somewhere in the in the chain of command someone thought it was okay to bomb and to kill civilian Sheltering inside inside an evacuation centers and patients inside a field hospital and hany I just want to warn our viewers that there is a possibility that we will see graph images on our screens because this is these are live pictures coming to us from where our correspondent hany is outside alaa Hospital in there Al Bala where there are many people many ambulances coming in after another deadly attack on a shelter uh close to where I believe close to where our correspondent is hany you were saying that this is the pattern of attacks that we have seen in Gaza for more than 9 months now but I want to ask how what you're seeing today Compares um how you would describe the scale in in in what you're seeing in those ambulances coming in the kinds of injuries that un really the Unspeakable injuries that you are describing that you've seen how it Compares you know to the scale of attacks we normally see you mentioned all of those attacks on schools that were Sheltering people refugee camps displacement centers that took place around a week ago in central Gaza and around a week ago we did see one of the deadliest attacks one of the deadliest weeks rather in Gaza since the War Began with more than a more than 450 people were killed and so how would you describe what you're seeing around you now this is beyond catastrophic and tragic the fact that we're seeing many of the civilians arriving in the ambulance and either they're they're fully soaked with the blood or they are in peace or they already killed uh losing losing a LM or they're already dead it's just an indication that the Israeli military is not showing any any slowdown or lit up in the attacks across the across the G turb and mainly here in the central area where we see in the vast majority of this place families have been pushed into this area more from more recently from kanun City and ra City when the Israeli military started its military Maneuvers and before that many of the people who left the northern part of Gaza poured into the Central Area according to the United Nations we're looking at at least 1.7 million people are concentrated in the central area at least 800,000 of them in Dar bah City that's a very small area already packed with people displac people from the northern part in Gaza and the number has increased with the more recent recurrent incursions of of Eastern Khan units and more the past couple months when people were pushed into further internal displacement into ra City the one thing that we we're certain about is the kind of injuries here that we're seeing have been subjugated to lethal weapons the kind of bombs that are Dro unpredictable rockets and missiles and bombs falling on their homes or their shelters They are packed with strap nails they're packed with nails they're packed with little pieces of metals that when they're flying at a high speed they cut through the arteries they cause severe bleeding and it doesn't it it doesn't take time it doesn't take time for for any of the casualties arriving here to be pronounced as they lose so much blood on the way that they being transfer from the bumb side all the way to the hospital so far what we're looking at at eight eight people have been killed and already transferred to the morg of the hospital the majority of them women and children and we seen them being transferred already uh inside the the morg of the hospital as you can see from the frame the entrance of the emergency department is quite chaotic right now and overcrowded with people either people from who are Sheltering inside the hospital or these are the family members who have someone Sheltering inside the the the field hospital or the schools that just being that was targeted in the past half a half an hour to just to put a little bit of context here just 45 minutes before the attack happened and and I was doing my life report here the sounds of the drones in the background was was so irritating it the the drones flew at a very low level in the area and we were just talking to each other we know we know that the moment that we see these Sky Predators these attack drones or surveillance Dron we know something bad is going to happen and we were just talking about unpredictable bombs that is going to fall somewhere here and just within minutes of talking we heard the explosions of the three bombs that were dropped on the shelter and the field Hospital inside of it uh this ambulance is backing up right now and that's a sign that the people inside the ambulance are already dead they are taking them to the morg there is no point of rushing them to the emergency department because they already they were already dead at the site as a results of the intensity of the attack and the the the fact that is is quite destructive the kind of bombs as one doctor described it when we interviewed them within the past weeks they talk about the kind of weapons that are used they're very lethal apart from the fact that they are packed with these strap nails and and and nails that cut through cut through the Flesh and cause severe bleeding it also caus severe burns and those Burns unfortunately with the lack of medical supplies necessary paying medicine uh most of the time people do not have a chance of surviving these severe burns and die within days within a week maximum of their arrival to the hospital and their cases that we documented at the ICU in the past couple weeks of people arriving and within couple days they were they died because of the severe burn here's the thing these are Lethal Weapon that dropped on a civilian population and a children uh there is no way there is no way that they're going to survive the attacks the we are we were here at the hospital we could feel the intensity of the explosion uh imagine the people were inside the shelter who had to experience this firsthand uh what have gone through their heads when it happened Hy thank you very much we're getting a report now inside this inside this ambulance inside this ambulance there are six more people brought to the hospital already dead from the bombed side that that just increased the number into 14 people right now 14 people and we were told there are children inside the this ambulance vehicle here to my right side all right so 14 people killed on an attack where people were Sheltering and where there was um a medical medical Point Hanny thank you very much for that for now there is hanim mmud a correspondent in there Al Bala he is outside that hospital that we are looking at live pictures of where a number a a great number of injured people have been rushed following that attack H
