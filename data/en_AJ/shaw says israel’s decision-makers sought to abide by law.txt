Madam president and members of the Court it is a great honor to appear before you again and a privilege to appear on behalf of the state of Israel it is my task today to address the issues falling within the general categories of primer fascia jurisdiction and the preservation of alleged rights sought to be protected however I would like first to make a preliminary comment about the key question of context which constitutes the framework for the consideration of this request for the ground of provisional measures South Africa casts its net widely in its application it uses the word context many times in particular it declares that it is important to place the acts of genocide in the broader context of Israel's conduct towards the Palestinians during its 75 year long paride leaving aside the outrageous nature of that statement why stop at 75 years why not refer to 1922 and the approval by the Council of the League of Nations of the British mandate or 1917 the proclamation of the balford Declaration maybe also include the entry into the land of Israel of the Israelite tribes some 3,500 years ago no the immediate and approximate context for the specific allegations of genocide claimed by South Africa lies in the events of the sth of October when Hamas militants and other armed groups and individuals stormed into the internationally recognized Sovereign territory of Israel and committed acts of bely credible atrocity it was these events that truly constitute the real context for South Africa's allegations indeed such act may be seen as the real genocide in this situation as the president of the European commission put it on the 19th of October there was no limit to the blood Hamas terrorists wanted to spill they went home by home they burned people alive their mutilated children and even babies why because they were Jews because they were living in the state of Israel and hamas's explicit goal is to eradicate Jewish life life from the Holy Land these terrorists supported by their friends into haran will never stop and so Israel has the right to defend itself in line with humanitarian law of course these atrocities do not justify violations of the law in reply still less genocide but they do justify mandate even the exercise of the legitimate and inherent right of a state to defend itself as enshrined in the UN Charter and under customary international law to put an end to the continuing attacks against it and to prevent them from succeeding a threat that has been made explicitly bamas and repeated and it is thus real and imminent this context is critical for it shows that the true nature of the situation as it as it has unfolded particularly the 7th of October is that of an armed conflict a heavily armed militia and its allies precipitated egregious hostilities and the consequences lie everywhere point is this armed conflict even when fully Justified IED and conducted lawfully is brutal and costs lives particularly when the militia in question specifically targets civilians and civilian facilities and when it is patently unconcerned about causing civilian casualties on its own side the conflict has also regulated by law the rules and principles of international humanitarian law under the h regulations the Geneva conventions of 1949 and customary international law these are welldeveloped and applicable and are fully respected by Israel such rules cover permitted activities under International humanitarian law where civilian damage and loss always to be regretted are caused in the legitimate pursuit of military objectives through to the violation of the laww being grave breaches of the G conventions and up to war crimes and crimes against humanity however the only category before this court is genocide not every conflict is genocidal the crime of genocide in international law and under the genocide convention in international law is a uniquely milici ious manifestation it stands alone amongst the violations of international law as the epitome and Zenith of evil it has been described correctly as the crime of crimes the ultimate in wickedness indeed the court itself emphasized in its order of the 2nd of June 1999 that the threat or use of force cannot in itself constitute an act of genocide within the meaning of Article 2 of the Geneva Convention and particularly instant bombing as lacking the element of intent in the circumstances to put it another way if claims of genocide were to become the common currency of armed conflict whenever and wherever that occurred the essence of this crime would be diluted and lost I turn now to the question of the primer FAA jurisdiction of the court in the matter before us article n of the genocide convention to which both part both states are parties without reservation makes the Court's jurisdictional Jurisdiction conditional on the existence of a dispute relating to the interpretation application or fulfillment of the convention mention and the relevant date for determining the existence of such a dispute is the date on which the application is submitted to the court whether or not a dispute in these terms exists at the time of the filing of the application is a matter for objective determination by the court it is a matter of substance and not a question of form or procedure the court will take into account in particular any statements or documents exchanged between the parties as well as any exchanges made in multilateral settings the court has said the key Point here is the use of the term exchange between the parties unilateral assertion does not suffice there needs to be some element of Engagement between between the parties the element of interchange and bilateral interaction is required a dispute is a reciprocal phenomenon this point has been consistently noted by the court for example the court reaffirmed in the Mayanmar case the view that it had expressed earlier that in order for a dispute in the sense of article 9 to exist it must be shown that the claim of one party is positively opposed by the other the court further referred in the Marshall Islands cases to the need that the respondent should not be deprived of the opportunity to react before the institution of proceedings to the claim made made against its own conduct where a state makes an assertion concerning the conduct of another state it must thus give the latter a reasonable opportunity to respond before resorting to litigation particularly in a matter of such severity as an accusation of genocide and particularly before a court of this standing and it behoves that state to provide supporting evidence of some credibility here South Africa cites only a couple of general public statements by Israel referencing merely a press report by Reuters and a publicity release from the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs these responses were not addressed directly or even indirectly to South Africa there is no evidence of positive opposition as required by the report further South Africa cites no relevant exchange between the parties which would be the normal fashion for the expression and determination of a dispute between states this actually typifies how South Africa has approached this matter it seems to believe that it does not take two to tango it is sufficient if one state determines there is a dispute leaving the other party flx Professor Dugard explains that South Africa had voiced its South Africa had voiced its concerns in the security Council and in public statements and refer and had further referred the matter to the international criminal court at that point he says it became clear there was a serious dispute between the two states the court has emphasized that in the case of statements made by one state in a multilateral forum the court must give particular attention inter Alia to the content of a party statement and to the identity of the intended addresses in order to determine whether that statement together with any reaction thet show that the parties before it held clearly opposite views South Africa's actions were insuff efficient indeed in the martial Islands cases the court referring specifically to statement made at a conference noted that it did not call for a specific reaction by the UK and thus no opposition of views can be inferred from the absence of any such reaction specific reaction it is th disingenuous for Professor Dugard to conclude that Israel must have been aware from South Africa's public statements de Mar and referral to the IC of Israel's genocidal acts that a dispute existed between the two states this is not a dispute it is a Unis spute a one-sided clapping of hands Professor dug God perhaps tries to retrieve the situation by declaring that that special considerations apply to the existence of disputes concerning article 9 without telling us what those conditions could possibly be we come now to the rather bizarre story of the exchange of note verbal Professor dogod would have us believe that such exchanges are merely a matter of courtesy of little real consequence this is not the normal understanding of such notes and their importance in international relations but he says this for a reason as we shall see South Africa instituted proceedings against Israel on the 29th of December in its long recital the application notes that on the 21st of December South Africa sent a note verbal to Israel raising its concerns about genocide in Gaza the application further states that Israel has not responded directly to South Africa's note verbal this is incorrect Israel did indeed respond that very day informing South Africa that the node verbal has been forwarded to Capital and that a response was expected shortly South Africa confirmed the next day that it had received the message on the 26th of December the director general of Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed to his counterpart in the department of international relations and cooperation of South Africa by text to shedule a meeting at his earliest convenience in order to discuss the issues raised on the 27th of December the embassy sent to South Africa by email a note verbal s suggesting a meeting of respective directors General at the earliest convenience in order to discuss the issues raised an an attempt by the embassy to hand deliver the note was refused due to a national holiday and the South African Department of international relations specifically advised the embassy on the 28th of December to hand deliver the note on the 2nd of January the application was instituted on the 29th of December this was an attempt by the state of Israel in good faith to open a dialogue and discuss South Africa's concerns however Not only was this ignored at the relevant time but South Africa proceeded to Institute proceedings the following day and declared in its application that no reply had been received to its note verbal which was patently not the the case perhaps realizing the effect of this South Africa with some haste sent a note verbal on the 4th of January which essentially just repeated the contents of the note of the 21st of December but it explained the following day in a letter to the regist that the Israeli note had not been received by the appropriate team Israel has proof of receipt it also stated that the dispute is plainly not capable of resolution by way of a bilateral meeting nevertheless it suggested to hold hold a meeting the next morning Israel replied the next morning expressing surprise that South Africa had instituted proceedings without taking up a sincerely made offer to hold consultations and conveying its wish for discussions to be held following the close of these oral hearings South Africa in a note dated the 10th of January similarly and surprisingly in the circumstances said there was no point in such a meeting curious indeed South Africa decided unilaterally that a dispute existed irrespective of Israel's conciliatory andf friendly response since repeated perhaps at South Africa taken up this offer at the time proferred as a result of its own note the parties may have decided there was no dispute as such to place before the court under the genocide convention and that South Africa's expressed concerns over the genocide allegation would have been assuaged we may never know South Africa's precipitate institution of proceedings foreclosed that option it's a point where worth underlining South Africa did not give Israel a reasonable opportunity to engage with it on the matters under consideration before filing its no doubt long prepared application one wonders whether South Africa at the very last moment suddenly realized that it needed to show the existence of a dispute under the terms of the genocide convention and proceeded to hastily formulate and dispatch a flurry of notes the court can grant orders for provisional measures only where the provisions relied upon by the applicant a prim fase to afford a basis on which its jurisdiction could be founded although it need not satisfy in itself in a definitive manner that it has jurisdiction as regards the merits of the case it's not an easy matter to determine whether a primer face shap case exists it rests between full proof and complete absence of proof and is intended to ensure that the court functions effectively and efficiently but there has to be something tangible in terms of the provisions in question the provisional measures procedure is a complex instrument in that the court has to decide upon the basis of certain assumptions which may or may not be disproved at a later stage of the proceedings this is particularly difficult in such an egregious manner matter as an allegation of okay well the standard of proof at the merriage stage is high the court having made it clear that claims against a state involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive that is not the case of course of the provisional measures stage but it's also not negligible the court is asked to Grant in this case a number of measures that in effect assume that the party in question is committing genocide as Mr Staker will show later this morning mud is thrown at a stage before conclusive proof and it may stick even if the accusation is comprehensively disproved at the Merit phase as we expect a serious political and security price may be paid by the grantee of such measures even though it may later be shown to be completely unwarranted this must surely required that the court acts with caution and understanding particularly in evaluating the components of the allegation in law provisional measures are intended to constitute a shield and not a sword to preserve not undermine rights we have shown that one element of article 9 that of the need to demonstrate the existence of a dispute as understood by the court in the light of its case law is lacking the second element concerns the question as to whether the ACT complained of by the applicant can be seen as falling within the provisions uh of the convention the court has noted that only at the merriage stage can be determined whether the Provisions in question of the convention have been violated to accomplish this the necessary specific intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnical racial or religious group as such has to be proved however this cannot be read as a complete rejection of consideration of the intend Criterion for current purposes the court is the mindark case noted that a finding of violations of the Merit stage notably depends on the existence of intent notably not exclusively Myanmar is not a ruling that intent is irrelevant in a consideration of Prim of fascia jurisdiction it is a ruling that in conclusion as to whether or not violations have actually occurred is a matter for the merits which notably depends on an assess M of intent this clearly leaves open the possibility that intent is indeed a factor in determining prate faal jurisdiction in Prov provisional measures proceedings this also comports with the logic of the situation the acts element of the definition of genocide are listed in article two and for present purposes there is no need to go through them the issue is this what determines the existence of the crime of genocide isal measures phase of this case South Africa does not have to prove that genocidal acts have been or are being committed but it does have to show that the con that the genocide convention is in play after all this court has no jurisdiction to consider consider any other alleged crimes however serious we are only concerned with genocide it is indeed a difficult balance for the court the court has stated that what is required at this stage is to establish whether the acts complained of are capable of falling within the provisions of the genocide convention but the acts complained of may only be capable of falling within the provisions of the genocide convention if the intent is present otherwise such acts cannot constitute genocide the fact of intent colors the whole question of Article 2 acts in other words that there is primate evidence that the acts that may fall within the convention necessarily imposing the intent elements have been established as such South Africa accepts the need to demonstrate intent it referred to the concept of specific intent in its application both generally and in the specific context of his discussion of the Court's Prime fascia jurisdiction in provisional proceedings indeed South Africa placed a considerable emphasis upon intent in its pleadings Yesterday by Miss hassim Mr Ang kitobi devoted his whole pleading to this requirement as far as the acts are concerned in this case there is little Beyond random assertions to demonstrate that Israel has or has had the specific intent to destroy in whole or in part the Palestinian people as such the intention faced with the 7th of October atrocities and the continuing rocket fire and incarceration of the hostages on the part of Israel to act in order to defend itself so as to terminate the threats against it and rescue the hostages certainly exists the intent to deal with the armed militants of Hamas and other such groups is undeniable were it the case which we deny that Israeli forces have transgressed some of the rules of conflict then the matter would be tackled at the appropriate time Time by Israel's robust and independent legal system but that is not the intent to destroy all or part of a people as such Israel's actions in restricting its targeting practices to attack military personnel or objectives in accordance with International humanitarian law in a proportionate manner in each case as well as its practice of mitigating civilian harm such as by forewarning civilians of impending action by the unprecedented and extensive use of telephone calls leafleting and so forth coupled with the facilitation of humanitarian assistance all demonstrate the precise opposite of any possible genocidal intent South Africa in seeking to discover the necessary intent presents a distorted picture it misunderstands the nature and provenance of certain comment comments made by some Israeli politicians let me try and explain the big picture Israel possesses a clear excuse me a clear and effective structure of authority with regard to governmental decision the war against Hamas is managed on behalf of the government by two Central organs the ministerial committee on National Security Affairs and the war excuse me uh and the war cabinet the latter established for the purpose of managing the War uh by the former these bodies make the relevant decisions regarding the war's conduct and according to Israeli law the decisions of the government and its committees obligate the Ministers of the government in accordance with the principle of collective responsibility it is the collective decisions of these bodies which are The Binding Provisions in question a prime minister stands at the head of these organs decides on the agenda of their meetings steers their activity and summarizes the meetings and the instructions issued therein to make it clear in order to determine the policy and intentions of the government of Israel it is necessary to examine the decisions of the ministerial committee on National Security Affairs and the war cabinet and to examine whether the particular comments expressed conform or not with the policies and decisions made th to produce random quotes that are not in Conformity with government policy produced as describing is misleading at best such as the statements by the minister of Heritage for example who is completely outside the policy and decisionmaking process in the war in any event his statement was immediately repudiated by members of the war cabinet and other ministers including the prime minister in ch 1 a of the volume which Israel has submitted to the court one may find numerous excerpts from internal cabinet decisions that attest to Israel's true intent throughout this war for example one finds the instructions from the prime minister in a meeting of the ministerial committee on National Security affairs from the 29th of October stating the following one the Prime Minister stated time and again we must prevent a humanitarian disaster two the Prime Minister indicated the possible source of solutions that may that will ensure required supply of water food and Medicine increasing the amount of trucks entering with the necessary inspections three promoting the construction of field hospitals in the south of the Gaza Strip to reemphasize this is a directive to authorities nothing less taban a contains a considerable number of similar directives emphasizing the need to avoid harm to civilians and facilitate humanitarian Aid genocidal intent let me turn to the IDF this is this like every Army is a hierarchical body that operates by way of orders from superiors and is headed by the chief of the general staff remarks or actions of a soldier do not and cannot reflect policy in tab 1B one may find a daily operational directive which I understand is repeated day by day issued by the operations directorate of the IDF stating that attacks will be solely directed towards military targets while adhering to the principles of Distinction proportionality the obligation taking precautions in attacks in order to reduce collateral damage this is a directive that binds all IDF forces it continues by stating that the laws of armed conflict allow destruction to civilian property only when there is a military necessity to do so and prohibit harm to property for deterrence purposes only or for the purpose of punishment individual or Collective it emphasizes that it is necessary to treat enemy civilians with respect they should not be treated in a humil humiliating Manner and civilians should not be used for the purposes for the purpose of Performing activities that might put them under risk to their life or their body this is a mandated instruction effective since the start of the war tab 1B contains many similar Provisions which are themselves only an illustration of many other such directives orders and procedures further on the 28th of October the Prime Minister publicly declared that the IDF is doing everything possible to avoid harming those not involved while on the 18th of November he declared that first of all and above all else Israel acts according to the laws of war this is how our army works the Minister of Defense publicly stated that on the 29th of October that we are not fighting the Palestinian multitude and the Palestinian people in Gaza and declared on the 13th of November that our war is against the Hamas terrorist organiz ization not the people of Gaza again the president of Israel declared on the 12th of October that we are working operating militarily according to rules of international law period unequivocally we have collated numerous such statements by the president by the Prime Minister by the ministry of Defense by the IDF spokes person and others in tab two of our volume since this is such a critical part of South Africa's thesis permit me to refer to two further statements by the Prime Minister I start with the most recent 10th of January Israel has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population Israel is fighting Hamas terrorist not the Palestinian population and we are doing so in full compliance with international law the IDF is doing its utmost to minimize civilian casualties while Hamas is doing its utmost to maximize them by using Palestinian civilians as human Shields the IDF urges Palestinian civilians to leave War zones by disseminating leaflets making phone calls providing safe passage corridors while Hamas prevents Palestinians from leaving at gunpoint and often with gunfire our goal is is to rid Gaza of Hamas terrorists and free our hostages once this is achieved Gaza can be demilitarized and deradicalized thereby creating a possibility for a better future for Israel and Palestinians alike on 23rd of November prime minister nany declared that any civilian death is a tragedy anyone and to to avoid them what you do is first you try and get the civilian out of Harm's Way and that's exactly what we did there are many more of the same any careful review of the official and binding policy decisions made by the relevant authorities in Israel since the outbreak of the war clearly evidence that such decisions lack any genocidal intent the contrary is true they are indicative of the consistent and Relentless commitment of Israeli relevant authorities to mitigate civilian harm and alleviate civilian suffering in Gaza some of the comments which South Africa refers are clearly rhetorical made in the immediate aftermath of an event which severely traumatized Israel but which cannot be seen as demanding genocide they Express anguish and the necessity to restore control over Israel's own territory and a Severe threat and safety to its citizens as DCH com tomka has noted sometimes statements are made which are nothing more than a part of the recent wartime rhetoric intending to put the blame and shame on the other side not to be totally ignored but not to be ascribed an importance which realize how and when they were made nor of legal significance let me refer to one further matter of some biblical moment yesterday the applicant referred time but again to two statements by the Israeli Prime Minister where he said remember what amalik did to you and attach great importance to it as part of the argument that Israel has demonstrated a genocide intent there is no need here for a theological discussion on the meeting of amalak in Judaism which was indeed not understood by the applicant let me just turn to the Prime Minister statement of the 28th of October which was partially and misleadingly quoted yesterday he said we are now entering the second phase of the war which its objectives are clear the restriction of the military and governmental capabilities Sol mass and the return of the hostages back home in the last couple of days I have met with our soldiers in the bases in the field in the north and in the South remember what a Malak has done to you we remember and we are fighting in front of our brave and hero soldiers there is one prior mission to defeat the murderous enemy and secure our existence in our lands the IDF is the most moral army in the world the IDF does everything to avoid harming the uninvolved tab three lists and addresses additional examples of misleading quotes by the applicants regarding Israel's policy it is this our conclusion that South Africa has failed to demonstrate the primary facia jurisdiction of the court I turn to the next issue as the court has noted its power to Grant provisional measures has its object the preservation of the respective rights claimed by the parties in a case pending its decision on the merits at the provisional measure stage the court does not need to determine to determine that such rights do actually exist in a definitive manner but it must establish that such rights are plausible South Africa yesterday dealt with this rather lightly we can safely say the plausibility is an elusive concept simply declaring that claim rights are plausible is insufficient the issue was addressed by judge Greenwood in the Border area case when he emphasized that what is required is something more than assertion but less than proof in other words the party must show that there is at least a reasonable possibility that the right it claims exists as a matter of Law and will be a judged to apply to that party's case he later discussed this in terms of a reasonable Prospect of success what is clear is that the court has sought to apply plausibility to particular treaty Provisions or to general rules of international law the court has also considered claims of fact in this cont as well as law such as the finding as to whether Equatorial Guinea plausibly used the building at 42 Avenue forch for diplomatic purposes in this case the court did not limit itself to considering where the applicant plausibly held the rights in question under international law but extended the field of inquiry to include consideration as to whether it was plausible that the respondent had breached the right in question question this approach appears also in Ukraine and Russia where the court concluded that on the basis of the evidence presented by the parties it appears that some of the acts complained of by Ukraine fulfill this condition of plausibility in other words the court was prepared to consider not only the question question of the plausibility of papers well but also the uh question of the possible breach of such rights the power of the court to indicate provisional measures under article 41 of the statute has its object object yes someone thought that my speech was a pack of cards indeed in the jadav case my apologies the court was prepared to examine evidence as to the existence of asserted rights and whether as a matter of fact the violations had plausibly happened the final point to be made in this section of my pleading is simply to underline the obvious point that the court needs to consider the relevant respective rights of both parties respondent as well as the applicant article 41 provides that the purpose of the provisional measures is to preserve the rights of either party I would note the court order of the 16th of March 2022 in Ukraine Russia stating that the power of the court to indicate provisional measures as it has as its object a preservation of the respective rights claimed by the parties and further quote the comment in the Myanmar case that the function of provisional measures is to protect the respective rights of either party pending its final decision this Mutual protection or balancing Criterion in the light of the rights of both parties is intended to prevent either party being placed in a situation of disadvantage and to ensure that irreparable Prejudice will not be caused to either party I will look briefly at the relevant rights of both parties here as regards the applicant I make three simple and brief points First South Africa has presented a confusing and a partial ccle of fact will be disc discussed later this morning by Miss Rajan secondly that the appropriate legal framework for this tragic situation is that of international humanitarian law thirdly that Israel's efforts both to mitigate harm when conducting operations as well as its efforts to alleviate suffering through humanitarian activities have gone relatively unnoticed and dispel or at the very least mitigate against the allegation of genocidal intent as from Israel's withdrawal of its civilian and Military presence from Gaza in 2005 which brought an end to its belligerent occupation and the violent coming to power of Hamas in 2007 a situation of conflict has existed with Hamas firing Rockets as Israeli towns and villages unceasingly however the attack on Israel on the 7th of October was qualitatively different from all that went before the truth is that if there has been any genocidal activity in this situation it was the events of 7th of October acts and intent can and have been advocately demonstrated but Hamas recognized as a terrorist group by at least 41 States including the US the UK all members of the EU Canada Australia Saudi Arabia Japan and Colombia is not before the court only South Africa a third party that is not involved in the armed conflict appears nevertheless as South Africa has pointed out complicity in genocide is in play states that supported condoned praised or glorified the events of the 7th of October both at the time and later stand guilty of a violation of article 3E of the Convention as being complicit in genocide and indeed of the duty to prevent genocide under article one and as the agent has pointed out South Africa has given sucker and support to Hamas at the least clearly of relevance to a discussion of of the situation is the something that hardly sits well with accusations of genocidal intent as my colleagues will demonstrate Israeli Israel's activities in this area need to be addressed and not swept aside as South Africa seeks to do Prime amongst the rights of the respondent that are critical to any legal evaluation of the situation is the inherent right of any state to defend itself embedded in customary international law and enshrined in the UN Charter this right afforded to states reaffirms and underlines their responsibility of all states towards uh their citizens and marks the acceptance by the International Community of the political reality and legal confir confirmation that states when attacked May legitimately respond in a forceful and proportionate manner Professor low yesterday sought to maintain that Israel has no right to self-defense in this situation how could anyone possibly argue that Israel could not defend itself faced with the 7th of October atrocities and the incessant attacks against his civilians since indeed a very wide range of States has acknowledged the right of self-defense here ranging from the UK to the US France Germany Italy Canada Japan Ghana and Guatemala and others Israel Bears the responsibility to exercise its protection over its citizens not only those constantly subjected to bombardment from Gaza but also and critically with regard to those captured and held hostage as a result of the 7th of October outrage these rights exist and cannot be disregarded of course Israel does not have any right to violate the law still less to commit genocide and indeed it does not but it does have every right to act to defend itself in accordance with the rules and principles of this of international law and so it has done a link has to be established between the rights asserted and the provisional measures requested and this issue will be addressed by Mr Staker and he will show that the measures proposed go far beyond the protection of the rights asserted Madam president members of the Court this is an important case allegations have been made with which Verge on the outrageous the attack by Hamas on 7th of October with its deliberate Commission of atrocities clearly forms in Falls within the statutory definition of genocide Israel's response was and remains legitimate and necessary it acted and continues to act in a manner consistent with international law it does so not in now unrestrained manner but in investing unprecedented efforts in mitigating civilian home at a cost to its operations as well as alleviating hardship and suffering with investment of resources and efforts there is no genocidal intent here this is no genocide South Africa tells us only half the story Israel is guilty of genocide we cannot deal with Hamas only Israel Must Be Stopped from protecting its citizenry and elimate eliminating the egregious threat that is Hamas we cannot deal with Hamas meanwhile we must bind the arms of the state of Israel Hamas is for some body I conclude first the core of genocide is intent without intent there can be no genocide in law it is true for the Merit it is equally true for provisional measures any primer fase consideration indeed of intent even at this preliminary stage will only demonstrate its absence from Israel's activities second there is here no dispute under the genocide Convention as at the time of submission of the application as alleged by South Africa and as required for primary fa jurisdiction indeed South Africa's own precipitate activities with notes over recent weeks demonstrates the lack of its confidence in this respect and that is telling thirdly the right to be protected in the provisional measures procedure cover not just the applicant but also the respondents and chief amongst these rights is that of the right and obligation to act to defend itself and its citizens this must be considered and weighed by the court as against the false accusations leel Israel Madame President members of the Court thank you for your kind attention
