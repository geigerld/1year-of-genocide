it is 13 GMT thank you for joining us we begin with renewed diplomatic efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza as Israeli bombardment of the strip continues US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is in Saudi Arabia where he's been meeting with regional counterparts blinkin says there has been measurable progress in the humanitarian situation in Gaza in recent weeks Washington's top Diplomat says there's an urgent need for a ceasefire to stop the suffering of Palestinians and he says President Joe Biden is urging Israel to take all necessary steps to prevent civilian harm the most effective way to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaz to alleviate the suffering of children women and men and to create space for a more just and durable solution uh is to get uh ceas fire and H home President Biden has insisted that Israel take specific concrete measurable steps to better address humanitarian suffering civilian harm and the safety while in his seventh visit to the region since October blinkin has been holding talks with leaders from the GCC on gaza's governance and reconstruction after the war the gulf Corporation Council is calling for Israel's military operation in Rafa to be stopped with an immediate truce in Gaza qatar's prime minister and foreign min Minister says any escalation of the conflict threatens peace in the region Lincoln's visit comes as Hamas negotiators are expected to meet katari and Egyptian mediators in Cairo the ongoing talks and consultations and coordination of positions is very important for boosting our strategic relations and dealing with the dangerous situation in the Middle East a lot of efforts must be exerted to sort out the military escalation for the sake of all countries in our region we need to bring peace to the Middle East the International Community has failed to find a solution to the Palestinian cause thus we now see the Bloodshed everywhere and every day in the Gaza Strip Al jazer Hashim Al following all these latest diplomatic developments Forest joins us now on the NewsHour I saw a great deal of diplomacy in the region in Cairo in Saudi Arabia a lot of different strands it would seem what is the common purpose what what is the objective today the Americans are hoping to achieve a a ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel and this explains why Hamas has dispatched its um Deputy uh leader KH along with the team in Cairo to try to pin down the details of that agreement the the Americans are hoping that this could be conducive to something broader more stability in the region but also the potential for a broader normalization between key Arab countries and the Israelis but now it was interesting to hear Anthony blinkin saying that the Israelis have offered Hamas an extraordinarily generous deal and that Hamas should accept the terms of that deal Hamas has has been dismissing itself dismissing uh accusation it was delaying the the deal saying that there are legitimate demands which need to be met and because their main condition is that there's still a permanent ceasefire in exactly the Americans still talk about calm Hamas says we need an indication of a over ceas fire prolonged ceasefire permanent ceasefire this is something they are trying to pin down also they asking for guarantees that the Israeli Army is going to pull out partially start partial P pulling withdrawal from Gaza that could be conducive to a complete pull out for the strip before they commit themselves to a final agreement with Israel now I've been talking to people about the chances for this to happen anytime soon and they say we'll just remain cautiously optimistic about the potential for any breakthrough I have to say that frustration is taking over more than a sense of optimism about a deal anytime soon we certainly uh have heard some frustration from the mediators from Qatar for example uh which has been involved in these negotiations they do yeah they do they've been waiting for this to happen over the last few months only to see conflicting statements from the different parties to the point where the qataris have been saying that we might reconsider our role as a key mediator if this doesn't happen and they all also would tell you that one of the key reasons why they're frustrated over this because they believe that both parties uh are using this to for maximum political benefits to the point where they also say that we can tell clearly that for Benjamin Netanyahu his political survival is more important to him now than a permanent agreement with Hamas now another interesting aspect of the meeting uh in Riyad between uh blinkin and and the regional leaders there is this idea of normalization with Saudi Arabia which was on the table before the war on Gaza began on October the 7th and it's still it seems being talked about because we heard blinkin mention it but how can they talk about normalization when there is an actual conflict there there is a reason why they would like to see that happen with Saudi Arabia it's the protector of Sunni Islam the most powerful Sunni Nation on Earth two it has the two holiest places in Islam Mecca and Medina if Saudi Arabia is on board and normalizes with the Israelis you will see many many Arab and Muslim countries follow suit now after October the 7th attacks the Saudi started to make a statement saying that basically they would they would like to wait until the Israelis solve the Palestinian issue but having said that today the Americans in Riyad are hoping to achieve two things reconstruction of Gaza this is where they would like to get more financial commitments from Gulf Nations But ultimately the final goal along with the normalization is to have a consensus among Arab Nations particularly the gulf countries that a new Palestinian Authority is going to be tasked with taking over Gaza and that hamas's era comes to an end Hashim thank you very much always good to get your Insight on all this Hashim AEL Bara now let's go straight to our correspondent another of our correspondents Bernard Smith who's in occupied East Jerusalem burned as we heard from Hashim there Hamas allegation due in Cairo for these ceasefire talks that are doing what about the Israelis will they be joining well the Israelis have a delegation ready to go to Cairo tomorrow that's Tuesday that depends on what the response from Hamas to Israel's proposal is you heard there again Anthony blinkin calling it an extraordinary extraordinarily generous proposal now it's understood that the Israelis are asking for fewer than about 40 of the 130 or so captives being held by Hamas and in return for that they'll release Palestinian prisoners and there'll be a moved to a second phase of a truce which will offer this a period of sustained calm the wording is very important there because we know that Hamas has been insisting throughout previous talks that they get a complete end to hostilities and the removal of Israeli forces from Gaza so that Palestinians can return to the homes particularly in the north of Gaza so will this offer of a period of sustained calm be enough for Hamas uh considering that they've been asking for this permanent ceasefire we expect to hear what Hamas have to say in the next coming 24 hours or so ultimately it's up to Yaya shinoa hamas's leader in Gaza he always has the final call on these things thank you very much Bernard Bernard Smith reporting there live from occupied Easter Jerusalem make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the
