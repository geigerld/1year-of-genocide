paled son is a strike desty the building Hamza, Glory be to God, the firstborn and the first I was happy. He was very polite and very good with the teacher. He was busy every day. He came to me almost daily. He came to me about my work and checked on me while I was working in the field. I saw day by day the extent of the massacres related to children, and this was the biggest scene and the most difficult scene.  Ali, as an ambulance officer in the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, affected me and my colleagues, but his injury was very serious. I was the one who took him to the hospital. He was in intensive care for no less than a quarter of a third of an hour after the attempts they made with him in reception and emergency, but unfortunately he died after Hamza Hamza was three years older than him.  For years, I was completely reassured about Karim because he was younger than him. Karim was attached to Hamza, and today I can feel the most pain over Karim’s impact and loss of Hamza, his brother. As for me, I have begun to hate my pick-up time from work because I am used to Hamza finding me at the door of the house, running to me and hugging me. I lost my son, but  Every day, every day, I prayed that he would be someone else’s son. Until that day, I prayed to God that he would be the last child in this war
