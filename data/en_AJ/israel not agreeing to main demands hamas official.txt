well a Hamas delegation has left KIRO without a breakthrough in cesa negotiations broken by Egypt by Qatar and by the United States but the group says the talks have not collapsed and it will continue negotiating through mediators badram is a member of the political Bureau of herass and joins us now live sir first of all can we just clarify if we could first of all your negotiating delegation has left the talks but the talks will continue how is that going to happen and where in the name of Allah Almighty at the beginning delegation of Hamas has left Cairo today to meet with the leaders of Hamas for more consultations regarding what's going on and regarding the recent round of talks in Cairo it is clear that Netanyahu and the government of Israel are insisting on playing with all the parties and they are not responding to the main demands not only of Hamas but of our Palestinian people the necessity of reaching a ceas fire and the necessity of allowing the displaced people to go back to North Gaza and to go back to their homes and allowing the humanitarian Aid to go freely without conditions to the gazin and the Reconstruction that will happen after the war the occupation is refusing to accept these main demands of our Palestinian people okay there is still confidence in the United States that an A positive outcome can be achieved through these negotiations and relatively soon do you agree with that optimism [Music] the American Administration is not impartial and is not a fair mediator the American Administration is a partner directly with Netanyahu and his government in the war against our Palestinian people the US Administration is supporting nanyu politically metally financially and on the Diplomatic level through the us uh veto in the security Council that's why what is said by the US Administration are only mere statements without real will to stop the war or to reach an agreement even temporary agreement and the US must practice pressures on the occupation and it can do the Americans practically are going parallel with the occupation with the Israeli occup that's why their statements do not represent the reality what will it take for Hamas to agree to a ceasefire deal first of all I need to confirm once again that we are not talking about certain requests for Hamas we talk about the demands of the Palestinian people we had consultations we had coordination with the effective Palestinian powers and consequently the situations that we talk about during the talks are National Palestinian positions and not Hamas Palestinian positions today we need to talk about direct ceas fire we need to agree about the mechanism of a ceas fire and the most important is to allow the displac people to go back to the north of Gaza and the necessity of allowing the humanitarian Aid Medical Aid food to go everywhere in Gaza to reach everyone in Gaza particularly in the north the north is facing starvation as mentioned by every media outlet and the occupation is putting a lot of obstacles in this connection allow me to remember you that starvation for the civilians direct killings of the civilians preventing the hospitals from providing the citizens with the health services are always the way that is opposite to the international agreement and nanyu and his government must be U taken to the courts it takes two of course to agree to a ceasefire and Israel said that they stayed away from the Kyo talks because Hamas refused to provide a list of hostages who are still alive why did you not do that discussions about this point is nothing to do or has nothing to do with this is fire when it comes to the prisoners in the Israeli jails this is also an important matter we have more than 10,000 Palestinian prisoners in the Israeli and we need the world to know that some of them have been detained for more than 44 years with out seeing the door of the prison we talk about hundreds of women and we have hundreds of men without even charges that's why this is an important issue for us and we consider now the top priority is to help our Palestinian people in Gaza to stop the destruction to stop the genoci side and we need not to talk now about the details of the prisoners now we need to help the Palestinians in Gaza and the occupation is refusing to give clear answers regarding the humanitarian uh uh situation in Gaza Strip H badran we'll leave it there thank you H badran member of the political Bureau of Hamas all right listening to that is Tamar kmud who's assistant professor of public policy the day Institute for Graduate Studies tamy good to have you with us um so Ramadan was the target deadline for a ceasefire that will not now be met it's pretty clear ramadan's going to what Sunday Monday it's coming on Sunday on Monday um so what's your sense of optimism or otherwise about this SE far happening um uh Nick personally I'm not optimistic but we still have a couple of days uh I mean before Ramadan starts uh tonight there is an important meet meeting for the Israeli cabinet and uh there also I think Hamas has returned the ball to the Israel and the American side so also they have to decide how to go on to to move on with this because the pressure also is in Israel and the us as well I mean the international comination is has is like has peaked like you know the international the entire world is very tired with this world and the question is would the Americans green light the Israelis because now if these um negoti negotiations officially fail or collapse we don't have an official statement from the two sides yet to indicate this then this means Israel has to enter ra and so far uh we know from American statements that they have refused or they're not in support of the Israel's entering Rafa uh so let's see I mean Hamas has returned the B to both the US and Israel so so in a sense Hamas is is making a statement just by by leaving KY yes of course stating their position yeah of of course of course and uh and I think it's um it could be a smart moved by them because because because they know also that they're not under pressure alone I I mean we know the the the size of the disaster in the Gaza Strip but also the Americans with the US elections now is is getting more momentum you know uh all these counts coming from the US showing that many voters have abstained angry with the Democrats so Biden Administration knows this now so will they will they bless or give a green light for Netanyahu to go in Rafa in a full military operation and start the big Massacre because we know most people are Corner in rafah and that's a big dilemma for the Americans and especially that them and the Israelis are really isolated on the international arena in the UN with all this building pressure uh but it's a tricky situation I mean Israel has I mean we know Israel's military conduct we know that Israel has crossed so many lines in this fight Hamas at the same time is not in an easy position the people are really suffering with the famine and all this destruction so it's it's like a Russian the Russian relate now who's going to like you know so we're in this situation more it's pretty evident it's not Benjamin netanyahu's priority to get the captives released and what do you say to those who who think that he's just trying to undermine the talk he's just stalling for time well let's let's listen to what the head of opposition said like you know they're angry and they're blaming Natan of failing these negotiations they accuse natany of of lacking anyone to do so because if and they say he could save these negotiations and allow give a chance for the 40 Israeli captives to be released in exchange for Palestina prisoners but he's not doing this and sadly the Biden Administration is also siding with natany on this blaming Hamas but the Israeli opposition is not blaming Hamas it's blaming nanyo so here we have these different opinions but the Israelis if we listen to the Israelis and their opposition of course they have a different opinion blaming Natan not Hamas on this and that's interesting Israel say that the the military pressure on Hamas is the best way to secure a release of the captives and in fact the only time there has been a release has been through negotiations isn't it yeah but also many of the captives have lost their lives as well during these operations so that's a big dilemma for Netanyahu unless he really considers them as a collateral damage and he's not able to say this to his own people like you know I mean so it's it's it's it's not Nat is not an easy position as well so I'm not sure okay so how far he will go with this military operation because the RAF issue is the big uh it's the elephant of the room I mean 1.5 million Palestinians cornered in a very narrow area near the borders what are you going to do with them I mean how are you going to conduct a huge military operation with these people there and one thing also Hamas in these negotiations have have requested or demanded the return of people to the north so if he's not allowing people to to go to the to the north and threatening with the major operation Rafa I just wonder how is he going to do it how right it' be interesting to see what happens as you say the next 48 hours time I come in thank you my pleasure
