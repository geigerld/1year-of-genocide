a mother and daughter taking shelter inside a church in Northern Gaza have been killed by Israeli snipers some witnesses say the women were shot in Cold Blood at the Holy Family Catholic Church one was killed while she was carrying her elderly mother to safety since the start of the war most have been taking shelter inside churches Lea Moran a British MP has relatives that have been living inside the Holy Family Parish Church in Gaza since the start of the war along with most other Christians in the Gaza Strip and I asked her when she last spoke to her family we last heard from them yesterday it's worth saying that there is a comms blackout across Gaza at the moment no internet at all but also in the escalating violence that we've seen uh in and around the church uh there were two generators that were already not working the solar panels had been blown out and the final generator was hit by Israeli forces yesterday there was a fire um and that one not just meant that there was no electricity at all but also helped to pump the water around the compound so the situation I mean it's just been awful obviously um it's been 60 days that they've been there it swelled from about a hundred people sleeping on mattresses and mattresses inad of the Sunday School complex to 300 now and they are terrified having on Tuesday seen the bin collector be uh shot outside the uh janitor who was just entering to fix something also shot the body were just laying there for days and uh since then there is a sniper we understand that has been firing into the compound um the Vatican has confirmed they've killed a mother and a daughter in this and they are just in those rooms desperately trying to survive there's no food there is no water and they are scared to even venture outside the door to go to the toilet because they are scared to be killed so that that is where we are are currently um and we are very worried for their safety obviously as as I'm sure any others who have family in Gaza and Palestine more generally are actually as well let's face it it's it's not good for anybody but I think that we've got an escalation here and it's just worth saying you know this is a week before Christmas um these this is a really important time in in the Christian calendar it makes a mockery of the suggestion that uh the Israeli Defense Forces are are keeping civilians safe these they've known they've been there for a long time they've been there for for 60 days now there was no prior warning we don't understand why this is happening and I would say to Israel please leave that church alone please leave my family alone and I say to the International Community please call ardently for the immediate ceasefires we need to make this destruction stop but also to lift the eyes to the lasting peace that Christians are singing about across the world in Advent in the runup to Christmas Israel's military and its government say they're hunting down hamus Fighters um as far as you're aware who is inside that church My Family Christians people who sought Sanctuary they've been basically there for two months with very few people who they don't know go in and out and it's worth saying the Christian Community in Palestine as a whole but especially in Gaza is Tiny they they know each other if there were Hamas tunnels underneath commanders there you'd have thought that they would have come to get them before 60 days um but they've decided to wait till now and and there was no leaflet drop there was no prior warning um as was confirmed by the Vatican when they weighed in yesterday so I don't know no one understands why this is happening but as far as my family are concerned absolutely not they have not seen Hine nor hair of anyone that they would understand to want to be targeted by the Israeli Defense Forces um the one we wonder you know we know that they've been wanting people to move they've been trying to get them to move they've been frustrated that civilians haven't moved um but even under international law if you tell people to move and they don't they have every right to stay you then have to do everything you can to minimize civilian casualties and in all of this including you know they reported seeing white phosphorus being thrown into the compound all of this I I will be encouraging my family who are eyewitnesses to report into the international criminal court um so that when uh that is investigated that they are part of the evidence base well Christians in the Gaza Strip are a minority there are only about a thousand left in 2017 there were 3,000 father Gabriel romanelli is the parish priest of the Holy Family Parish in Gaza and he says of the Christians who remain 135 are Catholics but denominations in Gaza aren't strict and worshippers can attend several different churches Christians have lived in Gaza since the first century they're thought to make up the oldest Christian Community in the world Archbishop Marios mavus is head of the Greek Orthodox Church here in Doha and he has spent some time in Gaza thank you very much indeed for being with us sir I understand that you have some friends and colleagues who are in the church that we're talking about at the moment have you been able to contact them have they told you what's happening uh yes uh indeed I was uh 1999 and 2000 serving Gaza as a parish priest and now I have people that they are inside our Greek Orthodox monasteries and perfidious I have some messages I cannot have a direct contact to them to the uh last uh two weeks but we have uh uh from from some messages I can hear from them that they are alive but they are in very uh bad situation uh waiting for humanitarian Aid we tried uh I mean the church steing committee here in Doha in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs uh in the uh two weeks ago on the Sunday the 3rd of December and we have uh AR right with a a military plane uh to Alish airport myself and the uh Reverend father Shel from the Maronite Church and we have carried uh humanitary Aid uh three days after the Ministry of Foreign first informed me that the eight it was was pass the trucks that carrying the eight enter inside Gaza Arch Bishop sorry to interrupt you I should explain to our viewers forgive me for interrupting you I should want to explain to our viewers top right hand picture that they should be seeing at the moment is are live pictures from Rafa Crossing and an a truck has just gone in and as it passed through the crossing crowds of people and I'm assuming this is of course is on the Gaza side crowds of people have jumped onto the truck and are now seizing boxes of Aid and simply throwing them into the crowd somewhat in indiscriminately now it's one would imagine this is not part of the the standard procedure my understanding is that these trucks would be uh offloaded by uh Aid organizations and the aid would be handed out um in a more sort of regimented fashion but it's perhaps an indication of the desperation of many people in Gaza that we're seeing these uh pictures at the moment tell me how uh given the level of support and Aid that you have been providing um how frustrating is it for you to see so much of your Aid on the Egyptian side of the border and unable to get into Gaza at the rate that you would want it to go exactly I have been around in the uh big hungers in the Elish and I've seen uh uh hundred of trucks they told me uh 480 trucks that day it waiting to enter uh Gaza and only 70 or 80 maximum can enter every day and of course the people they are desperate and they have seen those uh pictures uh I mean uh people that they uh just if they see any truck going inside they try to uh to grab any kind of food or water or with anything that they need so it is a picture exactly that uh illustrates the big need of of those uh people for uh so this has to encourage uh and to uh people to send more more support but also as a pressure uh to the people that they are controlling the entrance to uh make easier the procedure so people they can receive as much humanitarian Aid or food of some clothes there is a winter so it is they need it badly so I would like to ask you forgive me for interrupting you again but I I there's something I I I do want to get your uh your opinion on with regard to the church that we were talking about before and the um Christian Community that is Sheltering inside that church the Israeli military and the government say that their goal is to try to defeat Hamas Fighters that they are hunting for Hamas fighters in order to be able to uh uh to get get rid of them in your understanding is there any reason why this particular sh church should be targeted by the Israeli forces it was promised that it was not going to be hated but unfortunately it was uh also our church and also the uh Anglican by Anglican Church running Hospital the Baptist hospital um uh in in Gaza and many other hospitals and many other worship places so of course it's not understanding um because uh the people that they are Refuge now and shelter inside the church or the uh as as I know uh they are are uh only civilian people there are people that they lost their house so they are asking a refuge to the to the church to the monastery as the most safe place that they aren't the only place that they can stay because they are the houses they are just uh ruined so I don't understand uh why so many uh children children they are victims or lay persons um they are uh dead and they are affected so uh I'm very sorry for that because I know those people that uh our community and all the neighbors and the other people that they are civilians they are not military they are not Hamas but uh this is the picture that it is uh a different picture they have the Israelis and this what is promoting AR Bishop Mario M gianakis thank you very much indeed for being with us
