demonstrators were back at it for the first day of classes greeting new students with the same old demands so for today as as you see kind of like welcoming the new students and reminding them that Colombia is still investing in genocide that Colombia is still investing in weapon manufacturers um and kind of just to remind also Colombia that uh the students are here to stay uh that no matter uh how much uh oppression how much force you put against this student movement this would not stop at least two demonstrators were arrested for unspecified charges other than a statue graffitied with blood red paint the day's protests remained off campus where heightened security measures have been put in place once again the New York police department has been called to the campus also private security has been ramped up for the school year it used to be that the campus was open to anyone who wanted to enter it now you have to show a campus ID or be a pre-registered guest in order to get through the gates other universities have followed suit the University of California banning encampments as well as face masks the University of Virginia encampments as well as the use of megaphones on school days and at Rucker University in New Jersey the organization students for justice in Palestine is no longer recognized while Columbia student organizers say their goal is to end a genocide some Jewish students have complained of anti-Semitism I do not feel safe when the students on this campus are aiding and abetting terrorism a survey of students last year found 76% support divestment from Israel this Jewish Professor argues limiting speech is not the answer so if we go about making things worse taking unpopular measures here and saying it's because of Jews or to protect Jewish students we are absolutely going to make Jewish students the face of repression we're going to single them out in ways that are only going to make the climate worse the student demonstrators are promising more actions until their goals are met regardless Kristen salumi Al jazer New York make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
