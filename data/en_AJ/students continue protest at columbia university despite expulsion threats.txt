at Columbia University in New York students occupying Hamilton Hall have barricaded themselves inside the building this is after the University's management said it had begun suspending students refusing to meet a deadline to abandon their encampment well let's bring in our correspondent tedes Sao who's joining us live from Columbia University in New York and people continuing to protest there today are despite the university suspending students for doing so well that's correct we're right outside Columbia University right in front of Hilton Hall this is the building that was occupied by a group of students that barricaded themselves on Monday night they displayed a flag saying that they're renaming the building after hind rajab who's a six-year-old girl who was killed by the Israeli military and they've remained inside that building since then what we've been seeing is that many the people that you can see right here there are students that have shown outside to show their support they're not being allowed inside the campus the campus is on complete lockdown right now the only essential Personnel are allowed inside or those who live in there the students are saying that they're under siege that they're not they're being isolated by the university trying to force them to leave the campus they're saying that they're not going to do that we've been seeing people taking them food and other things for for them to remain in there but what we're seeing that's changing right now is we're seeing lots of and lots of police presence law enforcement that is coming this way they have completely sealed about two blocks away from where we are right now it's impossible to leave this area the same thing is happening on Broadway Avenue this is right across the campus and on the other side we've been in touch with some of the students they believe that their arrest is imminent we cannot confirm this is going to happen we do not know whether police is going to inside what we do know is that apparently the police is waiting for Columbia University to invite them but when this happened back in on April 17th and 18th over 100 students were arrested and until now they have been trying to prevent that something like this happens again but because of the number of police officers that we're seeing notor around this area but on the other side of the campus many believe that something could happen throughout the night today thank you so much for that today's AO keeping a very close eye on that moving story for us from Columbia University now most of the protesters arrested on charges of trespassing at University of Texas in Austin on Monday are still in jail Heidi Joe Castro has more there has been a slow trickle of the protesters that are being released according to the University of Texas Austin Administration 79 people were arrested arrested for Monday's protests and they have been charged with uh we're seeing a lot of criminal trespassing as the major charge here and now more than 24 hours later still the vast majority remain inside the jail that's behind me and that's despite the calls that you're hearing behind me of not only free Palestine but free those protesters these are UT students some faculty member and other members of the Austin Community that held a vigil overnight waiting for every last one of those arrested to be released and joining us is a guest who is an attorney has been helping some of those that have been detained this is rela sadiki thanks for joining us tell me about the charges that these individuals are facing and some of the criticism that you know this started out as a peaceful protest so are these charges valid I think it's important to note miss castra these continue to be peaceful protests they started as peaceful protests and that never changed and these students are protesting and they're exercising a right constitutionally guaranteed to them at a public university none of them broke any laws um the uh University of Texas Police Department threatened them to with a Criminal Trespass warning if they refuse to disperse which is something they shouldn't have been asked to do in the first place so in in short to answer your question no I don't think these charges are valid how many have been released to your knowledge know and what is what is it that they are going to experience now so um just having been here a couple of hours today um it seems like only a handful probably no more than five or six if I had to guess have been released um obviously these students have been here for a very long time and I'm sure I it goes without saying being in being in a holding cell being in County lockup is traumatizing and experience enough um for kids this young now this is the second wave of arrest a week ago there was another police uh action against protesters who were peaceful as you said and it ended up that those people all had their charges dropped because there was insufficient evidence against them that's what the County Attorney herself said yeah do you see some of those similar legal issues with the charges against these newly arrested protesters absolutely and you know aside from the fact that whatever notice the county claims they gave these students to disperse before they were arrested they have been they have waffled back and forth between what kind of threats they wanted to issue to students they've sent inconsistent emails to students and to faculty and to staff um they've at one point claimed that they would be charging them with criminal trespass at another they claimed that they would be charging with them obstruction um and so that in that in and of itself I think is enough of a notice issue um that these student these students wouldn't have otherwise known that anything that they were doing was illegal and and I and I think that nobody in their position would have thought that what they were doing was illegal especially as at a public university well we appreciate your expertise as an attorney but also interested in your reaction just as a human seeing the images of the protest from yesterday students being maced students being taken down so violently what was your response to seeing that I'm absolutely disgusted um but so overwhelmingly proud of all these kids I honestly my heart explodes every time I turn the TV on every time I come down here to the jail I'm so incredibly proud of of them I can't believe their own government is treating them like this um and you know what they're undeterred I when I was in school I would never have been brave enough to do this and so every time I meet with one in the jail or I come across one when I'm when I'm here at outside the jail I let them know how proud of them they are and I hope that they never stop and I hope that they also know there's always going to be an attorney that will come and get you and you will not be lost or forgotten in there thank you R welcome she and other attorneys have actually offered their time for free every single one of these protesters I'm told is receiving free legal representation that might help them through this Criminal Justice System but then of course they're also facing what could be punishment coming from the UT Administration I asked specifically what will happen to these students because there were some threats of suspension I was told that because this is exam week that these students had to be left in peace not knowing what will happen to them in the future make sure to subscribe to our
