for more than a month now Israel has waged an unprecedented war on the besieged Gaza Strip what many have described quite frankly as genocidal ethnic cleansing an attempt to wipe out and or expel Palestinians from their homes but we all know that all this didn't start on October 7th nor is it likely to end if and when the Israeli military stops bombing The besieged Enclave this has gone on for 75 years will it ever [Music] end let's take a sidebar and talk to Daniel pipes a controversial academic and political commentator and the president of the us-based Middle East Forum Mr Daniel pipes thank you very much for joining us on sidebar you've uh recently written a book entitled Israel Victory Zionist acceptance and Palestinian Liberation now uh we're coming into close to 40 days of uh what is essentially uh Israeli uh attempts at genocide in uh Gaza um this isn't uh as everybody knows uh the first time that there has been uh a war on Gaza nor uh did the crisis that uh uh exists in that area start uh 40 days ago it's something that has been going on for uh decades now so I want to start by asking where you view things mov moving forward and how you view that this uh decades long uh conflict can come to some sort of an end sure i' be happy to but before we get started could I ask you not to use such loaded terms as Israeli genocide against the Palestinians that that then requires me to have to answer it I'm not going to answer I mean if you you don't need to I I'm just if just for our viewers um the United Nations Article 2 of the UN convention describes genocide as a crime committed with the intent to destroy a nation National ethnic racial or religious group in whole or in part the Oxford English Dictionary describes it as the deliberate killing of a people from a particular Nation or ethnic group The of destroying so they're not my words we won't have a productive conversation if you're going to quote me the United Nations I can point out to you what happened October 7th that's not productive I don't really want to engage what about the Oxford what about the Oxford English Dictionary I do not want to engage in pics about the conflict between the Palestinians and Israelis it's really not a useful thing so please don't use words like genocide and I won't you're free you're free of course you're you're free to disagree with them but but let's let's move on I mean they those are like I say they're not opinions we're just going with what we view in the in English language as as the most accurate term as journalists and and that's all but but go ahead how how do you view things moving forward moving forward I see that the Israelis seem to be today November 14th on the the verge of taking control of Gaza or at least Northern Gaza and that Hamas seems to have lost control of it and so this is a very important moment because now we will see what the Israelis have in mind for the future of Gaza there are various options one is for the israelit to come back and take it over and administer the area a second is to bring in the Palestinian Authority a third is to invite some combination of foreign countries and organizations to come in and take it over uh I have my own idea which is that the Israelis carefully and quickly turn the administration over to gazin Gins who are opposed to Hamas opposed to the goal of destroying Israel Gins who are willing to live in neighborly way next to Israel that's not to say they're pro-israel I'm not saying they're Democratic I'm not saying it's a great place to be but it's a decent place to be Gaza has suffered for the last 15 years from the rule of Hamas I think the gazans would be much better off if they lived in environments such as those that can be found in Egypt or Jordan I'm hoping that the Israelis will and the gazin will agree to such an arrangement where Gaza is administered police schools hospitals utilities by gazes themselves no longer if you mind I want to ask you just a couple of things just to to kind of deconstruct a little bit of of that view there the first is uh your suggestion that the Israelis should uh uh hand over the administration to gazin that uh or people in Gaza that it deems fit right not that the people in Gaza should choose who their leadership is precisely because in no Arab speaking country do the people decide who their leadership is so this would be completely consistent with Egypt Jordan Saudi Arabia Qatar and Beyond is that because Arabs don't deserve to choose who their leadership should be no it's because it has been very difficult for Democratic institutions to last look look at Lebanon where they lasted longest it's very difficult so let's not look for the ideal let's accept they're they're realistic but don't don't you view that as a problematic approach um that western or foreign or yeah essentially foreign people should decide on behalf of an indigenous people who should rule them it's not ideal but it's certainly better than what has been the case in Gaza pretty racist last 15 years not racist at all it's saying Gaza is in terrible condition and to establish administration of why is it in a terrible condition it's in a terrible condition because rather than build a constructive economically buoyant politically stable country Hamas has used Gaza as a platform to attack Israel what's the foundations of a strong economically stable country or entity well the first thing you do is not try and destroy your much larger more powerful neighbor okay but it also it's based on trade no trade indeed how can you trade when you are besieged by land air and sea I point out that Gaza has two borders one with Israel and one with Egypt and if the gazan authorities Hamas had not been so destructive in their intentions the borders would have been open on both sides and Gins would come and go trade would come and go but because this was for 15 years 2008 until the present used as a platform for attack of course I was isolated and besieged but that was a choice that Hamas made but I really don't want to argue the Rights and Wrongs of the Arab ear but I think no but it's it's based on the not not to argue about rights or wrongs no no it's just about trying to understand your view moving forward because it's based on our premise and and what I'm understanding and I read some of the excerpts of your book and other writings and now discussing with you uh the premise that you're going off on if I'm correct me if I'm wrong here is that number one the Palestinians shouldn't have a right to self-determination they should be dictated who will rule them number two that they are somehow responsible for the misery that they live in and essentially it negates the fact that they have been under illegal occupation as well as besiegement for uh decades essentially and therefore that that premise seems as a false One how can you base a solution when the actual uh prognosis that has been uh applied to it is an inaccurate one you're making two points the first one is about the Israelis finding the administrators I agree with you that's not ideal but it's a lot better than Hamas ruling the territory why why don't we say that the Israelis somebody should come and dictate to the Israelis who rules them instead of members of the knesset or the cabinet who have essentially called for massacres and ethnic cleansing I on to discuss my idea is not to discuss the Rights and Wrongs this isn't about idea do I really need to point out to you that the Israelis left Gaza in 2005 do you really I would yes of course because they didn't leave sir and you know this come on let's not I'm not coming you've now brought that up not me but they didn't leave in 2005 they besieged it they they locked the doors they decided who goes in what goes in you can't go fishing a few kilometers into the water you can't fly a kite without being there really boys who are sh on the beach you can't bring that I I really don't want to do this I really don't want to argue the Rights and Wrongs of the Gaza Israel this isn't about arguing right or wrong it's about trying to understand your point of view moving forward sir you can't accept you can't expect me to accept it or you can't expect the viewer to accept it without understanding what it is based on it's a very simple simple discussion that's all it is based on the fact that Israel left completely every single Israeli left was forced out in 05 by its own military Israelis left and they wanted nothing to do with Gaza but the gazans kept attacking them and so they had to find things ways to deal with it but the fact is that until a few weeks ago Gaza had no Israelis in it whatsoever sir if I was to leave your house and and park a tank outside it and park a tank on the back would you consider yourself free this is so tedious really you really wanted to argue this I have ideas you ask me about my ideas so tell me tell tell me your ideas tell go ahead let's let's let's hear your ideas is moving forward aside from the Palestinians being dictated who who who uh who should lead them what else are they sir I believe that the is let's call them Israelis and Palestinians though they weren't called that in the 19th century I believe that the Israelis and Palestinians have two sets of mentalities that go back the whole way 140 years to the 1880s that are very consistent and are very inappropriate and I'm hoping there'll be changes in them those ideas are on the Palestinian side that Zionism Jews Israel are unwanted should not be there should be pushed out should be killed should be rejected all all three of them Zionism Jews and Israel you're conflating both Judaism and Zionism here yes yes with exception of a few a few a few members of what are called the old yeshu the pr Zionist Jews of Palestine in the 1820s 30s with those few exceptions people who prayed and didn't do much economically or socially that that they rejected this they didn't want it and that has been the approach of the Palestinians ever since and the Zionist or Israeli approach has been to try and plate and try and conciliate and try and enrich and say to the Palestinians look you'll be better off you'll have modern agriculture you'll have roads you'll have fresh water you'll have electricity you'll be better off thanks to our presence here this was an attit this was an approach that started Way Way Back 140 years ago and continues today these may have made sense in the 1980s they don't make sense today and I'm hoping that there can be a change in these attitudes of rejection and conciliation which are very sterile which go on decade after decade and which lead us to the problems which we now have so so we'll go into if you don't mind those two attitudes as you mentioned uh the first one if you don't mind I'll start with the latter one which is you as you say the uh attempts by Z ists to uh plate the Palestinians as you mentioned and to convince them that they would be better off with Zionist presence because of Agriculture water and economy right deade and enrich yes you're talking about enrichment yeah yeah so that's correct so over over the past uh 75 years Arab owned land uh has reduced drastically the demolition of uh Arab homes has uh increased greatly unemployment has increased um you've got uh you know aside from I'm not going to get into all the schools that have been bombed and all the killings and all of that but let's just go into the economic perspective uh of things as you mentioned there with water uh resources according to the United Nations and other International organizations in fact according to betum uh being hugely skewed in favor of the Jewish population of Israel it's a very strange way of trying to show you're trying to Plate the population I mean I'd hate to see how trying to show them that you dislike them would look like okay well let's take that the Israelis took control of Gaza and the West Bank not just Gaza I'm talking about the entirety I said Gaza and the West Bank in June 1967 the next 20 years until the beginning of the in showed an extraordinary economic success in both areas they were one of the fastest growing economic areas in the world faster than for example Taiwan and South Korea faster than Israel itself or the residents of the West Bank and gazin for the Palestinians it was enormously successful unties based on what metrix I'll be happy to send you the proof universities got started there were no universities before hospitals got established uh buil by who what I'm asking who what what are these we're not talking about who I'm saying that for 20 years there was a economic boom in the West Bank in Gaza so long as Israelis were in charge and there wasn't much of a protest against them it was a tremendous economic boom that began to end with the antifa and it completely ended after the oso Accords yaser Arafat coming in taking over making clear that economics was not his concern that he was interested in using the West Bank and Gaza as platforms for the destruction of Israel and Hamas furthered that so now you have the economic Horror Story that you can see in Gaza but it was doing very well so you shouldn't conflate all these different periods the the Palestinian people are perfectly capable of building their economy and living good productive lives but they have in in the form long as they're subservient to the Israelis is what no so long as they're not under yasar Arafat and and Hamas so long as they're not under brutal totalitarian Thugs who use them exploit them as Canon F against the Israelis so I mean obviously in the absence of uh figures that that uh corroborates your your view here let's move to the idea of the Palestinians as you mentioned rejecting um Zionism and as well you said there Jew Jews as well although you did say there was an exception uh of the uh Jews I'm assuming here you're talking about the Samaritan Jews or I'm not sure or the which which Jews you're talking about that the the Arabs didn't reject the old issue that is to say the very small group of Pious Jews who came mostly from Eastern Europe to to Jerusalem Tiberia saat yes uh heon to to pray basically to be whove been there for for many many years no no many of them came newly they were immigrants a number of them but they were not they were not in any way a challenge they were not engaged in agriculture they were not building economic base they did not have an ideology about building a Jewish homeland so they they were in theory acceptable so see that point there that you you put in there that they weren't there they weren't interested in building a Jewish homeland here is why I want to ask you about why you you coupled both Zionism and Judaism because historically and I obviously you are historian and somebody who who is well read on it um historically Jews living in the Arab world prior to Zionism uh uh did not have an issue as they did for example in Europe or in Russia and other places um and to assume that the Palestinians as you mentioned there have some sort of innate objection to Judaism and want to push some sort of uh agenda against Jews either within Palestine or even even as you mentioned internationally is something that doesn't really add up with the fact that it is about Judaism in so much as it is about those who came to set up a land on their land well you put words in my mouth let me say what I think rather than please do respond to your version what I think I think yes I agree that the experience of Jews in Muslim countries let's drop the word Arab Muslim countries whether arabic speaking or Turkish speaking or Persian speaking or otherwise the experience of Jews in Muslim countries until 1945 was better than the experience of Jews in Christian countries no question that's not to say it was ideal was not to say that there wasn't bias there wasn't Prejudice there wasn't discrimination there was plenty of that but overall the Jewish experience was better in Muslim majority countries than in Christian majority countries and the proof of that is that time and again Jews from the 7th Century till the 20th went from Christian majority countries to Muslim majority countries the very first time I think was in Egypt in the 630s ad and the last time was during World in the buildup to World War II when German Jews left Germany and went to Turkey and sees us again and again true it's it wasn't ideal but it was better than the there was no prg rums there was no Holocaust there wasn't mass killings there was there were there were no there was surely no Holocaust there were small programs but yes overall was definitely better since 1945 however and that predates Israel since 1945 the situation isn't dramatically reversed where the sit the circumstances of Jews much better Christian majority countries than Muslim majority countries so look a million Jews left Morocco Algeria Tunisia Libya Egypt go a whole way across to Afghanistan uh all of them essentially all of them left maybe 20,000 now they left it became very very unpleasant and that's because the latent anti-Semitism that exists in Islam became not latent anymore but blatant became uh forward why was that just coincidental or or why do you think that was that had to do with the leadership of the Muslim majority countries that decided that uh anti-jewish sentiments as well as anti- Zion sentiments were useful to them so for example in a place like Morocco which historically was quite quite a good place for Jews uh there were uh many efforts to show the Jews that they were not welcome and so they left they left you don't think that the fact that was uh for the past 15 years before that mass migration uh towards uh Palestine there was the setting up of militia like the uron and the Hagan and others uh and there was massacres that were taking place on Arab lands that that word spread around the Arab world and that fed into the uh the sentiment that was being targeted towards uh them so you're justifying the treatment of say Iraqi Jews by what happened in Palestine I'm not justifying I'm asking you think there's a corroboration I'm not trying to justify anything I'm just asking is there do you believe there could have been a corroboration between the two that's all there's no question that the Palestinian movement led by Amin Al husseini encouraged leaders from countries like uh Iraq Egypt and Morocco to turn against their Jews to apply pressure on their Jews and they did they found it useful now the Arab speaking countries the governments of arabic speaking countries long ago realized excuse me that this was not a good idea they pursued this 30s 40s 50s 60s and then they stopped this is no longer what what the governments are doing it's quite dramatic I mean you'll see very nasty language coming out of Iran and turkey but you don't hear it coming out of Arab camps Arab capitals don't do this anymore they've left this behind they realize that this was not useful but by by Arab capitals do you mean the regimes or the people no I'm talking about the regimes the regimes let's take NASA the best known the most important he was a soldier in 1948 fighting against is he came to power in the early 50s and he found the uh antagonism against anti-zionism he found it to be very very helpful mobilizing distracting his population and his population was mobilized and distracted he's long gone he died in 1970 and the successors have all for this 50 plus years been trying to move away from that they find anti-zionism a problem however the Egyptian population remains quite anti-zionist and the governments are trying to reduce this so I want to I want to ask you on that on that point that's why I wanted to to to see where where your view was on that um because here we're going to come to the normalization and and other things about moving forward with within not just within uh Palestine but Beyond in the in in the region but first I I just want to ask you you you had said um speaking at the Zionist Federation once or or or Congress that the Israelis must be encouraged to defeat the Palestinians I just want to understand what does that mean what do you mean by the Israelis because part of your book is calling for you say that the diplomacy doesn't work essentially and the way forward is for total victory in war by the Israelis um and only then can the Palestinians be liberated ultimately when they're totally defeated can can you explain that a bit please you're not quoting the accurately I didn't say total Victory and War I said Victory that's all and by what I mean by Victory is that the Palestinians recognize that their mentality of rejectionism I'm saying no no no no no is bad for them bad for Israel bad for everyone but it's time for the Palestinians to come to terms with existence of the state of Israel it is 75 years old it is there it is strong it is permanent and it's time for the Palestinians to come to terms with it and when they do they will be liberated from their obsessive irredentism against their neighbor which harms their neighbor of course Israel but it harms them even more I mean look at Gaza today look how much harm this is done it's time for the Palestinians to move on and that's only going to happen when the Israelis make that their goal which they're not doing until now maybe in the last few weeks it's changed but until now their approach has been one of management dealing with it but I think that's the wrong approach it just keep I need to just deconstruct this because again this is something for our viewers to understand here and these aren't loaded terminologies like I say I will use I will reference bet Salam which is an Israeli human rights organization and Amnesty International and others who say that what Israel is practicing is a parte okay now ultimately how it comes across and please feel free to correct me and and if I'm misquoting or misunderstanding you but how it comes across here is it as if somebody were to tell the black South Africans the indigenous people of South Africa or Nelson Mandela that you must stop resisting a partide because it will just bring you misery and the sooner you liberate yourself from an attempt to free yourself and just accept that you will be second class citizens or accept that you will be governed by you will have no self-determination the happier you will be is that analogy in your view correct the analogy if there if you must draw an analogy between South Africa and Israel it would be between the black South Africans and the Muslim citizens of Israel who constitute nearly 20% of Israel who I will not argue Christians by the way very few almost entirely Muslim they're Drews they're Christians but it's very very largely Muslim they are not in perfect conditions uh they have many uh complaints about police presence about investment in infrastructure and the like but they are free people they are productive people they are presidents of banks they're members of the Supreme Court they're members of of parliament uh they are teachers they are doctors and so forth there's no apartheid they can go where they want they can live where they want they have the same rights and duties as Jewish Israelis it's not perfect I grant you that but it is fundamentally egalitarian with every Israeli citizen whe Muslim or Jewish or Christian or Drews or other are having the same rights so it's an absurd comparison there's no parthe regime in Israel there is equality how do you explain Muslim Israelis on the Supreme Court how do you explain that they're ambassadors how do you explain that they're Ministers of State how do you explain that if there's a there's much I mean there there are there you had uh the British uh Home Secretary or or the former British home secret secretary who was from an ethnic minority who was the biggest champion of racist policies it doesn't mean much in the end of the day and you'll have that in every country where you have tokenistic people I don't think that but the what what will explain the aparte as I say according to Human Rights organizations is the different number plates that are being used is the fact that uh you have different uh allocation of water of electricity of land of roads that are specifically designated to settlers to use and others there's plenty you're talking wait a minute you're talking about the West Bank whether you're right or wrong you're talking about the West Bank I'm talking about Israel proper what is Israel proper because Israel hasn't even defined its the borders what is Israel proper Israel proper is within the green line within the green line the citizens of Israel whether they be Muslim or Jewish have the same license plates use the same what about the ones in in Jerusalem what about the ones in Jerusalem who have house constantly there you brought up South Africa and I reluctantly went ahead with the comparison and the comparison is the citizens of South Africa black brown and white and the citizens of Israel Muslim and Jewish and I'm saying there is no comparison now if you want to switch subjects and go to the West Bank that's a completely different story and Gaza it's a completely different story but if you want to bring up South Africa the comparison is with the Israeli Muslim citizens and they have they're not tokens they are everywhere in Israel they're in hospitals they're in Banks they're universities they're everywhere they're 20% man they're they're they're unable to pray in in their holy sites they also have their homes taken from them in Jerusalem they also have eviction notices constantly you can't dismiss that and say just because there are a few people that are in some positions that these things don't happen these are daily practices in in sh J and other places it's you're talking about Eastern you're talking about Eastern Jerusalem that's not that's not what I was talking about I was talking about the citizens of Israel the J Muslim jerusalemites are not citizens very very few of them are it's not the topic the topic are the citizens Muslim citizens of of C of of that is what's comparable to South Africa any case I really okay I I just want to finish finish with one last with one last question if you don't mind I just want to finish with one last question if you don't mind and and obviously you've written a lot not just about Israel Palestine but also about uh what you describe as uh islamist extremism uh you had obviously the campus watch initiative uh a couple of decades ago where it was encouraged to uh essentially report on what you perceived to be threats towards the United States and other places you describe wait wait wait wait your character it's not a couple of decades ago it's still there today the but it started a couple of decades ago is my point it started yes it did but made it sound like it's over and it's not primarily about students telling on their teachers it's a very very small didn't I didn't say students telling your teachers I said where the point was we want to hear from students yes but that's not the primary purpose the purpose is to critique the study of Middle East of the Middle East in the United States there was a there was a part of it as you mentioned where I want to ask you about is there is a video that came up online a couple of days ago of a chaplain from the United Kingdom leads University one of the biggest universities in the United Kingdom uh who is currently serving uh in the Israeli Army in Gaza um and uh he's encouraging his students essentially to support uh this even though he is a chaplain at the University part of Campus watch and part of some of your teachings was talking about the threat of uh uh uh what you described as uh islamists on campus and what impact that would have on the fabric of American society on uh uh peace and so forth uh there and the threat that it posed to Americans uh I haven't read anything or heard anything from you about the uh dual National Israelis in the west who serve in the Israeli Army um and where their loyalty stands and what impact that that extremism can have on uh the respective uh societies back whether in the United States or the United Kingdom or other places you brought up so many things about lead University about campus watch about dual citizen Americans I don't know where to start let me just say that uh there are plenty of dual citizens I am one myself I'm both American and polish um I don't think that's a problem Poes don't think it's a problem the Americans don't think it's a problem it's very common by now a lot of people have two or even more no no my question is about nationality it's about serving in the Israeli Army and why that doesn't pose as real a threat as uh the threats that you say other Muslims uh post what I I don't see Muslims as a threat I don't see Islam as a thread see islamism as a threat I see islamism as a radical utopian ideology like fascism and communism it seeks to take use people in the pursuit of an ideological goal it's the islamists that un battling whether it be on the campus or in any other venue I think islamism is a destructive ideology first of all to the Muslim population they're the ones who suffer the most I mean look at Afghanistan look at Iran look at Sudan look at what turkey look at the Terrible Things it's doing and secondly to the outside world so I'm not fighting Islam I'm not fighting Muslims indeed Muslims are the main Ally in fighting islamism Muslims are increasingly turning against islamism I believe but there's no threat from Zionism is my question you don't view a threat from militant Zionism you're kidding me Zionism is a thre to whom come on islis million Palestinians or is a threat to the US economy which it drains for billions of dollars a year or is a threat to anybody who criticizes Israel and could lose their job in Europe as we've seen we can agree on one thing that the money the the United States taxpayers sends to Israel is a bad idea a few billion a year I agree with you it shouldn't be but otherwise I see Zionism as Jewish nationalism no more a threat than French nationalism or Peruvian nationalism or or Egyptian nationalism or katari nationalism I see the threat being a transnational radical utopian ideology like fascism communism or islamism Zionism is transnational though but anyway thank you very much we've finished uh our time here pleasure talking to you Mr Daniel pipes thank you you you too
