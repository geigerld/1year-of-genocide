I mean, her affairs were good, and I was taking her home.  Physiotherapy session 15 months before the war. When we came to the tents, the chubs, mosquitoes, and bears were infesting them. I mean, we brought them here. They said, “There are medicines, and there are none.” I mean, Sue died because of the lack of medicines, and she died because of malnutrition. She died because we were in tents, in tents, living for nine months in  It is present and it is not present, but what is present means expensive. For example, we put nuts on the zucchini, on the food, on the thing. We mix it too. You want electricity. You want a blender. You want it.
