let's bring in Daniel Levy he's the president of the US Middle East project he's also a former Israeli political negotiator joining us from London thanks for your time once again so um I mean it it's really is a numbers game right now right when it comes to the release of the hostages uh from Gaza so at what point is it going to become real difficult to negotiate these extensions that we're seeing well indeed darene there are a number of variables and the one that appears to be pushing against the time clock most immediately is that the formula that exists relates to uh women non-combatants children elderly um who are being held in Gaza that category seems to be being exhausted so to speak there will have to be a new package negotiated if one is is going to move to these other categories can one do that in time to extend this sensation without getting back into what you have just reminded us is the intention of the Israeli political and Military leadership to resume its allout assault on Gaza they are being clear that that's where they want to go there are other pressures that exist because if that resumes then the death destruction Devastation we can anticipate will happen again the Americans are apparently saying hey we're with you on you continuing your military Mission but can you do it differently that sounds like a disingenuous position to me because why would anyone have faith that Israel will do this differently and Israel has given no one any reason to believe that you will not return to the absolutely horrendous civilian casualties plus we now have the effect of the devastation already which is the humanitarian crisis you heard what Dr kados from the who has has warned us about disease sanitation water the conditions now are so dire look this idea Daniel Levy of all for all this is something that we heard at the beginning of the the war Hamas said we'll give you all your captives in Gaza give us all our Palestinian prisoners in jail do you think that this is an idea that Israel is even willing to entertain at this point or can it be pressured into it either domestically or internationally it's an important variable what you just raised for us darene this idea of all for all uh is being discussed it's actually polling surprisingly highly I haven't got the numbers in front of me amongst Israelis I don't know if that's where we will go I don't think that's the immediate Next Step dur but also we we have to consider that on the Israeli side at the moment at least the political and Military leadership are saying well even if we go there we're still going to continue the military operation so I think what would have to be embedded in any kind of package and Hamas understands that the soldiers is is holding are the the high value levers in terms of a negotiation deal but it would have to include some kind of end decisive end to the Israeli phase of this kind of military bombardment and then the question becomes exactly as you suggested what is the balance of internal and external pressure that might get us there the internal pressure pressure has been very significant in forcing and I I use that word intentionally in forcing the Israeli political leadership to accept even these last several days of release and cessation because that deal was on the table before the ground Invasion that deal has pretty much been on the table for weeks and it was rejected until the internal pressure was sufficient but only a combination of internal and external pressure will get us to a permanent cessation uh Daniel leave you so just tell me what you see happening in the next it's less than 24 hours now before that ceasefire uh extension expires so what do you think we'll see tomorrow I I I'm not going to look into my crystal ball because I don't have one but we do have secretary blinken in the region I think that perhaps gives some more breathing space we do have ideas out there we do have the continued Cuttery mediation we may already have run out of Road my fear is that whether it's tomorrow or in the next 48 72 96 hours we are going to run out of Road in this current iteration and we need something to tide us over so we don't go now to see in South Gaza where so many people have been forced yet more civilian death as a result of his ir bombardment and I don't see and here's the thing I don't see how that happens without a very active American intervention to draw a line under this and right now the Biden Administration is pretending that it can have uh support for an Israeli Mission which doesn't cause those devastating consequences on the civilian population they will have to shift that position and and this is crucial Dar they will have to create a situation where by the gap between what they are saying to the isra in private and what they are saying in public is not so great that Israel can play in that space and can bamboozle and basically do what it wants with the Americans okay unfortunately we will need both them and perhaps others including in the region to make sure that we don't get back to the horrors of of what we've seen okay we'll leave it there Daniel Le we thank you so much for speaking to us from London thank you
