Israel says that it is committed to the release of Israeli captives held by Hamas and part of its strategy includes launching more strikes on Gaza we are fighting to secure the release of all the remaining hostages women and men young and old civilians and soldiers it is only unrelenting military pressure combined with intense diplomatic efforts that has secured the release of those 110 there will be no one left behind we will continue fighting to bring back the remaining 137 the IDF has resumed targeting Hamas Terror targets striking more than 400 over the weekend including extensive aerial attacks in the KH Unice area I'm joined Now by Imran Khan who's in Tel Aviv Imran I wonder what the Israelis Israeli authorities uh military war cabinet Etc are saying about how they're Prosecuting this war in this new phase of their offensive specifically in light of the fact that last night the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin nety who held this press conference and he said we're not trying to harm Palestinians and yet today we're learning that it's been one of the worst death tolls since October the 7th with more than 700 Palestinians killed in the last 24 hours I'm just wondering how Israel is framing its operation at the moment well it's framing it in the same way it was framing it before the ceasefire took place Israel says it has three clear aims uh to bring back all the captives to destroy Hamas politically and militarily and make sure Gaza is never used to attack Israel again now there's a PR element to all of this as well uh Israel is now much more focused on showing what these targets are uh in shuay they've released pictures of Hamas Fighters it claims to be members of the shuay Battalion and has said to them uh you guys are going to die you are we are going to attack you that's been a very clear message then uh you have this idea of safe zones now this idea of safe zones within Gaza they've issued this map they divided it all up in safe zones they've said when we attack those safe zones we'll give you warning so the civilians can leave but where are they going to go that's the other big question the reason uh a lot of analysts are suggesting that this map is taking place this kind of PR strategy is taking place is because the Americans are putting them under a tremendous amount of pressure Israel right now knows it needs needs a reasonably quick but absolutely decisive victory over Hamas and that has to happen within weeks not months the Secretary of State US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has been absolutely clear on this point he has said you don't have months to do this you have perhaps weeks to do this and while you do it you have to make sure that civilians are protected hence this idea of safe zones uh is a clear message to the Americans that the Israelis are trying on the ground it doesn't really mean anything as we've seen uh but also this idea that we're trying to get humanitarian Aid in 55 trucks uh entering a day from one checkpoint uh in the Rafa checkpoint for example you used to get 700 trucks a day that was only from one 55 isn't even a drop in the ocean and then sirel let's just go back to those pictures from jabalia let's just see what's been going on there is that defending protecting civilians giving them enough notice you know 700 people within 24 hours have died have lost their lives as you just pointed out all of these pictures that we're seeing are the things that the US President Joe Biden simply didn't want to see he's in a political fight as well uh remember uh he's got an election coming up he knows that all of these pictures damage his reputation the Americans are in freefall mode with this kind of diplomacy trying to do something uh to get the Israelis to back down but the Israelis they seem to just be dictating to the Americans they seem to be saying listen we're going to do this war the way we want to do it okay we understand your concerns but we're still going to you make sure uh that we try and get these stated aims done and these stated aims like I say are leading to those pictures we've just seen from jabalia refugee camp yeah and and this Bears repeating and you've you've you have uh addressed this Imran but it I I think it Bears repeating that the Israelis and I listened to that press conference with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last night their messaging is not that we're toning things down their messaging is the only way for us to achieve our goals our goals haven't changed the only way for us to achieve them is to actually intensify intensify things especially on the ground that's absolutely right the Israelis are going in now there's two things that are going on here that are worth repeating firstly for all the American pressure that's been put on them the Americans are still supplying them with money and with weapons and those are the weapons that are being used to fight in Gaza so there's a contradictory element to what the Americans are saying um then you have northern Europe particularly the French the Germans and the British who are backing Israel's right to defend itself that's what they're calling it uh to the hilt that is not having uh the same kind of uh reaction that the Israelis would hope in the global South in the global South the Israelis are coming under tremendous amounts of criticism um and particularly within parts of southern Europe as well so the Israelis are sticking to their guns because they know if they listen to the Americans if they listen to the the the global South it's not going to make a huge amount of difference uh domestically they're under a tremendous amount of domestic pressure there's still a lot of Sympathy for the Israelis and this war that they're conducting in Gaza at home people are still very angry about the events of October 7th when 1200 people were killed that is still a raw emotion that the Israelis have so the Israeli I have got this two-pronged uh almost pressure on them one domestic to actually go in and actually destroy Hamas and if that means flattening Gaza well that means flattening Gaza and then you have the international pressure on them as well uh that says well you need to do humanitarian Aid you need to have protect civilians and that is something that the Israelis are can't seem to do because this intensive bombardment is something that they are keeping up now just one point before I hand back to you sirel but remember the Americans uh just before the ceasefire was coming to an end linkoln was uh in town he did say to the Israelis if you do go into the South it can't be with the same intense pressure as you did in the north just take a look at the pictures oh absolutely and that is exactly what we're doing the same pictures that you referenced with uh well that what we're watching here is jabalia that's in the north but we've also seen in the last 36 to 48 Hours what's been happening in the South with and the bombardments there have intensified and once again targeted row upon row of residential buildings uh Imran Khan reporting there thank you so much
