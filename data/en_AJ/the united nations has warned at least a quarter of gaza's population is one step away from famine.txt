is Jonathan kutab he's an international human rights lawyer he's also a co-founder of the Palestinian human rights groups alhak Jonathan what is your assessment of the legal grounds of South Africa's request as it stands well uh I think the request is very proper under international law uh people seem to forget that it is the obligation of Israel under international law to provide food and basic services to the people under its occupation not only has Israel failed to meet that uh obligation it has also obstructed and prevented others from bringing food in as part of a deliberate strategy to starve the Palestinian people in fact it was announced we will cut off food we will cut off water we will not allow fuel in we will not allow these things in and then they started allowing it in and a drip drip fashion we will allow a few trucks here we'll allow a few trucks there but we will also control not only how much food comes in and what kind of food comes in we also want to control who does the distribution and who safeguards these convoys in the beginning it was the regular police who would Safeguard these convoys but then Israel started targeting these police because they are in uniform sometimes they are armed so they consider them uh enemy combatants members of Hamas and they shoot them then after a while the convoys have no protection to protect them uh once they come in Israelis also determined that they will not allow the food to come in through the north there's 300,000 people living in the northern half of the Gaza Strip and Israel has control of of all the borders and The Crossings there they don't allow any food to come in from the north instead it has to come from the south after it is inspected by the Israelis so by the time the food convoys even the the few that are allowed by the time they enter uh they have to feed the people on the way so they're either attacked or that they are looted or people who are hungry simply grab the food on the way the starvation now is becoming part of Israel's policy they want to stop the Jonathan it's clear that Israel has not complied with the previous provisional measures that the court handed down and we also don't know what was in the report that they were due to submit to the icj over a week ago many have described them as acting with impunity what sort of recourse is there well I think the question now is about the court itself and about international law in a real way what South Africa did uh was not so much put Israel on trial but put international law itself on trial uh put the system of international law and the icj itself because like every other court in the world the court doesn't have an army its enforcement depends on the willingness of the population and of the countries of the world to obey its rules and when Israel acts with total and utter impunity and nobody is bringing them to accountability and the United States of course uses the veto to prevent the security Council from enforcing international law then international law itself uh becomes uh under question you say that this is is pressure on the court now by all accounts Gaza is on the brink of famine we know it's already happening in parts of the strip the icj case that we're talking about is potentially going to take years so what sort of a difference would more provisional measures make if the court does grant them to South Africa is this then about ramping up diplomatic pressure too on Israel's allies is is that where the difference lies yes a diplomatic and moral pressure uh because if the court speaks and speaks clearly then it's on the countries of the world whether they are willing to respect international law or to allow Israel to act with impunity I think it becomes more difficult for the United States it becomes more difficult for countries uh for example countries which have cut off uh the aid to Ana which is the only organization capable of Distributing that food already the EU has changed its position and Canada has changed its position and hopefully the other countries also will uh end the suspension of Aid to hona Jonathan we've been talking primarily here about the icj case but as you say the constraints on humanitarian Aid as people are starving to death are also in clear violation of humanitarian law is there then perhaps another route another simultaneous route to some kind of accountability well the only the only route that is available uh is the different countries of the world uh at the United Nations uh three times they already tried and even a fourth time and each time they were blocked by a us veto already we are hearing some uh sounds from the American Administration that they want uh a ceasefire that they want food to be allowed in unimpeded that more food should be allowed in uh how serious they are uh we will find out in the next few days we will indeed and we'll continue watching very closely indeed Jonathan cutab there an international human rights lawyer and also a co-founder of the Palestinian Human Rights group alhak thank you for joining us on Al jazer thank you
