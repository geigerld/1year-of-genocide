We Begin this newsour in Gaza where Israeli military strikes have killed at least 200 people and injured hundreds more in several locations in a 24-hour period prime minister Benjamin nany is vowing to continue fighting Hamas despite growing International pressure to end the war a death toll of more than 18,600 Palestinians right now relatives are mourning the deaths of at least 27 seven people killed in Israeli strikes on two houses in the city of RAF in the south of Gaza Israeli bombs have caused mass destruction in the densely populated city of jabalia in the north meanwhile a teenager been shot dead during an Israeli military operation in the Janine refugee camp in the occupied West Bank more than 600 people have been arrested just the past 3 days the UN says almost 1 million displaced Palestinians that's nearly half the population of Gaza are now Sheltering around ra hash begins our coverage this is home for tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians the 10th city spraing across the desert irfa Southern Gaza is the latest temporary shelter for families who have been displaced again and again since the beginning of Israel's war this family left their home in sh all the way in the north they moved to anat in central Gaza but that was bombed too so they decided to go to Kan yunas where Israel said Palestinians would be safe now KH yunas is the focus of heavy air strikes so Noah and 50 members of her extended family ended up here in this desolate area of Rafa we have nothing here except for this nylon that we used to cover ourselves no food no water no toilets no furniture at least at a school we used to get Aid here there is nothing they traumatized and terrified of more Israeli attacks they're grappling with a tough reality is originally from ATI born in a refugee camp she never imagined her life there would be shattered and that she would end up fleeing for the sake of her family's safety but not knowing where to go they sought refuge in Al shifa Hospital in Gaza City but it was a short [Music] day the hospital was bombarded and it became dangerous with trapnel flying over our heads we left in a hurry without even taking anything of our belongings it was so scary we had to go on a road controlled by the Israelis raf's Hamed hospital is where many displaced families are converging but as their numbers increase the conditions become worse our life is a tragedy there are no toilets we try to come up with Solutions so we can survive we walk a kilometer hoping to get water which is often salty and undrinkable words cannot sum up our suffering and there's no end inside to the war Israel says it will continue its bombardment until Hamas is defeated and in the middle of the attacks the 2.3 million Palestinians living in Gaza are battling hunger disease and cold many have lost everything friends loved ones homes belongings and many fear this could be just the beginning of an endless another Exodus hash Al jaaz well Han Mahmud is live from Us in Raf in southern Gaza last time we spoke hany we were talking about the Kuwaiti hospital and Strikes there what can you tell us about the situation now yes there is still a bit of chaos inside the hospital Sammy and then since the last time we spoke things are getting worse and and worse and there is a growing fear that the intensity of the uh the strikes will continue to Surge as we are drawing to the end near the the end of the day but within the past 45 minutes or so an air strike targeted a residential home just a five minutes drive away from the hospital is a densely populated a neighborhood known in in ra neighborhood where residential home belongs to aladi family was targeted and destroyed completely in the courtyard of the hospital at the emergency reception uh we we counted at least 15 of of the critically injured the the vast majority of them were children and women brought to uh to the hospital there just within the past few minutes the hospital announced here that they were two reported killed in the air strikes two adults and one one uh two-year-old uh baby girl died in the in those in this attack on the residential uh building uh some of the very critical injuries inside the hospital were transferred right away to a larger size bigger size in hospital in raah just for better uh medical treatment they are better equipped and ready to receive cases that are critical conditions and this is part of a long series of of blood shedding going on since the early hours of this morning and late hours of last night where two residential homes were destroyed and more than 27 people reported killed and there are more still under the dbls the last time we heard it from the rescue team on the ground they they find it very difficult to remove those large pieces of concrete to to save who might have still survived surviving under under the rubbles and hany what do we know about people who have been rounded up at the kamalan hospital yes well this is part you know Sammy this has been going on for a while now now Kam is a very small midsize Hospital remaining Hospital in the northern part but came out of service as Israel constantly targeted and bombed the hospital and what we're seeing since the the early hours of yesterday's morning when the isra military completely surrounded the hospital and started targeting the medical staff there reports about members of medical team were killed some of the evacuees were actually shot at directly by the snipers in the vicinity of the hospital on the all the highrise uh building but what's going on there is a particular video uh that that has been circulated and and just part of isra propaganda of what's going on the hospital at this particular time since the beginning of every hospital a requested a a support security Personnel inside the hospital we're talking about members of the police department they work inside the hospital at this emergency just to keep security and maintain order as this time it gets really chaotic and it it bars medical team from working so what the Israeli military been doing since yesterday all day long been calling on loud speaker asking for all the security Personnel inside the hospital to come out with their weapons uh but what we're seeing today is a video that talking about that these are Fighters or operatives inside the hospital and these are their weapons but we just a little bit of Investigation just to look at the kind of weapons the bats that they're holding you can right away conclude that these are security Personnel they were there for the maintaining the order and the stability just happened to be caught inside the hospital uh uh because they there was no way to leave as the entire area was under heavy bombardment for the past weeks we're talk about day to-day uh bombardment inside and and outside the vicinity and the whole area uh uh of jabalia and we can just with with confidence according to the spokes person of the health Ministry who stated that these are security personnel and the Z military was requesting them to come out of the hospital uh with their hands above their head and to put their their weapons uh in front of them and that's what happened today but calling them operatives and and fighter is just very it's false and it just contradicts what the Israeli military did with the loud speakers yesterday all right we'll leave it that thanks so much H Mahmud
