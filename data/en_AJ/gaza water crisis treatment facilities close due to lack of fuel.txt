it's a basic necessity of life but for Palestinians in Gaza clean water is scarce thousands of displaced people travel Everyday by foot to one of the gaza's last operating dissemination plans it's an everyday ordeal we come to fill water two to three times a day some of this water is for drinking and some we use for washing it's a crisis a daily mental and physical struggle were drained and exhausted most of gaza's water treatment and sanitation infrastructure has been badly damaged or destroyed by Israel since October 7th Palestinians here now rely on what Aid gets through Israeli restrictions and remaining treatment plants but there is not enough fuel getting into the strip to keep them running the station stopped operating due to lack of fuel that's what we were told we fetch sea water to wash our belongings but it's not it's just too salty the crowded conditions and lack of Sanitation here mean there's a constant risk of disease and without clean water even basic hygiene becomes a struggle I have two boys with special needs they need care and they need water it takes me about an hour to go get water sometimes when I get back I find them crying in the tent they need someone to stay with them they need mineral water and it's not available they need a proper tent and hygiene the shortage of water is adding more misery to the lives of tens of thousands of Palestinians currently staying in makeshift camps after being displaced several times in the past few months hind alaza paltin make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaaz
