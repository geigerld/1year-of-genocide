well katar says it's appalled by remarks reportedly made by Israel's prime minister about doha's role in mediating the release of captives from Gaza in a leaked recording Benjamin Netanyahu Was Heard saying that K's role was problematic and he was unhappy Washington didn't apply more pressure on them in a statement published on X the Qatari foreign Ministry warned that if such comments were true they were irresponsible and destructive to the efforts to save innocent lives H Salu joins us now from occupied East Jerusalem just tell us a little bit more about really what the Prime Minister has reportedly said because um it's having repercussions regionally isn't it well in leaked remarks in a meeting with families of captives currently being held inside of Gaza the Israeli Prime Minister reportedly expressing frustration on a wide variety of issues the First with the Karis comparing them to the likes of the Red Cross and the United Nations saying that the kataris are actually in fact even more problematic than both of those Aid agencies he also is expressing a lot of dissatisfaction with the United States really saying that he was quote very angry at the fact that the United States renewed their presence at the base inq which is the largest in the Middle East for an additional 10 years he also says that the Americans should be putting more pressure on the qataris but not exactly elaborating how now these remarks have had severe repercussions they are being slammed by The kataris Who I'll remind you have had an integral and crucial role in mediating this conflict and also helping to facilitate not only Aid going into Gaza those medicines going to the captives but also the deal we saw back in November that saw the release of 110 captives being held inside of Gazo so theis are saying that if these remarks are true they're actually not surprising and the Israeli prime minister is obstructing and and really getting in the way of these negotiations undermining them in a way that is very harmful to the future of getting these captives out of Gaza the Israeli Prime Minister has been echoing that military pressure is the only way to bring them back but the reality is much different it's all of this behind the scenes negotiation and mediating between Hamas and the Israelis for which the qataris have proved that they are a crucial partner for and salute thanks very much for that update
