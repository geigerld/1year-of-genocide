German Chancellor Olaf Schultz has warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against his plans for a ground offens of in thefa the two leaders met in West Jerusalem Schultz urged Netanyahu to protect civilians in Gaza and highlighted the need for desperately needed humanitarian Aid he said the world cannot stand by as Palestinians risk starvation the longer the war last the higher the number of Civilian casualties Rises the more desperate the situ ation of the people in Gaza become the more this begs the question no matter how important the goal can it justify such terribly high costs or are there other ways to achieve your goal take the ground of fastive in Rafa the military logic is one consideration but there is a humanitarian logic as well how should more than 1.5 million people be protected where should they go we've just had uh uh I think a very serious conversation an important conversation among friends uh you express your concern for two things one protecting civilians and second uh provision of uh humanitarian Aid and I explain that these are our concerns as well uh because we agree with both goals meanwhile the EU commission president Ursula Von delion has echoed schulz's sentiments during a visit to to Cairo we are all extremely concerned about the war in Gaza and the unfolding catastrophic humanitarian situation Gaza is facing famine and it is critical to achieve an agreement on the ceasefire R now that frees the hostages and allows more humanitarian Aid to reacha and we are very concerned about the risks of a full scale offensive in Raa that to be devastated for of Civilian po let's bring in Madan Bashar alaz a senior political analyst he's joining us live from Paris good to see you mwan so strong comments on the face of it from Schultz from velan but do you think they'll put any real pressure on Netanyahu well listen to what Netanyahu just said I'm sure our viewers around the world have heard what I heard Netanyahu is of course concerned for civilian life in Gaza and of course he is concerned for humanitarian Aid to Gaza I mean if that's not comical I don't know what is of course it's also tragic that the Israeli Prime Minister can continue to lie despite being told once and again by his Western allies from Germany Brussels and Washington that's something that I give that that the price is too high that the scenes are too disturbing for Western public opinion that Palestinian death is no longer workable uh as a policy but again when you listen to vendor line saying we cannot stand by as children die really five months 20,000 children and women killed and vandaline stands there and says we cannot stand by while children die while they were complicit for five months in the killing of Palestinian children it's really astounding it's shocking it's deceptive it's a circus what we see happening in Cairo and T Aviv with Western allies pretending to be humanitarian in this regard why do you think they make are making these statements and how much do you think that Netanyahu is emboldened by the fact that you know Schultz said Israel has our full support but then said the cost of the war has been too high on Palestinians which is you know sounds a lot like what US President Joe Biden said earlier this month when asked about red lines Why the mixed messages that's exactly what Biden has said European leaders are simply parting what the American leaders are saying they're not inventing the wheel they're not expressing any independent policy of the United States the same public pressure that Western leaders are facing whether in this side of the Atlantic or that side of Atlantic adds up to more of the same it just looks too bad now the hypocrisy is too great the double standard is incredible it's the same vender line that supported Ukraine against Russia but supported Israel genocide in Palestine their their double standard and hypocrisy beyond belief they're parting the American lines because the American president told them to do so Washington is on a pressure spree they want natany to wage the war the way they he they want him to wage the war not the way the Israeli government of Fanatics and fascists want to wage the war but it's going to be War nonetheless whether it is waged American style or Israeli style yes hopefully there will be I can't believe I'm saying hopefully but yes less civilian casual is the better the the quicker the War Winds down the better the quicker we can get to a ceasefire of course it's better for everyone involved but the Nan government is not feeling any pressure only hearing words and more words but when it comes to Deeds the West is doing nothing to stop that genocidal war and yet they're saying and yet they're saying that the situation is not acceptable so if Germany if the European Union don't want a ground offensive in Raa like they keep saying that they don't want a ground offensive in Raa to go ahead do you think we might see them use sanctions more than words against Israel no no no no no no sanctions no sanctions I mean we've heard the same again and again you know we've been bit from that same poisonous bite already in the past five months remember when they were talking against land Invasion on the third week of October but the same happened genocide followed then they said Israel will respect human rights and if it doesn't then something got to give nothing gave Israel continues to get the support but it gets criticism sometimes it gets some kind of you know what you need to do this that and the other thing but it it's not followed with Deeds it's not followed with sanctions it's not followed with pressures it's just words and Netanyahu has already made clear today past 24 hours that he's not going to submit to that kind of diplomatic pressure by Israel's allies that he's going to continue with business as usual killing Slaughter in Gaza ra and so how then mwan does this complete lack of any real International pressure bed for those ceasefire negotiations that are going to continue in Doha on Monday with the head of Israel's intelligence agency traveling to Doha what are the prospects then for peace okay let me tell you why this is important right it's because Israel doesn't mind a trans transitional ceasefire a ceasefire for a number of weeks whereby a lot of their captives are released and they try to figure out what to do about RAF how they can be able to place the Palestinians once again because as things stand today Hamas leadership is not capitulating Hamas Fighters are not raising their hands in surrenders and the Palestinians in Gaza are not Rising against the against Hamas and hence Israel wants to take its time and since there is pressure it will accept a temporary ceasefire whereby it can reorganize and get a lot of these captives released after that according to Israeli officials they want to continue with the war mwan thank you as always that is our senior political analyst mwan Bashar in Paris
