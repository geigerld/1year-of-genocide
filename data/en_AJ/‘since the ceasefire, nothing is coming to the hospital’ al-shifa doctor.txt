it is designated for the world and for other municipality services and so on and for ready Christian Society ambulances this is what I hear from them till now and Israeli they are not allowing any fuel to come to the hospitals to the especially to Ministry of Health hospitals there this days from the AIDS that's coming from uh to Gaza through the RAF border crossing over the past few days while this ceasefire has been in place how much Aid has reached you at El shifa hospital I know what you've said about fuel what about Medical Aid that you've needed have you gotten anything uh since this

and other stuff that and the fuel some of the fuel which designated to the other to other surface part of in how many patients are currently still at elifa hospital today no I I sadly to say that we don't have any patients now most of the patients are evacuated to the sou hospital but a huge number of patient they are at homes they are asking for the surfaces to complete their management not all patients who got injured during this war they are they went to the Souther hospital they stayed here in Gaza and in the northern part of Gaza a huge number of injured patients with the fracture they are coming each day to ask about the Health Service about okay to the close the shifa but tomorrow we hope that we'll open the emergency department and to start to receive the newcomers and new and new patient to ship in terms of priorities as to what you need right now you've been very clear that you need fuel yes yeah can you tell us what else the top priority for us is the fuel and to repair the generator okay to maintain our oygen generators and so on but the most important thing is the fuel to run the generators of the hospital without the fuel we cannot do anything really in these hospitals uh Dr abusada just a final question for you because we know that when Israel besieged the hospital and forced the patients to leave at the time or a few days later it um detained some of the medical staff working there including the the director of the hospital Muhammad abui um can you update us on um do you know anything about his status or his whereabouts right now uh still Dr Abu
