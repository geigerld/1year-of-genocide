your reaction let's get uh the take from Maran bashara Al jaz's senior political analyst he comes to us from Paris um you know let's get your reaction to this uh breaking news uh of uh Hamas submitting its response to this outlined this us ceasefire proposal that's certainly a positive good news that the Hamas decided to engage uh with the Proposal with the American initiative based on apparently an Israeli proposal it's uh after it comes after Hamas has welcomed uh the UN Security Council resolution uh adopting that American proposal which as you just outlined uh does have three phases but eventually needs to lead to a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza now the past 48 hours we've heard different um declarations from various Israeli sources including to reers saying that uh this proposal is going to allow Israel to achieve its War objectives which usually means in an Israeli News speak destroying Hamas and I think now we see uh sort of a response from the other side from the Palestinian from Hamas side basically dilating uh how it sees uh this proposal moving forward and how it could be implemented in a way that safeguards Palestinian rights in Gaza and I think uh so far we haven't seen the full response yet but I think what is important is uh for Hamas apparently are two things uh one that this proposal needs to move from one phase to another phase and in the process there would be a ceasefire and that this proposal does lead to a permanent ceasefire so this is a clear red line for Hamas that it's not going to negotiate over release of captives in order for Israel to resume the War I think it's probably going to ask for uh Ironclad American guarantees for that movement from one phase to another and second uh the way I see it from uh the initial response is that not only does Hamas wants to see Israel withdraw uh from the occupied Gaza Strip but it wants to make sure that Israel is not at The Crossings again as you know the past uh couple of weeks Israel has occupied uh the Philadelphia Corridor to the uh opposition of both Egypt and the Palestinian Authority because Israel is not supposed to be there there's an agreement in fact between Israel and Egypt on that issue that this would be a Palestinian Egyptian border even if there's an oversight by Israel on it so I think in order to first uh make sure that Israel withdraws from The Crossings and two that Israel is in is unable to impose another Siege on Gaza if you remember these were one of the red lines by uh the United States eventually but they were adoped by the G7 uh foreign ministers meeting in Japan when they said among others that Israel cannot maintain a security Zone but it also cannot impose another Siege on Gaza once a ceasefire is reached and uh the road or the pathway towards negotiations over a final settlement is on way so these two two issues that ensure uh gaza's safety and its freedom from another Israeli Siege are clearly on the books for Hamas in order to uh save face at least in the uh in in the aftermath if you will overseas fire Mar Bash
