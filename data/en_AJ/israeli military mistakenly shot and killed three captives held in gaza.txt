the Israeli military says it's mistakenly shot and killed three captives during its Gaza offensive they were targeted after troops wrongly identified them as a threat Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the military will draw lessons from the incident the White House has called it a tragic [Music] mistake well relatives of the captives and their supporters have been protesting in Tel Aviv they demonstrated at the Israeli defense Ministry demanding the government do more to free the remaining captives and calling on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign he is responsible for everything that is happening that happened and and is still happening he has blood a lot of blood on his hands and he should resign now and let people that are responsible and care and care for this country unlike him to take over and and get this war over with and get of all the kidnapped people back home now deal should have been made much much earlier and all those lives of of all the innocent people could have been spared I think it's a big tragedy what's happening here now let's bring in our correspondent Alan fiser he's joining us live from occupied East Jerusalem and Allan families of captives and their supporters planning to keep up the pressure on the government with more protests on Saturday well you saw the reaction from people and that was a spontaneous response almost every single one of them could put their theirself in the places of the family of the three who had been killed thinking that their loved ones were so close to being rescued to being taken out of Gaza and then they were killed by their own side now the Israeli Army say that it's unclear how the three ended up being separated how they were there how they had been held in in Gaza whether or not they had escaped or they had been abandoned by the people who were holding them but as they made their way towards Israeli forces the Israeli forces were concerned because they' come under attack from a number of Hamas Fighters they said that some of them had even been wearing suicide belts and so that is why they took the action that they took Benjamin Netanyahu has called it a tragedy and heartbreaking he said lessons will be learned but the families are saying this is just another example of why there should be a definite plan to try and get more of the captives out of Gaza and in fact at 12:00 local time here which is what in in two and a half hours in Tel Aviv they will be holding a special uh news conference essentially because of what has happened because as I say almost every single one of them can put themselves in the place of the family who were hoping for good news and then ended up hearing the worst possible news from the Israelis who had actually been responsible for their death as well and amid this development Alan there are reports that the head of the Israeli intelligence agency is due to restart negotiations to release more captives well this seems like a big U-turn from Benjamin Netanyahu and perhaps it is the the possibility that these demonstrations on the streets are getting to him that he understands the depth of anger the families have complained that they are being ignored and every time they speak it's clearly picked up by the Israeli military but the war cabinet had decided earlier this week that they weren't going to restart talks they weren't going to send the head of mosad to Qatar Benjamin Netanyahu is one of the two who was dead set against that their idea was that if they continue to put military pressure on Hamas it would improve their negotiating position clearly the events of the last 24 hours has changed the calculus on that and now Benjamin Netanyahu as I say has u-turned and decided that the head of mosad should go to Qatar now that's expected to happen in the next 24 hours he will arrive in Doha he will speak to the Qatari prime minister and discuss the possibility of restarting negotiations to perhaps be a ceasefire which would lead to the exchange of prisoners which of course we saw during the last time there was a ceasefire but it's clear that the pressure that has been put on by the families in the streets of Tel Aviv and through the media in Israel is actually getting to Benjamin Netanyahu there's a possibility of course that these events could be unrelated but it's a heck of a coincidence that after this spontaneous protest and the death of of three at the hands of the Israelis that Benjamin Netanyahu would do this quite dramatic uturn Alam thank you very much for that that's our correspondent Alan fiser live in occupied East Jerusalem
