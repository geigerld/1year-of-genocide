all this comes as Kata confirms this morning that Hamas and Israel have agreed on a humanitarian pause in Gaza after weeks of negotiations mediated alongside us and Egypt the Israeli government approved the deal after a lengthy cabinet meeting and deep internal divisions amongst ministers for prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says agreement does not mean that the war will stop now as part of the deal 50 women and children captives held in G will be released in exchange for some Palestinian women and children who will be freed from Israeli prisons the humanitarian pors will also allow the entry of a large number of Aid convoys including fuel for humanitarian needs well we have correspondents across the region covering the story Osama bin Javed is standing by in Doha on the Diplomatic efforts Sarah hirat is in occupied East Jerusalem on the political divisions in Israel and we have John Hendrick in Washington with us reaction let's first cross to Tarak Abu AUM who is in Gaza T so I want to start with the strikes that have continued not just overnight but in the last few hours yes uh the Israeli strikes had intensified during the last couple of hours across the Gaza Strip including the North and even the South the southern areas of the besieged uh territory from the uh south of the Gaza Strip in particular in a noat refugee camp where a residential building has been completely destroyed by the occupation forces claiming the lives of around nine Palestinian till this very moment as the occupa as the occupation forces had also targeted several areas across the territory including in the north of the Gaza Strip where the vicinity of Kamal adwan Hospital in the north of Gaza Strip had been widely attacked by the Israeli uh forces uh the also confrontations on the ground between Palestinian Fighters and the Israeli occupation forces continued in different aess where the air strikes had been intensified targeting an ambulance vehicle while it was evacuating victims from the north of the territory where also a civil defense crew had been attacked throughout an Israeli Shilling uh during the last couple of hours these air strikes came as the as both parts we talking about Hamas and the Israeli side had reach a a ceasefire agreement as they have clearly announced earlier which also gives us a clear indication that the rates of the Israeli strikes today might intensify before the arrival of this agreement to be healed between both sides and T what reaction has there been on the ground to this temporary ceasefire presumably humanitarian relief can't come soon enough yes uh after the announcement by different officials belong to Hamas political Buu and with the statement of of the of the cat for Ministry related to the arrival to heal short-term ceasefire between Hamas and the Israeli occupation uh that will be conducted and carried out over 4 days in which uh the uh Palestinian fighters from the Gaza Strip will will release 50 hostages from the Israeli captives including young children and women and in return Israel will release a number of uh Palestinian detes in the uh uh occupation jails including young children and women over four days this shortterm uh ceasefire gives a hope for Palestinians related to the end of this war as Israel also will allow to the flow of humanitarian Aid and fuel to uh the Gaza Strip meanwhile people here in the territory were witnessing very dire situation and circumstances over the last couple of uh weeks of fighting between Israel and Hamas and in fact a kind of ceasefire will give a glim a glimmer of hope for Palestinians that uh this war will end as they want to go back again to the houses in order to check the lands and even to uh uh pull the uh victims from under the rles across the Gaza STP okay tar Abu AUM there for us in Khan yunes let's speak now to Osama bin jav he is in Doha uh Osama cat are of course critical in bringing about this deal uh what are the details that you are hearing about the contents of this deal well it is the biggest diplomatic development that we've seen in the last 47 days of this Relentless bombardment that we've seen on Gaza you've heard from Hamas spider saying that they are going to abide by this agreement as long as there is going to be a a mutual uh respect of this agreement they're saying that they've heard the statement uh from Benjamin Netanyahu saying this does not mean that the war is going to end and they are going to have their uh fingers on the trigger so to speak as well uh if there are any violations but in these 4 day truths uh guns are supposed to fall silent there should be no more arrests people should be allowed to move from the northern part of Gaza towards the South uh to using salahadin Street uh freely uh It also says that there are going to be 50 captives that they are going to release in exchange for 150 women and children and Hamas has made it clear that this is uh civilian captives that they are talking about releasing it does not include any soldiers and also the the people who are going to be released by Israel are going to be women and children worth noting that there are thousands and thousands of Palestinians who remain languishing in Israeli jails and there more who've been picked up in the last 47 days as well so this deal will also include a session of monitoring using drones and other uh aerial vehicles that Israel deploys in Gaza it will mean according to Hamas that there will be no more uh spying uh or satellite observing uh in in the southern part and there's going to be a cation for a few hours at least in the Northern parts of Gaza as well and then obviously there is going to be no arrests and and fighting as well but again this has all come from Hamas so far we've not heard a lot of details from the Israeli side and it's let's it's going to be uh 24 hours before this uh prisoner exchange takes place that they're going to announce the names and the Israeli site is going to announce the names of the people it's going to release as well and uh Osama talk us through some of the diplomacy that's been involved in making this deal happen I mean it's not something that's come about overnight it's taken weeks and weeks of intense negotiating absolutely it's been a roller coaster as one Diplomat put it to us uh of coming close to a deal and going away from it and it has to be said that qat has been pivotal in trying to make sure that this deal happens what is what the k side has been saying that yes it welcomes uh the development of uh this president exchange and a cessation of hostilities but what is more significant is the allowing in of Aid uh that hundreds of trucks of Aid are going to be allowed through as it's been sending and other countries have been sending Aid towards the Rafa Crossing in Egypt and that is where all the aid is going to come from as well uh so a major diplomatic breakthrough Qatar has also thanked the United States for exerting its influence on Israel and the Egyptians to for being part of this deal but again uh early days we're still waiting to hear the the basics and as it's going to come into action it is going to announced the timings of that particular truth AMA Ben ja there for us in Doha let's speak now to Sarah kyat who is in occupied East Jerusalem so the it in intense negotiation overnight uh we didn't hear from the cabinet Israeli cabinet till the early morning there was some opposition talk us through how the vote finally came through yeah it started uh later on in the night and it took more than six hours not just for the vote but debating uh because you had many members of those cabinets of the cabinet uh that was against this deal right from the start you had uh the uh national security minister itamar benav as well as the finance uh Minister B at smotrich who have been dead against it they said that all of this time they've been warning uh uh Israel against any kind of not just negotiations but before this clamping down on uh Palestinians and uh they said that this uh could allow uh more prisoners to be release prisoners they said that should uh actually be receiving the death penalty because that is what uh itar Ben gav has been pushing for in the last uh few months so a lot of political wrangling but interestingly uh smotrich the fin Minister he changed his mind his party changed their mind initially they went in saying absolutely this will not go through we will vote against it and then they voted for it saying that they realized having debated it that it was in the National interest for Israel and to ensure uh the return of those held hostage which is not just uh the only goal the war isn't just the only goal against Hamas but also those captives in the last uh couple of hours we've also been hearing from uh the Justice minister minist rather which has released a list of prisoners uh the name of those that will be released 300 interestingly because 150 we know will be released in exchange for those 50 captives but this could elude the reason why they're releasing these names uh being 300 so double is that if Hamas releases 10 more captives They will receive an extension uh in terms of PA of fighting more than those four days and as well the release of more prisoners so in a way this is a a push from Israel to encourage Hamas to do so very interesting Sara and you mentioned the families of those captives of course this news must bring some relief uh has there been much reaction from them huge relief in in some ways only in the perspective that they feel that their pressure on the government potentially has helped uh towards these negotiations they said that they've been left out of the dark but their marches and their protest and being very vocal about it also on Israeli media they think may have had something to do with this but there's real worry because Hamas will only be releasing the names of those that will be released the day before so uh the families will be waiting to find out if their uh members are being released and of course that's a big big concern the other concern for them is that some of those being held are not just by Hamas but also Islamic Jihad and in in a few weeks ago some of them had said said that they didn't know where all those those that are held captive were so again uh this is going to be a very nerve-wracking time for the families as some of them I'm sure will find out that th their loved ones won't be released just yet thank you for that Sarah kyat there for us an occupied East Jerusalem we can turn now to John hendren to get the view from the United States John so I wonder how significant you think it is that we did get a statement from the United States from President Biden but that only came after the qataris had released a statement that's right the US uh Administration official actually spoke to reporters before that announcement was made by Qatar but it was embargoed for reporting we weren't allowed to say anything about it until the Qatari announcement was made and that's because the US was grateful for qatar's role that is Qatar can do something that the us simply can't do and that is talk directly to Hamas and that's what they needed to happen and uh the Biden Administration is grateful that something has happened that there has been some progress on this not just because there are three Americans among those uh 50 plus to be released one of them is a three-year-old named Abigail whose birthday is on Friday but the Biden Administration really uh wants something to happen on this because Biden's popularity is really tanked in polls across the us there was widespread support for Israel initially after the October 7th attacks but that has waned and most of the protests you've seen across the US are pro Palestinian lately there are on both sides but there are some huge Pro Palestinian protests and polls have shown that Biden has really taken a hit that he's actually gone from being ahead of his presumed rival Donald Trump the Republican in the 2024 presidential election to being behind him not that that has necessarily driven it but we've seen statements across the Biden Administration praising this move they're clearly grateful okay thank you for that John hendin there for us in Washington DC
