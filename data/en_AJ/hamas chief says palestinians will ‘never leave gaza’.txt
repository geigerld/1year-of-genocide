we are going to cross live now to a senior leader of Hamas who is speaking now the lands and territories of Gaza and all over the Palestinian ter territories they have written the history OFA flood they have put the right beginning to eliminate the occupation we need no more occupation to our land s and our this resistance in every single hour in every single moment they go and they hit everywhere in the heart of this Zionist criminal regime the Zionist regime didn't manage despite the Army and the weapons to face our brave men so the zist regime is now committing this genocide burned land and the attempts to relocate our people in Gaza and the zist regime thinks that these crimes these brutal crimes B Bar crimes committed by this regime will eliminate the disgrace of being defeated and of being broken with the start of the Strategic Kasam attack on the 7th of October but no way this attack will never eliminate all the tools of Oppression and killing and the political consequences security consequences media consequences but I can say that this Alam attack has put end to this policy and to these Zionist plans of this fascist government in Israel against our prisoners against our people in Gaza West Bank against the Palestinian people everywhere we will sort and resume the strategy of Freedom with the help of Allah Almighty our enemy today is doing what is doing with the support and I feel sorry to say with the support of the American Administration and some European countries because they have this double uh understanding and double vision they are now going back by the way but they still think that what is being done by the zus regime the psychologic I War and the spreading papers and and this here and there to our people that our people will relocate will immigrate will be displaced but no way it's a dream the people of Gaza are adhering to the lands adhering to the Nations they will never leave Gaza they will never immigrate whatsoever done by you The Killers the criminals we have only one line to return back to our territories to our houses to the land of our grand parents it is not far away it's within hands this attack the Strategic attack Byam against you says that the freedom and our return is very close with the help of Almighty that's why I a big salute to our people in Gaza a big salute to those with their blood with the fire are facing the killing machine the B baric Machine the fascist machine of the Zionist regime they are adhering and they are committed to their houses to their mosks to their land marches everywhere yesterday under the threat of the war planes to salute the resistance to salute Alan brigades and to stress that we are here we will stay here in our nation as long as life is there this is the stand and this is the situation that should be mentioned in the in the honor list of of the Palestinian people today Gaza is facing the fire but still Gaza is saying it's historic word Gaza is placing the right place of the Palestinians in their lands and the Dignity of the Palestinians no immigration from Gaza no relocation from the West Bank no immigration from Gaza to Egypt and here I need to appraise the stand of our brothers in Egypt who are confirming that Egypt is a sisterly country and is a supporting country Egypt welcomes the Sons and Daughters of the Palestinian people but under no name such as immigration or relocation I'm telling my brothers in Egypt our decision is to stay in our land that's why your decision is our decision and we will face the Zionist plans supported by the US Administration it will be a big failure our stanfest and our unified stand and our solidarity the Arab solidarity the Islamic solidarity the world solidarity from the free people all over the four corners of the world they talk about the civilians they shed tears about the elderly and the kids and the women and they are trying by all means to not to say the right word about what's going on we belong to our religion we belong to our ethics and Hamas has always been Keen not to Target the civili not to Target the civilians despite everything done by the Zionist regime

where are you when our children are being killed massacres are being committed in our lands the destruction of all houses and homes what do you think of the destruction and demolition of the mosqu and the buildings and the infrastructure what is your stand and what is your position when you see the Israelis killing not now before different Nationals from different countries Palestinians and other
