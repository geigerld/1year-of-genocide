people the Israeli security cabinets been meeting in the last few hours and reports are that Israel is waiting to see what kind of retaliation is going to be whether there's going to be a few hundred Rockets fired by Islamic Jihad or a far bigger response from Hamas group that controls Gaza let's listen to close the circle with the terrorists we we are is the end of a military campaign a week a week ago when we took when we took the decision to start the operations shielded we're ready to to edit scenario our principally shopping clear whoever helps us will help him and with excessive thoughts we are fighting together I want to to embrace I want to embrace the population of South Israel the Army and the security services according I want to I want to thank to to to the to the

win thank you very much Hana neighbors has fired against the Israeli citizens a week ago but it's it's against our presence in our County we we were we were ready to stop to stop the criminal activities of Islamic Jihad they prepared plenty of Terror attacks on the West Bank was responsible for the murder of the Virtual Families after attacking us 19 years ago they killed a pregnant a pregnant woman and her children in our Direction services are fighting against them and and we reach and we reach everything which we wanted in our operation [Music] who who will try uh will try us he will see us we are going we are going against anyone who wants to help us this is what we'll do also in the future the heavy price it's what answers that Israel if the terrorist activities of his help in in preparing this operation and doing it I say to Israeli Army to the security services and to the fighters of their activity which is very important in this operation to the chief of general staff we are embracing the Israeli Army the operation which we've done last night is going to multiply to multiply also in other areas who who will try to to help us we will find we will find our excessive faults against them in the fight against terrible organizations we are using our strategy we are our national strategy all our operations foreign and production plants for all the information which is we prepare this operation against Islamic Jihad and we have waited we have waited at the time and place of our choosing and will do everything to have our security we have we have we have struck the the tailored points killing people which are not involved in the terror organizations they want but but they they want to kill innocent people on our part I'm calling to the Israeli citizens in South Israel to listen to things offensive against the terror and you're watching Al Jazeera we've been bringing you a live press conference uh from Tel Aviv which has been hosted initially by Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister of Galan but we've just heard from a senior uh Israeli Defense Forces uh official there senior officer um describing the operation that has been carried out over the last few hours in Gaza with the airstrikes that uh identifying some of the targets that they were aiming for one of which was he said a workshop for manufacturing Rockets prior to that we heard the defense minister yov Gallant talking about the the broader strategy that um uh the Israeli forces are taking at the moment he said in the fight against Terror organizations we are using our national strategy he said the ministry of defense is ready for any scenario and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu all right at the start said that he wanted to embrace the population of South Israel many of which many of whom have been moved from their homes to near the border with Gaza in the uh the anticipation that there may well be some sort of response from Gaza he also said that he wanted to embrace uh the Army as well I want to bring in our correspondent Muhammad Jam who's also been listening to that Muhammad it's quite clear that um Israel is bracing itself for some sort of response to come out of Gaza it's absolutely right Rob uh key takeaway here is that um Israeli Prime Minister benjam Netanyahu was essentially saying that Israel is prepared for any response the Prime Minister said that uh Israeli citizens must have the fortitude now to essentially try and cope with any counter attacks that might be happening in the days ahead he also said that if any enemies of Israel were thinking of planning any attacks or carrying out any attacks that they would be met with crushing Force he also said that the difference between the Palestinians and Israelis on a day like today is that when it comes to Palestinian factions they would actually Target Israeli civilians whereas when it comes to the Israeli military according to prime minister Netanyahu they try to Target only what they claim to be are terrorists essentially this is a response to criticism that in those air strikes that were carried out early this morning there were civilians that were killed alongside those leaders of Islamic Jihad the prime minister's remarks were relatively brief really not in any way unexpected it's basically what people here thought that they would hear from him then you had the Israeli defense minister joov Gallant who appraised the military uh went on to talk about how Islamic Jihad had been responsible for planning attacks that have been carried out in the last few weeks and also he said that they had Intel uh that the Israeli forces had Intel that uh Islamic Jihad was working on other attacks that they were planning to carry out in the days ahead and that it was an imminent threat and that's why Israel acted in the way that it did with those with those air strikes aside from that also he just went on to say that the Israeli forces had acted with determination and that they would continue to act against anyone who planned to threaten the safety of Israel or Israeli citizens none of this really coming as a surprise but but as you said Rob the fact of the matter is Israeli officials are anticipating that there will be a response from within Gaza whether it's in the hours ahead or the days ahead the big question right now is who exactly is going to be involved in that response and how much more of an escalation might it amount to because from the Israeli standpoint um if it's only Islamic Jihad that is responding to those air strikes then you're talking about potentially hundreds of rockets being launched from Gaza toward Israel if Hamas gets involved then you're talking about potentially thousands of rockets that could be launched from Gaza toward Israel so that's the calculation that Israel is making right now and throughout the day you've had senior Israeli officials being quoted anonymously in Israeli media Outlets essentially saying what happens next is going to be dependent upon Hamas they're basically issuing a warning and saying they don't want Hamas to get involved that if Hamas gets involved there will be more of a response from Israel right now it's very unclear as to what exactly is going to happen certainly a big Escalade Nation today this is something these airstrikes had happened in the overnight hours in Gaza that was not anticipated here I can tell you people were taken very much by surprise but when we've heard from Israeli officials throughout the day it's clear that they planned it prime minister Netanyahu even said a few hours ago that he had given the order last week to carry out these targeted assassinations against the leadership of Islamic Jihad and Gaza so right now what's going to happen next nobody knows people very much on edge and they're just waiting to see what the answer is going to be and then what Israel will do in return in West Jerusalem Muhammad thank you very much indeed
