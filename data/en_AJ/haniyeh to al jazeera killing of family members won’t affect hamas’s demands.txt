we begin with breaking news out of Northern Gaza that's where an Israeli strike has killed three sons and three grandchildren of hamas's political leader several members of is hania's family were traveling in the alhat refugee camp when their vehicle was hit and speaking to Al jazer hania said the killings would only Harden hamas's resolve he also said the attack would not affect the group's demands in ceasefire negotiations they believe that if they kill or assassinate leaders or their next of kin that we will abandon our people that we will abandon our resistance they are mistaken this Noble blood that is spilled including my own children will harden our resolve make us more defiant more adamant to continue to march on this road the road of struggle and resistance until we win our freedom and the lawful rights of the Palestinian peoples are restored well we have three correspondents covering the latest developments on this story in a moment we'll speak to our White House Cor responding kimy hit for what we're hearing out of the US Rory Chalin is standing by and occupied East Jerusalem with reaction from Israel but first we bring in hanni Mahmud who's joining us from Southern Gaza with the very latest on this developing uh story hany so what more we what more do we know about this attack yes well not only the attacks on the sons and the grandsons of SM that's the political bureau chief of Hamas in Gaza we're seeing also a surge within the past 45 minutes we received six reports of six more air strikes in the Central Area mainly in the western part of the Central Area including a refugee camp that's blocked to to the west of the Central Area uh waza area that's the area that has been designated as a safe Zone in which all displ uh families and Palestinians in the southern part of the strip were literally told to take that part uh of the strip and to the to further southern part of the strip as a safe zone for them also in uh the northern part in Gaza City but the the fact that we seen an attack on on the uh the sons and the grandsons of a political leader here is is largely viewed and believed by so many as a as a way to dictate the talks or the course of the ceasefire talks uh in Cairo it is also as a statement made uh made by uh one of Hamas political leaders it's it looks like more of a Revenge Kelling and because Israel milit Israeli military did not make a progress on the ground it resorted into a Revenge killing by attacking the children of Hamas leaders in the in the Gaza Strip okay hany thank you so much for that update from RAF in Gaza we'll cross over to occupi e Jerusalem speak to Rory chalen so Rory any reaction from Israel about this killing there is but not official reaction certainly nothing from the government or from the military itself the only thing we do have at the moment is a video that has been released by a member of the knesset called Al Mo Cohen now he is a member of Ben gav's far right UT my yehudit party and in this video he says that he was uh on the way to visit the family uh The Grieving family of a soldier when he received good news as he put it uh and then he finishes his video by saying isma Kia ID Mubarak you are next in line now we should not mistake this for being the official government line as I've just said but who knows what Israeli government members are saying to each other behind closed doors at the moment yeah and I mean one will have to kind of wait and see I suppose on if and whether this will impact the ongoing ceasefire negotiations well Hamas has already said that it will not change their demands but the timing of this is extraordinary isn't it I mean for one thing this was in the beginning of Eid which is a a time of Muslim celebration and joy should be uh also it comes when this negotiation which would see some sort of Peace restored to Gaza perhaps only temporarily it would also see perhaps uh exchanges of of prisoners and captives Etc all of that is hanging uh in the balance at the moment so yes there are more questions than answers uh right now but we have to say to ourselves well who took this decision uh did they know who they were going after this kind of strike is usually done on uh signals intelligence which means that they monitor uh phone numbers cell phone numbers uh and they can plot those uh by the triangulation of a normal sort of cell network so they know who they're going after and where they are that's how they do the strikes but the bigger question is if they have all that information and they know who they're going after who makes the all is this just a military decision or does a strike of this significance have to have high level political sign off now whoever took the decision must have known that this would perhaps jeopardize the ceasefire negotiations and I think there are many people both within the military and in the government who wouldn't shed any tears over that okay thank you Rory thanks for that update from occupied East Jerusalem and now to our White House correspondent Kimberly hit joining us from Washington DC so have we heard anything from the white house yet on this Kimberly and and how does this attack on hania's family members look considering Biden's comments that Netanyahu is making a mistake in Gaza very recent comments well this is only going to make the already tense relationship between the Israeli Prime Minister and the US President Joe Biden uh which has been fraught with uh disagreements and differences uh become that much more difficult given the fact that the US president has in the last 24 hours sharpened his criticism of the Israeli Prime Minister uh this is not going to be welcome news to the US president the US president in the last 24 hours as you point out called the actions of the Israeli Prime Minister and the way he has conducted his war on Gaza a mistake he has called for an immediate ceasefire given the fact that there are an excess of 33,000 Palestinians that have been killed there is near famine and uh humanitarian catastrophe that exists in Gaza he is calling for the fact that there needs to be an increase in the amount of humanitarian Aid and that's what he is looking for a duration of at least eight weeks uh but he has also said that what he believes is that Netanyahu is doing this for his political survival and as a result he says he does not agree with the approach so uh we are watching very carefully here at the White House given the fact fact that this is a state visit that is being conducted here at the White House today with the Japanese prime minister kashida there is a joint press conference that is set to begin in about 20 minutes or so if it's on time which is unlikely that usually isn't the case but this is likely to be one of the top questions from reporters given the fact that there will be likely a desire to see reaction uh on the deaths of the grandchildren and Sons of of the Hamas political leader so this is certainly going to complicate the relationship between the US president and the Israeli Prim Minister yeah and kimly we'll be watching very closely to see whether this affects the negotiations process at all which of course the US has a major role to play in yeah it's it's taken the lead uh with of course the Egypt its partner and uh this is probably going to complicate that as well given the fact we were told uh just on Tuesday by the National Security advisor Jake Sullivan that the latest in that process was that they were awaiting they being the United States a response from Hamas but uh given now the developments of the deaths of the sons and grandchildren six in total of the Hamas political leader that response may not now be forthcoming and that is certainly going to put a wrench in the wheel of the or the gears of this process given the fact that uh there was it looked like progress in trying to get the release of captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and in Israeli jails and so uh the hopefulness that there might be some sort of breakthrough in this process uh may now come to to a grinding Halt and that is going to be discouraging for the white house uh that was really hopeful that they finally had uh achieved some sort of breakthrough between Hamas and the Israelis okay thank you Kimberly H thanks so much for that reporting from the White House we can now speak to n who's a political analyst and the columnist she's joining us from rala in the occupied West Bank n welcome um to Al jazer so I was just discussing with Kimberly that uh Biden was recently saying that Netanyahu is making a mistake in Gaza but with this killing now in Gaza the Israeli Prime Minister seems to be doubling down on that with uh with the Hamas political leaders family being killed absolutely it seems that Netanyahu is and his Coalition are intent on further H escalation uh we have to also remember that assassinating or going after the families of prominent Palestinian leaders from all factions is not a novel it's not an anomaly this is consistent with Israeli actions over decades and we've SE that we've seen that happen over and over again but as you've been discussing in the bulletin the timing of this uh assassination the fact that it was a Precision attack that most likely uh you know who was in the car is pretty much known to whoever gave the okay to pull the trigger uh one has to wonder if Tel Aviv really wants a positive response um from K in Cairo about a possible ceasefire and an exchange of captives because of course you know SM hania's reaction is expected this would not change the resolve of Hamas it would not change how negotiations are uh conducted but even in terms of perception uh people uh are going to see this as Israel poking Hamas in the eye and they will want to see how Hamas is going to respond what do you think the message is that Israel was trying to respond uh to uh convey excuse me with this attack I think Israel has been very consistent and the the ones who don't really want to hear what the Israeli message is are its closest allies from the beginning of this genocidal war is the Israeli cabinet members have been very clear they want they said and they promised they will decimate Gaza they will kill kill uh everybody they will want to expel as many Palestinians as possible and they're going to go all the way and that includes ra and I believe this escalation coupled with the fact that just less than 24 hours ago we heard from Netanyahu himself saying that a date has been picked uh for the invasion of Rafa it just means that Israel is you know making good on its promise given the fact that we hear a lot about you know Washington being upset and angry and in disagreement but we don't really see any action towards all of these incorrect Israeli policy decisions except statements and meanwhile weapons continue to flow in political protection continues uh um you know and is unshakable and and countries like Germany is willing to go to to the international court of justice to defend its complicity in this war rather than you know change course and change policy so we'll have to see how how this plays out you you said a moment ago that the hamas's response was expected when hania said that the he he said this the killing of my sons will not affect Hamas um ceasefire demands um I mean do you think though that this kind of throws a wrench into the works when it comes to this negotiating Pro negotiation process that's uh that's currently underway well look you know more than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since the beginning of this war up to 20,000 are buried under the rubble uh the children and grandchildren of the leader of Hamas cannot and would not be placed at a higher value than those uh Souls who were lost uh including more than 14,000 children but the Optics of it and the political messaging of this assassination um is significant and and that's why I don't think that we can count it down or or discard it in terms of how Hamas will read these messages and and and I think it speaks a lot because what we've been hearing even while these negotiations are happening even while you know Washington sent in its big guns to play a heavy role in the negotiations is Israel and the US for that matter saying okay we'll negotiate a deal there will be a six to8 week ceasefire there will in exchange of captives but then Israel will go back right to the killing to the destruction to the displacement and to finishing of Hamas which I think everybody all saying experts agree is not an achievable goal uh so the Dynamics and the expectation that something positive can come out of somebody telling you let's talk now but then once we're done once once the deal is done I'm going to come back at you and I'm I'm coming back to kill you off without a change or break in that Dynamic on top of this assassination I think it makes it less and less likely that we're going to say see a breakthrough in the coming hours all right n thank you so much for speaking to us from Ral make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the
