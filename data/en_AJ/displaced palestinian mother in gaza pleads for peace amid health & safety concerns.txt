skin infections are spreading at a crazy rate amongst children in the tents and amongst displaced people I was displaced from K yunes and now after the military operation concluded there I'm going to go back thank God I am happy that I vaccinated my children against polio so that they don't suffer from anything in the future hopefully all the children Gaza get vaccinated not only against polio but with other vaccinations as well my baby was born almost 3 kilos or a little bit less she was weak because there wasn't any nutrition for me as the mother now I'm breastfeeding and there still isn't enough nutrition because everything is expensive I was scared to give birth during the war and thought it's impossible but I gave birth and here she is living through the war as well when I gave birth I was worried if I will be able to vaccinate her and where I got worried in the beginning if this vaccination was harmful or not but I gathered the courage when I heard that those children could get polio so I said no it's better to take it than for them to suffer complications in the future we really don't want only vaccines we want them to stop the war let them stop the war every time I get this place this is our biggest worry especially for those who have children when I flee and move I would be so worried it is better for me to die than to keep moving from one area to another I have been displaced seven times I hope we can stay in our homes without having to move around make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaaz
