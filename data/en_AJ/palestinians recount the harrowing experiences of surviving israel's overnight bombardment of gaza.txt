hear from some Palestinians who survived those strikes to see another day a warning though some of the images you're about to see could be distressing we were in the tent me and all my family when the bullets all came at us my father went to see what's happening and said there were strikes and a strike happened while he was talking we all fled my father was mared we were at home with the air strikes were ongoing I told my mother that I wanted to use the bathroom as she was awake suddenly all the walls of the bathroom and all the containers above it collapsed on me he was born one month and a half ago and today he went back to God his father is in intensive care at the European hospital and his mother is wounded in her leg and hands terror terror so much Terror something you've never seen not in Hollywood or in the US not in Libya not in Syria did something like this happen only in Rafa they kept saying go to Rafa go to Rafa and people came here then you target them well let's get the latest now from our correspondent on the ground TK abaz he joins me from Rafa T tell us what you're seeing and hearing there what's the situation like right now well the situation uh was completely critical to night as the overnight as the Israeli military army had started a clear attack on Rafa District in the far south of the Gaza Strip now everyone knows that Rafa district is the last remaining area where more than 1.9 million Palestinians have been taking refuge in and the attack had been very organized as the Israeli forces had used excessive fire power as it seems to be a kind of a release of hostages operation by the Israeli special forces inside the heart beating areas of Rafa District where they managed to release two uh Israeli captives under under heavy Israeli bombardment of residential houses killing at least 60 uh Palestinians uh within the past 24 hours in Rafa District only and this is uh this attack had contributed to to cause a sheer damage in the majority of Rafa areas including the Eastern the Central and the western part of the uh district and people were absolutely terrified panicked they know where to go as we have been seeing a lot of families are running in in the middle of the streets looking for a place to be away from the Israeli bombardment and this is was beyond comprehension no no one was able to realize what is happening on the ground because there was an excessive use of Firepower and the sound of the Israeli fighter jets and surveillance of drones was completely overheard in the region uh with a very high uh low explosions that Shaking All residential buildings in RAF District we have been seeing today also more people are wondering about if that will be repeated tonight kind of more military attacks as some families started to search for another place in order to uh seek refuge and and to be away from the Israeli unrelenting bombardment that has been fold unfolding uh Rafa District within the past few hours and T we know as we've been reporting that 1.4 million people are there because Rafa was supposed to be safe according to the Israeli military this is really only the beginning well Palestinians after what they have so have seen yesterday they they have been completely concerned and worried about the the potential military grounds in cin and they uh completely believe that it might be the beginning of a WID scale attack that might be carried out in Rafa in order to militarily eliminate the military infrastructure for the armed groups here and also for forcing people to flee more to another area just that to help the Israeli Army to have a full military Mobility on the ground and this is absolutely something terrifying specifically that people do not know where to go they have no homes they have no hope in terms of being safe again especially that today a lot of children being wounded elderly people and women also being killed due to that WID scale attack that had been carried up people Palestinians he being displaced multiple times from the houses after following the Israeli military orders to get away from areas of operations but right now the entire territory had been cramed into Raa District the population more than half of gaza's population are being here and right now they have no any other options uh to have specifically that the Israeli Army did not provide much details or a timeline for the potential military incursion that might take place at any moment and they are afraid to have the same scenario that happened yesterday of course T abom they on the ground forest in Rafa in southern Gaza thank you T and please stay safe
