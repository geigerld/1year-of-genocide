BVI is in am man and Jordan because the Israeli government has banned aljazera from reporting from Israel saying there are due to be sisire talks later this week but uh we understand the national security minister has actually said Israel's participation in those is a serious mistake so where does that leave these talks well that's exactly right Israel has committed to sending a delegation once more to either Doha or Cairo in the next few days we're expecting talks to begin once again on the 15th but this comes at a time when Israel is being condemned by almost everyone they'll be sitting with at these talks and they know that the actions they've taken with the strike that resulted in this massacre on Saturday and in the last 24 hours they have themselves the Israeli forces have said they've continueed to carry on a number of operations across Gaza will only Harden the position of Hamas make it almost diff almost impossible for Hamas to acques to any of Israel's demands in the current climate now in terms of what these talks are likely to mean is Israel really sincere about negotiating some kind of ceasefire about a settlement that could see Israeli captives brought back home we have to look only to the uh national security minister atar Ben gav's recent statements this morning on social media in which he said that yes this is a mistake and that Hamas must be crushed until they completely surrender in the statement he said that Hamas should continue to be crushed and stomped on its head until they completely surrender that this Summit must not be used as a way to stop the conflict in Gaza that the transfer of humanitarian Aid and fuel should be stopped until all abductees are returned home and he also said that we must encourage immigration and occupy Gaza uh permanently in order to keep our hold on it so these are very very hawkish statements coming out of the national security minister and will only serve to harden the position with which mediators and Hamas come to these talks so is it likely that they'll result in any sort of ceasefire or or a prisoner exchange between Israel and uh uh Hamas forces and the Palestinians in Gaza that seems very unlikely at this stage okay thanks so much Z that Z best Ravi for us in Aman Jordan because the Israeli government has banned El jazer from reporting in Israel we're going to go uh to uh honey mmud for uh who is in khun where they have been many people have been forced to move yet again can you just explain the ongoing impact of being displaced over and over again hany and where are people meant to go at this point in time Tom within the past 45 minutes we've seen many of the cars or many of the cards pulled by animals arriving to this area this is the last remaining uh somehow empty with with a little bit of a space available at Al maasi evacuation Zone and this is right at the Northern Western part of of at the edge of city and area between these two cities in the central area and here maasi evacuation but we seen more people definitely coming from the area that's the uh the uh third the block number by 36 that's Hamed's residential complex where it is located that has been targeted at earlier hours by the uh by air attacks destroying two residential Towers pushing people the residents of these towers into further internal displacement is really military at earlier hours overnight issued these sharp orders for people to evacuate from the area now this having this happening at this particular moment and this particular location just further increased shrinking the areas the humanitarian Zone that the Israeli military had described and designated uh for Palestinian displaced families for the past 10 months which by the way hasn't been safe at all it has been repeatedly attacked people died and killed and Meed inside these humanitarian Zone they were talking about a short SL of land at the western part of of the Central Area starting from Dar bah City passing through ran unit all the way to rafah City and now rafah is out of the equation of the humanitarian Zone the only area available right now is at the western part of Dar bah City and here in Khan unun but right now Hamed residential towers and its vicinity has been uh in the Red Zone in the red area and just further shrink the area the humanitarian uh zone for evacuation we're expecting to see this space to be filled up very soon and uh we're going to we're going to see it becoming overcrowded but the impact of this limited resources there is economic Suffocation there is family and social disintegration as people ended up finding a space at anywhere possible to stay in it also causes more of the psychologically trauma and feeds into one reality permanent displacement as some of these families have been displaced for the eighth time or the 10th time so far yeah honey the other thing I wanted to talk about was the school attack yesterday which has been described as one of the worst since the War Began can you just give us an idea of the scale of the devastation that's left behind perhaps the worst uh elements of of of the this attack has been the uh the the deepening of the the sense of shattered safety right now the people uh this place families inside evacuation zones and at the vicinity of all uh shelters in Gaza and the noart are not are not safe they are under uh repeated attacks all the time and so this one thing that has been made uh sure for people that they are not safe at all and their sense of their shattered sense of safety has been deepened further by these attacks what's really tragic that these evacuation zone are the only remaining space in Gaza and the northern part uh for people to go to who are struggling with the recurrent incursions in W part of Gaza City of the heavy bombardment campaign in the center part of Gaza and the western part uh of the city all leaving their residential homes because of the ongoing threats going to these shelters seeking not only safety but also of whatever left whatever available of Food Supplies as there is ongoing enforced starvation going on in the northern part of the strip none of the commercial and none of the humanitarian e truck here uh allowed to move into uh the uh the northern part and Gaza there is ongoing enforc starvation going on so people are seeking these evacuation Center because they are searching uh not only for safety and protection but also ability to have access to Food Supplies and and water supply which by the way it's already depleted and limited to the only number available uh at these evacuation uh centers but again the uh the tragedies keep unfolding of the number of casualties the death do is rising the the pressure that is put on the health facilities in Gaza is beyond imagination honey as always we really do appreciate uh your reporting there from Gaza honey mm for us and Khan Unice make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from
