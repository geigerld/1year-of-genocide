[Music] we're going to begin in Gaza where the UN says that Israel may have committed war crimes during its raid in alnus at refugee camp on Saturday the United Nations human rights office has questioned whether International humanitarian laws were observed when Israeli forces raided the camp in central Gaza on Saturday to free four captives 274 Palestinians were killed and more than 700 were injured the UN also says war crimes may have been committed by Palestinian armed groups and they include the Detention of captives in densely populated areas we're going to head to Central Gaza we're going to speak to talum outside the alaka hospital in De alala and the alaka hospital is where many of the victims of that attack are being taken talk to us about what's been happening well what we really hear from uh those victims and even from the injuries is absolutely devastating where're talking about at least 600 98 Palestinians being wed from the attack that was carried out by the Israeli Special Force in aarat refugee camp in order to release for Israeli captives now we've been talking to a number of uh injured people they have been describing the general atmosphere where they have been injured and the one of them has been saying that we were getting ready to eat as we suddenly heard loud explosions as we saw dozens of Israel helicopters firing and opening the fire against multiple areas in at refugee camp and later on we heard the sound of the Israeli tanks as we start hearing from people that there is a special force operating in anarat refugee camp later on the this special force has stormed this injured person house the has arrested his uh father and his Granda and at the same time one of the Israeli Special Forces soldiers have opened the fire against him where he has been shot in his chest and in his abdomen being now receiving treatment in AA hospital and this is one of the critical conditions that resulted from anarat Refugee attack that was carried out just two days ago now the groom reality is not only that this case but General cases what are right now in a very desperate need for advanced surgeries and they are unable to leave Gaza in order uh to get treatment due to the Israeli foreclosure of borders and the ongoing control over Philadelphia coridor and the Grim reality day by day is exasperating in light of the chronic short AG of basic medical suppliers as there are some injured people are unable to afford for them different kinds of medications that are essentially required in order to help them to recover as soon as possible but people are still afraid due to the collapse of the sense of safety across this trip and and areas uh and areas also that were designated by the Israeli military to be safe zones T thank you very much indeed that's T kabo was bringing us up to date from outside the alaka hospital in darala in Gaza well I'm joined now from Geneva by Jeremy Lawrence he's spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for human rights thank you very much indeed for being with us so the allegations are being made that war crimes may have been committed by Israeli forces during this particular raid but also by Palestinian Fighters as well can you describe to me how you gather evidence for allegations like that yes hi and thank you so we are obviously we have uh uh we're monitoring closely what's happening on the ground and we assess information that comes in now as your correspondent has said during the operation on the weekend hundreds of Palestinians many of them civilians uh were reportedly killed and uh injured uh our concern is it's the manner in uh uh the way in which this raid was conducted uh in such a densely populated area uh in in Middle Gaza this seriously calls into question whether the principles of Distinction precaution and proportionality which are bedrocks of uh the laws of War uh were respected by the Israeli forces in terms of the the allegations that are being made against Palestinian Fighters again how is it that you are able to assess the the situation and in order to be able to gather evidence to suggest that that uh war crimes may have been committed in that case Okay so the the same applies and when it C uh with respect to the Palestinian armed uh armed groups they are continuing to hold hostages Now The Taking of hostages under International humanitarian law is forbidden uh it's a it's a serious breach beyond that uh we have the holding of hostages in densely populated areas so you're not only putting the hostages themselves at risk but also Palestinians at risk uh both all these aspects that I've raised uh could be uh amount to war crimes so when you make the assessments that you've made for both sides what do you then do with that evidence and also what constitutes evidence that could be presented in a form that would allow a case to move forward well quite simply our office uh gathers information and we know what the laws are the international humanitarian laws are quite clear uh we then make sure that all sides parties abide by those abide by the by those laws which are set out under the Geneva conventions then we assemble the information uh we will call out if we see an issue uh with respect to adherence to these laws uh and then this information can be passed on to International tribunes uh the to a certain degree it comes down and please forgive me but I I don't understand how this system works but there is I get the sense that there is an element that that is open to interpretation that uh the UN will make an assessment based on this on the criteria that you have put forward but of course the Israelis and the Palestinians may come back and say no that is not how this worked actually on the ground this is simply a broad assessment of what of a broad picture uh that was seen um what um how confident can you be in the in the evidence that you're presenting uh that the case is actually representative of what you've been seeing on the ground okay so in the case of the weekend's operation as your correspondent said there were 270 people killed now four hostages were freed in the process we welcomed the the the fact that they've been freed they should never have been taken in the first place but what we saw was a mass uh destruction and a massive amount of uh killings uh so there's that aspect we all we simply do we will collect evidence and then pass it on to a relevant competent court if need be and they will take the decision based on the uh assessment that we have made Jeremy Lawrence it's very interesting to get your assessment of this and the benefit of your expertise in this thank you very much indeed for being being with us on Al thank you make sure to
