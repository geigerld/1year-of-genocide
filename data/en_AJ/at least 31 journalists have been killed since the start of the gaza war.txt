well the war on Gaza has taken a severe toll on journalists with the number of casualties only rising at least 31 journalists have been killed since October the 7th 29 of them were Palestinian four were Israeli and one of them Lebanese numerous journalists have been injured with nine reported missing or detained not only are journalists being targeted themselves but also their families alzer's own while alu's wife son daughter and Grandson were killed in Israeli strikes well let's speak to Sheriff Mansour about this he the Middle East and North Africa Program Coordinator at the committee to protect journalists he's joining us from Washington DC good to have you with us Sheriff Gaza was not a great place for journalists even before October the 7th and it's only gotten worse for them ever since unfortunately we have been documenting past Gaza Wars and the to talk and over the course of 21 years we counted 13 journalists killed in Gaza out of 20 overall we have already exceeded double that number in three weeks and unfortunately the majority the absolute majority are Palestinians because they were basically the first one on the front lines they have no exit or safety Haven and many of them have reported not just losing family uh colleagues who also were killed with their amilies in their homes um so the of course this is unprecedented for this region for this conflict but also worldwide since we started documenting cases of kill journalists in 1992 you say Palestinian journalists were the only ones on the front lines the first ones on the front lines but they are also the only ones on the front lines right now because Israel is not letting anyone into Gaza of course is Israel deliberately targeting these journalists these Palestinian journalists in Gaza and their families we cannot verify that independently we are still investigating circumstances of each of those cases we're tracking life the casualties for obvious reason about safety for journalists who continue to cover from there and who are fling to the region right now to cover how risky it is but uh we have our de Bas and in each of these cases we explain from as much firsthand sources families colleagues media Outlets those circumstances and to our comparison we only say journalist is murdered if we can prove a lot of evidence including past threats tracking and targeting and other ways and that in the previous Wars out of the 20 journalist that we said were killed covering the conflict by IDF fire only three we classified as murder including sh AB last year and Y M and mahm abusse in 2018 when they were covering the Gaza protest what is significant about this current conflict and its coverage is that you know in previous escalations in previous Wars some foreign journalists were allowed into G it's not the case anymore why is that [Music] unfortunately we have been seeing a dwindling number of international media and international journalists in Gaza over the years because at every past Gaza Wars media Outlets were bombed by Israeli air strikes in 2012 2014 and just two years ago we saw Al jaaz and press building and at least uh 18 other Palestinian media Outlets being bombed to the ground and of course the fact that no one was held accountable in all of the journalist killing that 20 not just shakla and the fact that no one was held accountable for bombing these media offices have changed the calculus about the risk for a lot of international media organization International journalists to be there Sheriff mans thank you for talking to us about this Sheriff Mansour is the middle eastern North Africa Program Coordinator at cpj the committee to protect journalists thank you for your time thank you
