the news houra is Sam Rose director of planning for unra he live from London thank you for being with us Sam so at least two unra locations targeted in the last few days can you tell us more about the circumstances of these attacks first and were there any warnings from the Israelis absolutely thank you look the the attack on the school in in noat happened a couple of nights ago about 2:00 in in the morning 6,000 people Sheltering in that school the majority of these people women and and children we've not been able to independently verify the casualty numbers but we believe between 35 and 45 people killed and and there'll be higher numbers of injures as well and we've all seen the reports from the hospital which would appear to indicate large numbers of women and children among amongst the dead we've not been able as unra yet to access the the site after the incident it requires proper bomb disposal and mind clearance experts to go in as part of that mission it's not been possible yet and and and like you were just hearing again the the stories of the or the reports of this second attack on an unra building in in Northern Gaz and if that is if those reports are indeed true and there's no reason to believe that they're not that it's yet another shocking attack on on on a un and UNR premises in Gaz and these are protected premises under international law it's critical that all parties the conflict respect the humanitarian character of our premises it's not the first time we hope and we pray that it will be the last but the way this war is going we Fe that it won't be indeed and we have seen repeatedly unra buildings being uh targeted in this conflict as our correspondents noted there why is that the Israelis claim at times that Palestinian Fighters have been hiding among civilians who are Sheltering in these facilities I mean I can't comment on on Israel's military tactic but but I would agree we are seeing unprecedented uh levels of of attacks and and incidents on un protected premises I believe 180 unra premises now in Gaza have been have been hit either directly or or indirectly and and look I I I think this is just emblematic of the unprecedented nature and scale and horror of of of this of this conflict we've seen similar incidents in conflicts in the past but they've been they've been terrible they've been tragic they they've led to civilian casualties but but not on this scale because we've never seen a conflict of of of this scale or intensity in in Gaza we we uh of course now um are uh looking at a situation where the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is only getting worse every day Sam uh can you tell us about the current Aid situation as you know it how much Aid has gone into Gaza in the past few days getting worse than than ever we'll recall that we were on the brink of a famine 6 weeks 2 months ago when the last report came out from Global independent famine experts a new report is out in the next couple of weeks or so and it's inevitable that that report will show a deterioration in humanitarian conditions we've been able to bring less Aid in in in the last six weeks really than than any time since about November December time and it's not just the lack or or or The Limited volume and quantities of supplies that we've been able to bring in it's that the population is yet again increasingly vulnerable as a result of a mass Force displacement over a million people have left Rafa in the past uh in the in the past month and and our ability to reach them becomes increasingly difficult when when they're on the move our networks our infrastructure our own staff who are themselves affected by by the displacement have to move have to adjust to support them and it's not just a matter of of stopping a trucks from entering Gaza is it Sam there are a number of obstructions that's preventing unra and other Aid organizations from from doing their work and delivering the assistance and and uh the aid the humanitarian Aid that these people so desperately need absolutely I mean the only way that we will put an end to the humanitarian crisis is in gazra as if we're able to put an end to the conflict everything that we do right now in Gaza is incredibly difficult incredibly complicated in large part this is due to the nature of the conflict and the fact as your correspondent said a few minutes ago that we're essentially seeing bombardments and operations across all areas of the Gaza Strip this means that we have to coordinate very closely our movement with the Israeli authorities it means that our staff are increasingly operating in extremely dangerous zones as well Sam thank you so much for talking to us Sam Rose from unra talking to us there from London make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaaz
