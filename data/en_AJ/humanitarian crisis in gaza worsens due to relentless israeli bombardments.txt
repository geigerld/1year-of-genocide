Israeli forces have stepped up strikes in southern Gaza overnight a day after announcing plans to pull back some troops the center of the strip is a battlefield there's fighting around three refugee camps between Israeli forces and the armed wing of Hamas the number of Palestinians killed in the military offensive since October the 7th is approaching 22,000 the humanitarian crisis is getting worse Aid agencies say Relentless Israeli bombardments are preventing badly needed supplies from getting in this say even more is needed hany Mahmud joining us live from Rafa in southern Gaza hany first of all tell us what's been happening with these Israeli strikes yes well despite the uh the reports about Israeli military pulling out of some parts of the Gaz the northern part and Gaza City from major areas that uh earlier uh the this week declaring uh it's full control over these territories but now we're seeing these reports of them withdrawing uh from these areas with no further explanation about what were the motives for this withdraw uh we're seeing more intense bombardment in the central uh area and on Khan Unis particularly all of all of last night uh uh and the early hours of this morning uh these two areas came under heavy bombardment and artillery Shillings and reports about a massive explosions taking place at the entire city of kanun as well as all the refugee camps in the central part now the intensity and the scale of the of the bombings that prevented paramedics and ambulance to uh to go to the targeted sites and tried to uh uh take people back to the hospitals or save them just uh could not move and given the fact that the vast majority of the roads and infrastructure are destroyed and what we heard just within the past hour of the in in Khan un from Naser Hospital paramedics and ambulance are able now to get to these targeted sites the residential homes that were targeted and the evacuation centers within their vicinity where much of the bombings going on similar thing in the central part so we're expecting uh to uh to get exact numbers of of the casualties of overnight and and early hours of this morning now the fear is those who were not being able to be saved overnight given the intensity of the bombings are are are possibly lost their life as they were left bleeding on this on these targeted uh sites and hany not only do people have to deal with the Israeli air strikes and the damage to the infrastructure of course there's a lack of supplies as well on top of that the weather is causing problems too yes indeed and and for the the thousand of of Palestinians forcibly displaced here in in in in the southern part of the gas are forced to live in in in unsuitable living conditions inside these plastic and Nyland tents here uh appli towait uh uh them given that the weather is getting colder and with the possible heavy rainfall as what happened overnight we get reports about the area where the AL maasi evacuation Zone was set up it's flooded and a lot of people had water inside their their tents but for this large number of people on a prepared uh for the cold weather no Heating and no suitable closing no blankets to keep the warm the uh the the the the the concern about survival uh uh are are very very high and there is another place not only it's getting cold and and then there is no proper heating or clothing for these people but the the spread of waterborne disease as well infectious disease that among the most vulnerable group here we're talking about a children there's also another problem that most of the water available here in the southern part is U generated by the desalination stations that are operated by a solar panel and in winter time a solar panel needs a Solid 5 hours of sunlight to to charge so the the the stations can operate well and get water with with wind and and the the sun is is not out for uh for long hours there is a a difficulty of the for these uh uh desalination stations to to operate and to to generate a drinking uh water for people so we're looking at ahead of further complications as the weather getting colder and uh more rain is is expected to to come down hany Mahmud in Rafa in southern Gaza Hy thank you very much indeed
