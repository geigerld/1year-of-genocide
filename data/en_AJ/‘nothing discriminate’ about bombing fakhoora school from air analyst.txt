well let's bring in Maran bashara he's alzer's senior political analyst Maran I mean we've seen so much civilian infrastructure being hit by Israeli air strikes you've been saying this is this is a war on hospitals it's also a war on schools on shelters on homes and fura school is like Al shifa Hospital in the sense that fura school is like the shifa of schools in Gaza okay it's been bombed it's been targeted like a shifo has in fact before the Israeli Spinners come on the various media Outlets to explain and to lie about what happened in fura just now let us remind our viewers around the world that this school in this refugee camp has was bombed in 2009 it was bombed in 2014 yeah it was bombed early in this month in November 4th the fact that a school is not just attacked it's bombed from the air which means there's absolutely nothing discriminate about the fact that a school that shelters thousands of people yeah has been bombed from the air that is meant to create damage human loss suffering and deaths because when you attack a hospital with such a concentration of people taking Refuge refuge in the school you are sending a message that is more than I am uh going after I don't know what Hamas Fighters here and there yeah what is saying is I want people to be driven out I want people to pay a price I want people to die so once again just to summarize so our viewers around the world don't get confused about some detail or another this school was bombed in 2009 2014 and 2023 and this is the second time this month that has been bound and we're seeing the human toll of that right now on our screens what is is the jabala refugee camp now to Israeli forces clearly that there's a huge military focus on this refugee camp and and for our viewers from around the world what does it mean for the Israeli Army you know just generally speaking and and just for our viewers around the world who were of a certain age I would say something like it's suo you know of Palestine right like Su of South Africa I mean it is a a place where um it's of course a refugee camp right so it's another one of those refugee camps and clearly it has been trying to uh rebuild itself and when it was destroyed in 2009 they rebuilt it again in fact with outside help yeah but the people in refu in in in jabalia have been steadfast throughout the Israelis considered it at one point or another in the past as as some kind of a resistance stronghold but clearly the boming of the hospital had absolutely nothing to do with that because when we saw the images and later on we looked at what in fact happened and who died scores dozens of people died in each and every one that we know of at the time right and now clearly this is just another Massacre another Slaughter of people happening in front of our eyes but once again I mean to underline uh the tactic being used the strategy by the Israelis is on the one hand they want to cause as much damage as possible they want to make sure that none of their soldiers is in Any Which Way in any which probability as In Harm's Way so they bomb from the air bombing from the air and not from drones or helicopters where at least you can see clearly closely and you're targeting certain thing when you're bombing from the air that means you are bombing a wide air area of of uh of geographically speaking and that in a place where it takes shelter thousands of people yeah it's meant to kill as many people as possible and Marana I know that our our audience isn't listening to the audio of this of this video we have been getting that translated for you here at Al jazer English and we're hearing people there in that video talking about being hit overnight while sleeping let's listen because you can also not only hear people talk about what happened that this strike took place overnight while people were sleeping but you can also not only hear but see children there who are searching for their parents you you can hear children calling for their parents who aren't there now Maran you've been saying that this is obviously one of the most densely populated parts of one of the most densely populated parts of the world is this part of a a broader policy of a depopulation of the northern Gaza Strip it's looking more and more likely I mean you know as they say uh I hate to use such uh uh sayings now but if it does you know uh quack like a dog and a dock and and walk like a dock then you know it is probably as such and and the way Israelis have been the way isra the way Israeli military has been handling itself and the way it's getting that justification from Israeli politicians clearly there is intent at ethnic cleansing clearly there is intent at Revenge clearly there's intent at punitive measures against an entire population and that's why it's probably important once again to contextualize what is it that we're seeing so in the past six weeks we've seeing bombings of hospital vicinities and even attacks on hospitals we've seen bombings of schools we've seen bombings of mosques we've seen bombings of a church we've seen bombings of residential buildings all of that happening in plain sight in other words Israel is carrying killing on an industrial scale this is no longer what they call hand-to-hand confrontations this is an army with a with an incredible Firepower that Firepower is not just Israeli it's American in fact looking back at some of the reports that came out in 2009 and 2014 the people in gaza's mess m to the rest of the world was American jet fighters are bombing us Maran let me ask you you've talked here about potential ethnic cleansing we've seen literally in in the last day or so 36 un special rapporteur signed a letter saying that there is clear evidence of genocidal intent that this is potentially a genocide in the making they're calling on the World to do more what more could the world do right now given the state of of of politics and the way that countries are making their decisions could something like this what we're seeing now on a school the death toll of women and children is something like that going to shift opinion or is it all just a bit too far gone this is see this is the thing so the so-called International Community or at least the hypocritical part of it the Western Powers have been making statements about this and Maran I'm sorry to interrupt you so quickly into your answer but we are now getting translation of of an unra press conference Tamara alari who is a communications director at unra that's the UN Agency for Palestine refugees is giving a press conference on the phone right now let's listen in dead bodies are received namely those from Alura un the capacity of this hospital is very uh minimum we are taking hard decisions we are comparing and contrasting victims who to attend and who to leave to die these are very difficult decisions to be made by doctors we are overwhelmed receiving hundreds of well we've been listening just briefly there to an unra press conference that's the UN Agency for Palestine refugees now they were running the school the alpha cor school that's been hit in this Israeli air strike that you're watching the the video right now the aftermath of they were running that school and they've been talking about their their operations the dire state of their operations in the Gaza Strip we're trying to get translation back for you um of that press conference and we'll go back to that as soon as we get it but for for now let's go back to Maan Bashar Maran you and I were just discussing the idea of genocidal intent here and whether anyone could do anything about it do you think that the there's any kind of light at the end of the tunnel well as as I was saying um the United States is the one that could actually put an end to this now if it actually uses its leverage with Israel but the United States has been too weak and it's a very very old and apparently not very well very old president uh has been boxing himself in be behind prime minister Netanyahu and his military and that's why the United States while it says it doesn't want to see that kind of action against schools and hospitals it's actually given the green light for it so while the United States has been putting pressure verbally but not in any other way secretary of state blinkin had to go to Japan in order to issue have a statement issued by the G7 most powerful most rich World democracies to tell Israel that it can not ethnically cleanse the Palestinians again and push them into the Sinai so the question is to our viewers around the world is why with the G7 out of out of Japan issue a statement to Israel not to ethnically cleanse the Palestinians unless there was an intention or fear by those seven countries that in fact Israel was about to do just that ethnically the Palestinians unfortunately Israel is not listening to anyone because no one with the power to influence Israel's decision is using their leverage people uh leaders like in Germany the UK and the United States are speaking out of both sides of their mouths on the one hand they're saying Israel needs to respect international law such as not bomb schools and hospitals but at the same time when they're asked is Israel in violation of international law they mumbling and stuttering and not actually taking a position that Israel in fact is in violation of international law and hence it has to be stopped those who are capable of stopping Israel carrying such crime as we see now in Alura school yeah that again to remind viewers around the world it was bombed in 2009 it was bombed in 2014 it was bombed earlier this month dozens of people were killed in each and every air strike schools one should insist should not be bombed hospitals should not be bombed that's the least one can say about any War but this war against Gaza has turned to a war against children a war against hospitals a war against schools and residential neighborhoods because in the end of the day one can explain why this is very complex different but there is no justification for what we see today unraveling in Gaza just one last comment on that and it's very important those who wouldn't condemn such an attack who think that such attacks on hospitals and schools and mosques and churches is justifiable need to shut up about the October 7 attack because those who think the October 7 attack against civilians is not justifiable need to be able to say the same thing with the same Humane compass that what we've been seeing on October 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 November 1 123 through November today that these are also not justifiable attacks and must be condemned Must Be Stopped Maran Bashar aler senior political analyst thank you for being with me here in the studio in Doha
