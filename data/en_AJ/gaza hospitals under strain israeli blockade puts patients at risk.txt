Al AXA hospital has been treating the wounded since the war on Gaza began they've been constantly overwhelmed many patients have no choice but to sleep on the floor and some need help that the hospital is unable to provide I hope I'll be treated and that I'll be cured so I can go home doctors here say I might need to be treated abroad Muhammad and his father were injured when an Israeli bomb struck their home doctors here at Al AA have been able to make him comfortable but he'll need treatment outside of Gaza if he's ever to walk again I've been waiting a long time to travel abroad and get treatment I still hope to get cured to be able to walk to play with my friends and to go to school Israel has shut down the crossing to Egypt until it's open again patients like Muhammad won't be able to get the help they need Israel block is also denying gaza's hospitals the medical supplies they need to keep people alive some patients are worried about what will happen if they don't get proper treatment because of all the disruption I'm afraid that my leg will have to be amputated here in the hospital there are a lot of wounded and injured people and the medical staff can't cope with these big numbers sometimes they treat my wounds even without anesthesia due to a lack of supplies every day the hospital receives more wounded people doctors here say time is running out and if Israel doesn't stop its blockade many more people will die there are more than 21,000 critically wounded people in Gaza some of them have already died we urge the Free World and the international organizations to put pressure on Israel to open the crossing they must allow the wounded to travel for treatment allow medical supplies to come in and allow field hospitals to open the Rafa Crossing has been closed for more than 3 weeks now leaving all of these injured Palestinians in risk of death and a deteriorating heal situation this is hindar Al jaaz ala Hospital Gaza Palestine make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
