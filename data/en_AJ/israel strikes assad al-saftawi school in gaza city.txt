so then it is 1500 GMT that is just past 5:00 p.m. in Gaza where Israel's bombardment of the strip is unrelenting we've just received reports that Israel struck the Assad Al safawi school about an hour ago it's in the AL daraj neighborhood of Gaza City where hundreds of people have been Sheltering moments after the attack many had to flee carrying just whatever they could Israel's military is expanding its operations by launching more attacks in the central and southern areas in the south hospitals are becoming overwhelmed doctors describe the situation as catastrophic the wounded are being treated on floors and in corridors in overcrowded facilities with limited [Music] supplies well Israel's on relenting air strikes in the South have reduced entire neighborhoods to Rubble more than half of the homes in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged by Israeli attack since October the 7th well let's get the picture from Khan yunas now tar abuo is standing by for us there in southern Gaza so T Israel is targeting the central and southern parts of Gaza but the attack on that school in Gaza City shows that the north is still in Focus too yes uh absolutely attacks against hospitals and even schools in the north of the Gaza City uh had uh renewed Again by the occupation forces this time at school in the North or uh in the north the Northern areas had been attacked and uh these areas considered to be an operation zone for the Israeli occupation forces that had regular battles with Hamas fighters in that area meanwhile people had used to take these areas as shter for them with they tend to be protected from the Israeli uh artillery bombing and the aerial uh bombardment that had had been carried out by the occupation forces since the early beginning of this round of fighting uh the majority of residents from the Eastern areas of the north of the Gaza trip whose houses are adjacent to the borders fled earlier to the uh schools that are affiliated to the United Nations and the schools that also uh run by the government uh inside the Gaza Strip in order to be away from the Israeli Relentless bombardment and to receive also humanitarian AIDs that are distributed by the United Nation but the the atts on those areas continue in order toce people to flee to the south of the of Gaza and uh at the same time to give a clear Mobility for the maneuvering troops on the ground to act in these areas uh the M the the fact on the ground in the not that some people refuse to evacuate simply because they don't have any safe Corridor bage out to the South uh to the southern areas and they are still now stay and remain and the in these shelters they were running low in terms of for water especially with the limited number of the humanitarian trucks that were allowed to enter the north of the Gaza now as I said you're in car Unice in the South it is gaza's second largest city and home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians you've been describing who've had to flee and been forced from their homes tell us what the later situation there is now yes uh the situation on the south is very complicated and is getting much more exacerbation uh especially with the Israeli orders that had been delivered to the residents in the Eastern areas of kanun to flee to Rafa in order to be away from the Israeli bombardment but the fact is that the attacks on the south did not stop as Israel bombarded ra district for multiple times during the last couple of days after the collapse of the truth and the possibility for reaching further extension of the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel and uh the uh a number of people had practically started to flee and to evacuate to Rafa uh District they are now taking shelter on public areas and uh we just uh take a look uh a close look over the people there we found them like they are setting up tinted camps they are taking uh shelter in on the street where there is no any kind of proper human facilities to be provided for them unless they are using a very primitive way of sitting fire in order to feed their children and to do uh their Necessities but they are they don't have any further options because ra considered to be the last shelter for the people who had been evacuated for more than one time from the homelands as they were forced to flee from the first time from the north of Gaza and now they head to the far south of the territory as the bombardment did not stop that clean till this now more than 15,000 Palestinians with more than 30,000 others who have been been critically injured and now receiving a treatment on the hospitals of the south of the territory but there is a very hidden problem that it yet not yet had been discovered is the fact that if there's going to be more military including into khuna City it means that the uh the majority of hospitals in the South will be forced to evacuate the injured people to rougher hospitals which considered to be very limited in terms of the number and the capacity as well all right we'll leave it there t thanks for that comprehensive upate appreciate that t Abu AUM that inar unus in the south of Gaza
