now a Jewish political appointee in the US Interior Department has resigned in protest against President Joe Biden's support for Israel's warn Gaza Lily Greenberg Co who worked on the Biden election campaign is the first Jewish official to publicly resign over the war let's go to shab Brans is live for us in Washington DC shab so talk us through exactly what's been announced and it's an interesting thing yes she is the first Jewish appointee in the Biden Administration to resign but in fact a member of the defense Intelligence Agency on Monday resigned who was also of Jewish descent but he wasn't an appointe he'd been working his way up up the system the DIA is the the Pentagon equivalent of the CIA but I'll give you some Choice bits from from the letter itself she talks about how much she believed in Biden fighting for a better America uh but then she says um that she she was thrilled to join the department of interior but but what she suggests what's what's the point of power if you can't actually use it I can no longer in good conscience continue to represent this Administration amidst President Biden's disastrous continued support for Israel's genocide in Gaza she says she talks about how her own family escaped anti-semitic persecution in Europe and then within two generations she managed to to to reach her position in the Biden Administration but what's the point of having power if you will not use it to stop crimes against humanity and she's particularly triggered it would appear by Biden constantly conflating being Jewish with with what Israel is doing in Gaza and she subsequently spoken about how you know Biden saying you know were there no Israel there wouldn't be a Jew in the world who was safe and was talking about the Hamas attacks were triggered by ancient desire to wipe out the Jewish people but but what Cole says is Biden is making Jews the face of the American War Machine and that is so deeply wrong noting that her own ancestors were killed by state sponsored violence and in fact Biden by doing that and Israel by doing what it's doing in Gaza is making Jews very unsafe and what do we make of the timing of this well in the letter she clearly is pegging it to use a news term to Naka day which you were just talking about so she says uh you know today is May 15th nakba day I reject the premise that one people's salvation must come at another's destruction I'm committed to creating a world where this does not happen and this cannot be done from within the Biden Administration beyond that the timing is yep she's another official from the Biden Administration to resign we've had several from the state department who who've resigned we've had the chat from the DIA that I just mentioned someone from the education department we had an enlisted Airman set fire to himself Aaron bushnel outside outside the White House and this does reflect what we've been hearing consistently over the last several months of the intense unease within the administration particularly in the state department which I've seen people refer to as being an open Revolt well maybe closed Revolt open Revolt within the walls of the state department and lots of letters have been sent to blinkin and others saying what on Earth are you doing why aren't you listening to us uh but often they're sent sort of anonymously and not not publicly like this so I think that's that's that's the difference is whether more people will publicly come out because there is that fear of Retribution in fact Call's Twitter account was suspended briefly we're not quite sure of the connection there but now she's back on back online but there is that sense that you know something has to give but for Biden for Tony blinkin for Jake Sullivan for Brett mcer they're the ones who are driving this policy they aren't listening to anyone else in the administration and they're driven by their own personal sense of intense Zionism and the wishes of their billionaire donors in the coming election okay thank you for that shab Rotan there for us live in Washington DC make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al is zero
