well 200 Israeli Ultra nationalists will March through the old city in the Western Wall in occupied East Jerusalem they demand an end to the control of the alaka mosque compound by The wakf Authority that's the Islamic endownment Authority which administers the Muslim holy site well the alaka MOs compound is a constant point of contention in the Palestinian Israeli conflict Israel's encroachments intensified in 1967 resulting in the illegal occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem including the old city and aluxa mosque since 1967 Jordan and Israel agreed that the wak or Islamic trust would have control over matters inside the compound while Israel would extend will control rather external security non-muslims would be allowed onto the site during visiting hours but not allowed to pray there Rising Temple movements have been challenging the Israeli governments ban on Jews entering the compound well today Israeli forces routinely allow groups of Jewish settlers to enter the alaka compound under police and army protection Israel restricts Palestinian entry into the compound through several methods including a separation war and permits from Israeli authorities and permits rather from Israeli authorities are hard to get I'm now joined by Mustafa abuu Islamic scholar and member of the Islamic W Council in occupied East Jerusalem good to have you with us so looking at what is transpiring are you worried that the bigger picture is an attempt to end your authorities administration of the Muslim Moss compound of course I'm U worried and in fact everyone uh would be worried uh because we talk about the rise of these U you know fanatical uh Jewish movements uh they have been on The Fringe decades ago and today they have gained momentum and they are they have representatives in the Israeli KES the Israeli Parliament and in the uh cabinet in the Israeli uh Ministry Ministries so uh this does worry us and uh of course it is condemned it is provocative and it has been condemned by the Jordanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs the official spokesperson Dr safyan warned against such a a pro provocative March which would go through the Muslim quarter of the whole city through nablas the Damascus gate as we call it and then through the most probably the W Street and probably also there would there is a small alley that leads next to the uh W Administration and then they will proceed uh to the uh and but they would stop from uh entering uh this uh this March has been uh given the green light by the Israel police but it means that this is the office of the Israeli Prime Minister we we know very well that anything pertains to would have to get the direct okay from uh prime minister Netanyahu himself uh of course the gravity of the situation made people like y Le the leader of the Israeli opposition to condemn also the same March and he said that in during his days he would not have had given such a a group of Fanatics the uh the green light Theos in all of the the 144 denoms 36 acres plus uh is an Islamic holy size and uh it is exclusively the right of the W Department to administrative this exclusive right exclusive legal and historical uh right at is as this is the historical status quo and just to put this in context because this The Narrative sometimes put out by some of these far right Israeli groups is that they want freedom of worship equality of worship the ability to Worship in this site however the the backdrop explain to us the backdrop of this because we know that some of these far right Israeli Jewish groups promote the idea of the complete destruction of the alaka MOs compound some of them call for the Ala Moss to be disassembled and reassembled in in Mecca and other places places right so this is this is for not just a question of who's allowed to pray where this is a struggle for sovereignty and control right this is true I mean this this particular March they have raised the uh uh the the stakes and they they are demanding the total removal of the uh W Administration and they want to implement the total Israeli sovereignty let's not forget that this is part as you said said in your introduction that this is part of East Jerusalem occupied East Jerusalem and Israel as the occupying uh Power has the uh responsibility to uh uh maintain the historical status quo until basically the uh the end of uh the occupation yes these uh groups uh demand uh U taking over the Ala MOS those who are kind enough they would like to re relocate the D of the rock for example and there are those politicians even who speak directly about demolishing the uh the Dome of the Rock and lately even amid Hali a member of the keset suggested that he would make it a law to divide ala mosque whereby the Jews would take about 2third including the Dome of the Rock and the Northern Area and he would leave the MOs the southern M building in the hands of the uh Muslims yes it's a how disturbing is it now when we have I mean these sorts of calls and ideas are very it's very difficult to dismiss them as a fringe opinion anymore when you see that members of the cabinet the like the national security minister itamar Ben gavier taking part in marches to the alaa Moss compound um earlier this year in July 2023 and on the record are saying statements like this place is important to us we have have to return to it and prove our sovereignty this place has been a most for 1500 years and there is nothing that could change this the MOs and all its cour yards buildings uh Subterranean Halls the it is airspace even all of this belongs to the Muslims sovereignty talk about political sovereignty it should be Palestinian the custodianship his majesty King ABD second is the custodian of the Christian and Muslim holy places this is accepted by the American Administration uh secretary blinkin used you know the the same uh the same phrase to describe the Jordan custodianship It's A Century Of Care Jordanian care of the Haram Sharif and yes it does pose uh a risk it does pose a challenge uh but we know very well that whether it's the UNESCO it's the whether it's the International Community uh or locally the W tries its best to uh protect the uh premises OFA mosque these uh these movements whether it's Bing he has this is really uh his time but it's basically we know very well um and hopefully that he will not be in the next uh uh cabinet not that this is the uh the maximum hopes for us it's occupied land and it should be free not freedom of movement not freedom of worship for them freedom of movement for us and freedom of worship for us since October 7 the Israeli authorities limited the uh the number and in fact Muslims who could basically go TOA more right are able to make it through we'll have to leave it there Mustafa thank you so much thank you
