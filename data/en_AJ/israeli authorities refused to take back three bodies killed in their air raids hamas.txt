all right we can now speak to Muhammad nazal who's a member of hamas's political office thank you for joining us on Al jazer so we saw an extension of that ceasefire by one day until tomorrow 7: a.m. what's the likelihood that it will be extended again because all eyes are on what's going to happen tomorrow uh this is the seventh day of humanitarian ceasefire we are negotiating now through K foreign Ministry to extend the humanitarian SE fire as soon as soon as we understanding with the other parties we hope that we can uh extend the Seas fair for one day two days few days as soon as we H can reach uh to this extension humanitarian I I understand your hope Mr nazal but is this how it's going to be day by day until all the prisoners are going to be released yes of course our goal is to release uh all uh prisoners from two sides and of course we need to enter to enter the AIDS to our people because uh it is not enough H to enter these AIDS within last seven days we want more what can you tell us just let's focus on the releases for a moment if we can just focus on the releases what can you tell us about today's release in particular does it still include Israeli women and children yes of course H but the Israeli refused uh to take the bodies of uh their prisoners uh who they are killed them by their air strikes uh we are ready also uh to deliver the uh bodies of Israeli prisoners but the but the authority Israeli authorities refused to take their budes the Israeli said because this was a violation of the agreed upon standards which uh right now we understands stipulates 10 living uh detainees but again back to today's release Thursday does that group still include women and children or will it include yes all women and children include women and children H it's this is the releasing today inshallah okay so what happens once uh the women and children are all released which which group of captives will will then be released till this moment till this moment uh our leadership in Gaza Strip H they announced that we have only last of women and children among the prisoners till this moment so we are ready to negotiate about the other prisoners in both sides we have soldiers uh we have settlers we are ready to start negotiate about these kind of prisoners have these negotiations started right now are they are they ongoing it's ongoing it's ongoing uh but uh we are waiting of er we are waiting of uh the sponsorship and patronage of this negotiating between us and Israelis Ministry foreign Ministry can you uh give us an exact number then of the number of um hostages you're holding apart from the women and children you you just said that you have settlers and you have soldiers can you give us an idea of of the numbers actually I have uh no idea about the exactly number but I can say that it's about hundreds of prisoners ER among ER these prisoners who are detained them can you tell us about the reports of of the dead bodies that uh that Hamas uh is holding in captivity they are talking about three bodies now but I don't know whether they have more or not but they refused uh the three bodies uh who which Hamas declared about it do you think that there's going to be an opportunity uh Mr nazal for a permanent ceasefire after uh these temporary ceasefires uh take place we hope that we have we hope that and we we are looking for a permanent uh ceasefire uh but till this moment the Israelis are refusing a permanent ceasefire what do you why do you say that they're refusing a permanent ceasefire can you elaborate more on that I think uh there are a division and inside the leadership of Israel in political establishment and in military establishment so till this moment they didn't decide whether they are ready to stop uh the war or continue the war for the um soldiers that Hamas uh is holding on to in Gaza uh which Palestinian prisoners do you want to see released and is it also going to be the same formula as we've seen over the past couple of days for one Israeli three Palestinians are being released no of course we must change this space when we started to talk about soldiers it's different talking about civilians this bace was because of we we were negotiating about civilians when we started to talk about soldiers I think we must change this space so what will Hamas then be asking for we are asking for releasing of all prisoners in Israel jails for the release of the soldiers just to be clear for the release of the soldiers from Gaza you're asking for all the Palestinian prisoners to be released from Israeli jails yes this is what we are looking for and what's been the response uh from from negotiators to this and from Israel till this moment till this moment we didn't start uh in this way of negotiating okay we'll leave it there thank you uh Mr Muhammad nazal thank you for speaking to us thank you very
