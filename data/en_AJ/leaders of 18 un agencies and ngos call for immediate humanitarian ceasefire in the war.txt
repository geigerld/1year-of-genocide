the heads of 18 United Nations and other humanitarian agencies have issued a joint statement calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza almost 10,000 people have died there since the conflict began a month ago the latest round of Israeli air strikes has targeted densely populated areas and refugee camps well Toby frer is joining us live from Aman he's from UNICEF the un's children's agency thank you very much for being with us of those large numbers the 9,770 Palestinian dead I'm seeing 4,800 of those are children and in one can only imagine the kind of psychological State and the impact that all of this is having on children who are Left Alive talk to us about the kind of conditions that children are facing in Gaza at the moment yeah I mean the situation right now you know is catastrophic for for children across the Gaza Strip you know it's been 30 days since the horrific attacks inside Israel and now the this this catastrophic number of deaths and injuries of of children you know across the Gaza Strip and um you know what we know is that the every day day in day out children are first of all trying to survive so families doing whatever they can to best protect their children we have around 1.5 million people displaced and that means families children living in even more densely populated shelters trying to seek safety uh and then at the same time you have this massive um concern over you know access to safe water access to medical facilities trying to support and keeping those hospitals running uh given they are you virtually on on the brink now so so there's a whole uh culmination of of huge issues and that's why it's so important that Unis un you we keep calling for to scale up you humanitarian access as well um because the impact on on children is massive both from the ongoing intense hostilities but also the concerns over other issues arising such as outbreaks of diseases tell me what the UNICEF presence was in Gaza before the conflict and and what it what it's like now yeah I mean UNICEF has worked in inside the Gaza Strip for for many years um and we still have our teams on the ground there you know doing whatever they can despite the situation uh so we are still moving you know supplies around mainly in the in the southern part of the Gaza Strip right now and trying to reach children families wherever they are you we've heard from staff of of the dangers of of how they're trying to survive look after their own children you know children who like a four-year-old daughter of one of our staff members who she was saying that she was like ripping her hair scratching her thighs until they ble there's this massive massive distress of living through this every day and we know how dangerous it is for humanitarian workers unra the UN Palestine Refugee agency have had 88 staff members killed the highest number of un workers killed in any conflict um so the impact is massive it's extremely dangerous to do the work and at the same time for staff members to look after their their own families I would imagine also it can be very difficult for Unicef members UNICEF staff to be able to find people particularly of course if there's a Communications blackout which we've seen happen I think this is maybe the second or third time that that it's happened talk to us about how much of a hindrance that can be that's right no I mean the communications blackouts um have a massive impact so what we've seen over the last 12 hours now um was a blackout my understanding is that communication is being restored um but every time this happens it's it's it's isolating you know it's isolating people in the Gaza Strip it's isolating them from their friends from their families from their ability to be able to contact uh family members or contact urgent support within the Gaza ship but it's also very very difficult obviously for for Unicef for un and others who working in the G ship to then communicate with our staff on the ground and best to and coordinate sort of the life-saving aid so that it's a massive concern when we have the these blackouts of course we we have about 40 seconds or so left but I'm just wanted to ask you about the the fact that the heads of 18 United Nations and other humanitarian agencies are issuing this humanitarian ceasefire how confident given what you've described can you be that the Israelis are actually going to listen and that ceasefire may happen well the UN our civil society Partners many many others are calling out we keep calling out for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire for the release of all civilian particularly child hostages inside the Gaza and to scale up that life-saving age which is so critical to to save lives now children who would be more at risk of other issues breaking out and so we'll keep doing that and we'll keep advocating keep pushing for that for that immediate humanitarian Seaside because it's needed now as the statement says enough is enough Toby frier from UNICEF thank you very much indeed
