a political analyst he joins us now from London and how significant is it that there will be a Hamas delegation now in Cairo um I'm not sure I'm going to call it significant but it is certainly uh a Way Forward I guess uh they are curious enough to see uh what the Israelis uh provided the Egyptians if you remember several weeks ago several days ago the Israelis presented the Egyptians with something similar but the Egyptians refused to present it to Hamas they thought it was so ridiculous and so beneath them that they basically all the Israelis take it back we're not going to deliver this thing to Hamas well it seems like now the Egyptians are convinced that perhaps this might be of interest to Hamas to start yet another conversation and I think KH the deputy head of Hamas heading to Cairo is to say okay we'll take the Egyptian word for it and we'll see this is really worthy of our time because as you reported just now Hamas continues to insist that if it's not consistent with its agreement and with the Biden plan of the end of May and the negotiations ever since through July 2nd they're not going to accept it what are US officials hoping to achieve from this latest round of talks even if an agreement is not reached well look I mean in the end of the day what we have is something quite tricky right and it's the reason why Qatar Egypt and Hamas remain involved in this thing and that's the Israel's attempt at running the clock uh by continuing the slaughter you see as as you've been just reporting um the beginning since the beginning of the hour Israel continued to destroy and to kill dozens of Palestinians every day so we have a situ ation with the disease and the famine eating away at the people of Gaza Netanyahu and Israel are taking their time you know they're just basically playing everyone and procrastinating as much as they can adding conditions here and there and going back and forth between Cairo and T Aviv and Doha and T Aviv and Washington and T Aviv and so on so forth because they know two things are constant since the beginning of this genocide one is that they can continue to kill and maybe kill and talk two that the United States will continue to provide them with all the weapons needed so when the United States as the negotiations start give $20 billion to Israel Israel is in no rush whatsoever is under no pressure whatsoever to take these negotiations seriously especially someone like Nan because in the end of the day Maria when when you give a Dr addict drugs and say you know you should live healthy you know what the result is right you don't give an arms a violent addict like Netanyahu like Israel 20 billion do and then you act and then you expect him to pursue peace the the next day that's not how it works how absurd does it look though for Washington to raise expectations and even um Express optimism that there might be a deal when they come away empty-handed every single time see this is the thing this is where I say uh perhaps This Time It's Different and and please I need people need to stop accusing me of being optimistic this is not about optimism it's certainly not about hope I'm just saying that we have a bad deal now right this is not a good deal whatever Biden proposed and later on adjusted over the weeks is not a good deal it's not a permanent ceas fight so that's number one the permanent ceasefire was vetoed long before May when when the United States rejected every single International Initiative for peace deal and then it imposed one on the UN Security Council and on Hamas and on the mediators so now we're stuck with a bad deal and this this bad deal is getting worse this bad deal could pass I mean why not it is not calling for a permanent ceasefire this is a bad deal that even nany should the ically and practically accept because it was his original two the entire International Community is fed up with Israel and it's fed up with excuses including Western Europe the United States and everyone else today the only obstacle to an agreement is one man an indicted criminal a liar called Netanyahu who has a personal and political state in postponing in not having a deal at all I cannot believe I want I refuse to believe that the entire world that the United States and Western Europe that the entire Arab and Muslim world that the UN Security Council and the International Community that none of them including the majority of Israelis cannot take on this one criminal I refuse to believe that so there should be a ceire coming forward there is no reason why it shouldn't especially because it's a bad deal and there's only one man stopping it okay thank you Al jaaz senior political analyst Maran bashara make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
