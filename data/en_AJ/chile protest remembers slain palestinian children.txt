I'm outside of Chile's presidential Palace right now where there's a pro Palestinian demonstration taking place there are several several hundred people here as you can see and they are holding a demonstration that has a very very particular theme this time apart from the from calling for chile to break diplomatic ties with Israel they are also they're also putting out shoes small shoes tiny ones to illustrate the children that have died without their very many cases without having had time to put their shoes on I'm going to ask Rafa to to please take a a closeup shot of these shoes that are painted with red paint they are symbolizing of course the blood of thousands of children who have died in Gaza there are about a thousand shoes here but uh right now we can they are continuing to demonstrate against the Israeli government which they are calling a genocidal government the point of this demonstration is to open they say the hearts the minds and the eyes of people to what is happening in Gaza especially to children and this is not the only demonstration taking place by the way at this hour uh in Brazilia there is also a protest taking place in front of the US Embassy but here in Chile is a country that has the largest Palestinian diaspora outside of the Middle East people have been Gathering constantly since the War Began and they say they will continue to do so and to speak out and call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza not just so that their message is heard in Chile but they hope all over the world or certainly Latin America Lucia Newman Al jaaz Santiago
