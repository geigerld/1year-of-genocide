we're inside the lxa hospital at the emergency department here uh and as you can see it's overcrowded uh I'm joined by Dr Bushra man uh inside the hospital she's from panima medical Mission uh volunteering to help uh people and medical staff inside the hospital drer we need to know more about what's going on inside the emergency department thank you Hy so um as you can see here there's extreme overcrowd in the emergency department um this is actually a time when it's not really as busy as it could get especially when there are attacks nearby um there's limited resources in the department with only a few doctors servicing hundreds of patients family members are everywhere there's not enough beds for the patients you can see them either in wheelchairs or uh on the floor on mats surrounded by their family members um there are only three doctors generally in the emergency department so these doctors are overworked and understaffed um as you can see here some of the nurses are helping distribute some of the medications to the patients there's certainly not enough medications to go around um some of the antibiotics that we want to use that are crucial aren't available here and also aren't allowed to be l in in terms of medical supplies so um it's it's a hospital but it's barely functioning and it's working on very limited resources which is causing a lot of strain um any minute now the Health Care system is going to imminently collapse and the millions of people getting care here at Al oxa Hospital won't be able to get it this is a hospital normally that would have a couple of hundred beds and doesn't necessarily get to treat a lot of patients there are now up to 800 patients and thousands of displaced people living here as you can see all around us there are patients and their family members in the corridors in hallways living with their blankets family members um it makes it very difficult to be able to move around even to be able to actually even find your patients but a lot of times unfortunately because there's no structure and there's no system you actually don't know always where your patients end up or where you might be able to find them in order to provide the treatment that they require we're in the Pediatric Ward or the children's Ward here uh which houses infants and small babies all the way up to kids about 12 years old as you can see it's extremely overcrowded and one of the Striking features uh that the particularly young babies and infants require is um formula and feeding there's severe malnutrition especially through both the children and the adult population um as you can see there's no room for these patients to be in beds they're surrounded by their family members in the hallways um it's very difficult to be able to examine them with privacy so unfortunately sometimes we're having to examine patients and speak to them in open hallways um and that's just become an accepted part of how we can provide care here for them this war on children is absolutely heartbreaking and soul shattering it's very very difficult ult to uh actually provide them any care so some of these children don't actually have their mother or their father or potentially both parents they here being looked after by extended family members um a lot of them have had trapnel injuries that are going to leave them with amputations and debilitating um problems for the rest of their lives now we're walking from the older building to the building that used to be the obstetric ward that's now been converted to the operating theaters building and we're going to take a look inside on the Li mited resources that are being provided here in the operating theaters in all the healthcare facilities inza there are only a couple of hospitals that are still partially and functional and this will be one of them we just entered the operating theater complex here at the laa Hospital Dr Basher tell us more what we're seeing here yeah so just very quickly um on my left hand side here are the recovery rooms where patients come after they have finished their operations um we can't necessarily show you everything that's inside but there's very limited resources there's not necessarily the equipment to be able to monitor them in terms of taking their Vital Signs like blood pressure and heart rate there's one main Corridor that is both the entryway and the exit for patients coming into the operating rooms um and most of the time there are four five six even up to 10 patients just lining the corridor and it's very difficult to actually move around what are we seeing here what is this case yeah so this is this is a young kid that's obviously had severe burns from an explosion or a blast injury um this is a very common and unfortunate scenario um a lot of these kids are in severe pain because of their wounds there isn't enough adequate analgesia to be able to give them uh they have to come daily down to the operating room to get dressing changes because there isn't enough adequate Supply on the wards to be able to dress their wounds appropriately um and they require care actually that NE sometimes is unnecessarily not able to be provided here at ala Hospital tragedies find you at every corner of AA hospital after walking into the different Departments of this Health Care Facility the only remaining semi operational Health Care Facility in the central area we couldn't help but noticing the inadequacy of the medical care available for people this is hanim Mahmud from Ala Hospital in the Central Area
