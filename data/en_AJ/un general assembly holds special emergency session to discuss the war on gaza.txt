so and we go straight back to the UN General Assembly in New York where the representative of Jordan is currently speaking it is adopted and it's essential to emphasize that in the event of the adoption es10 would only be temporarily adjourned immediately following the conclusion of the debate thank you Mr President I thank the distinguished representative of Jordan the representative of Jordan has moved that the debate on agenda item five be suspended at 300 p.m. today for the assembly to proceed to the consideration of draft resolution a stroke E10 stroke l25 and that the debate would continue after the action on the draft resolution it it is my understanding that without setting a precedence and given the urgency of the issue if the assembly were to decide to suspend the debate on agenda item three on agenda item at 300 p.m. for the es10 stroke l25 and to continue the debate after the action on draft resolution and if the assembly were to adopt the draft resolution later today that the 10th emergency special session would be adjourned temporarily following the conclusion of the debate on item five is there any objection to the motion it is so decided before proceeding further I wish to address the question concerning the majority required for the adoption of the draft resolution in light of article 18 paragraphs 2 and three of the charter of the United Nations is there any objection to taking action on draft resolution A10 l25 by a 2third majority of the members present and voting I see no objection the 2third majority of members present and voting is therefore required for the adoption of draft resolution a [Music] l25 the 23s majority of members present and voting is therefore also required for the adoption of any Amendment to the draft res resolution I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of the Boliver bolivarian Republic of Venezuela you're listening to proceedings at the United Nations General Assembly we're going to break down everything that's happening for you we have Al Z's correspondent Gabriel alzando who is standing by at un headquarters in New York and we've got the pleasure of having Al's diplomatic editor James Bay with us in the studio uh Gabe I'll start with you we we so we listen to the last few minutes of of of proceedings uh explain to us what we heard the uh speaker was saying the debate on the draft resolution on the Gaza war will be suspended uh if I'm getting all this right uh at 3M they're speaking eastern time so that's in over four hours the debate will be suspended and I believe that's when they would then proceed to vote but run us through the steps yeah that's right uh essentially what happened here was a procedural uh maneuver here so let me just explain it today there are more than a hundred countries on the list that want to speak about this resolution that could go on for a very long time on Friday perhaps even into Saturday so what the Jordanian Ambassador did who is's sponsoring uh this resolution with 43 co-sponsors is he asked the president of the security Council no matter where we're at at 3:00 p.m. local time that's 19 GMT can we please request to stop the debate and take a vote at that time uh with no objections the president of the of the general assembly as you just heard uh said yes so essentially what you have here is pretty pretty simple they're basically saying we're going to go on with the debate we'll go on hearing from speakers uh but at 3 p.m. local 19g will stop and we'll take a vote that's essentially what just happened here in the General Assembly Building what does the vote then look like so it'll be at 19 GMT just over I said four actually over 5 hours from now what would that vote look like I don't mean the results I just mean what are we going to be seeing at that point well unlike the security Council where in the security Council when votes are taken uh the Ambassador simply raise their hand yes or no or raise their hand if they want to abstain here in the general assembly there are 193 members it's lot of countries represented here of course the entire United Nations body if you will so when votes are taken in the general assembly it's done electronically there's a big screen where all of the uh where all the the display of all the votes are are put on a big screen either green voting for red voting against or abstaining all the ambassadors have uh Representatives have something they can click to register their vote it's very simple it's pretty quick and it's very transparent so we'll get the the vote totals uh very quickly after the vote is called right Gabriel thank you very much I
