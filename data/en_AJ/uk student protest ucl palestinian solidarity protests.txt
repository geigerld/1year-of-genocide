events in American universities are certainly inspiring students here in the UK to come out and protest about what's happening in Gaza we're here at the UCL in central London but there are protests and encampments happening at other universities Newcastle at Warick at Manchester uh here at UCL it's a relatively small group I would estimate around 50 people who have tents on the lawn outside the main headquarters building of the university and are certainly making their presence felt with the megaphones they've also been addressed by Hassan abua who is a medical doctor who worked in Gaza at the beginning of the war and urged the UCL and other universities to divest of the investments in Israel the blood of 15,000 Palestinian children is on the hands of anybody who owns shares in these companies that have provided weapons and have actually increased by tenfold the delivery of Weapons Systems to Israel since the 7th of October now while encampments in America have been cleared by the police here there seems to be a more tolerant approach and the UCL have issued a statement uh saying that they are monitoring the situation and they will manage this in line with their legal Duty and commitment to promote freedom of speech uh within the law Paul Brennan AL jazer Central [Music] London make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
