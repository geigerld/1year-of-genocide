mediators are working behind the scenes to try to secure a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel this week the US president suggested an agreement was imminent in response Hamas has downplayed his optimism saying it had yet to receive the proposal the US state department however remains hopeful our goal is to achieve a deal to uh reach a humanitarian pause and the release of hostages is soon as possible certainly we' welcome getting one by this weekend um what I can say about the overall progress is that we made significant progress towards an agreement last week when we had officials from the United States government engaging in the region we continue to pursue further progress this week American officials across the government continue to be engaged on this question um we are trying to push this deal over the Finish Line we do think it's possible bam name is Hamas hel of political and international relations he's joining us live now from Istanbul thank you very much indeed for being with us sir is Hamas as optimistic as US President Joe Biden and the state department that some sort of ceasefire deal could be reached by next Monday we in the movement we were always optimistic to achieve an end of this Slaughter and aggression against our people but to be honest and to be related to the reality uh I think based on the ideas and thoughts we have received after the meeting in Paris to uh the Gap is still wide and uh we have to discuss a lot of points with the mediators and if the Americans are want to be really optimistic they have to end this double standard games they talk on one tank for stopping the uh aggression or for for achieving a seed fair and avoiding broadening the the conflict into the region but at the same time they are using the veto in the security Council to uh to reach a they are approving $4 billion for for Israel they are securing Israel with more ammunition I think uh more or less I can say that this optimism uh is not related to the reality on the ground and it is more part of the internal American politics in the year of the election um I know that Hamas has said that it has yet to receive any sort of proposal for ceasefire there have of course been a lot of leaked details apparently about some sort of ceasefire given what you know about the possibility of what might be out there is there anything that Hamas would be prepared to be flexible on Hamas have showed from the beginning great flexibility uh to achieve a c because we know every added day to this Slaughter means 100 150 new civilians Palestinians killed people are in the northern part of Gaza STP are dying because of starvation we know exactly what does it mean our families are still there in the Gaza City and in the northern part of the Gaz STP but at the same time this flexibility cannot be at the cost of our main and strategic goals for example we are looking not for a a human Arian pose or a humanitarian ceas we are looking for a final total comprehensive ceire we are looking for a total withdrawal of the Israeli Army Israeli forces from the Gaza STP we are looking for allowing all Palestinians fre to move from the south to the north and vice versa we cannot accept keeping our people 1.5 million Palestinians in the southern part of Gaz kept hostages under the Israeli uh policy or Within part of the Israeli internal political games between the right and the left therefore this is the Baseline where we can build on when it comes to the SE to the prisoner deal or to the rebuilding plans yes there is uh space for flexibility about the numbers and about the phases phase one phase two uh about how big how huge the operation of re buildings or R resuscitating of the people in G how can we do it but when it comes to the ceas final and total declared ceas when it comes to Total withdrawal and when it comes to the allowing the people uh Palestinians from the south to the north to move freely without any uh break conditions I think this is the red line where we we we cannot cross you mentioned the rebuilding process and I want to ask you about the future of Gaza particularly at the point at which this kind this war eventually does end I understand that Hamas and fata officials are currently in Moscow for talks part of that I believe is a pro to try to find some sort of process of moving forward some sort of governing process for Gaza what would Hamas hope to achieve out of those talks given that so far there is a lot of international pressure to have Hamas not involved in any future for Gaza first of all I have to reassure everyone that Hamas is not looking or or or putting a condition to be part or not to be part we this is not the main question the main question that we have always worked hardly and we have shown a lot of flexibility uh to reach Palestinian unity and Palestinian reconciliation if the Palestinian division before October 7th was a choice I think after October 7th it is not a choice we it is a month to reach unity and flexibility it is very harmful for our future goals as Palestinian to get rid of the occupation to achieve our political goals of an independent state to achieve Unity therefore we have proposed a Unity government or a consensus government or a technocrat government uh it should not be that Hamas part of that uh the main thing is that this government is acceptable from all Palestinians representing all Palestinians acceptable from the International Community and can perform the Tas which mean the rebuilding process which mean the reunification of the institutions between Gaza and R and preparing for comprehensive elections at political elections at all levels I mean the national elections the presidential elections and the PC election therefore we hope that MOS talks can uh push this uh these goals a step forward you mentioned the level of Devastation that has happened in Gaza since October the 7th and of course the numbers who have died as a result of the Israeli action with all that has happened to Palestinians since October the 7th and the Hamas L incursion into Southern Israel how much Palestinian support can Hamas rely on particularly in Gaza and the West Bank I think Hamas in October 7th have behaved and acted in accordance with our national goals of resisting the occupation looking how can we get rid of this occupation how how can we break this 17 years old suffocating Siege how can we get our uh independent sovereign state and how how can we guarantee the right of return for Palestinians who has been displaced for years uh portally uh but at the same time what we are looking for after this aggression uh we are ready to uh to participate in a comprehensive process to run or to organize a democratic transparent free election and the Palestinians have all the right to choose their leadership to choose to choose their political track and I think that all the polls have been B by done by neutral independent bodies after October 7th including the the poll done by Dr KH shaki 100 day after October 7th have shown that 90% of the Palestinians are supporting the resistance are supporting the act of of October 7th and looking for serious steps to to reach their final National goals of self sovereignity and independent state but at the end again it is not the the question of Hamas in the government or not the question is how can our people achieve their main National goals b i name Hama head of political and international relations we appreciate it thank you very much indeed please
