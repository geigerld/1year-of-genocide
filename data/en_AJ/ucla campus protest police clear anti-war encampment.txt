has gone 13 GMT that's 6:00 a.m. in Los Angeles where Riot police have been clearing a peaceful protest at the University of California it was one of the largest police raids on student protesters since Nationwide demonstrations and solidarity with Gaza broke out well after a standoff that lasted hours police fired stun grenades to push a protest barricade back reinforcements were brought in to surround the demonstrators and arrests were made but a few students remain defiant with a call for peace in Gaza we've got a team of correspondents covering the protests in the US Kristen salumi standing by at New York University for us shihab bansi is going to have the latest from George Washington University in the US capital first we're going to head to Phil lavel who's joining us from Los Angeles Phil talk us through what's been happening over the last several hours well you know Dawn is Breaking now Rob and it's signaling an end to this protest we think they've pretty much taken every last protester out now a few minutes ago there was a line of police taking the protesters out here they were leading them out fairly peacefully it has to be said I think the protesters here realized that they' gone as far as they could for this particular protest uh they weren't not really putting up too much resistance and you know there were a few that left voluntarily but we heard the police officers say they're not going to come out voluntarily we've got to go in and then they brought them out so now we're going through the process where the police are walking through through this encampment remember for days this has been a solid very dense area with tents packed right next to each other now the police are going through and they're dismantling the tents there is Davy everywhere I mean there are signs that people have been living here for a week and you can see on the floor some of the things that these people have been living off and you know we've got gaffa tape where people have been um having to tie things together and you know what was interesting about the protesters as we saw them coming out was they were all or the majority of them were wearing gas masks that is because uh obviously they were worried that there was going to be tear gas involved obviously we had that violence the other day in fact there's a a fire extinguisher over here presumably not necessarily just a fight in fact we just had another flashbang which suggests that maybe they may still be trying to disperse some protesters although I'm not sure where they would be uh particularly because this area is now all clear perhaps set off accidentally if we head over here we're going to take you just slightly outside the encampment this railing here that we're walking towards this is where so we're we're inside where the encampment was this was until a few hours ago boarded up with fences and blocks of wood and crates to stop police getting in but also to stop uh any counter protest getting in because remember we saw that violence uh on Tuesday night where those pro- Israeli supporters turned up and tried to attack those protesters we're just going to walk over here cuz this is where a number of the protesters have been taken they've been lined up by officers and they're wearing zip ties and you can hear them I'll just I'll just be quiet for a second you can hear them still chanting to find to the end [Music] listen okay we've just been told by the police that we have to move back up folks come on right there so we have to we have to walk around this way but we'll try to stay as close as we can so you can see here we've got these huge buses that are lined up this is the county of Los Angeles sheriff's department and we have these massive buses which are going to be used to process these students Phil we can hear the determination obviously in the the voices of the protest is still chanting there but is this it for the protest at UCLA or is there a plan to keep some sort of protest going let's check is this the end of the protest as you can see we're asking them uh we're not getting many answers you know there has been uh I've been to several of these campuses Rob over the last week or so and in a lot of them there is a lot of Suspicion towards the media particularly here at UCLA um I know that there been there's been a lot of resistance to speak to the media uh directly let me try once more is this the end of the protest the end of protest is this the end of the protest is this the end of the protest no not at all will you be back I'm not saying I'm going to be back but there will be be people be back people will be back it's not the end it's not going to be the end until the genocide ends in the funding for the genocide ends the billions of dollars spent what would you say to UCLA after all of this it's disappointing very disappointing gentle okay we're being asked to move by the by the sheriff department yep yes sir we're moving okay y we're moving so the sheriff's department are over there as you can see they've got the buses lined up and we're being led Away by the sheriffs at the moment so we have to move um this screen here which you can see as we walk past here this was a massive display that was set up by those pro-israeli supporters this has been playing and you can see the speakers next to it has been playing images of October the 7th for several days day and night particularly I'm told at night loudly uh as as a counter protest obviously now it is uh it is no longer active but uh y as we can see these protesters are now basically waiting they're lining up waiting to be booked uh and they will line up on those on those huge buses there were seven or eight of those from the sheriff's department lined up plus a whole lot more on a federal site further away and uh they will be taken to be processed whether they'll be charged with misdemeanors uh or whether they will be released we will we'll wait to see and whether they will be back again because you know as we've seen with a lot of these protests they are closed down but then they come back they might not be in an encampment here but they will be back and in the distance you may be able to hear I'm not sure because it's quite faint there is a load of other protesters who come up to show some solidarity Rob Phil thanks very much indeed I want to say thank you to you and your team for giving us that tour of the the uh former campsite there and also being able to talk to one of those protesters who's being arrested Phil thank you very much indeed and I'm joined Now by Lo from Los Angeles by Lauren Victoria re she's a community activist and she's supporting the students I understand you were attending the protests but you left let me ask you first of all what was the motivation for being part of the protests in the first place um so just real quick I know the gentleman that just spoke he said that we don't trust media and I do not represent uh the students that organize the event I do not represent UCLA in any way whatsoever so I just want to get that out there um my main reason was there is no way I don't believe that you can see the Carnage see the genocide see the the trauma that we're witnessing understand that our tax money is paying for it and not need to go to these events these events are are so important and they're so vital and they've been vital to every single Community movement that's ever existed because something clicked something clicked for us um second third week of October when we realized exactly how complacent we've been how complacent the the way our our system is run has forced us to be they've hid they've shrouded us from the rest of the world as this beautiful American patriotic thing and now we're finding out and I'll say we're finding I'm finding out that not only have we facilitated the genocide of the indigenous people that lived here on this land we've actually facilitated the genocide of so many people so many people around the globe I apologize that's my grandmother in the back we've facilitated the death and we have funded the death of so many innocent people in the world and that was our Mo that's part of the motivation part of the motivation for getting out there let me ask you the people that you've been talking to over the last several weeks uh or perhaps since October the 7th when the the this part of the War Began who are the people that you're talking to how wide is the the collection of people what are the differences amongst the people that you've been talking to who share this common goal of stopping the war in Gaza but may come from um desperate cult Cal backgrounds or religious backgrounds every culture Creed gender sexuality religion every single person is represented at these at these marches at these meetings at these encampments every single person from every corner of the globe has found themselves to resonate with their story resonates with the Palestinians I'm indigenous to um the New Mexico area my family is from that area originally and I as an indigenous woman I didn't understand my own story my own trauma my own pain until I met Palestinian women who had experienced the same things their children were taken from them they were subjected to horrible mistreatment in their own land and I didn't realize how similar our stories are and I think that is specifically part of the tactic of how America is run if they keep us separated if they keep us divided we can never unite and realize that at the end of the day we all have the same enemy and the enemy is global Supremacy white supremacy and frankly capitalism it's all of these things make protests encampments like this inevitable you have ra we've they've raised a generation who is so desensitized to unnecessary suffering between all of like the students that are protesting right now they're calling them the Sandy generation why are they calling them that because they have they liveed through Sandy Hook and not only that they witnessed the years after Sandy Hook where their government made choices against their safety every single day every single day for their entire adolescence their government was actively working against them on one side and then promising them freedom and Justice on the other so it's it everyone everyone you can imagine was there I have met some of the most amazing human beings from all walks of life and we all find ourselves there because it's not that we're angry to be there it's that we have fallen so in love with Palestine and Palestinians it's inevitable Lauren thank you very much indeed Lauren Victoria I should just explain that Lauren was referring to the Sandy Hook shootings at the elementary school of s Sandy Hook in which children were killed Lauren thank you very much indeed Kristen salumi is joining us now from New York University in New York so bring us up to date with what's been happening there well frankly it's more of the same pattern that we've seen in recent days uh police move in and make arrests uh they clear encampments and then the protesters pop up someplace else I'm at New York University uh where that happened on April 22nd there was an encampment in place and the university called in police and arrested uh 128 people including 19 faculty members and then days later the encampment behind me was set up and here at NYU is where uh Park in a park nearby is where a lot of the demonstrators have been coming and rallying including late last night uh so let me bring you up to speed on that uh yesterday after as nearly 300 Columbia and city college students were being processed uh for their arrest a new encampment had sprung up at forom University in the middle of the city there there were about a dozen tents in a building it was a smaller protest the protesters said they were doing it uh out of inspiration from the Colombia situation uh about 15 students were arrested there police called in moved out that encampment now we're hearing about Stonybrook New York another school where students have set up tents as well uh and the the demonstrations just continue uh yesterday when the students were being processed at Police Headquarters a rally uh happened around the courthouse there and the students who were supporting the students that were arrested from other schools many of them went to that location and then then marched here to NYU uh in a park nearby there were hundreds if not thousands blocking traffic throughout the street so what we are seeing this morning is the quiet aftermath um this has been the pattern the demonstrators stay out late the police are uh called out late in force uh patrolling the streets trying to keep the streets clear and then the students Retreat to their camps and regroup and start up again in the afternoon just talk us through if we know what's been happening to those arrested and what's next for them but there's been a lot of questions about what charges if any are likely to be brought against these young people yeah absolutely and in fact I was speaking to the New York Police Department this morning trying to get a breakdown of the arrest what they're being charged with how many of them are actually students uh given that the mayor of the city Eric Adams has implied that outside agitators are are behind most of these demonstrations uh and they don't have those numbers yet frankly and they could not give me that breakdown we know that just under 300 were arrested as I said from Columbia and City College with another uh 15 or so at forom yesterday the charges the process is that they have to be arraigned they're treated like any other criminal they go in they have their fingerprints taken their mug shots taken uh most are released with the summons to appear in court at a later date What charges they face it could range from Criminal trespassing to disorderly conduct to more serious charges in the case of those who uh breached campus property broke into that building on Columbia University uh but the breakdown as I say has not been shared publicly just yet uh these students many of them will have to appear in court uh it's not likely that they would face jail time but they do have the threat of a criminal record hanging over their head as well as in most cases suspension from their universities uh if not permanent expulsion it's Christ salomi at New York University Kristen thank you we're going to head to the US capital and shik habitan is there George Washington University so been watching these very strong pictures coming out of UCLA what's the mood where you are it's all quiet here and it remains quiet and you get the sense actually after several Republican members of Cong Congress came here yesterday and threatened the mayor unless she clears out the encampment that perhaps unwittingly that means that the mayor can't really act CU it looked like she's acting under durest but we are all watching what's happening at other encampments let's get the reaction Sarah is with me so we have UCLA moving in firing rubber coated steel bullets at unarmed protesters once again unwittingly or wittingly perhaps given that they're often trained by the Israelis in their exchange programs very similar to how the Israelis Street unarmed protesters but what's your reaction when you see all these pictures it's honestly disgusting and it's reprehensible that you know the university in Tandem and in partnership with these police forces would resort to violence instead of listening to the demands of the students instead of actually acknowledging their um very very realistic calls for the universities to divest from companies that are complicit in the occupation of Palestine to disclose what companies are invested in um especially looking at UCLA it's a public school but a lot of times these Public Schools will hide their Investments by going through a private company um and then also just you know the call to protect anti-zionist voices the fact that these universities and these police departments are putting zionists over the own people that they're supposed to protect is disgusting and the fact that they're putting the interest of a foreign entity over their own constituents and their own citizens is reprehensible La staunchly you know Democratic party uh Democratic party mainstate liberals they're the ones calling in the cops cops there then you have the Republic members of Congress who were here yesterday calling you anti-sites and calling for you to be thrown out you have Joe Biden and the White House still seeming to like incite violence against you by calling you anti-semitic it's an election year so what do you do I mean and the opinion polls show a majority of Americans are with you where's where's where's your Democratic Outlet then in an election year de you know as as a US democracy I think um a lot of people have become disillusioned with the election process especially within the past four years um when Joe Biden ran four years ago you know promising all these um big things that he never deler delivered on and that he doesn't even he never planned to like cancelling student loan debt so I believe a lot of people no longer believe in the Democratic process that's currently in place and they believe in um having to do other actions in order to get their representatives to hear them there have been for the last six almost 7 months people calling their Congressional Representatives every single day people writing letters um and it's fallen on deaf ears it's they're being completely ignored and the fact that you know this is still continuing they're still continuing to send billions of dollars to is is for um weapons deals for military aid is extremely extremely disgusting they're putting again the interest of a foreign power over the interest of their own people when they want this money to stay in America and go towards housing go towards food and go towards uh Healthcare but the argument as as as summarized on social media yesterday was yes but you know this may look fascist but imagine how much more fascy it would look under Donald Trump and that's the choice you have I mean is is that a winning argument for the Democrats do you think I think that's a very very weak argument if for your candidate you are expecting people to be scared of someone else when none of the policies under Trump have been reversed when the infrastructure in this country has collapsed when people are like when um interest has increased so much when PE when uh people have been going after layoff through layoff and layoff since Biden's election so I don't think it's enough and I think a lot of people are trying to recognize that you know the two parties are one and they have to resort to encampments to have their their wants heard and for them to be to feel that they're being represented um you know especially after over 40,000 have been martyred in Palestine um there's been 76 years of occupation there's been a 17e on Gazza and the Zionist regime continues to arrest Palestinians through this administrative detention which is basically you know detention without any trial without any um charge um it's really really disgusting so there is a it's two sides of the same coin there is no one is better than the other both should not even be considered to be president Sarah thank you very very much and you know as I think Phil was was alluding to once again I mean we see these crackdowns but that just seems to fire up the the demonstrators and the protesters even more actually I have to say there are even more Tents today every day we've come here there have been more and more tents that are springing up here J thanks very much indeed shabi George Washington University in Washington DC make sure to
