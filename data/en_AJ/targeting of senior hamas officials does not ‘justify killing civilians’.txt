returned to Hassan barari he's a professor of international Affairs at Qatar University he in the Jordanian Capital Aman uh Hassan as you may have heard there multiple reports um most of them coming of course from Israel specifically um an Israeli Army Radio reporter claiming that the the Hamas military Chief Muhammad de de was the intended target of these strikes of course what we do know for certain is that the consequences are devast stating for civilians in that particular part of western Rafa your thoughts on what we're hearing from Israel this a question to me yes that's to you Hass there was a little disconnect so sorry yeah no sure what let me let me repeat that Hass what what I was saying is I'm Sor what I was saying is that we there are reports coming from Israel specifically from an Israeli Army radio reporter claiming that the intended target of these multiple Israeli air strikes was the Hamas military Chief Muhammad div we have no um way of independently verifying that of course but what we can clearly see on our screens is how devastating these air strikes have been for the many civilians crowded there in alasi yeah you you're right you know I know Muhammad is a big Target for the Israelis they've been trying to kill him for like ages uh so there were there were several attempts in his life but they all failed uh we know the importance of Muhammad as a leader but uh the question here is this justifiable to kill like 50 people simply because you want to kill a military leader uh where is the humanitarian aspect of it how the International Community going to respond to that uh because this is one more time he was targeted in an area that was designated by Israel itself to be safe one for a safe zone for the Palestinians uh you know even including the the Hamas people they can go in and out in this area because it was designated as as a safe but I think the Israelis have been using this as a trap for the Palestinians now in order to identify the and track down all the Hamas leaders and try to kill them if the if the price is killing hundreds of Palestinians they don't care uh we've seen this before we've seen this movie before the Israelis have been committing a lot of atrocities uh since 2002 they killed Shah Shada and they killed 16 people and this is this is collateral damage so one more time the Israelis have they're very uh insensitive when it comes to the to the Palestinian civilian and innocent people uh Hassan also we know according to what we've heard from sources in the United States that previously us intelligence has been involved in at least trying to help the Israeli military locate the leader of Hamas in Gaza Yaya Sina it does beg the question whether or not any kind of us intelligence may have helped support these apparent strikes looking for Muhammad Dev now we all we know is that there's an American unit working for the with the Israelis and to provide them with intelligence I I can't really claim that Americans are involved in this in this incident but I don't all this out uh so the Americans have been providing them with a lot of information a lot of intelligence and also the Israelis have been trying uh uh by using different means uh to track down Hamas leaders and and high ranking military leaders in order to kill them and this helped Netanyahu in in Israel to be seen as a Victorious uh leader uh because as we know majority of Israel see him as someone who does not fit the bill of leadership so he wants to send him a message that he's a strong man he then he can even kill the uh top military uh leaders in Hamas uh so from the Israeli side you know they they want this to happen now the question can they sell this to the world uh can they tell the world that you know Muhammad is you know quote unquote is terrorist and for this reason it's okay to kill the civilians I think they going to have up uphill battles to convince the International Community and I think that there will be an outcry at the at the global level against this atrocity that is totally unjustified and as you suggest there I mean in the past uh Israel has struggled to provide the world with evidence of claims I'm talking about the likes of the AL AXA hospital being used as a major Command Center for Hamas I mean the list goes on it does beg the question whether they will be able to provide any potential evidence of these claims that we're hearing well um this is a very important point I think the Israelis will definitely fail to provide any evidence any sort of evidence and but the question here they don't care you know we we have to see this we have to look at the Israeli attitude in in this war as someone who is really deaf to what the word is saying all all their interest lies in America as long as America support Israel the Israelis will believe it's okay uh for them because there's no price tag there's no clear price act on the Israeli atrocities against the Palestinian H and and this genocidal War has has been on for nine months and we can't see really International stand against it I mean there are some uh we can't we can't talk about the Civil Society at the inter International level the global South Etc we can see even some Western Capital voicing their critique against Israel but Israel is is is not punished by by what uh by it its its Deeds in Gaza Hassan badi thank you so much for your analysis for now as we continue with our extended coverage of this developing story from Gaza if you are joining us here on Al jazer we have been reporting on some breaking news from Gaza where Israeli air strikes have killed at least 50 people in the al- maasi area that's west of can yunas medical sources have told Al jazer that dozens are injured Israeli war
