well Israel's war has taken an unprecedented toll on gaza's entire population the United Nations says 1.9 million Palestinians that's more than 85% of gaza's population have now been uprooted from their homes tens of thousands of people pushed to Rafa in the South which has become the most densely populated area in Gaza there is little food and no sanitation the UN says around 2.2 million people nearly the entire population of Gaza need food food Aid to survive there's a shortage of f Fuel and clean drinking water desalination plants have shut down because they don't have fuel to operate and the World Health Organization is worried about the outbreak of disease doctors are recording thousands of cases of diarrhea among children as well as cases of he hepatitis A menitis chickenpox jordis and respiratory illnesses but only 11 out of gaza's 36 hospitals are functioning but only partially and they are struggling to treat the tens of thousands of injured Palestinians omana spolarich is the president of the international Committee of the Red Cross he joins me now from Geneva thanks very much for being with us so um we just gave a a summary there of just how acute the situation is uh for people um in Gaza and it's it's a whole list of things as as we uh mentioned there it's it's the lack of food lack of Sanitation and perhaps the most pressing uh problem right now the one that's that's been growing more most recently is the the breakout of disease good afternoon I've just returned from Israel and the West Bank and visited Gaza before that I can confirm that in Gaza this humanitarian situation is untenable there's a lack of everything there's a lack of of operational space for the humanitarian actors but most importantly there's an acute lack of Safety and Security for the people anywhere in Gaza uh so just talk to us a little bit more about the work that your that your organization is doing or trying to do given the conditions uh right now as far as uh getting getting the aid uh to people uh in Gaza is is some Aid getting in some Aid is getting in there's a number of trucks coming in but this is by far not enough given the suffering and the level of the needs of the people we are focusing our operations on on the hospitals on providing medical assistance as much as we can including through Medical Teams surgeons that are there operating Around the Clock what I saw in the hospital that I visited was a total exhaustion a density um because people are seeking refuge in these hospitals but what I also saw is a lack of medication a lack of electricity a lack of water that is necessary for the hospitals to run um but most importantly uh decreasing surgical capability given the high number of casualties and wounded people this is a serious problem that we are facing at the moment and we still have great difficulties in moving around in bringing more material and also in rotating our staff and Medical Teams indeed and we got a sense of just how desperate the situation uh is there uh for people with the the pictures of the the a truck coming in and and people descending uh on those trucks to to get whatever they could water Provisions anything they could get their hands on you you get the sense uh as well that there there's kind of been a a complete breakdown in order there what I can see is that there's no adequate humanitarian response possible under current circumstances there has to be a serious deescalation under the current level of hostilities and operations ongoing we will not be able to provide adequate humanitarian assistance none of us none of the humanitarian access actors there's no protection there's no safe spaces for people who have been displaced multiple times and with winter coming very fast this is going to be an acute problem we have to resume the provision of critical Services notably electricity and water we are asking for our repair teams to be allowed in the ICC has the capability of working with the local actors to at least repair what is POS possible to be repaired to be able to improve the access to water the access to essential needs good to talk to you thanks very much for being with us thank you
