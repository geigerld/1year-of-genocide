the US Secretary of State is in Tel Aviv where he's expected to discuss the terms of that potential Israel Hamas deal he's just been in Doha where the Prime Minister said Hamas has given a positive response to the proposal okay well let's look into uh this proposal in more detail now with Hussein haridi who joins us from Cairo so he's the former Egyptian assistant foreign minister and field artillery officer in the October 1973 War thank you for your time for joining us here on aler so so from everything you've seen and heard so far around this proposed framework how confident are you that we're moving towards something resembling a lasting agreement well um maybe it's a bit early to uh expect a final agreement uh soon uh the United States Secret State Mr Anthony blinkin is is Israel today holding talks with the uh Israeli Prime Minister with the Israeli president and maybe with the members of the military cabinet in in Israel in order to discuss the uh proposal by uh Hamas that was handed in yesterday to the CES and the Egyptians uh the uh as you said the initial C reaction to the Hamas proposal was was was was positive to a certain extent and I I believe that secretary blinkin would would would would try to work something out today with the Israelis uh let's hope that after uh the talks in Israel are over something more concrete would come out and we can we can that would enable us to see more clearly ahead but definitely uh something certain now that the United States Administration is Keen for humanitarian Po in in Gaza as soon as possible right so so in your view there is a degree of momentum but we need to to wait and see how Israel obviously comes back on this let's talk about the negotiation process if we may because that's been done as you say through mediators Egypt Qatar and the US in the absence of facetoface talks between Hass Representatives and Israeli Representatives how effective a process do you think this has been given that of course it's taken a week from the Paris talks to reach this point well concerning the the last point that you you have rer uh the the the explanation is that uh once the Hamas political leadership the political Bureau of Hamas received the uh proposal uh the draft proposal uh that came out of the uh meeting between the CIA director the director of the Egyptian intelligence the mosad director and the K prime minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs in Europe two weeks ago the explanation is that the Hamas political Bureau had of course to uh forward the the draft proposal to What's called the military uh commanders of Hamas in the field uh that is to say in Gaza and to coordinate with other Palestinian Palestinian resistance movements namely Al Jihad Islamic Jihad so it took it took some time and this is why why why why the the reply by Hamas people almost took one week but having said that having said that I guess uh this is the uh the we have succeeded last November in negotiating a POS in the fight in in Gaza that lasted one week and I guess the the same mechanism would would prove so it's so it's a mechanism it's a mechanism that has proven to have worked in the past the assumption is that it can potentially work again regarding the deal itself it envisages three phrases 45 days each what are the benefits of this phase framework well so so far we have the Hamas proposal uh so I'll discuss it I'll answer your question in this context um Hamas in its counter proposal came came up with is maximalist position uh we we are waiting for the Israel reply to the Hamas counter proposal but I I presume that the Israelis would try to water down uh some some uh elements in the Hamas counter proposal H we don't expect we don't expect that Israel would say yes to everything that uh we have let me let me let me underline here that uh we don't have an official copy of the Hamas counter proposal but according to press reports we have an idea uh we have details of of of of this counter proposal so I don't expect that the Israelis will say yes to every element that according to press report today uh elements that were contained in the uh the Hamas reply so u i I believe that uh we we we at the end of the day we can we we can but the the negotiators the mediators can reach a compromise a compromise deal all right but as you suggest a degree of push back is almost inevitable when it comes to negotiations on this level Hussein haridi former Egyptian assistant foreign minister and field artillery officer many thanks for your time for joining us on aler thank you it's my pleasure sir
