Gaza where the Israeli military continues to move its forces further into the Central and western parts of Rafa after plunging the city into total darkness overnight Israeli forces have seized more of that border area there with Egypt known as the Philadelphia Corridor now that area is about 14 km in length it's meant to be a demilitarized buffer zone running along the Gaza Egypt border this all comes as Israeli strikes targeted various areas in Rafa overnight as well as in the early hours of Wednesday nearly all the hospitals there are now out of service let's get the latest from the ground and speak to Honey Mahmud he joins me now from darl Bala in central Gaza honey as we've been reporting more Israeli movements in and around Rafa in the last day or so talk us through exactly what you're hearing yes well for the past 20 days the Israeli military has been pushing its occupying forces at the center of rafah City all the way to the western part that's the EV evacuation Zone where literally we're looking at thousand of displaced Palestinians who have nowhere else to go we're looking at there's no safe zone no safe place to go to but also there's no esape away from the genocidal acts taking place in Rafa City right now particularly the past three days have been quite difficult we're seeing an exponential increase and surge in the attacks that are carried out by the Israeli military supported by the occupying forces that are now the their artillery Shilling and the tank sh are reaching as far as the vicinity of the Kuwaiti hospital that's at the center of the city and also along the remaining part of the Philadelphia Corridor to the southern part of the strip between the rafah and Egypt uh borders and what seems to be the Israeli military is pushing deeper and soon enough uh from the judging from the patterns of the attacks and the bombing soon enough this operation is not going to be limited is in fact quite unlimited right now and we are days away from the Israeli military taking over the entire uh city of raah and of course that has a a negative implications on the ground not only we've been seeing this a rapid Mass killing of civilians inside evacuation Zone like the past two days where an attack on the Northern Western uh part of the city at least 45 people were killed including children and women the scenes of the decapitated children and the uh the the shredded babies as well inside the tents and the women who were taken into hospitals in the area also within the past 12 hours another attack very close to the EV the first one also it's a 10th site where 21 people were also killed and if we look at the same exact pattern of casualties women and children making the vast majority of casualties of these deliberate attacks on areas that have been designated as safe Zone by the Israeli militaries people in the area are living with shattered sense of Safety and Security right now they're pushed into further enforce displacement not only to uh the evacuation Zone but elsewhere in the western KH units the remaining part of Amasi as well as the central area that is becoming overcrowded right now Hy as you say so many of these attacks are taking place in areas that people were told were safe so what is the situation right now for civilians particularly in the South given that all the hospitals are now closed quite dire situation created by this intense bombing campaign we're in fact looking at an an a crisis that is above emergency not only people are being herded from one place to another by the quadcopters by the intense bombing campaign moved into areas that are supposed to be safe but they're not safe but the infrastructure the facilities that are supposed to be there to support people people are pushed to the point of of offering no Services whatsoever and by that I mean the health facilities that are quite vital right now at these difficult conditions the vast majority of these Hospital nearly all of them with the exception of one maternity health facility a small one in western part of RA City and soon enough given the insufficient medical staff as well as the shortage of medical supplies this maternity health facility is going to close down all the field hospitals were forced to shut down and and and shut services and moved all the way to Khan Unis in in different locations they were forced to relocate and start field hospitals in different places the two uh official public Hospital the kuti hospital and the Nar hospital they were forced to be out of service given the intensity of the the bombing campaign and the the all of their almost the their their vehicle the ambulance the the the inability to get medical supply to these facilities uh it become un safe situations for everyone including the injuries and the patients inside these two facilities are forced to relocate uh elsewhere in western part of kanun city and again we're looking at the maasi evacuation Zone and it's not it hasn't been largely safe we seen the patterns of attacks on these zones and which confirm quite consistent with what people have described that there is no safe Zone in a war zone Hy
