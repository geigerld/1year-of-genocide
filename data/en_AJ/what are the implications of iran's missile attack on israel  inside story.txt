for the first time ever a direct Iranian attack on Israel a barrage of drones and nissar fired in retaliation for a strike on the Iranian Consulate in Syria most were shot down but the world watches with deepening concern who'll be saying what to whom to try and bring calm this is Inside Story hello there I'm James Bay Iran warned it would attack Israel in reprisal for the bombing of its Consulate in Syria and 13 days later it did a huge wave of weapons launched most shot down by Israel's air defense systems with limited damage or casualties we're told perhaps as some analysts have said it's a kind of high stake sparring with Iran choosing not to unleash much greater Firepower it has in its Arsenal a choreographed display to flex Iranian military muscle against its Arch Enemy maybe as much for domestic consumption as to send a message to Tel Aviv however the Diplomatic reverberations being felt far and wide with fears about what might happen next so how serious is the risk of wider conflict and what's being done to prevent that and is the US President Joe Biden the only person who can now reign in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu we'll be exploring what might happen next with our panel of guests in a few moments but first this report from Lena Abu akle the shock waves from Iran's attack are reverberating worldwide with many political leaders alarmed by The Barrage of drones and [Music] missiles it's the first time Iranian weapons have directly targeted Israel from Iran Israel said air defense systems intercepted most of them tahran had vowed Revenge after revolutionary guard commanders were killed in the bombing of the Iranian Consulate in Syria two weeks ago the missile barrage increases International worries of sparking a wider regional conflict but Iranian military leaders sought to draw a line under the latest hostilities we see this operation has completed and successful and there is no intention to continue it and it's over from our perspective but if the Zionist regime does anything against us either inside our soil or anywhere in Syria or other countries our next operation will be much bigger if the US gets involved in any action against us none of its bases will remain safe in the region but words from the top in Israel will do little to ease fears of more conflict to come this campaign is not over yet we need to remain prepared and attentive to the the idf's and Home Front commands instructions and to prepare for any scenario at the same time we blocked the first wave of attacks and we did it with great success US President Joe Biden has again vowed to defend Israel but wants to avoid open conflict with Iran since Israel genocidal war in Gaza began in October killing and wounding more than 100,000 Palestinians fears have grown that the violence could explode into to a wider War International diplomats are working frantically to avoid further military action that could have devastating Regional and Global consequences lenina abak Al jazer for Inside Story well we're going to define the significance of this escalation in the Iran Israel conflict with our panel today in tran Muhammad Mandi is a professor at the University of Iran and he's advised the Iranian negotiating team at International nuclear talks in London Yosi meckelberg is an associate fellow at the British Think Tank chattam house and in Washington D.C Akbar Shahed Ahmed is senior diplomatic correspondent at HuffPost he's covered US foreign policy since the Obama Administration thank you all three of you for joining us today Muhammad let me start with you we have had literally Decades of hostility and proxy attack between Israel and Iran but what has changed in recent hours would you say that Israel and Iran are now at War well first of all the strikes last night against Israeli regime were very devastating the Iranians severely damaged two military bases and uh the propaganda that we're seeing 24 hours a day literally now in the western media about how little damage was caused is is absolute nonsense the Iranians sent many very cheap drones and old missiles as decoys maybe a couple of million dollars and the Israelis spent $ 1.3 billion dollar to down them and then the main missiles all got through and struck the military bases and if the Israelis are so confident about themselves then I guess today they can take International reporters to see the base the two bases for them El but beyond that we have to remember that Iran has shown strategic patience for years and the Israelis carried out assassinations in Iran years p and sabotage when that failed they started to assassinate Iranian officers in Syria who were fighting Isis and Al-Qaeda and their Affiliates who were being supported by the Israelis among others alongside the Golan Heights and uh and during the last 6 months when Iran has uh been supporting Gaza and the resistance and uh been opposing the genocide the israelies murdered a number of officers of Iran and Syria and Iran did not retaliate at least directly because Iran wanted to keep the focus uh in the past on the fight against Isis and Al-Qaeda and now the focus on Gaza because the Americans want the Americans and the Israelis and the West want to change the narrative but since the Israeli regime struck the Iranian Embassy and the US Britain and France and un Security Council refused not only to punish the Israeli regime but to condemn it Iranians were obviously forced to punish the regime and this has changed the equation this is the big change okay now let me bring in let me bring let me bring in Yosi and ask how it's changed the equation people have talked about this for a long time as a shadow war is it now a hot War yeah it's it's was a direct attack let me start what I actually agree with the previous speaker is that Iran showed strategic patience for for many years and that's you know fighting through proxies actually serves the the the Iranian regime but it definitely didn't serve it last night and I don't know where where this information about hitting our 90 90% of the around 350 drones missile cruise missile ballistic missiles were intercepted and probably didn't cause much much much damage sadly it's injured badly one young girl and I think in this sense the question is what happens next but it set it changed the the the parameters of this conflict from a shadow War for what Israel calls war between Wars in into a direct one now Iran says on the one hand this is a close chapter we want to move on from there Israel said it would retaliate I think in this sense it's better for Israel not to retaliate yet because what happened yesterday after Israel actually experienced months of and months of criticism from its closest allies for the way it conducts the war and unacceptable way it conducts the war in Gaza actually Iran and tan managed yesterday to unite the United States as some countries in the region Europe in defending in Israel so I'm not so sure in in what sense this was a strategic success for uh for for Iran but at the same time there are pressures within the Israeli government within the to to retaliate but as as as it stands and as you alluded earlier the the cards are with President Biden to ensure that there is no further escalation abbar how worried are they in DC because of course there's a nuclear Dimension to this Israel doesn't talk about it but we all know it's a nuclear power Iran has a nuclear program and most experts say if they they wanted to develop a nuclear device the breakout time is just a matter of days now absolutely that's a huge fear um and I think that's an awareness for the Biden Administration in particular which did not pursue right the Obama era nuclear deal that PR Donald Trump torpedoed the Biden Administration knows that their choices have brought Iran much closer to nuclear capacity than you know ever before and they know Israel right now has a huge incentive to begin a big war I think for us officials what they're thinking right now is how do we get Israel to as Yosi said see it as logical and beneficial to not escalate however what we know from six months of this conflict now in Gaza is that this government in Israel in particular is not being driven so much by necessarily rationality strategy achieving its actual War aims it's being driven really by the political calculation of Prim Minister Netanyahu and importantly those around him seeking to succeed him right so you showed a clip of Y Galan the defense minister very much seen as someone trying to out Haw Netanyahu right you've now seen Benny Gans the the the kind of DC preferred alternative to Netanyahu also come out and say we want to hit Iran hard now what that means for the US is even if they're in a scenario where the Biden Administration can avoid an Israeli as escalation against Iran I think that they then feel they lose political Capital to stop Israel from doing other things they don't want Israel to do so that means the operation in Raa in Gaza which the US is extremely worried about what that would look like and what that would mean for Palestinians for international opinion against Israel that also means Lebanon right that's a place where Israel could say okay if you're not going to let us hit back at Iran in some huge traumatic way we have been kind of chomping at the bit to going into Lebanon I think there's a real fear Among Us officials that the leverage to stop either Rafa or Lebanon is now quite low on the US side especially because President Biden chose in this moment to revert to what's called his bead strategy with Israel so demonstrating overwhelming military diplomatic rhetorical support for Israel in a bid to kind of gain American influence that hasn't worked in Gaza so I don't know if it'll work for the Americans going forward looking at the scale of the attacks Muhammad um you are telling us things that are not what we are hearing from the Americans and the Israelis you say that two uh bases uh were hit and severely hit we've got no pictures of that we've got no reporters to go to the scene and yet the narrative that's coming out from the US side let me quote you uh the National Security Council spokesman of the US Admiral John Kirby an incredible military achievement by Israel is is just an extraordinary example of mil military superiority what do you say to that and you know isn't isn't this damaging for Israel's as for Iran's military reputation uh in the region and and damaging for domestically for Iran are these the same Americans who are saying we have no evidence of genocide in Gaza or are these the same Americans who are saying that our intelligence says that they were tunnel under ala hospital or that the uh that the uh resistance they would they bomb their own hospitals I think that's the same intelligence agency so I wouldn't to take it too seriously in just you made some specific claims which I haven't seen elsewhere before this program certainly the Israelis are saying that a base called neim uh which is in the south of Israel in the desert that that suffered some minor damage just just to be clear for us where is the other base uh that Iran says it's sely damaged first of all uh it's very surprising that in this base in southern Israel uh only a small little girl was severely wounded I wonder what she was doing there but uh I I think it's all you have to do is ask the Israelis to let you see the base and take a comprehensive tour of the base and I'm sure all is well but if really indeed the isra regime was successful then why are the Americans so worried about the uh expansion of the conflict okay muhamad sorry to interrup mammed but just to be clear just to be clear because you made an allegation about two bases can you name the other base for us please yes it's an intelligence gathering base uh which the Israelis have are using against uh the resistance in the north and in particular in Syria so I think you know this 99% stuff reminds me of the elections of these governments that are controlled by the United States these presidents which all all get 99% of the vote the fact is that uh the Israeli regime last night was humiliated and the Iranian hit them back and when your when your guest goes and says that uh Arab governments are or you know what what their position may be we have to look at what people on the streets are saying not at what governments are saying in fact if the greater the gap between the governments and the people in the region when it comes to Israel the worse it is for those governments so when for example the jordanians are seen to be siding with Israeli regime that's the Jordanian government that's not the Jordanian public let's let's separate these two but uh again as I said if the Iranian if the Iranian uh offensive capabilities are so weak then then the United States should encourage the Israelis to attack Iran again but I think the Americans know that if Israel strikes Iran again the response will become even more harsh this time around Benny gance uh one of the key members of the war cabinet Yosi is saying that Israel will extract a price in a time and manner of Israel's choosing do you you think it plays into this in any way into the calculations of of exactly what scale Israel's response is the fact that this attack by Iran was very clearly telegraphed in advance it took place at a time when both Israel and the US were on the highest state of alert and the fact that there were no deaths well there was an element of a theater in all of this where they we could watch at home and actually know exactly when the the drones and the ballistic missile and the cruise missiles were were were launched and what we hear now that basically there are two Iranian narratives that contradict each other but one for domestic consumption and one for international and strategic reason for domestic reason it's presented as a great success and there is some story about about Israeli basis badly Hur though you can imagine that satellite imagery by now would have exposed something like this and it be revealed in in in in in public so this probably is is is a kind of a narrative developed domestically in Iran on the other hand it was almost obvious that Iran didn't want to hurt Israel too much because they understand the consequences of it and they didn't want to push either Israel the United States the region into into a Cascade war war so between the Strategic and the need to appease some domestic pressures there can now some some not only paradoxes but there are there there are tension and what Benny Gans which is one of the more responsible members of of of this cabinet says you know Israel will choose its time and and the manner of retaliation in other words Israel doesn't need to retaliate right now because there was no major danger and Ma major ma major threat or major damage to Israel let's remind ourselves actually the damage was because two weeks ago and everyone expected and accepted that Iran for to a certain degree has the right to response to that the question was is the time the scope and and the place and now we know how it happened then everyone can move move on and again Iran in many ways by fighting through proxis was better off and while Israel has been criticized for for the last six six months and being isolated right now Iran actually made Israel Israel standing internationally in a way better stand Akbar um we seem to have evidence that that the US did get a direct warning and certainly uh the Iranian side are saying that they did warn uh the US the evidence I have for example the US President Joe Biden was at his home in Delaware and then he hurriedly hurried back to the White House because he knew this was coming as a diplomatic correspondent for your organization how much knowledge do you have of what's been going on behind the scenes in recent hours and days yeah there are two channels between the US and Iran to kind of pass these messages of De confliction or any other kind of important message they need to pass right so one is through the Swiss who are sort of the guardian of of any diplomatic relationship where there is antie between two countries and then Brett Mur uh who is President Biden's quite controversial Middle East advisor but very influential Brett mcgurk has been running his own kind of channel in recent months in Oman an Arab state that does maintain some degree of relations with Iran so there are these channels and certainly it's understood in DC that tan does not want sleep in some huge way right now and also perhaps is not have the bandwidth to do so I mean given the regional situation where yes Arab states are very conscious of of their population being Palestinians they're also very worried about Iran I mean that's indisputable there's a lot there right and then there's Iran's own domestic situation coming now almost two years after Mass protests for over the killing of a of a civilian woman so there there's a lot of reasons why Iran may not want to escalate right now Washington doesn't want to escalate but I think the wild card here remains that Israel cabinet right and I think one thing I just want to highight is that in this moment of Bluster in this moment where we're still talking incredibly right after escalations on both sides the is really attack in Damascus the Iranian attack today from Iranian soil into Israel we're still talking about further escalations okay now who's going to punch back in a bigger scarier way and that's exactly the kind of talk that a lot of us officials don't want to see um and conversely at the political level in the US we see President Biden and a lot of lawmakers especially Republicans saying the time is right to send $4 billion more weapons to Israel right so that's a stalled military package that Biden has wanted since the start of the Gaza War so while there's a lot of hesitation there's also a lot of political maneuvering including in DC and in Israel to escalate further and to arm Israel more which leads to greater risk Muhammad let me ask you about diplomacy that might be going on behind the scenes um you've heard heard Brett mcer maybe talking that Akbar is saying directly to the Iranians what's your understanding of any direct contacts because of course Brett mcer was part of the Obama Administration as are many of the officials in the Biden Administration Bill Burns the CIA director he was involved in nuclear diplomacy Jake Sullivan the National Security advisor he previously was involved in negotiations with the Iranians you know all this well Muhammad because you were an adviser at one point to the Iran nuclear team are there Direct talks between the two sides no there are no direct talks between Iran and the United States and we have uh indirect Communications between the two countries that have uh been utilized for uh years now and of course the Iranians have sent messages to the United States and the United States has sent messages to Iran and the United States knows quite well that escalation is not something that's in interest of the United States if the United States were to get involved these very same missiles and drones that are highly capable will destroy us bases in the Persian Gulf region and then uh across the region and those countries that host those bases will be seen as complicit and that would bring about massive destruction and the uh it will destroy the global economy because energy energy prices will go through the roof so the Americans they have enough San people left in Washington I think that would understand that they can say the propaganda about how all the drones and missiles were stopped and and all that and how in Gaza Israel is winning and how in Lebanon they're winning and the Americans are winning everywhere and how Russian drones and missiles are all shot down they also they're also being shot down 99% of them in Ukraine but the Americans are losing across the board and the West is on the decline and so Americans let me let me let me let me bring in Yosi on this because it's pretty clear the US I think all of you are saying this wants to draw a line under this and stop any further escalation and that seems to be Iran's position too but y see we've seen President Biden in the last six months give unconditional support to Israel uh to defend itself we've seen President Biden send a naval Amada to the region we've seen him provide diplomatic cover for Israel at the United Nations and we've ke seen him continue despite all the deaths of civilians to send weapons to Israel and yet whenever Biden has said show restraint respect my red lines Netanyahu does not listen to him so what sway does Joe Biden have over Israel and the current Israeli government right now and I think we need to differentiate between the US policy when it come to Gaza and I think we should have seen them way more proactive President Biden in in in stopping the war CIS far humanitarian cisar and and and and allowing more more humanitarian Aid entering the the release of the hostages and so on and so forth there is there was not enough pressure on netan and differentiat from the attack last night that I think the United States and the other allies were were were right in stopping this income drones and and and and miss but when it comes to the United States it has all the cards when it comes to Israel if it wants it can actually put enough pressure on Israel again not necessarily to do exactly what Washington wants but enough sometimes to save Israel from itself and the way and and the thing I agree with the I think lot what I disagree because actually Iran is supporting all the wrong causes right now in the Middle East and also in in Russia in in in its war with with Ukraine but when it comes to to to Gaza Israel is not winning the war in Gaza it's making only make it worse for the Palestinians and for Israel and if it's the role of the United States actually to help the Israel to get beyond the war to think about the day after in Gaza and try to build also a new security architecture in in the Middle East which will include peace with the Palestinians more inclusive including of Iran but at the same to look at Iran as not an adventurist force that destabilized the region so you say that the US has all the cards Yosi and not been prepared to use them until now Akbar we heard mammad talk about potential economic meltdown globally if if if this was to expand into an allout war between the two countries well just seven months away you've got a US presidential election do you think President Biden is prepared to use all these cards now I think it's indisputable that if a major Middle East consecration occurs which would as Mohammad mentioned include right Iranian or proxy strikes on us bases probably in the Persian di probably shutting down shipping routs and energy exports that would be a huge blow to American global influence to President Biden's re-election prospects I will say the US knows it has the leverage right so I think one one factor in this conflict that hasn't gotten enough attention is that in a couple of spaces President Biden has used that leverage so on October 10th for instance we know from The Wall Street Journal that Israel was ready to strike hisbah in Lebanon right they had made a decision they wanted to expand the War President Biden had a 45 minute phone call with Netanyahu and said this is not happening what I think is so striking about that is that that means Biden and his team have known since October time that will take one phone call to stop Israeli actions whether it's in Palestine in Gaza in the West Bank where they say that're quite concerned and also regionally they haven't made that choice broadly I think that calculation could shift as we get closer to the election and I do think zoomi out brought a picture yes President Biden is thinking about his re-election in November but he and his team this is a this has been one of the handicaps of the Middle East approach unfortunately but it it remains one of their focuses they see themselves as these adults in the room right not just dealing with the conflicts of today but setting the stage for us relevance on the world stage in the future so they are very much thinking about the Pacific they're thinking about the war in Ukraine and European security and from that point of view they do not want some destabilizing Factor some destabilizing conflict in the middle right now that upsets the relationship stability in the Pacific right and upsets energy security there they do not want uh some kind of shift of Arab states towards Russia feeling that Russia is more successful in Ukraine so they're very conscious of those factors as well as they're making the decisions on okay thank you very much to all three of you our guests today Muhammad Mandi Yosi meckelberg and Akbar Shahed armed
