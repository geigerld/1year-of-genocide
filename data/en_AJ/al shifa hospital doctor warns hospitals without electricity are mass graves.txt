well it's 0600 GMT that's 8:00 a.m. in the morning in Gaza the World Health Organization says it's lost communication with its contacts inside the AL shifa Hospital thousands of Palestinians seeking safety at the largest medical facility have endured another night of fear the Ministry of Health has reported bombing and fighting in all directions around Al shifer other hospitals have also been under attack an Israeli air strike on a maternity hospital killed two doctors inside the hospital there are dozens of newborn babies in of critical care Imran aan begins our coverage these are some of gaza's most vulnerable these prematurely born babies are meant to be kept in incubators with oxygen and temperature regulating equipment helping every breath they take but due to the constant Israeli Siege and bombardment they are now bundled up in towels and sheets in gaza's alifa hospital with insufficient Fuel and no electricity Hospital staff have suspended operations and are urging the International Community to help save the youngest lives in the besieged strip we requested protection for these children and protection for all patients in the Intensive Care Unit however they told us that you have only one hour to remove these children from one place to another now we place the children in a very unhealthy uh places that is not conducive to their condition these children were born after less than seven months of pregnancy now we are struggling to save their lives using primitive methods using manual simple methods but however this is very unsustainable Al jaer spoke to a father of two infants who are being treated at alifa hospital he says he feels Beyond helpless honestly this is something you cannot describe when you reach to such a point where you can provide safety to your newborn children honestly today when I spoke with the Red Cross literally they told me that they have suspended their operations in Gaza and they have no news about mea and the hub no news at all I don't know whether they are all right or not this desperate father is among the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians forced to leave their homes in North Gaza to escape Israeli strikes alifa hospital is gaza's largest medical facility thousands are using the hospital as shelter almost 5,000 patients are receiving care and nearly 800 others are waiting to be admitted the facility and its staff are at a Breaking Point and with every passing minute the youngest Palestinian lives born into this war are in danger of becoming part of an Ever growing list of young lives cut too short Imran Alan aler ER well in a moment we'll speak to s hyat in occupied East Jerusalem for Israel's response to what's happening at alifa but first let's go to hanim Mahmud in Han Unice in southern Gaza hany so what more are you hearing there about the fate of these babies at the alifa hospital hany yes we we're we're I'm going to talk about this but first I want to give you the latest update about the air strike campaign that's been uh targeting multiple areas in the ga in the Gaza Strip including Rafa kanun is the central part areas that were designated by the Israeli military as safe areas where many evacuates found themselves victims and targets of those unpredictable bombs and air strike the total number within the past hours late uh early hours of late hours of last night early hours of this morning by the 28 Palestinian have been killed with so many people is still under the rubbles uh as of the shifa hospital it is still under military Siege as Israeli tanks and milit and armored vehicles are pushing very close uh to the uh complex the health facility complex from all sides from the north the West the East and the southern part about couple hundred meters away and I've been targeting the hospital and the compt repeatedly with tank shells and there are also attack drones that the qu capter are on top of these are hovering at a low attitude of a of the SKU of of that of that area uh now with we we heard Dr Abu selia the director of a Shiva Hospital who talked about a uh a possible coordination with uh uh with ambulances and with the Red Cross in order to evacuate uh uh civilians inside the hospital now when when we talk about babies in incubation it's very very difficult and very impossible to remove them uh uh from that area uh to other Hospital most of the hospitals in Gaza and the northern partk are under heavy targets and and and the vast majority of them don't have if not all of them don't have electricity don't have the the sufficient medical supplies to sustain any of the patients and to uh uh treat them properly uh in addition uh there's no electricity to keep these incubation running so what he's talking about is looking for a safe Corridor just secure a safe Corridor with very well equipped ambulance and vehicle to carry out those babies to ensure they're not going to die because as of now without electricity and sufficient oxygen coming from uh the lines and in the hospital uh those babies are dying by the hours unfortunately all right hanim mmud they're live for us in KH units in southern Gaza hany thank you let's bring in sah hyat in occupied East Jerusalem Sara so what are the Israelis saying about all this then well Daniel Kari who's the spokesman for the uh Israeli military uh spoke and also released a statement saying that Hamas has been lying uh saying that people can't leave Al shifa hospital for safe uh passage and he also um had said that um the Eastern uh side of the hospital was safe for people to leave and that was the exit um that people could use uh and in terms of the babies he said that they are willing to assist uh and to help in the movement of them to a safer location but let's speak about this practically how practical is this when a uh Palestinians aren't trusting uh to uh the very people that are bombarding it um and have tried in many attempts to leave not just Al shifer hospital but during uh the evacuation of the north of Gaza and then coming under Fire um that's one thing but also uh the question that many people have been asking uh not just in Gaza but elsewhere is why not ensure that the uh organizations such as the red crescent and Red Cross why are not they not able to be uh to be the ones that can take those uh that are in dire need and move them to a place elsewhere when we spoken to the uh Red Cross ourselves here at Al jazer many a time they told us that they've tried uh to deliver Aid they've tried to deliver much needed uh equipment um when they did a few days ago their own Convoy uh came Under Fire and then they had to divert they were making those deliveries to Al cot's hospital and eventually they were able to make that delivery to Al shifer but they did tell us that was nothing in compared to the dire situation and the dire require the requirements needed for those uh in absolutely a terrible uh physical and mental condition so how practical this is it's it's it's really unclear and also uh the Israelis didn't get detail how this would be possible Sarah thank
