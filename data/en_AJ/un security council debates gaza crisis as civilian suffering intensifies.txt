since October 7th meeting after meeting and yet nothing the UN Security Council has done or said has been able to stop Israel's war on Gaza a few examples back on October 30th an emergency meeting a call to Halt the fighting when the death toll was 8,000 the resolution presented today does not reflect the real situation on the ground it is since soared to five times that on May 24th the council meets to pass a resolution condemning the killing of un staff and Aid workers the draft resolution demands that parties to conflict uphold their obligations since then another 15 un Personnel killed and more humanitarian workers as well and on May 29th the council meets after Israel's strikes at camp in Rafa sparking fires killing dozens we are heartbroken and horrified since then more strikes by Israel More Death this is the 24th special session um that has been called on Palestine since October 7th 24 sessions yet very little that the security Council has actually been able to do that's significant and it's something that will continue to hurt and undermine the legitimacy of the security Council you know far past when ceasefire does uh is is reached in Gaza do you think there's any takeaways from what the security Council has not been able to do I think one of the biggest takeaways which many member states have been shouting from the rooftops is a need for reform of the security Council we're in a situation where the Security Council is clearly not working to maintain International Peace and security as it was mandated to do Riyad mansur palestine's ambassador to the UN says the council and member states have the tools to hold Israel to account there are many things that they can do if they have the political will to act journalists report about it diplomats listen to it that is the power of the security Council and the hope is eventually there will be the political will to end Israel's war on Gaza something so far the council has failed to do Gabriel zando Al jaaz at the United Nations in New York make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
