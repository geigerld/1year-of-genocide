well we begin with breaking news from Gaza City where Israel has killed at least 77 Palestinians and injured hundreds more more than 30,000 people have now been killed since Israel launched its war on Gaza in October Thursday's attack is being described as a massacre of civilians by Israeli troops hundreds of starving Palestinians had gathered to collect food Aid when they were attacked by Israeli snipers and shelled by Israeli tanks a paramedic in Gaza City has described what situation was like as he rushed the injured to the Kamal adwan hospital when we received an emergency called that elifa hospital is no longer able to cope with the massive number of victims we rushed with the only three ambulance Vehicles we have running as we are out of fuel we found dozens of dead bodies lying on the way the three ambulance Vehicles were not enough to carry the dead and the injured we decided to start with the injured first for more than 4 hours now we have been transporting victims to hospitals more than 200 injured were taken to two hospitals not only by ambulance but also by Donkey carts and private cars we later returned to recover the dead bodies as of now there are 30 dead bodies that have been recovered this is genocide against our people those were innocent civilians waiting for days for the trucks carrying relief Aid it is a war crime well let's bring in Al jaaz senior political analyst Maran Bashar to unpack some of this for us further Maran we've literally just heard from from villum there with the latest Israeli statement they're saying that people were were killed in a crush in in a stampede they were looting the aid delivery obviously we've heard from doctors who've been treating the injured they're saying these are gunshot wounds these are wounds from from shelling what do you make of the two narratives um it's uh predictable right I mean it's more of the same lies that we've heard before throughout the years um every time Israel commits a a massacre or a war crime there's always some lie that comes behind or after unfortunately a lot of this thing is happening in uh in plain sight and sooner or later we're seeing evidence we're seeing footage and and so on so forth and things are getting investigated and so on so forth what is really striking is a number of things and that's why it's hard to believe anything the Israel is saying because of what you you just said earlier and I think we need to stop and think about that 30,000 30,000 yeah in less than 5 months mostly women and children and the idea of shelling starving people killing them twice I mean what's the point of shelling people who are dying by starvation M what is the point there's been speculation that that something like the attack that we've seen could be used as as some kind of a negotiating tactic especially as talks are continuing what do you make of that you know I the more I think about it throughout the day and I look at these images a number of interpretation a number of explanations are possible one is that this is more of the same I mean why today well why yesterday why the day before and why the bombings of hospitals the killing of children the bombing of residential buildings the ethnic cleansing and so on so forth and why well it's because of all of these there is a pattern here right and it's very important because if there's no pattern then you can talk about Randomness you can talk about exception but when there's a pattern over 5 months of war crimes of targeting civilians right of making justifications that are no longer sellable because when Hamas Fighters or those who are killed among Hamas Fighters become the collateral damage when the absolute majority of those who were killed are civilians mostly women and children you know that there's a pattern here that's why we speak of genocide that's why we speak of war crimes that's why we speak of Slaughter of civilians and I think in a sense here you can say that this is a pattern now does this have something to do with the deadline Monday the 4th of March where there's a potential deal over a temporary ceasefire there could be I think this government in Israel does not want any form of a ceasefire does is not really interested in freeing the captives in return for whatever the cost is freeing prisoners stopping the war even for a while right I think in that sense if they are forced to accept the deal they will probably break it within weeks but in the meanwhile they will stauter and Destroy as much as possible the other explanation is if the deal is not set in stone yet and there's wrangling about it I I think they are more than interested to torpedo it either by driving the Palestinians and Hamas to the brink or by creating so much Havoc right that it's going to be uncontrollable you talk about driving the Palestinians to the brink I I'm wondering when you say well driving Hamas to the brink there are fata and Hamas Representatives right now meeting in in Moscow and there's been plenty of talk about how a more unified Palestinian front would would help the the negotiations bring make a ceasefire potentially more likely do you think something like this what we've seen today in Gaza City that it it has the potential to bring the different Palestinian factions closer together well thank you for that because that gets me to the third possible interpretation of why Israel carries that Slaughter of the Palestinians one can Define it as an act of State Terror why an act of State Terror because Israel is basically using Force against the civilian population of Gaza and the West Bank in order to extract concessions from Hamas and fat from those who are still in control or somehow in control in Gaza and those who are in control in the West Bank the more killing and the more Force they are using they are trying to basically blackmail Hamas of fat into making concessions on the number of days of uh of the pause or a number of prisoners released and so on so forth right and that kind of state Terror against the people in Gaza in order to extract concessions from the leaders it's not working or it has not worked yet so we don't know if it's going to work this time because truly the Palestinians in Gaza are getting fed up and think a lot of them all of them just want some kind of respite in the days in the days in the days ahead and that's why most all people are waiting for some kind of a break during Ramadan right yeah well stay with me on because as we've been discussing the death toll among Palestinians from Israel's war on the Gaza Strip has now crossed 30,000 according to gaza's health ministry that's 1.3% of the population now let's take a look at how this percentage potentially Compares with other countries now if a war was launched against Israel on that same scale and for the same duration 1.3% of its population killed that's more than 120,000 Israelis the same percentage in Ukraine that would be nearly half a million dead in the United States that would translate to nearly 4 and a half million Americans in China that's more than 18 and a half million who'd be killed Maran you spoke about people wanting respite obviously as we've been saying Ramadan is just around the corner a hugely sensitive time not only across the Gaza stripit but across the region too right now we're watching babies starve to death in hospitals as these talks of a potential ceasefire continue and the International Community presses for a ceasefire but but not much seems to happen what now you know when we start talking about famine in 2024 uh us backed Israeli imposed famine I I cast my eyes back trying to remember if the United States was ever involved in forced famine I mean Biden President Biden needs to be thinking about that what did does it mean for that country that you know have these self-fulfilled or self pretensions about morality and and uh and values and so on so forth to be backing famine in a place like Gaza and an open air prison in a basically a concentration camp famine which reminds us of the second world war in a concentration camp what does it mean right so in a sense you could say that what uh the Israelis are doing today in Gaza cutting Aid and creating that kind of famine basically starvation as a weapon of War may you know one has to be somehow you know feels their own Humanity we need to feel our humanity and think that the chancellor of Germany the prime minister of Britain and the president of the United States have some humanity and decency in them to look at the situation in Gaza unraveling in plain sight on their TV screens and see what is their policies are leading to in Palestine and I think you would think that out of all the misery and the slaughter and the suffering and the death and the destruction that maybe this will start moving people about now it's not apparently moving money in the Middle East yeah unfortunately right we still hear from Arab leaders how they have really everything possible to get food into Gaza yeah everything possible to get food into Gaza let's all remember that there is a un Security Council resolution that mandated enter of humanitarian assist to Gaza and there is an Arab League and Islamic conference resolution towards that end and we've been hearing that anger and frustration on on the streets of Gaza directed at Arab states to Maan Bashar thank you for joining me again here um on this Bulletin
