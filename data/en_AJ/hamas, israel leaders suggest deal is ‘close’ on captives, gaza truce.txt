Al jaer hasham albara who's here in Doha and hasham of course over the past few weeks uh Doha has seen a revolving door of high level delegates and diplomats in the hope of reaching a point now where that we can call progress tell us more it was a long journey NE there were moments of up and down and there were some skepticism about whether this is something that could be har M by all the parties but today the qataris are saying that they are they have reached the closest point they have ever been in reaching an agreement the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that this is just a matter of time before finalizing some small details in the agreement but he told the media BEC given the fact that this is a sensitive issue he didn't want to further elaborate on some of the sticking points in that agreement but this could be a pivotal moment for qatar's diplomacy which qataris have been instrumental in convincing Hamas in accepting the terms of the deal and pushing forward for an agreement that would pave the way for the some of the captives to be released in exchange of Palestinians detained in Israeli jails to be released at the same time the establishing of humanitarian corridors and allowing more Aid into Gaza if this Happ happens is going to be the most significant political and diplomatic development since the start of the conflict on October the 7th all right Hashim many thanks there Hashim albar speaking to us from here in Doha
