[Music] we begin in Gaza City where the Israeli military has killed at least 104 Palestinians nearly 700 people are injured dozens in critical condition more than 30,000 Palestinians have now been killed since Israel began its war on Gaza in October Thursday's attack is being described as a massacre of civilians by Israeli troops hundreds of hungry and starving Palestinians had gathered to collect food Aid when they were attacked by Israeli snipers and shelled by Israeli tanks Israel's Army says its soldiers were forced to open fire because they felt threatened by the large crowds Safa baruti who's in Moscow he's the Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative and I'd like to ask you sir about uh meetings taking place in Moscow in just a moment but first let's pick up on what we've just been talking about this decision by uh the Israeli government uh to expand into lands uh further land of course in the occupied West Bank salutary to learn that amidst these horrific events taking place in Gaza that that at the very same time expansion continues despite the UN and in spite of the international court of justice well what you see from all that is happening both in Gaza and West Bank is that we are dealing with a par State a structure that has become fascist run by fascists in an government that includes fascists like smotrich and Bing and they've committed today a horrible crime another crime a massacre that took the lives of more than 104 people these and and and injured more than 760 these were civilians who are starving because Israel is depriving them from food for months and does not allow any supplies to them for more than a month now and now they are bombarding them not with anything with artillery they know very well that when you use artillery you can cause so much damage and so many killings uh in this in this manner they use drones they use gunshots they and then they try to justify it by saying that Palestinians are responsible for being killed by the same Israeli soldiers it's unbelievable and on top of that they are stealing land continue to steal land in the West Bank this all is happening because of the Silence of the Western countries in particular the United States of America because of the fact that United States of America and the government of Britain and many other Western governments are complicit with these crimes and allowing them to happen this should stop immediately and it cannot stop without immediate permanent complete and total ceasefire without Israeli Army withdrawing from Gaza after they have destroyed it so much and after they have driven so many people millions of people to the edge of starvation and death from starving and of course Mustafa baruti the Palestinian people entirely powerless to defend themselves they don't have an army they don't even have a state they now don't even have a government they can't even politically defend themselves which presumably uh leads us to why you're in Moscow Palestinian factions meeting in Moscow I want to ask you first of all is any sort of political Unity uh even feasible and and and what is the Russian role in all of this well Russia just provided the space and the invitation it's uh Russia is facilitating this meeting nothing more and it is a Palestinian Palestinian meeting happening on the land of Russia in Moscow because they invited us and provided us with the venue but I can tell you that the discussions that are taking place are quite positive so far and that I think I've never seen the atmosphere so uh so so close to Unity as it is today I think mainly because people feel the responsibility after all these massacres that our people have been subjected to and the issue of a future government is also being discussed with the idea of having some kind of a national consensus government a government that all parties would agree with a government that devotes its intention and its work mainly to alleviate this terrible suffering in Gaza to prevent the Israeli efforts to enforce ethnic cleansing on the people of Gaza to allow the supplies of everything that is necessary to for people to survive there and uh I think this is the atmosphere we are talking about and the first statement that came out from this meeting was specifically a statement condemning this terrible Massacre that the Israeli Army has just committed in Gaza uh I think there is a general feeling of responsibility here and we are not talking about something that will end in two days we are talking about initiating of a initiation of a process that hopefully will lead eventually to complete Unity within the ranks of a unified Palestinian leadership I say the Palestinians don't have a voice politically of course the Palestinian Authority has responded uh to these events with forceful words aimed at the International Community uh in the hope that they will redouble efforts towards a ceasefire presumably a fairly faint hope though that these events on top of everything that has happened in the last almost five months will move the dial significantly in terms of international opinion and in terms of bringing about a ceasefire we know very well that this Israeli government is a fascist one and I insist on this description they don't care about Palestinian lives I think they don't even care about Israeli prisoners lives uh they care only about staying in power they care only about destroying the future of Palestinians and destroying the lives of as many Palestinians as possible uh but it is also the responsibility of United States of America that has prevented the passage of any resolution for ceasefire in the United Nations security Council they prevented that four times and that because of that they are not only complicit with this crime they are participating in this crime because their troops are also participating in it and their tank their planes are over Gaza and their ships are around Gaza and they are supplying Israel with all these weapons that are killing the Palestinians so time has has come to stop this atrocity and stop talking about international law and international legitimacy when it comes to countries like Ukraine but nothing when it comes to Palestine this double standard is awful and these crimes that are happening in Palestine are sending very dangerous message worldwide that what we what we live by in this world today is not international law but the law of jungle and Israel is allowed to commit all these crimes how would other governments and countries conclude from all these events wouldn't everybody think now that if you have the power you can do whatever you like you can kill whoever you want that is totally unacceptable they are playing with fire they're dragging the whole world in a very dangerous Direction and this has to stop and it can stop immediately by declaring immediate permanent ceasefire and these criminals who committed the massacre today and committed the massacre of killing no less than 30,000 Palestinians so far and injuring more than 70,000 have to be taken to courts have to be held responsible in front of the international court of justice sooner or later we're talking about a ceasefire an eventual ceasefire when ass assumes it will happen it must happen all wars end what happens next of course brings us back to why you're in Moscow now to come up with a unified Palestinian voice that can take part in future negotiations you're doing this in Russia can you give me a sense of whether there is a road map emerging from your meetings now that will take you further down that road towards unity and whether it's will be appropriate at some point point to involve other International powers in your deliberations for instance the Americans yes I can tell you uh a road map is being formed gradually I can say that as I said that for the first time these meetings are happening in a much positive atmosphere and uh I think there are six or seven points that we all agree about now already and uh I think this is a very good beginning uh anybody who wants to help Palestinian national Unity is is most welcome uh and and they can contribute but the most important thing here is that this should be an independent Palestinian position uh we all are aware of the fact that we need to agree not only about a national consensus government very soon but also about bringing back the whole Democratic process of Palestinians having the right to to to to choose their leaders through Democratic free elections but one very important point that everybody here realizes whether you are talking about us or fat or Hamas or anybody else that we cannot allow other countries other forces to take away our right of representing ourselves to take away the right of Palestinians to present their their their their interest and their goals and their aspirations for for getting free from this terrible occupation and this system of aparti and now these massacres that are conducted against our people okay Mustafa barotti Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative speaking to us there from Moscow I thank you for your time thank you
