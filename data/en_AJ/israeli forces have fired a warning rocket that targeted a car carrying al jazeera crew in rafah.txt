now on Al jazer is Adnan Abu hasna who is the media advisor for unra that's the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees he joining us from Cairo thank you very much for your time uh Mr Adnan Israel Israel as we mentioned they not only blocking Aid getting into Gaza they're also targeting people trying to access the little the little food that's managed to get into the territory just talk to us about the difficulties right now for people in Gaza to get anything to eat yes we are talking about hundreds of thousands of gazen that are actually Starving in the northern part of the Gaza Strip and the Gaza City so what we are seeing there that you know pushing people to do things that you know they never had done before like you know gathering with t of thousands of people waiting for the trucks to get into Gaza City and there is you know there is no police there is no actually no system there that they can protect you know the the convoys and on the other hand in many times the Israeli forces they you know they open fire you know at many many of the people and many had been died and injured you know in some occasions you know in the northern part of Gaza Strip yeah we we've reported also on people now leaving Northern Gaza because there's no food there wfp has suspended food deliveries uh to the North and the last time unra your agency was able to make deliveries to the north was last month so you know what are people there relying on how are they able to survive and those who make it to the South are they finding enough Aid in that area they're finding nothing actually they are really starving even you know animals food they're not there anymore they tried to use it for a while but now everything a gun actually there is not even you know food for animals that the the Palestinians in many places they you know trying to maneuver around that and to make you know some bread from it but now there's no more something like that and uh we are communicating with people contacting people there and they are telling us that they are starving and you know family or family Bread Winners actually they stopped you know eating and know to allow their kids to eat you know one meal you know in 24 hours or 48 hours and we are afraid that people there will start dying because of uh you know they have nothing to eat actually yeah a s situation really you mentioned some of the obstacles to deliveries but at the same time we've seen that the flow of Aid um has reduced sharply in the last few days why is that the case that in the last few days the flow has has reduced considerably yeah unfortunately you know that the number of trucks that Israel allowed you know to get into gaza's STP this month is nearly 50% of of the tracks that had been allowed in in the last in the last month and it it resulted you know actually that many people they don't have you know enough food even we we we we don't know how to distribute you know uh some trucks that getting into Gaza that we have now the average of trucks that getting into Gaza 80 trucks and among them you find water and medicine and we are the remain body in the Gaza Strip the only body who is responsible for Distributing you know food and water and Medicine in the Gaza Strip they ask us to distribute 50 trucks or 60 trucks to 2.3 million Palestinians on all over the Gaza Strip so it's normal it's normal that there is a reduction in flour reduction in in everything not only in food cans and and in water and everything Mr Adan abasa let me ask you a final question there is a lot of talk right now about a possible ceasefire the Americans have mentioned this before um the start of the holy month of Ramadan which of course is a month of fasting for Muslims and you wonder how Muslims in Gaza the people of Gaza can fast on under the circumstances they're living in today how hopeful are you that this ceasefire could happen and how much do you think it will alleviate the situation in the near term if there is a real Seas fire and opening really a humanitarian Corridor to get to get the aid into Gaza Strip and in the north and Israel should open other Crossing Point Israel has you know seven crossing points with the Gaza Strip it's not only RAF and and Kim Shalom or k Abu Salam they have to open other Crossing points and to push all the assistant and the food in into the Gip and to allow us and allow us to reach to all places and to accelerate the mechanism of you know tracks inspection actually which is very slow and you know now they are talking about thousands of facts on the Egyptian side because the mechanism that is the tools that had been used by the Israeli Authority you know to inspect the tracks it's unbelievable it does not work so they have to change all the mechanism and to allow us to get into all places to reach all the population and we believe in Ramadan there is there is a chance there is a window with with a real ceas fire thank you so much for talking to us Adnan Abu Hasa from unra the Agency for Palestinian refugees joining us there from Cairo
