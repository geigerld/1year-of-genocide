let's now bring in Abdullah Al Aran he's an associate professor of history at Georgetown University here in Qatar and so attacks against humanitarian workers their premises their assets violate international law how worrying is it that we continue to see this happen well I mean this is the result of um being able to do this for 11 months with complete and total impunity there has been absolutely no accountability for the many many many similar attacks um even the sense of of even needing a justification right I mean if again we' become so desensitized to this level of of atrocity um against schools against hospitals Etc that we forget the fact that this actually going back to the very beginning um was something that was deemed completely off limits uh the Israeli forces at one point would have to make arguments in cases and talk about the reasoning behind targeting these facilities all of that has now been done away with to the point where it's become so uh routine to be able to do this is sh taken place during the course of this 11mon war would you say yeah absolutely I mean I think because the way that this war has unfolded the way that the genocidal campaign has unfolded is one in which Israel continues to test the limits of what's acceptable internationally and as long as there has been absolutely no accountability no intervention externally from any uh actors of course led by the United Nations itself which sees itself constantly targeted in this way um but also of course all of the various countries that have continued to Shield Israel from any accountability um that as a result it continues to escalate its just to be clear that the legal the international framework exists to enforce accountability UN member states are meant to protect humanitarian workers um and I think this is called for in UN resolution 2730 which was adopted earlier this year so they can hold perpetrators to account for violations if if the willingness is there exactly I think you touched on it right there at the end that we know what the law states the law is very very extremely clear about this issue but but the law is only as strong as the political will that exists to defend it to apply it to enforce it and we haven't seen any enforcement mechanisms whatsoever coming again out of the United Nations the security Council which of course is the body that would necessarily have to take action the United States has used its veto multiple times to Shield Israel from any actionable uh resolutions um and on top of that of course all of the regional actors that that continue to basically sit and watch um as we talk about you know ceasefire deals and negotiations that have led nowhere that have simply acted as as a kind of a distraction from um you know what's actually unfolding in Gaza do you think it's it's also quite sad and unfortunate the lack of attention that local humanitarian workers get because we do see occasionally this kind of international condemnation when International staff are targeted as we saw with the world Central Kitchen staff in April but you know most of the aid workers that are leaving their homes if they have homes still in Gaza every day going to help their their fellow Palestinians they are National staff and they don't get anything like that kind of attention that's exactly right I mean the the complete and utter dehumanization of Palestinians in particular has been very much a part and parcel of this entire uh War I mean this is exactly how genocidal campaigns unfold it starts with stripping uh the people who are being um you know massacred exterminated in large numbers to this degree we're talking about tens of thousands if not likely hundreds of thousands of casualties over the last 11 months and irrespective of whether they work for an international agency like the UN um have SE or if they're journalists for instance another protected category or medical workers or or people across so many different uh sectors that are crucial to the survival of Palestinians during this exact moment and they're the ones that are being targeted most directly um quite often in in these uh attacks Israel's B has turned Gaza into the deadliest place in the world to deliver Aid because hospitals ambulances schools shelters convoys all these bits of Civilian infrastructure have been targeted and destroyed do you you envisage a time where perhaps there will be no International presence or very little International presence in Gaza to help the people there well I I think one really important element to this that that should be highlighted is the fact that we know even predating this last year that uh the state of Israel along with even segments of supporters within the United States have targeted unwa specifically as an agency as a body that they deem to be um you know essentially standing in the way of their AIMS in in Palestine and so there have been attempts to defund it to delegitimize it to criminalize it and even to the extent that we're seeing its workers targeted and killed in this way and so I think the idea that that essentially attempting to revoke the status of Palestinians as refugees let's also consider the fact that than two-thirds of Palestinians living in Gaza are either refugees survivors of the NBA or their descendants right so this is a agency that has been absolutely crucial not just to this daily survival of Palestinians but also to the idea that they retain the right to return to their homes right this is something that's been enshrined in international law and un resolutions and of course part of this campaign has been both Again by the by uh Israel as well as as um within some segments of the United States to try and and eventually undo uh Palestinian claims to their own nationhood okay thank you very much Professor Abdullah Al Aran thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaer
