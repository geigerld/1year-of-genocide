who is in Rafa Tark uh let's talk about the aid and uh Israel announcing that it will open the arz Crossing in Northern Gaza to allow Aid in what are the reactions there to this decision and how much difference is this going to make for people in Northern Gaza who are experiencing famine at the [Music] moment yes fully in fact uh after the uh meeting that has uh been held between the members of the Israeli War cabin they have totally agreed that they will again reopen areas acrossing in order to allow for further flow of a humanitarian convoys to reach to the desperate part of the Gaza Strip in the northern sector of the territory and that step is understood among Palestinians here to be as a result of the American direct pressure and the increasing level of a criticism Israel has been subjected to after its multiple repeated attacks on uh eight Seekers alongside with the humanitarian organ ganizations that are working to facilitate the process of a delivery to the Gaza Strip the latest one has been conducted in the wal Central Kitchen which has completely sparked a international outrage that's why the Israeli military had been accepting the American demands in order to uh open AAS of crossing and allow for further flow of humanitarian convoys specifically after the American President Joe Biden has been calling the Israeli leadership to increase the capacity of the humanitarian suppli to the Gaza Strip but yet Palestinians are wondering about the number of humanitarian convoys that would be allowed to get into the northern part of Gaza but if there's going to be real and practical mechanisms to uh increase the capacity of these AIDS Palestinians see that it's a very good step that will help to partially alleviate the aggravating humanitarian crisis there in fact but even with this glimmer of hope that some Aid will finally get to Northern Gaza the attacks the air strikes across the strip continue uh T tell us about what's been happening in the last few hours yes uh in fact fully within the past few hours the Israeli military had been focusing on using its artillery units that had been stationed the outskirts of the Gaza Strip bounding the Eastern areas of rafah that are adjacent to borders with Israel they have been attacking these areas massively in the past few hours alongside also that artill unit had been hitting the southern part of the city of kanun and with over night they have been carrying out more attacks on Baha town and also in jabalia refugee camp that had been widely hit uh as a number of casualties have been reported there but yet we have been hearing here in Rafa City a more active military movement for the Israeli surveillance to drones as it usually do not leave the sky of Rafa District on hourly bases thank you very much for the update that's Al jazer is tar kazum reporting their life from Rafa in southern Gaza
