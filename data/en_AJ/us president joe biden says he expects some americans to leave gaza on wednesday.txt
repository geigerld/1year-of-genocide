now despite a small number of people being allowed into Egypts via the Rafa Crossing many more are frustrated and frightened by not being able to leave Gaza we spoke to some of them my two little children are jordanians I'm not I've applied for citizenship their names are on the list mine's not they're asking me to separate from my little children 2 years old and 3 years old how am I going to leave them it's been horri in horrible my little brother has a condition he ran out of medicine and he's suffering repeated seizures and has many complications I would like to know who has the right to go home we are Egyptians we are only one hour away from our home I'm with my two little daughters I've been here since the day the crossing was hid by Israeli war planes I'm here to see off my wife we're recently married she's Jordanian I'm pales inian I need to see her get across to safety my only crime is that I am Palestinian well US President Joe Biden says he expects American Nationals to leave Gaza today and in the coming days let's bring in our White House correspondent kimbery haret from on this from Washington DC Kimberly so what more is the White House doing to try and get these US citizens out of Gaza yeah we were hearing that they would be among some of the last today to be departing but in the last hour or so we're hearing that at least five Aid workers with American nationality have now departed through the Rafa Crossing they are Aid workers that work for Charities such as Doctors Without Borders among others now we're learning more about how this Arrangement was worked out uh John Kirby the National Security spokesperson speaking aboard Air Force One talking to reporters revealing that this was discussed in detail on a Sunday phone call that occurred between the US president and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin net Yahoo some days ago we're also hearing from the state department that no concessions were made in terms of any sort of deal to Hamas so we're getting a better understanding of how this was worked out but at the same time still a lot of people left behind and so uh the United States hoping that there will be more in the coming days and the US president taking credit for this on Twitter he's writing today thanks to American leadership we secured safe passage for wounded Palestinians and foreign Nationals to exit Gaza hoping more in the coming days but we should point out even as the United States has taken credit for this uh we should also remind our viewers that Qatar has been instrumental in these negotiations bringing together the parties given the fact that Israel the United States don't deal directly with Hamas Kimberly President Biden has since the beginning of this latest escalation expressed unwavering support for Israel but I wonder how much pressure he facing right now in this White House is facing given the condemnation that's growing of Israel's attacks on civilians in Gaza we've seen hundreds of kill of people killed in the last two days how much pressure is President Biden in to reign in Israel he's under an enormous amount of pressure and it's not just coming from outside the White House it's starting to come from inside the Biden Administration as well we've already seen the public protest the open letters the walkouts that have been happening on Global stage but now we're starting to learn more and more about the dissent within the Biden Administration it's starting to leak out and is being reported here in the United States that members of the state department are voicing their concerns they are actively being ignored they say they are reaching out we've had one high-profile resignation at the state department people that dispute and take issue with the president's policy say they can no longer support this they no longer believe that having a right to defend itself means the murder of women and children and so there is open dissent but what we are hearing is that the US president is not listening instead what he's doing we understand is surrounding himself with a very small tight-knit circle of advisors and essentially is ignoring the experts in other words the people at the state department at the Pentagon who have expertise but he is not utilizing that and so uh there is a growing pressure on this president but the president is as we often say in Washington listening with closed ears Kimberly thank you very much for that Kimberly hawkett is our White House Correspondents live there in Washington
