killed and wounded in this strike more than 6 and a half thousand Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the 7th of October and nearly 17,500 people have been okay I'm being told that we can now

crimes and the Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip continue during the last hour since the early beginning of this day this day could be considered one of the bloodiest day in the uh in the word that had been erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli occupation forces but before we start talking about the alwafa targeting we'd like to send our condolances to our uh colleague at work uh the Arabian correspondent for the uh loss of his wife that has been killed in an air strike and one of his uh also uh grandchildren uh we ask Allah that they will uh rest in peace and make they saw the

the Israeli aircraft Target at the house uh his wife was killed also two of his uh children were also killed by this attack while is a veteran journalist who's uh always provide and deliver truth to the International Community about the Israeli crimes on Gaza and the Israeli violations for against uh the principles of international law even uh journalists family are not away from the Israeli ongoing bombardment different crimes have been made in uh against the families of bedics medical health workers journalists teachers doctors professors every single person in the Gaza Strip might not really have any glance of Hope to wake up next morning due to the Israeli ongoing barbaric crimes well was shocked while he was covering the uh the events on Central Gaza he was delivering the truth to the International Community to everyone in the world about what is happening on the ground we become afraid that we might lose even our family members after the the the attack that had been carried on W's house what is happening with the ground is beyond compare what is the happening with the Gaza STP is considered to be a collective punishment for more than 2.3 million Palestinians tell us about nerat refugee camp why would nsat be struck or be a Target in the Israeli bombardments wellat refugee camp considered to be one of the areas that are located uh to the Far East of the Southern areas of the Gaza Strip which recommended to be a safe place as what is soal the Israeli occupation forces have described and even ordered people to evacuate too uh those people who are even well has been even evacuated his family to anat refugee camp meanwhile he abide to the orders he tried to protect his family but meanwhile the Israeli War Machine destroy destroyed his dreams and even take the souls of his children wife all right tar kabum thank you for your reporting thank you also for sharing all that information with us uh we will come back to you for more on what's happening in Gaza it's 1706 GMT that means it's just minutes past 8:00 p.m. in Gaza what you're seeing right now is footage that was filmed a short while ago of our our colleague at Al jazer Arabic uh while dhu who lost his wife and his son you were just seeing seeing him kneeling um by the body of his son wife lost his wife and son in an Israeli bombardment on the nerat refugee camp which struck uh the house or the lodging where his family was staying at the time H ABD Hamid is in rala in the occupied West Bank Huda uh I understand that you knew while I beg your pardon excuse me excuse me my head's my head's not straight that you know present tense that you know while I don't know if you knew his family I didn't know his family but I did meet W several times I mean he was the backbone of Al jaz's coverage in Gaza he's actually the voice of Palestinians in Gaza ask anyone when you walk around the streets there people just rely on him to make sure that he conveys what they going through uh to other Palestinians but also to the Arab world so that people know what is happening to gazans and not only during war but also during times when there's no conflict and still the life of gazans is extremely difficult um I would say on a personal note he he's W is always this cheerful man always wanting to help us and while I was standing here waiting to speak to you I was just thinking about just a week ago he was at that hospital alahi hospital where hundreds of Palestinians died and he kept on saying there is no safe place for people in Gaza and indeed there was no safe place for his own family and it's it's really something that just came through my mind immediately because he has been conveying this message war after War this is the fifth war in Gaza and W has always been there trying to make sure that the whole world understands and then this tragedy hits him so closely it is also our choice it is our choice we are standing our ground with our heads held high down with the occupation forces and down with okay we just listened to an interview or a bit of an interview that was just conducted with alaz Arabic correspondent while ALU in Gaza uh this happening moments after his wife son and daughter were confirmed to have been killed in an Israeli air strike we can talk now with Maran bishara aljazira senior political analyst you're joining us from London uh Maran it's it's difficult for me to formulate you know questions that actually make sense at this hour so I'll let you talk well you can imagine I I just heard and um I can't formulate an answer either [Music] um you know um W is U is is one of a kind and just listening to him now briefly it's the same courage uh that we've uh that we've witnessed from him over the years so many years he was the he is the voice of of courage and uh and Humanity that comes out of Gaza uh he's not he's not as lucky as sharim uh was sharim died he had to see his family die his children you know there's no um Maran can I can I jump in I think since since you bring up um the memory of Shireen I I think we have to some of course many of our viewers will remember this but some won't uh Shireen Abu aay was an aljazera correspondent and this time I am using the past tense because she's no longer with us and she was killed doing her I would say in the line of duty doing her work as a journalist in the occupied West Bank I'm sorry to interrupt Marwan go ahead yes yes um sharim died but uh but what is cursed now while probably would have wished he died instead of his family there is no greater curse uh for a person than to see their children die before they do really for us to come to this uh you know to this uh to this situation where we feel that someone died they're lucky because another colleague uh is watching his own children die uh right there in front of him the way they die by more of the same Injustice uh that we have faced all of us but notably our colleagues in Gaza I was just talking uh the other day about how brave are our colleagues in Gaza just watching these young uh young Souls those those uh those formidable human beings uh like our colleagues Al English and Al Arabic we are all of course one family but to to see one of our family lose his family that's just unbearable I mean yes we talk about death and you know Death Becomes numbers and we talk about more than 5,000 deaths and so on and we see their faces and and we see the kids we see the babies but now it's it just come home to us to our Al jazer family once again uh the um evil has has hit us personally has hit us in our hearts and our being and our family and it's it's not just not varable yes uh they are uh you know like other people in Gaza dying uh families entire fam is dying and now we see it our own colleague but once again uh it's just the evil the the the the curse of a person seeing their own children die before they do sharen in that way our colleague who was shoted by the Israelis was lucky uh to have had you know her own uh Destiny in her hands doing her job W has been doing his job but now he sees his own family he's our family and he sees his family die and hearing him now uh talk about why he's going to maintain his head high it's just it's just undescribable it's just you don't know what to to do with that that courage and that humanity and that perseverance right there and then the man is crying the man is broken but um but he just can't lose faith in his people and in their capacity for steadfastness I I I I just I can't imagine that a person can say that right there and then as he watches his kids laying down in front of him dead um but this is the kind of people we have this is the kind of Palestinians who were live in Gaza who Israelis treat them as as just uh you know casualty of war I've I've heard earlier today Israelis and the Americans talking about how yes yes more civilians will die we know that and yes this is war no I'm sorry no no that's doesn't have to be that way doesn't have to be our way just because we have criminals in our midst like the Israeli leaders and their supporters in Washington and elsewhere we don't all have to die and certainly not of our members of our family and members of their family it doesn't have to be that way it doesn't have to be that way at all and and W in particular just comes home because throughout the day throughout the days I hear him he is in my head day and night CU he's there on Al jazer Arabic explaining to us transmitting to us the suffering of his people and now the suffering has hit him person it it got to him it got to his family it got to us it's too close to home this is the reality of Palestinians this is the reality of Palestinians today the past two weeks the past two years two decades the past Century that they just continue to die because some other people claim that they have a right to defend themselves to defend themselves against what for what occupation they want to defend their occupation their Siege of Gaza they have to kill so many thousands of people in order to make keep them in prison that's what they're doing that's what they called self-d to kill children in order to keep their parents locked in in an open prison called Gaza that's what W has been reporting on telling the story of Gaza to the world in the most humanitarian ways the most Humane ways and now this man this for formidable this incredible this Brave man watches as his kids lay down there his family our I don't know I don't I honestly I can't get my head around it I certainly can get my heart to it but I can't get my head around it the crime that is unraveling that continues with the complicity of so many of those who call themselves Humane in what capitals enabling this kind of genocide against entire families against entire people this is just unheard of in today's world to happen like that in front of our own eyes day in day out minute after minute hour after hour people die in their hundreds yesterday more than 700 people died today we don't know how many people died but we certainly know that our family is dying and um Marwan you know this is a this is a reminder and all the Palestinians that we've spoken to whether they're our own correspondents whether they're our guests whether they are you know doctors anybody who lives in Gaza right now for the last 18 days they've all said there's a Common Thread to what they've all said which is they've all said there is no safe place in Gaza right now there is no safe place in Gaza you whether it's the north whether it's the South whether it's an unas School whether it's a a hospital whether it's a live standup position for a reporter there is nobody who can guarantee if I go here you know I know that I will be alive and so I know that personally each time I speak to our reporters who are in Gaza and we try to open most hours with what's happening on the ground in Gaza where 2.3 million Palestinians live each time I talk to them I do have that in the back of my mind they have families you know how are their families doing will their families frankly still be alive by the end of our coverage of this conflict and this uh tragic incident comes to prove once again not that it was needed but prove once again that there is no safe place for anyone whether they're doctors reporters um un staff anybody I I know you are uh you are very care with your words but really this is much more than an incident this is a crime a deliberate crime the Israelis are targeting civilians the Israeli president said there are no Innocents in Gaza well here here it is Mr hsog the president of Israel tell me if these children are not innocent when you say there are no innocence in Gaza and everyone supports Hamas I want you to tell me you who this crime is in your responsibility this genocide has been called by Israeli president and Israeli Prime Minister enabled by the leaders of Western democracies this is it when when in a in an area like Gaza an open air prison a church is bombed a mosque is bombed a hospital is bombed another hospital is bombed one4 of residential areas are bombed a million people are made homeless within 10 days two weeks what kind of humanity is this when there is no mask no church no hospital is safe American president talks about the laws of war the laws of war bombing hospitals schools hospitals and schools and Moses these are supposed to be the safe havens for believers and nonbelievers yes there is no safe place in Gaza there there are no safe anything in Gaza and said oh I can't see that not I mean the children the children more than 2,000 children have been killed massacred by this bombing because some Israeli leaders think it is their right to kill in order to maintain a gruesome occupation a gruesome Siege of a people who only want freedom that's the only thing they want Justice they want to be able to see and fresh air without looking up and seeing Bombs riging over them this is not a lie life when a hospital a school a Mosk is not safe anymore Maran um look thank you for sharing your thoughts uh just moments after we found out that uh our colleague who lost his wife his son and his daughter we'll talk to you again um gather your thoughts and we'll come back and we'll talk to you again as we we need to continue to talk about this thank you veryone very much Marwan bishar I'm going to turn to alzer's Gaza producer safwat kahut safwat you're joining us now on the phone uh from Gaza you know while I don't know if you knew his family it's just it's almost 8:30 where you are in the Gaza Strip and for viewers who are just joining us uh we are saddened to have to report that um aljaz correspondent while ALU lost his wife son and daughter as a result of the shelling of their house in nerat in the central Gaza Street safat back to you what can you tell me about while and and his family if you knew them let me pay condolences for first while ourselves and for the whole Palestine for their losers I know while for more than 20 years when he started to work for the local daily uh National daily called Al then gradually he uh moved to work for TV satellite I think it was Iranian one and then Al jazer was lucky that they got uh I know about his family his family was is one of the most famous families in in the G STP uh it's a well known family um um reputable family well we need in a long time to talk about and his strugging as a journalist three years ago we met in the Bure that we have evacuated and I we have been or we should do some reports from Sha hospital and I met W in the P I said why don't you to move to a safe place he asked me do you recommend a safe place I said no so now he play the bell for reporting the truth which was expected and now even we have been receiving lots of phone call from relatives to move and change our places especially those who live abroad thinking that there could be a safe [Applause] place take your time take your time safw what um no it's the moment that needs everybody besides him but fortunately too dangerous and to reach him and stay with him in these difficult moments My Sons even because once we visited his family especially with as for a family visit my wife met his wife personally she said I loved his wife she's a struggler in terms of growing up lots of children good family good husband we all feel sorry for what happened and especially that we cannot reach while and stay with him at these difficult moments that is that is another pain to add to what what we suffer from now have you SE have you spoken to him recently I mean have you in in the last few moment we tried we tried we tried but you know the network is not uh about helping it's uh most of the time there is a failure in the networks either cellular or uh internet I'm now by the way using uh Israeli SIM card just to get connected with you because of the failure and the continuous failer of the network um we some of our colleagues decided to go but then finally they had some explosions in the nearby they they changed their minds as he say he has been saying no safe place and as Maran said a while ago doctors journalist everyone is a Target and cannot you cannot be safe or you cannot get or move to another place now even one of my friends asked me to put one of my children in a different house so at least one of them could could survive I wish well if we could find a safe place from the the beginning and he could help his family this is surprised that we expect that the journalist would say it few days ago by the way there was intensive bombardment near and next to the place where I'm displaced to I took my children and I try to move to a safer place when the family or when the people living in that building they knew that I'm from Al jazer they were all scared and they told me literally you you could be a threat for the whole building safat can you can we pause for a second explain that to our viewers um you think and tell me tell me if I'm understanding all of this right but you're telling our viewers that as a reporter you think that you are specifically you and other journalists a Target on account of your work bringing information out of Gaza you think that not only yourselves are targets but also your family am I understanding all of that right if I was 50% sure now I 100% sure after what happened to Wild family yes and this is what we hear from people wherever we go we put uh TV Fon in our car or indication so people you know they say you're journalist you are a Target so try to move to another place that's why some what some people say because they follow the Israeli News everybody is listening to the local and Israeli news and everybody knew almost about Israeli decision to shut down Al jaaz offices uh in in in Israel so this decision in Israel they might follow the law to to shut down Al jazer and but in other places they might use something different to to stop Al jaaz from telling the truth and from reporting what's happening I have been receiving also in my my um Facebook lots of I don't want to say trats but people claiming from the west from Israel that we are telling lies and that we are not telling the truth something like that we try to explain to them we are are not part B part in this conflict I mean what happened I mean in the armed conflict but they still attack and criticize us as um you know as if we were killing lies from their point of view and that we are a threat to their uh existence something like that you know it's not really lovely what you receive no and you know saf what it's something that uh jazer has had to say out loud along with others many times that journalism is not a crime and it Bears repeating and it will bear repeating that journalism is not a crime um tell me about W's family because my understanding uh I don't know how much you know about this is that he moved his family from the northern part of Gaza he was one of the many Palestinians who heeded Israel's call to leave the north when Israel said it would start even heavier bombardment of the northern part of the Gaza Strip and he moved his family as I understand it to the south in order to be safe because Israel said at the time this is a few days ago um that the north would not be safe but the South would be is that am I getting this right yes by the way while while family was hit in Alat refugee camp in the central area of the Gaz I myself I'm staying in the city which is 5 kilm were far from Wild's family so yes we were displaced and followed the instructions if we can say instructions uh thinking that we are in safe place or could be safe but when we arrive to this place it's same same suffering same bombardments same uh inhuman uh conditions as uh we have been reporting before we spend the day looking for water for our children so and we have been as as you could see around 24 hours from Naser hospitals U people arriving Parts into to the hospitals children women elderly people so there is no safe place and all these um instructions that we receive or thst to evacuate the North to the South When we arrive to the South we found we found it even in some places even more dangerous than the North and Gaza City many people by the way returned back to Gaza and including my father by way by the way who remained who stayed with me couple of days and then he decided to return to jabalia refugee camp uh because when he came he thought it could be a safe or safer let's say but then he realized that all the areas are dangerous and suffer from same crisis same danger same bombardments today one of even one of my colleagues who were displaced he came to visit me with his family and he was considering staying with me in my place but suddenly the the fighting the fighter gets bombarded in my area so he even took his family and look for another safer place and again there is no safer place the the south is not an independent region and is not an independent Governor whole govern is controlled by the crossings that controlled by the Israelis and since Israel is controlling these Crossings the same humanitarian problem the same humanitarian crisis the same bombardment the s16 that bombard jabalia is the same one that bombard and the of the south of the Gaza Tri now we from every now and then we can hear even the Israeli artillery bom ing in east of the of the central and southern area of the Gaza Strip so there's no real safe place all over the Gaza Strip and by the way Gaza is very small even if they bombard the north people in the South they could hear it so it's very small place in terms of distance and um and population safat thank you very much uh for you know get getting your thoughts together and sharing all of that both your thoughts all the information and the reporting that you just also gave us um we appreciate you and we will come back to you uh shortly that's alzer's Gaza producer safat kahut who was just joining us on the phone from inside the Gaza Strip moments after Al Shazer learned that our colleague Al Gaza correspondent while ALU lost wife son and daughter in a strike in an Israeli strike on the nerat uh camp in the central Gaza Strip the aljazera family naturally presents its condolences to uh yel and we grieve with him at this hour H Abdul Hamid is in rala in the occupied West Bank H what can you share with us you've met while before you know him well I would say that when it comes to Gaza there is us the journalist and then there is w dhu and W dhu by far is the voice of Gaza he is the man who relentlessly regardless of the situation is out there in the field giving a voice giving a face uh explaining what's happening in Gaza and I would and he does that not only in times of War but also in times where there is no conflict but still life is extremely uh difficult for people in Gaza and EXT and for him as well because he's part of of of the Gaza social fabric his family is part of the Gaza social fabric so whatever pressure people in Gaza feel they feel it as well and while always manages to keep coldhead go in front of the camera and just report things as they are and you know and I was listening now to safat kahut and how broken he is I could relate to that because also for the AL jazer Family W is the focal point uh you go to w to ask about things you w gives you if you're not really understanding a story he will explain it to you and he always tries to keep you on the a right track and it also touches saf all of our staff in Gaza uh so what happened to W's family so much because they Pro probably think what's going to happen to our family is this the same thing that's going to happen uh how we going to how is W going to be we need W because W is our boss so certainly I I just hav been there so many times I can just imagine that this tragedy definitely touches wild the most but it definitely touches every single person in that Bureau and I would say that a lot of people in Gaza regardless of what they are personally going through they would also feel for while simply because a lot of people told me that when I was in Gaza and I've been there many times during Wars after Wars people tell you that W is our voice is the man who gives us dignity is the one who reminds the rest of the world that we exist that we're having a hard time so I think this his tragedy is a tragedy that just going to touch many other uh people in Gaza regardless of what they're going through and it's going to touch many journalist I mean just a few hours ago uh we were watching a video of a journalist here in the occupied West Bank Muhammad Al far he was sitting in a car and he also broke down in tears because he had just received a phone call that his sister and members of her family uh had died also in an a strike in Gaza journalists are being Palestinian journalists are being touched so close to home by this tragedy by by the conflict that's going on to Gaza 23 have already died inside this trip and it and then you look at other journalists people like well they will continue reporting just a week ago he was at the hospital alah hospital at that horrific bombing that happened there hundreds of people died there and I remember him saying to the cameraman don't put don't show some of the some of what he was saying seeing was so gruesome he did not want to share it but he was there reporting over and O throughout the night and just to see him tonight at the hospital himself carrying a baby just like the people he's been reporting on is a picture that shocked me I have to say and didn't shock only me it would shock many Palestinians and many people around the Arab world because that's how famous Wu is but seeing him carrying I think that baby was maybe one of his grandchildren I'm not really sure but seeing him breaking down he all of a sudden was not W ddu the journalist he was that W the son of Gaza who is going through the same tragedy as everyone else in Gaza yeah Huda uh absolutely uh and frankly we don't lean into the type of Journalism at aljazera where we insert ourselves into the story we try to stay out of it but as when it comes to Gaza that's almost impossible because whether it's our correspondents or their families there you know they are in it along with the 2.3 million Palestinians who all say that there is no safe place for them and that they don't know where to go to make sure that they won't be the victims of an Israeli bombardment ABD Hamid reporting from rala in the occupied West Bank thank you very much for that I do want to uh bring you I can bring you now um W's words moments after he found out that he lost his wife his son and his daughter in a bombardment on nerat refugee camp in the Gaza Strip he said and this is a rough translation what happened is clear it's a continuation of the targeting of women and children and civilians we were reporting on the strikes in general I was focusing on the a yarmuk area and after returning from this demolished area I was reporting on the air strikes that have targeted all the areas including Alat we were suspected uh suspecting that the Israeli occupation will not leave those without punishment and unfortunately that's what happened this is the supposedly safe area that the occupying forces were talking about the ethical Army it's a big catastrophe especially when the victims are children and women no more no less a large number um so those were Wild's words moments after he found out that he lost his closest family members his wife his son um his children while ALU Al correspondent inside the Gaza Strip I can turn now to Y yna you're our correspondent you work inside Gaza you have a family inside Gaza I know this must be hitting you hard what can you tell us it's a shock that we reporters who report to the world what's happening around us have to report the stories of our fellow colleague or he has to report the story of his own why is always known to us as the tough man and the strong man we all turn we all turned to him when we were where we're in tragedies when we're not feeling safe we call him on a daily basis every day just to say tell us is this going to end soon and we're journalists and we're working here and we know it's not he calms everyone he tells us to take care of our families he speaks to us like a big brother not just a bu Chief in Gaza he's always there when we need him it's very heartbreaking to be reporting about's family and to see how broken he is he did not leave God the city he stayed there despite all the threats and warnings because of all the bombardments that were ongoing in Gaza and did not stop for for 19 days in a row now I I just show him a couple of days ago and I said it's very dangerous in the buau why don't you leave he said almost all the crew is in mood hospital I must be here in Gaza City to report about these people who are getting boms every day he you didn't give up on them you want to leave you were explaining you were you were saying to our viewers while is Gaza bureau chief for aljazera you're an aljazera correspondent you're both in the middle of this war you both have families um you've shared to our viewers and to your social media followers a little bit of what it's like to be a correspondent and a mom in this territory that's being relentlessly bombarded I wonder did he ever give you uh advice while on you know how you handle that the professional side of your life and also the personal side of your life and how you keep your family safe and how you handle all of that side of things asked him I told him what what should I do he told me I'm sorry but there is no safe place in Goda he literally told me like this I told him I went to the South and the bombardment was relentless it did not stop there was no water there was no electricity I struggled to get drinking water for my kids he said Gaza is just like the South it's just it's all just a fake propaganda to go to the South people are being killed in the South just like they are in Gaza City and this is what we have been witnessing since day one hundreds of people who had EV who had evacuated to the the South including me returned back to Gaza thousands not just hundreds thousands that I know myself they came back because hundreds others of those who evacuated were killed in the bombardments of the South he told me I'm sorry I can't I can't tell you I can't lie to you and tell you there is a safe place to turn to there's no safe place in Goda and this is really the reality what what we're living every day you were referring to the fact that uh many Palestinians left the north went to the South when Israel warned gazin to go down to the south in order to avoid bombardments and then you reminded our viewers um something which has been true for many days now which is even in the South there are many many bombardments and it is not a safe place despite the fact that Israel uh told more than a million people to go there uh and you were just saying that hundreds of people who came from the north ended up dying in the South uh in these bombardments can you share with us your story because you decided to take your family back to the northed to take my family back to the north because literally the bombardments were all in the south every single moment everywhere everywhere we turned to there was a home bombarded with civilian the home itself next to the towers residential Towers where I was staying bombarded the resal tow most of my nephew was injured with other people in those Towers they were severely injured from that home bombardment and until now we're still witnessing bombardment everywhere in South why should we stay in the South when it's the same condition there's no water there's no food there's no electricity and there is ongoing bombardment it's the same conditions that we're talking about in Gaza City there is no difference at all there is no justification for us for isra to go to the South if one day just one day was a safe day for us one night that we slept and we hoped that we would wake up alive we did not hug our kids very close to us and kiss them because we might not wake up again in every night just in the South just like we do in Gaza City we wouldn't have returned yna we thank you uh well we thank you for many things first of all I thank you for joining us on the phone uh moments after we all found this out and everybody is shocked and I think viewers can well understand that and uh we're all grieving for Wild's family here so thank you for joining us on the phone for that and also just before I let you go an immense thank you uh for the risks you've been taking to bring information to us and to our viewers out of the Gaza Strip and uh you just pulled back the curtain you know more than we typically like to do about what your personal situation has been and you going from the north to the South when you have a young daughter and you have a family and you have to think about their safety so uh we thank you for all of that and uh we hope for everybody's continued safety thank you very much yimo it's uh 5:47 GMT it's just before 9:00 therefore in uh Gaza and I want to remind you of what has happened the family of aljazera correspondent W dhu has been killed in an Israeli air strike in central Gaza W's wife son and daughter are among the victims the dhu family used to live in Gaza City but when the Israeli Army issued an evacuation order while sent them to Al nera's refugee camp for their safety which is further south he remained behind to report on the situation in Northern Gaza and while was reporting from Gaza City on Wednesday evening when he was told that the house his family was staying and had been hit while son Mahmud was in his final year of high school his daughter sham was just 7 years old other members of W's family are still missing now W spoke to reporters at the hospital in Gaza moments after he found out and this is what he had to say of course we are in a big Calamity right now a big tragedy especially it's perpetrated against women and children no more no less than a Calamity large numbers of people's houses bombarded however this is the custom of the Israeli occupation at the end of the day we are in on this land this is our destiny this is our destiny and this is our choice and this is our patience and we won't deviate from this path I want to talk now to Sarah kyat Sarah you're in occupied East Jerusalem Sarah I think you've heard our coverage over the last 50 minutes or so uh you know I I'm I'm going around and I'm talking to our teams on the ground and we're talking to people who knew while you've been to Gaza you know also what he represents in terms of Journalism there I I'm not sure whether you met him at the time or not um what can you tell us at this very early stage while we're still trying to all of us put our thoughts together and our emotions in order as well s yes s well um that was back in February when I went to Gaza and I met all of the team from Al jazer Arabic to the AL jazer english team incredibly welcoming and um you know the circumstances there have been difficult they're working under very difficult circumstances of course I would have went well as I did with all of them they um always tried to remain uh you know welcoming in a way that uh to show you what what gazer is like and to show you that um people in Gaza are some of the friendliest when you're living under such uh tragic circumstances they would make light sometimes of their situation they share uh they have a good sense of humor in Gaza and of course that was the case also with W as well in the bureau there that Bureau um that I was staying at and worked from um was a replacement office if you like for the one that had been bombed in 2021 in an Israeli air strike and we even uh they took me in the car and we went and had a look and I pointed out a massive crater not knowing that's where the building that where it stood and they said oh that's where our old office was um and of course many of the journalists there and this including ourselves have been targeted in in more ways than one since covering uh this conflict because it's become incredibly divisive um also you know I was there in occupied West Bank when it was the oneyear anniversary for the death of our colleague abair and it just really brings to home the devastation that it can cause not just to the story that we're covering but also the people that are covering uh that story you know we've been in touch with our colleagues there and as you heard from yomna the fear is real um we just heard from uh prime minister benjam Benjamin netan the Israeli Prime Minister who's had another statement that's come out and in that statement he urges again once again the people in Gaza to move from the north to the South and that is just what's just happened now with w and his family is just another proof um that something they've been saying time and time again that nowhere is safe this uh rhetoric that the government keeps pushing the Israeli government is to move but really the south is being bombarded as is the Rafa Crossing as is the north um and I just wanted to add sirl um just uh less well about 24 hours ago um W himself and our Al jazer Arabic crew what many of our viewers don't know is they were filming a live from the top of the rooftop from the bureau and a massive explo a massive uh strike struck another building about 20 to 30 MERS away and it clearly rattled them it was a very close call it was a huge explosion um and they could even the debris was flying across with them at the rooftop it was flying across and they had to duck down including W himself it's all on video it was all filmed live and that was just 24 hours ago and here you are and unfortunately the you know the tragedy of this war is that journalists are not immune and neither are their families Sarah I note what you told us that Israel is still at this hour and on this day calling for gazin to head south even though it is you know beyond any doubt and it is well established and documented at this stage and has been for days that there is nowhere safe in Gaza and that both bombardments are continuing in the North in the South and in the central part of Gaza Sarah hyro thank you for sharing that information and your thoughts with us uh at this hour Sultan Barakat you're professor of public policy at hammad bin Khalifa University here in Doha you've been on set with us this afternoon uh this is the last thing we expected and wanted to be talking about there I'm not sure what you want to share with us but you've been sitting beside me for a whole hour you've heard what everybody's had to say it's absolutely Terri it's heartbreaking really and uh my condolences to while and to the whole family of Al jazer but it does illustrate that there is no safe place in Gaza at the moment uh while moved his people his family to a refugee camp refugee camp by definition should have been protected to start with so nothing can protect anyone and I think as long as Israel has the uh green light from the United States we are likely to see worse and worse this has just happened to be a real uh a real time example unfolded in front of all of us with someone that we know personally so you can you can just an illustration of what millions of people are suffering from and I would just like to quote from Biden's speech on the 19th of October in Tel AV and I hope he also now is watching this news and can feel the black hole he said when he talked about the Israeli victims he talked about the black hole in the middle of their chest and now there's a black hole in what in theid middle of wild chest and the everyday small things that he will miss with his wife and children including that morning coffee and I use this specifically because there is this business of De dehumanizing the Palestinians they don't do the everyday thing these people just run around trying to survive all the time while the other side is the Civilized world where they sit for coffee meet each other uh feel for their relatives and I think it's time to stop all this I mean the same uh president who gave that speech I hope now there will be something said from the United States to try and bring some sanity to this crazy situation thanks for sharing that with us and thanks for also reminding us of that quote uh I'll take that to Maran Bashar uh ales you're senior political analyst at this hour Marwan you know you're of course you're our analyst but you're you're you're an Al you're a staff you're a colleague of w we're all feeling this on a on a personal deeply human level um so I suppose I suppose that you know we're this is a kind of a message to our viewers that we're we're doing our best to report and normally we don't put ourselves in the middle of the story but the fact is with Gaza it's different because everybody including our reporters and their family are right in the middle of it and nowhere is safe Marwan your thoughts yes absolutely I I just can't begin to imagine how well it must be feeling now uh he's always had that steady voice so I cannot really tell how he's feeling I certainly can't even begin to imagine being in his place um paradoxically uh I I also come to learn the last few minutes that in fact he he reported on that story he actually reported on the killing of his family of his children not knowing they were the victims of that woman so imagine you report on another human tragedy happening in Gaza because of the Israeli bombing and then you find that it's your own family and you find out it's your own children and I I can only think of one thing here just in terms of Netanyahu and his ilk regardless of their religion and nationality there's a special place in Hill for the killers of children all right Marwan mishar thank you very much will be talking to you throughout the evening uh we're going to reset we're going to take a short break I just want to remind everybody who's been with us of what's just happened the family of aljazera correspondent wild dhu has been killed in an Israeli a strike in central Gaza Wild's wife son and daughter are among the victims his son Mahmud was in his final year of high school his daughter sham was just seven years old we're back in a moment
