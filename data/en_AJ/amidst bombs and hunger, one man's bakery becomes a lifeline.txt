I am the young man Majed Al-Naezi from Gaza. I was displaced to a garage in the city of Rafah after the brutal aggression on the Gaza Strip. I decided to start a project after my source of income in the city of Gaza was cut off. I started a new project that I can use to support my children and my children in the city of Rafah. I start my day at 12:00.  At dawn, we start making the dough. When I finish it, my wife starts covering a distance. I go and get the breasts. I borrow them from the oven I want to bake in. Peace be upon you. My wife and I are in this project so that we can cover our expenses as if we were displaced people, because the cost of living is high. We suffer from a complete lack of tools.  We borrow them from our neighbors, for example, the table, the soup table, and the dough we use to make these pastries. We also suffer from the high prices of the raw materials used in making these pastries. For example, the high price of the ghee was 17 shekels, now it is 75 shekels for 3 liters. I also suffer from the story that I bake in an oven, in an old oven.  Primitive, that is, if I had a gas oven, I would produce a faster quantity and it would help me produce these pastries better and faster. I am on the way to selling pastries. I hope this war ends, and God willing, this way I will be able to have my own project, so I can get the tools myself and buy a gas oven and bake on it.  Alone, because I suffer a lot with this method. Fresh pastries, guys. Fresh
