we are actually going to stay on ear we're going to go back to the United Nations security Council where Riyad Mansour is speaking the Palestinian ambassador to the UN let's listen in want to express our appreciation to Algeria uh Guana and Slovenia for convening this important meeting today and I want also to add to express our appreciation to the unanimous decision by the Arab group yesterday requesting through our representative the ambassador of Algeria to ask for this meeting and those the two other countries Guana and Slovenia for joining in this endeavor I want also to uh thank the two brief two briefers from Ocha and save the children Mr Raja singam and Madame sorto for their briefings Madame President allow me to address you today not only in Your Capacity as diplomats preserving representing your States but as parents and grandparents as daughters and sons as members of families that you love and cherish last night a Palestinian father sat powerless by the bedside of his twomon old baby watching him die slowly of hunger after searching for hours and days for baby formula in Northern Gaza to no avail a mother had to leave her children in their home for their safety while she went out to try and find flower she heard a loud bombardment as she reached the streets Corner rushed back with no flower only to find her home destroyed and her kids killed we speak of this terrifying assault against life in Gaza in days and months 180 days 6 months but parents calculate in hours agonize in minutes and seconds and they wonder how much longer longer will they have to wait how much longer can they preserve shreds of life before them too they are torn apart to how many children will they have to bid an eternal farewell or how many children will they leave behind if they are to perish Israel has destroyed the homes killed entire families displaced the entire population demolished the hospitals and made every effort to ensure to help could re to to to ensure no help could reach our people it is killing those who heal those who rescue those who provide Aid and relief those who feed those who report being a Palestinian is enough to be killed trying to help to help Palestinians like this Brave woman and their organization is enough to be killed you saw it over two weeks in a shefer hospital where Israel summerly executed people arrested and tortured them including the wounded and the sick and medical personnel without feeling the need to provide much explanation or any evidence it then burned down the most important Hospital in the entire Gaza Strip continue ing to bring the health system to its needes at the time it is most needed to save lives we present our deepest condolences to the families of medical personnel of rescue teams me members and of over 2008 workers who have been killed and express our admiration to all the humanitarians who are pursuing their sacred Mission at the Peril of their lives they should not be abandoned but rather supported and protected the killing of the aid workers from the world Central Kitchen is not an isolated incident it is confirmation of what you are all knew for months now Israel is targeting those that the laws of war were established to protect Israel knew very well who it was targeting hitting three cars in three locations despite the fact that they were identifiable and had coord coordinated with Israel the delivery of aid it says it suspected one person so it killed many never mind distinction precautions proportionality protected status never mind human decency it is unfortunate that it took the killing of foreign Nationals for some to fully acknowledge the fa reserved to Palestinians for 180 days now as the world Central Kitchen CEO eloquently said and I quote this is not only an attack against wck this is an attack on humanitarian organizations showing up in the most dire of situations where food is being used as a weapon of War this is unforgivable end of quotation it is even more unforgivable that Israel as occupying power is the one with responsibility in ensuring that the civilian population is not harmed or starved and instead it is not only inflicting such harm and starvation but also killing those trying to alleviate them for Israel the entire civilian population and any one helping them and the ENT the entire civilian infrastructures are legitimate targets it's enough to call them quote unquote collateral damage Express grief and move on to committing the next crime Israel basist ly argued that the problem was in the organization delivering life-saving humanitarian assistance on Rua whose role is fundamental and who is doing heroic work on the ground now even the NGS who have worked in the worst possible circumstances around the world are saying they cannot operate in Gaza because of the environment created by Israel Madame President Israel while killing with its bombs and Bullets Over 32,000 Palestinians and Ming over 72,000 Palestinians have also made sure to create a man-made famine the worst of its kind affecting over 2 million people besieged and starved with tons of assistance by a few kilometers away who can still speak of shared values with Israel that is committing such crimes without being Devo devoured by shame this Council finally demanded an immediate ceasefire leading to a lasting and sustainable ceasefire Israel ignored this demand resolution 2728 must be implemented it is the responsibility of this Council and all states to ensure that it is upheld the icj ordered Israel twice in the last two months to undertake measures to prevent the real and imminent threat of genocide including to take all necessary and effective measures to ensure without delay in full cooperation with the United Nations the unhindered provision at scale of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to Palestinians throughout Gaza but Israel breached the order the problem is not that the council adopted resolutions or that the icj ordered provisional measures or that Humanity has elaborated the rules that led the UN bodies to adopt these positions and which should be observed the problem is that Israel can violate these rules demands and orders in full impunity no one should arm or Shield those committing atrocities no one no country should arm or Shield those committing atrocities they must be held accountable or these crimes will continue faced with such outrage for its attack attack on foreign Nationals from the world Central Kitchen Israel took its first measures dismissing two senior officers and reprimanding three others that is the punishment for the commission of war crimes that is outrageous and who will be held accountable for all the tens of thousands thousand of Palestinian civilians killed Is Our Lives not worthy of holding accountable those who murder us and kill us in large numbers Madame President history will remember that Israel continued to be present Within These Walls while trying to bring down the UN and the international law-based order this organization this organization stands for destroying and displacing an entire people and denying their right to existence and their state unchecked and unhinged while the state of Palestine committed to the rule of international law and to the just and Lasting peace has has yet to become a member of these United Nations this is only one more Injustice to which our people is being subjected to one more contradictions between the clarity of the statements and ambiguity of certain actions there are no nuances no ifs and buts no justification ations for what Israel is doing none let me repeat there are no nuances no ifs and buts no justification of what Israel is doing none and there is no justification for the continued denial of our right to self-determination and to freedom and dignity in our land we knew you will you all knew what was coming 6 months ago we knew and you knew Israel would resort to mass and indiscriminate killing to total Destruction and Devastation and that the famine was on the way this genocide was announced by Israeli leaders it was perpetrated in broad daylight right it was displayed in your own screens it was discussed in your meetings many of you were mobilized to stop it but there are still tools that were not used not even considered one day as for other genocides a lot will be said about these failures but we cannot wait action is needed now at every level with every means possible I Call On You individually and col collectively to do more now to figure out a way to stop these massacres and this PR pre pre mediated meditated killing of children and women and men I call on you to bring immediate relief to desperate parents who have witnessed what no parent should endure and children who have suffered what no children should suffer for 260,000 minutes now for 260,000 minutes now our fa failures mean death that should be reason enough for us to do everything in our power to bring this tragedy to an end thank you Madame President I thank
