a huge obstacle to getting humanitarian Aid into Gaza are the Border checks Israel insists on making before trucks are allowed to enter let's take you through the process you see supplies arrive in Cairo on cargo ships at Port s or by plane at Alish airport well eight trucks due to enter Gaza are checked by Israeli authorities at nitana but they then have to cross back into Egypt where they head to the rafah crossing the last time any truck was allowed to pass through rafah was February the 4th or they go to the Israeli controlled Kum Abu salum Crossing for inspection and enter there now before the War Began around 500 trucks a day crossed into Gaza through Karam Abu salum almost none are getting through now let's speak now to Abdul wahab hammed he's the Gaza office manager at Jud for community and rural development a local NGO joins us on the phone from Rafa good to have you with us let me start with a basic obvious first question is any Aid getting into Gaza right now thank you thank you very much for bringing me in Sammy actually the there there has been a deliberate delay of a humanitarian Aid at trucks by Israel especially during the the past few days that Shalom Crossing where the aid is received by the unan site and a Consortium led by un and run in partnership with other unan agencies and international NOS now this is the denial of access to food water and basic necessities this by itself constitutes a serious violation of international law and humanitarian principles now during the past few weeks the aid coming into Gaza is or getting the throw into Gaza is very limited we speak roughly of 80 to 100 we used to speak about an 80 to 100 trucks of AG received on a daily basis now during the P few days no Aid is is getting this world into Gaza uh this makes the the already this undermines the already vulnerable conditions of Palestinians now in in ra you know in the midet of the last remaining sanctuary in in Gaza ra which is a very small stb on the Egyptian border and which shelters over a million and a half displaced Palestinians now our our BL here is UN imagable with some residing in tents and others seeking refuge in makeshift shelters these displaced individuals have endured these dire conditions for months now RAF also as you know lacks major hospitals only relying on extremely small clinics primarily for basic medical assistance and occasional referrals for the treatment now the Israeli threat also to enter ra would have severe consequences and and it will be a plattin violation of international humanitarian law current stands as the largest refugee camp on Earth and any Israeli military action also here would be legally reprehensible now the situation is further Complicated by conflicting Israeli statements hting at ethnic cleansing against Palestinians actually they have said it explicitly many many many times urging Palestinians to evacuate some have already uh by the way some Palestinians have already returned to homes in Central in central Gaza While others just remain in ra andure of safe Heaven okay let me jump in because you've mentioned a few important points one I want to pick up on is you said if I've understood correctly you said no Aid has entered Gaza for the past few days is that in fact the situation no Aid at all has entered Gaza I mean how are people how long can people go on for before food runs out well actually I I think it's imperative for international organization and those who are engaged in relief processes to tell civilians shuring Gaza about their limitations so people plan their life according to the limitations of those engaged in the relief processes this is so so important you know people now in the north they eat animal food the first statement made by Israel Before the War Began was how to food to water and to fuel their animals and we should behave ACC condently this is happening right now alas this is happening in the north okay in the South we still can like we have very limited access to food but at least we we we can have in the north they don't okay they're starving to death uh we have very limited access I mean Safe Drinking Water we speak roughly of 1 to two liters per person b day with with 5% coming from the central by with with the rest being in water tanks it is disheartening and it is troubling to witness this much of negotiations over humanitarian guarantees and increased access to Aid in exchange for the leas of hostages this would potentially delute the urgency to put an in to the suffering in Kasa it is a tring to witness the International Community fter in such a great crisis this must end this madness the surv for killing this killing for killing must stop you mentioned if I jump in again you mentioned that some people have left Rafa assumedly out of fear of a of a ground Israeli ground Invasion where do they go what is awaiting them because the North and Central parts of Gaza according to reports have been destroyed even more heavily than the South yes it is disheartening because civilians now they started to allocate themselves where it's safer not now the the the the the illusion of safe designated area has has just been shattered because because people have been into unrelenting cycle of displacement and loss for the past four months Ra was declared it's the military claims to be a safe Zone a couple of weeks ago now they pump everywhere okay even during the past five days like we had Relentless bombardments all across ra which is the military claims to be a safe zone so now this Shadow the illusion of self designated area civilian now they live in constant fear and panic particularly women and children uh they have nowhere to go uh and and it's good to bring up this now the conflict has reshaped the physical realities of Gaza the physical landscape and it has gone so far destabilizing gaza's geotechnic Foundation now the destruction of Gaza geotechnic foundation will be hindering life impossible for 2.3 million Palestinians living in the St they've been they've been hitting really deep in the ground 50 70 60 M now this is like it is distinguishing any resemblance of life for the people of Gaza causing its citizens to evacuate but Noah safe in Gaza even if they evacuate back words saying to to to the middle of Gaza and to to to to to to to other areas you know 65% of hospitals of the operating hospitals stopped to operate already they've been they've been running very low of efficienc of efficiency due to either being bombed partially destroyed or completely damaged so even if yes all right thank you so much for uh conveying to us the picture there of what is transpiring yes thank you thank you
