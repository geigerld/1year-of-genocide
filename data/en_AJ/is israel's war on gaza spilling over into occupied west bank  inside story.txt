is Israel's war on Gaza now spilling over into the occupied West Bank Israeli forces have conducted their largest assault in decades killing and injuring dozens of Palestinians the escalation is coupled with increasing settler violence so what are the consequences this is Inside Story [Music] hello there I'm James Bay on Wednesday Israeli forces launched a large scale military operation in the occupied West Bank for days they've carried out drone strikes and hundreds of troops of storm cities and refugee camps Israel insists it's targeting Fighters but Palestinians say it's attacking homes and civilian infrastructure the escalation is Raising fears that the war on Gaza is spreading into other pal inan territories so will the assault open another military front for Israel we'll explore all this with our guests in a moment but first this report from Kata Lopez hodan the scale and scope of the latest Israeli assaults marked the largest Bank in more than two decades troops accompanied by armored vehicles drones and bulldozers stormed four Northern cities and refugee camps tearing up roads roads and destroying infrastructure homes left to burn now line the streets of these Palestinian neighborhoods me civil defense teams came to put out the fire but Israeli forces didn't let them through we broke the bathroom window and managed to get out my wife's shoulder and arm were burned thank God that was all Palestinians say the frustration is overwhelming this house belongs to an old woman they destroyed it there were walls and a road here they destroyed them my relative's house was damaged with missiles and drones Israel says it's targeting Palestinian armed factions with links to Iran and what it describes as counterterrorism operations we have evidence of Iranian trying to smuggle weapons and we have seen Rising Terror attacks in Israel so we take the measures necessary to pre prent Terror activities in Israel the day long assault on the occupied West Bank is Raising fears that Israel's war on Gaza could escalate regionally Israel is already preparing for teran's promised retaliation after the assassination of Hamas political leader isma Han and its exchanges of fire with Hezbollah along the border with Lebanon have intensified we must expand the goals of the war and include the safe return of Israel's Northern residents to their homes on the Northern Lebanon border safely an increase in il legal settlements is also fueling tensions more than 700,000 Israeli settlers live in the occupied West Bank and violence against Palestinians has risen since October the 7th the eu's foreign policy Chief Joseph Burell is calling for sanctions a suggestion backed by some leaders we will be supporting y perel's um recommendation for sanctions uh in respect of uh settler organizations in the West Bank who were fermenting and who were facilitating expansion of settlements all these developments cast out on the chances of reaching an agreement for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of captives Kia Lopez oan Al jazer for insight story well let's discuss all of this in much more detail with today's panel of guests and today we have from West Jerusalem manaram Klein he's a professor of political science at bar Elan University in the Jordanian Capital am man is tahani Mustafa senior Palestine Analyst at the international crisis group and in rala abas milhem the executive director of the Palestinian Farmers Union his family farm was attacked by Israeli settlers last year so let's start our discussion on what's been going on in recent days in the West Bank um let's go first to you abas because you are our panelist who's there in the West Bank I know that you are in uh rala and most of this has been happening in the in in the northern part of the West Bank but tell me what does it feel like there because this we're told is the largest Israeli offensive since 2002 which is when um the then prime minister Ariel shiron took over the major cities of the West Bank during the second inter it's worse than 20 too absolutely I mean it's like an entire Invasion and attacks against everything in West Bank it's the Army and the settlers who are doing these invasions and these attacks you know targeting most of the farming communities and Farmers across their entire Farmland areas across West Bank from Janine in the South till from sorry from hon in the South till Janine in the north yes I'm based in ramala but my farm and my family I'm from Janina actually working in ramala because I'm the director the union but my farmlands and my family farmlands and my town is in Janine area that has been under ongoing attacks and violence by settlers and regular and repeated invasions by Israeli Army since October 7 until now although the Israeli attacks against Farmers did not start from October 7 but was intensified after October 7 the attacks before October 7 against Farmers from settlers was three attacks per day but now the average of the attacks are 11 attacks against Farmers per per day and these attacks have resulted in direct killings of farmers in their farm land like what happened with a farmer who part of the Union in aaia town between ramala and naos who was shot in the chest and killed by a group of settlers while this farmer was harvesting his Olive crops last year other Farmers from surra town near Nablus while plowing their Farmland they were killed also by settlers in addition to other tens of farmers and farming communities who were attacked severely by settlers groups who are doing these attacks under the full protection of the Israeli Army and then and finan and supported financially by the Ministry of Finance that is run by a sitler leader in the Israeli government who is so Mish so the situation in West Bank is more Beyond and more difficult and more complex than the one in 200 too where let me bring in monar let me bring in manaram in West Jerusalem abas has made it clear this has been going on for many many months uh in the last few days though a major military operation um Israel is saying it's planning to Target what it calls armed terrorists who pose a threat to security forces explain to me what you understand is the objective or aim of Israel's operation Israel trying to regain control over the West Bank the pa the the Palestinian Authority lost any control over the area from South up to the north and already before October 7 there was a a small Uprising in the Northwest Bank against both Mahmud abas PA regime and Israel the in the in the name of the close cooperation between the PA and Israeli security yes the PA have been seriously weakened by Israel have they not the the Israeli the Israeli goal is to control the area and actually it reminds me what happened in Gaza strep before the this war there were small raids since 2007 into the Gaza Street and the the photos that we see from tul reminds us what is going on in the Gaza strep the destruction and the violence that the Israeli Army uses and in Gaza the method in a small scale is implemented in the North in the Northwest Bank it is it it is a red flag showing what may happen in the next stage okay at the beginning of the program in Catcher's report we heard the claims of the Recycled ambassador to the United Nations for Israel Danny Donan now back in his old job that Israel Iran is supplying Palestinian with their weapons that is something putting everything at the hands of Iran that I've heard many times from Mr Danon having had dealings with him myself toan what do you make of those claims well look Israel has long talked up the threat of Iran to itself to us interests in the region and yes these groups may be uh receiving financial support from Iran uh however their Logistics are coming from in in some instances Israel's allies in the region like Jordan for example uh they may be getting some of it from Lebanon from Hezbollah uh you know it's it's irrelevant in terms of where they're actually getting their Logistics from these organizations are not Iranian puppets they are their own organizations and there is a context that is effectively leading to their reestablishment in September these groups were practically ineffective uh in some cases they were non-existent in places like Naas Janine they were severely weakened through targeted assassinations arrests today they have managed to reestablish themselves and that is precisely because uh of the the severe level of violence that these communities are facing these groups take a very def defensive posture that is what they are they are Community defense mechanisms that are pushing back against the violence an occupation now Israel thinks that it can reestablish a sense of security that it lost on the 7th of October by acting preemptively the way that it is by creating the kind of violence that we're seeing uh on more localized levels in the West Bank that we're seeing in Gaza uh Israeli ministers have made no secret about this they've actually come out and openly stated that they do intend to create uh sort of mini GSA scenarios across the West Bank you know this is coming from very senior levels the Finance Minister uh for instance has openly stated that they intend to do just that Ambassador Danon who I just mentioned was speaking uh in his answer at the UN in reply to a question from Al jaer one that he deliberately sidestepped and that was about comments of us that were made by Israel cats the Israeli foreign minister on X he said we need to deal with a threat exactly as we deal with Terror infrastru structure in Gaza including the temporary evacuation of Palestinian civilians and other steps needed abas what do you make of that the idea they're going to start moving large parts of the population in the West Bank potentially what there government is doing in West Bank is exactly implementing their own policy of annexation of the land and transferring of Palestinian this has been announced by the Netanyahu government in 2020 when he was calling for the annexation and imposing the Israeli law on the West Bank area it's not something new it's not yes but we Haven you've seen what's happened in Gaza entire parts of the population constantly on the Move forced evacuations how fearful are you that that sort of thing is coming to the West Bank they are doing the same and this is with what they publicly sit in their even Facebook pages saying that we will do exactly what we are doing in Gaza at the time when this genocidal work war is happening in Gaza there is an ethnic cleansing War occurring in West Bank although the war is focusing on Gaza in terms of this massive destruction of every living and L living there in Gaza the eyes of the Israeli government and the settlers are on the West Bank land they want the land empty from Farmers and empty from people to do so they are imposing and conducting all types of crimes there and I'm I'm really shocked to to listen to your guest from West Jerusalem saying that it is because those inine doing so and so the question why those people are doing so it is because the occupation is still there since 75 years until now those people are resisting and their message and the message of the entire Palestinian people is no more occupation in West Bank no more settlements in West Bank this land is an occupied land and the land is owned by Palestinians and from the time when Palestinians accepted this historical con and signed the oso agreement until now what we have gained was loss and loss of our land for the s for the s for the sake of settlement expansion this government does not believe in peace do not recognize Palestinian Independence right do not recognize even the existence of Palestinians as a human beings here what they have committed engine tarim toas and different parts in North North area of West is exactly what they are doing in Gaza it's the same policy the same killing machine that they are using in Gaza are using in West Bank and yes the fear among Palestinians in West Bank is on the high level they know that they are witnessing more and more massacres not only by the Army but also by the settlers who are protected and supported by the Army as well and the eyes is to Annex and impose the full control in the Palestinian land and they are justifies they are using no nothing can justify the killing of 40,000 people in Gaza where half of them are women and children nothing can justify controlling and stealing destroying all agricultural farm lands in West Bank for I I don't know for for what lies they are using I mean it's worth noting that the points you made on occupation are actually now backed by the top Court in the UN system the international court of justice uh with its ruling in July monar I'm telling to you I am still despite what you all told me a little confused about the timing of this current escalation by Israel because if you look at what Israel currently has on its plate it's still fighting in Gaza it's leadership is still supposed to be involved in detailed seesar negotiations so those those seem to have paused for the moment only days ago there was the heaviest exchange of um of fire between Israel and hisbah in Le and still pending we have the threat of Iranian retaliation for the assassination in tran of Ismael hania the Hamas leader so why now is Israel acting Israel operates in the West Bank bases on intelligence collection and op operation uh opportunities and whenever it is possible is Israel operates Israel does not take into consideration the Western word protest and the anger and it Israel feels that it has freeh hand to do whatever she wants in the West Bank and promote some radical hopes and visions of its government ministers they they plan to do in the West Bank what they did in Gaza they started with small portions they do they few weeks ago they did the same near Jericho expulsion of weakened population happened in the Jordan Valley and South Hill Hebron the the problem with the Israeli from Israeli perspective the problem of the Northwest Bank the refugee camps is different so they need to build up big army units and destroy the roads the roads leading into and connecting different areas within the refugee camp and the city and be there stay there for two days three days before going back to the state of Israel this is the if I can bring you in tahan if I can bring you in as you just heard from monim there he said Israel is acting on intelligence um we've seen that various Palestinian Fighters have died including uh it seems some commanders including the commander of the taram Battalion of Palestinian Islamic Jihad do you think there is a deliberate Target list here I mean look Israel has never been able to substantiate a lot of the evidence it supposedly has uh and there's never been any pressure on it to do so right it is able to go into these areas conduct targeted supposed targeted assassinations um arrests uh it can go in literally raise local sorry local communities to the ground which is what it's doing by the way this isn't just about targeting supposed uh uh resistance infrastructure I mean if you're talking about targeting health workers mosques um uh schools uh hospitals these are not supposed uh resistance infrastructures and they've not been able to provide any substantial proof that any of the people that they are looking for uh are actually operating from those areas um so you know it is again very much taking the Israeli sort of PR talking points at face value and then having them completely unscrutinized but what we're actually seeing on the ground is something far more far far worse sorry uh than what Israel is claiming it is doing now as I said earlier these groups set themselves up as a community defense mechanism they try to protect their communities when uh Israel sorry when Israel does conduct uh its incursions which often do come uh with Palestinian fatalities and often at times it's not just resistance Fighters that get caught up and I'm not going to call it Crossfire because it's often uh Palestinian civilians that get caught up in a lot of the targets uh that Israel claims that it's uh that it's supposedly aiming at um you know can I can I just drill down on who these Palestinian Fighters are exactly because in the past in the northern part of the West Bank they would have been the alaxa mar Brigade I think which would have been um allied with fata there was a group called Lion's Den but now we have Palestinian Islamic Jihad of operating as well in the West Bank and Hamas I mean do these labels matter anymore or and any rivalries between these groups or is it or are they all working together now a matter of survival this is a matter of survival look these groups established themselves in 2021 as a matter of survival they when you talk about the Lions Den the Janine brigades uh the tul karum Battalion uh you know even even now the the latest group that set themselves up do know like these are all cross alliance-based groups these and by the way primarily their membership actually stems not from the most extremist elements in Palestinian Society they're often coming from more leftist secular elements like fet for example is a lot of this has to do with the fact that Fat's Grassroots have lost faith in their own partner in their in their own political tier where they do not feel like their own party speaks for them can resonate with the reality that they live under uh and therefore have had to turn to more radical elements like Hamas and Islamic Jihad to try and get the logistics and support that they need to fight an occupation this is a matter of survival and that's exactly what these groups are they don't really have an identity in and of themselves they don't have a clear uh command structure they you know ultimately there is is no identity in and of themselves that comes out of these groups they are cross allianc a mish mash of of different um uh fact political factions individuals that have joined for their own rationale but what does unite them what is holding this momentum together uh is is is their fight against an occupation an occupation by the Israeli military but also abas the settlers the incitement the harassment of the settlers often with collusion from the Israeli authori the Israeli courts and the Israeli militaries um you yourself had your own Farm attacked at the end of last year by settlers yeah it's not only me I'm one among tens of farmers in my town in jine area called kuur where most of the land Kota Cod is classified as area B which is supposed to be under the control of the Palestinian Authority and despite that Sans have attacked like 13,000 dams which is almost 4,000 Acres of these land the restricting the access of all Palestinian farmers who owning the land in that area including my own farm and my family farm from October 7 until now we had been unable to get access to that land and it is a Farmland a farm land of olive crops and last year Harvest we couldn't even Harvest our crops and now we are approaching the coming Olive season in Palestine and all these farmers in my town and as as well as so many hundreds of farmers in other areas are are really uh uh scaring not to be able to to harvest this ol their Olive crops this year uh due to Settler's attacks and settler violence and settlers controlling the land it's not only area C it's area B and even parts of area a let me bring you in on on on the settlers none of them are supposed to be there according to International law and that was reaffirmed uh by the international court of justice in in the last month or so but despite that if Israel wanted it could Reign these people in couldn't it the Israeli Army and the the settlers are Incorporated they are the same unit they are the same Administration what the international criminal court got it and the uh the American Administration get it very very wrong they sanction individuals instead of sanctions the state and the state is behind it they they form up the same entity with two different arms um so that that's that's the problem H here the the settlers or the violent settlers are not individuals implementing attack against the Army Vision or the Army code of operation and the in the contrary the Army is there and does nothing in order to protect the Palestinians okay to on that point we had fresh sanctions against settlements from the US state department on Wednesday they sanctioned an NGO that it said provided material support for settlements and one individual in one settlement who was a security coordinator as manaram says these are not separate the Israeli State and the settlers but the US is saying they are separate is that a deliberate Mistake by the us because they know that if they admitted that Israel was behind the whole settler project uh then they would have to think about stopping all military aid to Israel which is something that this Administration the Biden Administration it seems uh if she is elected uh as president Harris don't want to do that's precisely it uh the the US is very much well aware that this is something that goes well beyond a few hundred settlers that this is a systematic state sponsored problem where you have courts the IDF uh that a bet sometimes joins into joins in with this violence today we have the obscuring of the lines between settler and Soldier considering that many of those settlers that are repeat offenders known to the security establishment are now Dawning military uniforms and the US is very well aware of this these the the supposed sanctioning regime that uh the US is boasting about in terms of trying to to present itself as though it's trying to remedy or do something about the issue of settler violence that's been fueling the crisis in the West Bank it's completely bogus they came up with this idea back in 2023 and at the time uh under the support of the US state department those that were trying to formulate and implement this sanctions regime knew that it was a total failure they knew that it wouldn't address the problem they knew very well that this was a systematic problem the reason why they decided to go ahead with it was to prove to those back in DC that refused at that time to try and push for any kind of political process thinking that you could maintain the status quo that many on the ground including their own practitioners Affiliated to the UN US security coordinator the US state department were warning uh was unsustainable so they they were very much aware that this this sanctions regime was a policy that was not going to that is not going to remedy the issue what they were trying to do was to exhaust all Technical Solutions so that they could go back to DC and make it very clear that right now is the time to start implementing political pressure specifically on Israel that was absolutely adamant on not pursuing any diplomatic route with the Palestinians thank you all three of you for
