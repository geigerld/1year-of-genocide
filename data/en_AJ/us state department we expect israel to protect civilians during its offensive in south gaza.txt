Washington says it's too early to tell if Israel will heed us advice on protecting civilians in Gaza here's what the state department spokesman said just a short while ago unfortunately we do expect to see civilian casualties as a result of this campaign um that is sadly true in all wars it is especially going to be true in a war in a crowded Urban environment where the opponent Hamas is using civilians as human Shields and hiding themselves hiding their Fighters hiding their infrastructure behind civilians so what we have made clear to Israel is that we expect them to comply with International humanitarian law and do them do everything they can to minimize civilian harm so we don't see a repeat in the south of what we saw in the north uh and and with respect to that we're at the very early stage of the operation I think it's too too soon to draw a definitive conclusion well a White House delegation headed by vice president KLA Harris is National Security adviser Phil Gordon has arrived in Tel Aviv for more on this and what we've just heard from the state department let's speak to to kimbery H we'll start with the state department first kimbery if if you will uh commenting on this Israeli expansion in the south of Gaza what more did you hear well what we're hearing there is really the state department putting the blame for the high number of Palestinian civilian casualties not on the Israeli military that is responsible for the campaign is responsible for dropping the large number of Munitions that have resulted in more than 15,000 deaths uh but instead what we're hearing is the state department placing the blame on Hamas and how they're doing that is by saying that Hamas is embedding itself inside of churches mosques schools and hospitals and as a result that is why there are these high number of Civilian casualties because as uh we see the Israeli military going after these operatives uh civilians are caught as part of collateral damage but of course the international condemnation for the disproportionate number of Civilian casualties would certainly beg to differ with that explanation and so uh the United States is certainly having to find alternative explanations and this is certainly one of them it does have a little bit of a challenge from the vice president's own words as she was meeting very recently over the weekend with Arab leaders and following that meeting did point out that it is time for the Israeli military to follow humanitarian law and that the uh numbers of Civilian casualties and her her words are simply devastating right and and speaking of which the the White House delegation in Tel Aviv right now what more do we know about what they're hoping to achieve what are the aims of that well the vice president kamla Harris is now back in the United States but her delegation that traveled with her to those meetings with Arab leaders uh is still ongoing they are now in Israel and what we know is that her National Security adviser Phil Gordon is meeting with his Israeli counterparts the reason for this is that the United States is already starting to explore with the Israelis uh what post governance in Gaza looks like now uh they're having those conversations Israel says that it is not willing to have Hamas running it uh as it has been previously or the Palestinian Authority even if it is a revitalized Palestinian Authority uh and so the United States is also exploring the option of perhaps some sort of international body but uh so far many of these have been uh ideas that have not been welcomed by the Israelis still the United States is presenting this discussion and they're also doing it with five key principles and that is no Force displacement no reoccupation no blockade no reduction in territory and also that Gaza should no longer in the eyes of the United States and Israel be used for any staging ground for any future types of attacks against Israel kimbery thanks for that kimy Hut there at the White House
