are getting a live report now a doctor is on the phone from inside the alifa hospital gaza's largest we're hearing his voice on the phone line now through translation let's listen in we are carrying surgical operations without anesthetic without even oxygen we are doing performing surgical operations with least medical supplies and medical resources at hand we on some occasions we are forced to leave patients to die because we are helpless we cannot perform any uh surgical operation onto them the least we can do is to give them some painkillers intervenous painkiller to let those victims die in peace we are helpless we are doing all we can but we ran out of fuel out of medical supplies even out of food and water premature uh newborn babies many of them died we lost many of the premature newborn babies in the incubators especially we ran out of oxygen those newborn babies require certain attention uh very specific temperature oxygen supply and even certain medical supplies that we run out of now those premature newborn babies are out of nutrition let alone that they were born with less weight now started dehydration loss of weight and with every passing minute we are losing a newborn baby we do not even think that those small frail bodies can endure as especially that they were already born uh Less in weight they range between 900 to 1,200 G and they were all they were born 7 months old they cannot survive they cannot endure the Israeli occupation forces are keeping 7,000 people as hostages inside the hospital we are doing all what we can to attend to the victims to attend to the patients already in the hospital we lost all those who were in the Intensive Care Unit and now we are struggling to help the newborn babies to survive the Israeli occupation forces claim to have provided incubator to the hospital however this is not true this is false uh in addition we are not in a need of incubators we have already incubators in the hospital yet we are out of fuel that will provide or generate electricity so we run out of electricity we need electricity to operate these incubators we must uh restore those newborn babies into the incubators as soon as possible even if the Israeli occupation forces provide incubators they are out of use they're nothing but scrap piece of metal we need generators we need power in order to be able to operate these incubators the Israeli occupation forces are propagating false claims we are not able to do anything to these newborn babies without power without electrical power the hospital already have incubators but we cannot operate these incubators because of absence of power you said that the number of victims losing their lives every minute is on the rise how do you deal with the dead bodies yesterday we were facing a problem as many victims died they succumbed to their wounds many of those who were killed were left more than 18 hours hours we do not have enough space in the morg we can we do not have any refrigerator trucks to keep them we were forced to dig Graves within the hospital compound and bury those dead bodies uh what adds insult to injury the Israeli occupation forces started to exume those dead bodies they even took position of some of these dead bodies we do not know what they are going to do with them we started to negotiate with the Israeli occupation forces we told them we are in need of food water medical supplies oxygen and power they turned a blind eye to our demands our demands fell to a dead to a deaf ear they provided only some water and some sandwiches that is not sufficient to 300 people despite the fact that more than 7,000 people are kept hostages inside the hospitals Columns of Tanks Myriad of soldiers are surrounding the hospital we are under siege a total Siege we requested them even to have some of the victims leave because they require critical medical attention they refused we requested them to bury the dead they refused we even requested them to have them some of the dead bodies buried outside in regular cemeteries yet they refused no one is able to leave and no one is able to come in we are losing patience we are losing victims we are losing newborn babies with every passing minute the hospital is under tight Siege we are left without power without medical supplies without food without water what we need now is to have some fuel to restart some of the generators to restore some power in order to be able to save those in the Intensive Care units or the new born babies in the incubators above all we need a safe passage out the hospital has is now nothing but a mass grave for 7,000 people medical Cruise patients victims and other displaced persons who took Refuge into the hospital it is a big prison for 7,000 people those 7,000 are under emminent threat inevitable threat it is nothing but a genocide you said that you are about 7,000 in total kept as hostages let's make the pictures clear are you kept in one section of the [Music] hospital those 7,000 people are distributed in various SE of the hospital but the western part of the hospital is now evacuated by the Israeli occupation forces and they are Roaming In and Out and we are trying to keep the patients and victims as much as we can in order to save their lives the displaced persons are kept in the corridor and sometimes around the doors and within the hospital yard the medical crews are also doing their duties they are once between the victims on other occasions with the already patients inside the hospital and we are doing our best even the medical crews are running here and there doing all they can in order to save lives but we are helpless we cannot perform surgical operations we ran out of medical supplies there is no power no water and no food this is imminent death inevitable death and we have been appealing to the whole world but no one listening the Hospital uh Pharmacy we still have some medical supplies inside but the Israeli occupation forces is denying us access the newborn babies require immediate attention they require hydration milk even IV intervention but we are running out of supplies let alone the displaced persons inside the hospital are already patients and many of them are with chronic disease some of them with high blood pressures others with diabetes and they require attention even the displaced person kept inside the hospital are also under the threat of death simply because they are denied their own medications we are left with nothing no power no food no water with every passing minute we are losing aive overnight we lost 22 persons for the past 3 days the hospital has been kept Under Siege we lost more than 55 persons and all those in the hospital are lifeloving people innocent people children Women Medical Crews and innocent displaced persons the Israeli occupation forces are stations in are stationed inside the hospital denying us every possible means for assistance they are not even allowing us to leave it is a war CME crime it's a full-fledged water War crime what you are undergoing now is unprecedented in any war in history were you able to communicate with any International health organizations like the Red Cross or the red crescent I ask you again will you be able to communicate with any International Organization we were trying to reach any of the international organizations but I told you the Israeli occupation forces has cut off off all the power internet connections and even telecommunication we tried on a number of occasions to uh uh communicate with the International Red Cross at least at least to lend a helping hand to the newborn babies and allow their exit out of this hospital to get attention somewhere else for the past seven days I spoke to many International organizations namely the Red Cross the 36 newborn babies still alive need immediate attention however no one moved a finger the international humanitarian organizations the health organizations nothing none of them has lent any assistance we were abandoned by the whole world we were abandoned even by the international organizations health and relief organizations we are left with nothing we are helpless we are saving trying to save lives but we are helpless we were abandoned by the whole world by the health organizations by the humanitarian relief organizations despite the fact that many of these organizations have already initiated many projects within the hospital compound they have even programs in place up and running but we are left with nothing we were abandoned by the whole world let alone the international relief and health organizations since you are witnessing as an eyewitness what's taking place and what are the Israeli soldiers doing as we speak I do not know what the Israeli soldiers doing but all I can say that they kept us in one section of the hospital they evacuated the MRI sections and the entire Western section of the hospital is now evacuated and we do not know what they are doing they are moving here and there up and down uh to the degree that they even started to dig with bulldozers uh across the hospital art they even exed some of the dead bodies some of these bodies were taken away we have been under siege for days we do not know what they're doing and we do we do not exactly even able to ask this is a hospital this is a medical facility we are catering to patients victims and people in need for medical attention let alone the thousands of innocent civilians who took shelter within the hospital compound the we are under siege it is uh now nothing but a prison Columns of Tanks all around the hospitals soldiers everywhere on every floor on every section of the hospital we are denied access to the uh only phac catering to the hospital and we are helpless we are even left without food or water what we are appealing to the whole world is to have some fuel to restore the generators in order to be able to save lives this is a hospital this is a medical facility we have nothing here but victims patients and civilians innocent Civ Ians alifa hospital is the largest medical facility in Gaza it is a fully fledged Hospital catering to various of discipline and specializations to all of the gazin we have nothing to do with military or militants and this is what is the Israeli occupation forces trying to propagate after three days of Siege what are you embracing for we as a medical staff are holding our grounds we are not leaving we are standing our ground we cannot abandon our duties we will continue to fulfill our duties as doctors we cannot abandon our fellow Palestinians we will continue to cater with whatever left in receiving more victims and angeled persons we already are overpacked the influx of victims and patients Indescribable all those who require surgical operation will be left to die we cannot do anything to them babies children women and innocent civilians we cannot perform any medical operation on any I asked you what are you embracing for as a medical crew it is known to everyone that our duties is to cater to the victims we are helpless we have been abandoned by the whole world we are doing all what we can we are left without nothing no more medical supplies and however we are embracing for the worst we have nothing more to fear if the Israelis are willing to kill us we are prepared we are embracing for the north of Gaza is annihilated the entire section of Gaza is turned into scorched lands all the hospitals are out of operations this is a war crime it is unprecedented in the history of humanity even in the Dark Ages this is unprecedented all hospitals are out of operation even hospitals in the past used to attend to the victims of the enemy but now we are not even able to attend to our own victims we are leaving patients to die victims to die patients with cancer are left to die patients with kidney disease are left to die victims of the Israeli bombardment are left to die prematurely newborn babies are left to die this is a war crime it's a full War crime and the whole world is standing in silence till when how much how many more do you want to die to be killed in order for the world to move it is a war crime being perpetrated by the Israelis over the past 5 days yet we are not even able to post any picture or make a phone call this is a catastrophe you said that you cannot even move within sections inside the hospital but are you able to communicate with your medical staff fellow member staff it is very difficult to move within the hospital units we are cut off not only from the outer world the whole world we are even cut off within the hospital sections we do not know what is going on with our fellow medical crews in other units the Israeli occupation forces as we speak we lost yet another baby boy as we speak we lost yet another newborn baby we lost one prematurely newborn baby other five in a very critical situation this is what we have been saying the whole world is standing in silence no one is moving a finger we are cut off from the whole world gazans are being murdered all the Gaz are being annihilated it is a war crime this will be recorded in history it is a smear in the face of the whole world for the past week the Israeli occupation forces have been laying seede to the hospital colums of Tanks soldiers everywhere we are cut off from the whole world the whole world is watching the whole world world is watching us being murdered here inside ala Medical Hospital it unprecedented in history your is being repeatedly outed to the whole world but no action is taken how do you respond I do not know what to say at the end of the day I am a medical professional I am fulfilling my duty and I will continue to fulfill my duty till I breathe my last I am now doing all I can in order to save lives with whatever left in hand but I all I can and say this is unprecedented in the history of Wars this is unprecedented in modern history this is unprecedented at all levels we are losing newborn babies patients injured victims women even innocent civilians who are kept hostages inside the hospitals are dying because they are even denied their own medications we cannot do anything we are helpless besieged denied all forms of axes and above all we are cut off from the whole world the whole world even cannot witness the program taking place the whole world cannot see this massacre however we are left helpless we can do nothing we will continue to stand our ground fulfill our duty as a professional me myself and my fellow medical Crews but now the whole world has fallen those who have been preaching about Humanity human rights and rule of law all those have proven to be Hypocrites the whole Humanity has failed I am Dr Fel the head of the Orthopedics I have been here for 10 days I have been uh examining many of the victims who lost limbs many of the utees those have been performed on without any athetic as we speak I assure you all those victims are going to die simply for the reason that we cannot do anything to them we cannot perform any surgical operations we cannot perform anything without an athletic I have been in the field for more than 25 years I haven't seen any like these one of the victims were forced to lose his four limbs we amputated the four limbs the two arms and the two legs of a fouryear old child we cut off we severed her four limbs without anesthetic without even pain killers this is something in descript rable I cannot put this to words I haven't seen this in my life in my medical career before I assure you Dr mamad the uh director of the hospital spoke about the newborn babies now I would like to shed sub light on those amputees those are left die the lack of medical attention is crucial to them we if there is no water in the hospital not even water in the hospital how do you think we will be able to perform we have more than 230 amp those will be left to die one by have more than 200 2003 ues some of them lost a limb others with deep wounds some of them lost one arm and one leg and some of them have lost the four limbs let alone that all those amputees are left with their wounds open they are bleeding and we cannot even dress their wounds yes you you said that the entire hospital is denied medical resources medical supplies even food and water we appreciate the dire situation you are in and as we speak we can see pictures of patients with severed limbs lying on the floor and those are left to die they are inevitably going to die Dr what is alifa hospital is now reeling under a catastrophe we have a large number of victims larger number of patients let alone the innocent civilians who took shelter in the hospital I have been in this career for 23 years I haven't seen anything like this there is no doubt that these are dire hours grave moments precedented in history and we are afraid to say that the situation is going to exacerbate as there is no helping hand reaching you if you put us more in the picture you spoke about those amputees those with SED limbs addition to patients with cancer pregnant women premature newborn babies dialysis and kidney disease patients in addition to all what I said I must stress that the hospital is living very dire hygiene conditions blood is on the floor everywhere we run out of uh disinfectant and detergents dead bodies everywhere blood body remains body parts this is unhealthy conditions total absence of hygiene even those alive will contract any possible contamination or disease this is really unbearable that's true especially that many of the dead bodies started to decompose many of the Wounded are still bleeding some of the dead bodies are bloated and I am sorry I I cannot hold my tears the situation is dire the situation is grave I swear to God excuse me I cannot hold my tears we are 7,000 people here from medical Crews to patients to victims to civilians taking refuge in the hospitals we are all kept as captives we are kept as hostages now the anesthetic specialist is asking for help she almost fainted because she cannot do anything to the bleeding victims excuse me I have have to leave we have to attend a victim that is in a dire need for a surgical operation but we are going to perform without anesthetic without painkillers this is really difficult for all of us here it is even difficult for the medical Crews many of the nurses have fainted due to the horror they have witnessed we are joined back by Dr Muhammad Abu the director of the shifa hospital before him we spoke to Dr fisel the head of Orthopedics to be honest uh questions are of no good amid these atrocities if you are if you have any few words to say all I can say that we have been abandoned by the whole world we are helpless we are abandoned by the people and we are left to embrace imminent death
