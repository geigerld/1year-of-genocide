okay we'll now speak to Muhammad Mas who's a professor of media studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies joining us here uh in Doha thanks uh again for your time so if we just uh go back to the announcement that was made by the World Health Organization saying that Israel has agreed to area specific pauses and fighting in Gaza to allow a polio vaccination campaign uh to be carried out I mean we hear from eight agencies as well that the constant evacuation orders make planning extremely difficult we just saw Han's report where entire neighborhoods are reduced to Rubble how difficult or how challenging is this campaign going to be it's going to be incredibly uh difficult um people are terrified not just uh you know gazen uh civilians but also also Aid workers we have to remember that um Israel has killed approximately 200 un staff they've also killed uh about 150 uh journalists uh these are both world record uh figures um you know there was the tragedy um a few months back I believe it was on April 1st when the world uh world Central Kitchen uh Aid workers were killed targeted by Israel clearly marked uh van they had shared their coordinates with with Israel and then just yesterday as you all were reporting uh this world food program uh van clearly marked also had shared its coordinates with the Israeli army they were targeted um so Aid workers are also um very uh scared and that's why uh the who was adamant that if they were going to be able to uh carry out this vaccination program a pause in the fighting was going to be absolutely necessary but do the people the Palestinians in Gaza trust that the Israelis will actually adhere to this to these area specific pauses and fighting as being outlined because we've seen over and over throughout the 11 months of war is that when Palestinians are told to go to Safe so-called designated safe areas they're then subsequently bombed right and to your point uh forensic architecture which is an independent research um organization they did a study in July showing that right after Israel had declared a particular area to be a safe zone They proceeded to bomb it at least 10 times in about 3 weeks so and that has happened repeatedly uh over the past 11 months right um Israel uh tells people to go from point A to point B and then they they bomb uh they bomb point point B uh and so people are are scared and this is why many Palestinians have still refused uh to evacuate there are still some Palestinians who are who are refusing to um not follow some of these evacuation orders and that's one reason why because they say there is no safe place to begin with and many will say look it is a ceasefire that is needed right now if you want to ensure public health safety it is a ceasefire that's needed where are we now do you think when it comes to a ceasefire and if you look at sort of the bigger picture and look at what's happening across the other Palestinian territory of course in the occupied West Bank where the raids are ongoing by by the Israeli military I mean where do you think things head to next yeah I I think you know Israel tells us things very clearly and very explicitly but sometimes for some reason we don't want to believe them uh they've told us for months that they have no intention of stopping uh of stopping this war um I could if there was time I could call up a long list of of statements from Netanyahu and other top officials so Israel has no intention of stopping unfortunately I wish I could tell you something something different and I don't think they're going to stop this War uh on Gaza uh until the United States uh and I don't like to use the phrase the International Community because really there's only one entity that's capable of exerting uh the appropriate pressure on Israel and that is the United States which is I mean how do you evaluate what the United States is is sort of it's positioning right now because we hear optimistic comments coming out of us officials particularly when it comes to any ceasefire talks well this is what the US has to say the US has to present itself as a peacemaker and and and show it's public that it's doing everything that it can but in reality the US is putting its full backing behind Israel if they wanted a ceasefire they could have forc the ceasefire many many months ago so I think we're going to be unfortunately headed for more War uh and more instability and violence and aggression even in the West Bank unless the United States applies uh the pressure that it can exert on Israel if it wants to okay Muhammad M thank you so much make sure to subscribe to to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
