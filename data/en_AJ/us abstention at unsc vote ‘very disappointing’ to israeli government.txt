many world leaders have welcomed a un Security Council resolution which demands an immediate ceasefire in Gaza during the remainder of Ramadan it also calls for the unconditional release of captives and unrestricted access to desperately needed Aid now in response to the resolution Israeli officials canceled a trip to Washington in protests against the US failing to use its veto prime minister Benjamin netanyahu's office issued a statement saying that us actions were a clear departure from its consistent position since the beginning of the war the statement says the resolution gives Hamas hope that International pressure will force Israel to accept a ceasefire without the release of the Israeli captives held in Gaza Israel may have cancelled that delegation visit to the US but its defense minister yuav Galant is was already in Washington and he's holding separate talks with National Security adviser Jake Sullivan and the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin alzer's White House correspondent Kimberly hit has more from Washington DC the White House is calling the decision by the Israelis to cancel a meeting with us officials later in the week disappointing the meeting was designed to discuss Israeli campaign plans into Rafa and whether or not there could be Alternatives the state department saying that there was a fear that there could be undue civilian harm also the belief that the Biden Administration feels that this could reduce Israel's standing in the world and as a result undermined its security well ahead of another meeting taking place on Monday the Israeli defense minister spoke to reporters ahead of his meeting with the secretary of state and the National Security advisor saying that he felt that the actions of the United States at the UN Security Council were certainly not supportive of Israel and as a result he issued this thinly Veiled Threat take a listen and we have no moral right to stop the war in Gaza until we return all the hostages home if we do not reach a clear decision in Gaza it may bring us closer to war in the North I will stress the importance of destroying Hamas and returning the hostages home we will operate against Hamas everywhere including in places where we have not yet been now White House security Council spokesperson John Kirby has countered the argument by Israel also that there has been a shift in policy as a result of the United States abstaining on this latest un Security Council resolution as opposed to vetoing as has been seen in the past in fact Kirby's saying that this is not a reflection of a shift in policy instead the United States saying that it wanted to get to a place where it would see a clear condemnation of Hamas and its actions on October 7th and given that they could not get that language this was a resolution the United States says it could not support Kimberly H at Al jazer Washington Imran Khan in occupied East Jerusalem joins us now Imran let let's wrap up this uh this Israeli response to the United Nation Security Council resolution they've said it's not going to impact how we conduct this war they're seem to be basically ignoring it and pretending that it hasn't happened well that's actually completely consistent for Israeli policy remember there's been about 148 un resolutions since 2015 Israel's ignored every single one of them it's very good at ignoring uh all of those resolutions in fact it has a spin on this calling the UN anti-semitic at worst and anti-israel at best so it can ignore all of this this is much more difficult for Israel to ignore because of the US's role in all of this we've unpacked a lot of that already but let me just remind you the fact that the US abstained rather than veto is what's driving the anger from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies here in Israel he is saying very clearly uh that this Administration is trying to stop uh Netanyahu from carrying out the war the way he wants to be able to carry it out now that's something uh that is driven a wedge between them the UN resolution it is binding it is international law but Israel can ignore it because it still has the key support of the US $3.5 billion a year in military assistance alone that money hasn't been threatened so there is a rift in the relationship there is a public facing Rift in that us relationship but backstage where it counts the money that's still coming Imran I wonder are you able to get a sense of how this is all playing out with the Israeli public because this is another show of Israel's isolation on the international stage well let's take the media for an an example normally the Israeli media is very divided hard right and a very small liberal left uh kind of media uh very divided on all of the issues they're actually United um in talking about the fact uh that the there may well be a rift in the US Israeli relationship and that's indeed worrying the public because it's not not just Joe Biden the former US president Donald Trump has criticized Israel as well saying Israel needs to stop its war in Gaza there was a calculus that prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu may have had in the back of his head he knows there's an election coming up in the US if he sticks to his guns with Biden maybe the next Administration May well change uh its position on Israel's actions in Gaza that doesn't look like it's happening Prime uh president Donald Trump has been very clear that might just be election in but all of this has an impact does it change uh the public support for the war no it doesn't that's still pretty high but this idea this notion that they can go into raffle with this ground offensive without any kind of international opposition that's now going away the US has been very clear and that vote of abstention from the US is the clearest signal yet that it's not a green light to go into graa grafa with a massive ground Invasion Imran Khan reporting from occupied Jerusalem thank you very much Amron
