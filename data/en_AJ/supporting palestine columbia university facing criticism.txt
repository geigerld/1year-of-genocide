Columbia University officials facing mounting criticism from all sides over its handling of student demonstrators prominent Republican politicians after meeting with some Jewish students on campus called on the University President to resign as Colombia has allowed these Lawless agitators and radicals to take over the virus of anti-Semitism is spread across other campuses by some counts as many as 200 universities have a similar form of protest right now students who faced arrest and suspension say they're the ones who need protection many are afraid to show their face there's there's definitely a fear of you know being attacked and and the risk of like losing career opportunities and stuff which is really a shame that people willing to you know advocate for human rights are smeared in such a way nevertheless they are vowing to continue their encampment student organizers say they have three demands for the University number one disclose their investments in Israel number two divest from them and number three provide amnesty for students who've been suspended they say they won't leave the grounds until that happens many have compared their actions to what happened on campus in 1968 when Colombia students held Sittin to demand an end to the University's connection to the Vietnam War and were arrested sparking Nationwide demonstrations credited with the US's eventual withdrawal from from the war and the students do have the support of many Jewish students and faculty I do not feel that this project is anti-Semitic in any way I do feel that the students are highly critical of Israeli politics and I do not believe that that is inherently anti-semitic at all and I do not feel threatened as a Jewish faculty member in any way by what's happening here on this campus except by the arrest of many of our students the university has warned students to take down their encampment by Friday morning or face unspecified consequences K Christen salumi Al jazer New York make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
