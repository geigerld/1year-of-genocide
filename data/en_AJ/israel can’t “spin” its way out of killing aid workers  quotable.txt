it is completely outrageous and unacceptable that she and her fellow Aid workers were killed by an Israeli IDF um mission in what was known to be a safe zone or for Aid convoys you know you can't spin your way out of this she is the 196th Aid worker killed in this conflict it is not an isolated incident um whatever the investigations show the only solution to this horrible conflict ultimately is a political solution for two states but an immediate humanitarian ceasefire leading to a sustainable ceasefire it's only Israel that can decide whether they let enough food trucks in to feed people who are at risk of imminent starvation you know this is not the decent country that we all want to support this behavior of of using food as a weapon of War as they say is
