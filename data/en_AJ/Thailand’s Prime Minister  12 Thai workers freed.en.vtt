00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 align:start position:0%
so they've had to try and make a a a
 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.670 align:start position:0%
so they've had to try and make a a a
plan<00:05:01.759><c> um</c><00:05:02.199><c> that</c><00:05:02.520><c> would</c><00:05:03.520><c> not</c><00:05:03.720><c> build</c><00:05:04.080><c> trust</c><00:05:04.479><c> but</c>

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
plan um that would not build trust but
 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.070 align:start position:0%
plan um that would not build trust but
build<00:05:05.000><c> momentum</c><00:05:05.520><c> into</c><00:05:05.800><c> the</c><00:05:06.039><c> process</c><00:05:06.759><c> and</c><00:05:06.880><c> so</c>

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
build momentum into the process and so
 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.629 align:start position:0%
build momentum into the process and so
what<00:05:07.199><c> you've</c><00:05:07.520><c> had</c><00:05:07.919><c> is</c><00:05:08.440><c> the</c><00:05:08.600><c> Ceasar</c><00:05:09.280><c> temporary</c>

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 align:start position:0%
