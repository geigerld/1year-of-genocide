the devastation of Civilian and medical infrastructure is escalating in Gaza as Israel's ground forces push deeper into Gaza City several major hospitals were targeted overnight the US says Israel has agreed to implement 4-Hour pauses in the fighting but that hasn't been officially confirmed by the Israeli government more now from uh our correspondents on the ground that'll be in just a moment first though this report from Michael Apple gaza's hospitals have endured another night of continuous bombing overnight and into the early hours of Friday morning some paramedics from the red crescent could only block their ears as bombs rain down around them outside gaza's largest hospital elifa another strike this is what the occupation is throwing at hospitals missile shno let the world bear witness to what the occupation targets truly are Israel accuses Palestinian armed groups of operating from within or under any types of buildings including hospitals but people on the ground and Aid experts have rejected that saying nothing is off limits to Israel's military the el- Naser Children's Hospital in Northwest Gaza has suspended operations after being repeatedly damaged at Al Nasser hospital we were attacked twice once at the main gate and the second was a direct hit there is severe damage we ran out of oxygen for the Intensive Care Unit and the neonatal unit and we are out of electricity there is only Power in the ICU gaz's Health Ministry says 18 of its 35 hospitals and 40 other health centers are out of service due to damage or a lack of fuel the White House says Israel has committed to what it calls tactical pauses for humanitarian Aid lasting 4 hours a day to be announced 3 hours in advance many are questioning Israel's intentions within the Gaza Strip prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously said Israel will have overall security responsibility for Gaza indefinitely but he appears to have backtracked on that he told a US News outlet that Israel does not seek to conquer occupy or govern Gaza it comes as Regional power cutter Works to facilitate the release of captives held by Hamas in the territory Sheik tamim bin hammed Alani is visiting Egypt to push forward humanitarian relief efforts for now Fierce Street battles are being fought in the north and tens of thousands of Palestinians some waving White flags are fleeing South but not to safety as Israel also bombs that region Mike leel Al jazer alzer's hanim Mahmud joins us from hanun that's inside the Gaza Strip in the southern part of the strip Han let's try and together map out what's happening inside Gaza City itself because the Israeli military for several days have had the city en Circle they've been pushing towards the center of the city earlier you were saying that some of the fighting has been centered around ansar roundabout we can bring up a map that's not far from alifa tell us what's happening there we have the map yes well the the fight is in inside Gaza City particularly at the center of the Gaza City when it was effectively uh splitted from the the other parts of the Gaza Strip as Israeli claims it's the headquarter of Hamas militants and Hamas leadership now Israel keep pushing their tanks and armed vehicle from three main axes the Eastern side the northern side and the southern part and coming from the Sun Empire along the coastal Road uh a Rashid road all the way to an area better known as roundabout or ansar intersection that includes residential Towers right at the corner of that area which has been taken over by the Israeli military with at least seven snipers on top of this residential Tower in addition to surrounding a public facilities and and and two schools a public school and an honorable school now the distance between this area to a shifa hospital if we're talking about air distance that's a straight line from that area and roundabout TOA it's about 200 met 250 meters but if we talk about ground distance where you have to go around uh corners and from Street to another it's about the double the distance or a little over double the distance what seems to be Israel has position or the Israeli military has position its tank in that area because know it's the closest and it's very strategic uh in in its attempt to a shifa hospital where it made its claim that right underneath the buildings of the of shifa Hospital lies the bunkers and the tunnels used by Hamas leadership so in the coming hours we're going to be seeing uh an attempt for those armed vehicles and tanks pushing uh toward a shifa hospital it's a it's a bit difficult given all the residential building in the area where which will require more air strikes uh in my assumption uh to clear the way in front of those tanks as it will have to make it as short as possible honey pause for a second because we're listening to your every word and I want to show again our viewers uh a picture that was shot just a few hours ago or a few moments ago in fact in Gaza this one so we are seeing tanks now um our our information is that this video was shot near alantis Hospital not far from Al Naser Hospital which are both close to each other both of these also not far from Al shifa so our viewers can see what it looks like what it means when you say that tanks are progressing in this uh you know Urban landscape of the of gaza's most populous city talk to me now about what's happening around alifa you were explaining earlier that the Israeli military appears to be targeting all the access roads in and out of gaza's largest hospital yes that's exactly what was happening and it's still happening just within the past few hours and and late hours of last night where a shifa hospital targeted repeatedly by by Massive air strikes and tank shells destroying the surrounding areas we're talking about the western side of the hospital uh that is very close to a Rashid uh there's just a neighborhood one neighborhood separating a cha Hospital from a rash the coastal the coastal uh Road uh uh of of in the western side of Gaza but from that side it's being repeatedly targeted from the the southern side where is an entire department of the hospital uh it's the delivery department has been targeted wise I believe it was the fifth and the fourth floor of that building particular building where Israel made a claim that it's underneath very the very foundation of the building contain the bunkers and the tunnels that Hamas is using to run its its operations now to the Eastern side where is the main gate which is easier to get through from another road that's why we're seeing Israeli tanks are around another and rantis Pediatric Hospital just one straight road that take you directly to the main gate of a shifa hospital so we're talking about couple hundred meters from the Anar roundabout and from atisi and Naser hospital to a Shiva Hospital what seems to be an attempt very close to squeeze a shifa hospital alaz alaz is hanim Mahmud reporting from hanun that's the very latest that we know about what's happening inside Gaza City
