we are inside the new natal Intensive Care Unit at the Kamal adwan hospital where we have a number of newborn babies who are suffering from severe malnutrition and finding it very difficult to obtain the required medication and treatment as the Israeli occupation continues to prevent relief and humanitarian Aid and medication from entering the Gaza Strip and reaching these newborn babies as well as the patients and the wounded in Northern Gaza we used to admit 500 to 600 babies a day into the hospital now we admit between 1,000 and 1,200 babies a day we notice that all patients are showing signs of pness and weakness second a picture is worth a thousand words even newborns are emaciated in the past every newborn baby would have their own box of milk and today we can barely find a single box for the entire department the majority of newborns we are treating today at the Kamal adwan Hospital are without parents they were referred to us by shelters or other hospitals and they are without their mothers therefore it's incumbent upon us to offer them food and Medical Care the situation is absolutely catastrophic we usually feed newborn babies every 2 to 3 hours however due to the limited Supply we're forced to feed them every four or 5 hours instead and this affects their weight whatever milk we have is split equally amongst everyone and this will definitely affect the baby's weight and their Daily Progress additionally given the poor health they're in when they're admitted they need a sufficient quantity of milk to support their immune system and the current shortage prevents the babies from recovering properly which means they have to undergo treatment for a longer period of time usually once newborn babies have recovered we give them small doses of milk to try and gauge their health and find out if their recovering well however given the limited Supply we are using a 10% glucose-based solution to try and get them to stop crying I'm scared for my child she has sepsis and a severe chest infection and she is only 23 days [Music] old death continues to haunt everybody here in Northern gaza's babies and adults continue to due to the occupation preventing the entry of relief humanitarian and Medical Aid including baby formula into the strip an Sharif alaz shalaz well let's bring in Jonathan fer he's a spokesperson for unra uh the UN agency that works with Palestinian refugees there he joins us today from Aman Jonathan unra has been coordinating Aid access for so many agencies on the ground what is the situation when it comes to getting Aid in at the moment well it it's extremely challenging um as as Illustrated in in the previous reports the um the amount of Aid has has basically halved since January um we need to get 500 trucks a day into the Gaza Strip simply to maintain an aid operation that's not commercial traffic that's 500 trucks of Aid it's simply not happening um for a number of reasons but this means that the population um which is basically on life support is being deprived of the Essentials for their share survival you say it's hared in the last month what reasons are the Israelis giving for that are they saying it's administrative are they imposing additional checks what are you hearing from them it's it's a combination of factors I mean obviously um in in any conflict setting the the the UN talks with with all parties involved to ensure that convoys Aid convoys can flow freely to get the aid to people uh that need it um we we have a combination we we've had um blockages on On the Border but we've also had issues of safety within the Gaza Strip um and also refusal of access notably to the north um conditions have not U made it simple to get to the north but lack of facilitation for getting convoys across the Gaza Strip is a huge problem so bottlenecks um arise inevitably and and enough it is not getting in and it's not getting across the Gaza Strip either Jonathan your agency unra has said that it might to cease operations within weeks if the funding freezes currently in place aren't reversed what would that mean for gaza's Aid infrastructure well as it stands um two million people um rely on on support from anra um in the Gaza Strip so that that's almost the entire population we're feeding over 1 million and we have over 1 million people in um around 150 unrush shelters which um uh before October was was school buildings those are all massively overcrowded so basically um if we unplug unro we unplug the aid operation to those people and when you see attacks like we saw today in Gaza City can you perhaps give us a sense of the threats that your staff feel that they face and trying to do their jobs there are so many thousands of them still active on the ground in the STM yes indeed I mean we have 13,000 staff in Gaza and around 3,000 of them are able to continue working um they're doing things like Logistics warehousing U getting uh convoys from from a to zed to ensure that deliveries can be done when possible they face huge huge risks all the time um we've lost over 150 staff members killed in this war um and um like the rest of the civilian population they face immense risks going about their daily lives and doing their Duty given the pattern of attacks and Strikes that we've seen Jonathan do you at believe that Aid infrastructure is being systematically targeted by the Israelis it's it's it's it's very very very hard to to to to say that clearly but what what what we we do see in this war is um that the international humanitarian law um needs to be applied that's absolutely essential um both in terms of The Siege uh so The Siege needs to be lifted but also the facilitation of Aid operations on the ground um that's an obligation in any War for all parties involved um and and that needs to happen uh Jonathan in terms of trying to assert some level of accountability do you have any hope that that might be able to happen especially given the the lack of access and trying to determine exactly what's happening on the ground I mean I think at this stage our immediate focus is on trying to to make sure that the aid continues to flow and gets the people that that need it um clearly issues of accountability do matter that that that that's something um for um entities independent of unra to to look to um in the future but but clearly um there are issues of huge concern and um we need to make sure that International humanitarian law is followed to the hill Jonathan we just ran a report where literally babies are dying because they don't have enough to eat or drink in the north of the Gaza Strip can you characterize the situ ation for us at the moment in Northern Gaza obviously conditions on the ground are are incredibly dire should we expect this this trend to continue absolutely we we haven't been able to get um food into the north since the 23rd of January so for over a month but already the north was the most isolated uh region of the Gaza Strip the most restricted in terms of Aid operations um and just one illustration of this fact was that when we were able to run a convoy in January um we had um people coming to to to to the Convoy eating food on the spot um and indeed for example when a bag of flour split open when it was being unloaded um after the crowds receded um there were people scrambling in the dirt to try and pick up uh flour and we've also had reports of people grinding up bird seed to eat and and other kinds of animal feed I think th those th those examples speak for themselves when it comes to the situation and of course the lack of water so a combination of lack of food lack of water inevitably that causes um huge problems for the population there you mentioned a couple of anecdotes there about eating bird seed or or animal feed I understand there have been some issues around around health concerns around that a child got got very sick I believe after eating some some bread that was made with with animal feed can you give us a sense of of the health challenges that that people are facing on the ground as they try to to think creatively about how to feed themselves and their families well absolutely I mean I think the the these are cases which illustrate the the level of of absolute desperation across the Gaza Strip and and particularly in the north and by definition when people are hungry they're more vulnerable to disease anyway because immune systems are weaker um so um here we we basically start to see a perfect storm and this means that famine is looming you say famine is looming famine is happening in In Pockets I understand in in parts of the Gaza Strip can you describe for us what that looks like on the ground because these are obviously man-made conditions absolutely as you rightly say this is a this is a man-made disaster this is not the product of a natural Hazard um what's um happening is that the pockets um as the pockets gradually expand and come together we start to see a famine Zone and that's that that that that's a huge risk because we're not able to get um and we haven't being able to get in in into the the north um this month um that means that it's very hard to assess uh clearly the situation on the ground but what we do see and from from staff that we have um who are who are still able to operate there um even with a lack of access is is exactly these kind of problems this is a disaster within a disaster within a disaster in Northern Gaza we've just been talking there about the north I'd like to ask you a little bit about Central and Southern Gaza too obviously the the levels of restrictions on Aid this is also a catastrophic situation for people in the South where people have been increasingly crammed into a a tiny tiny piece of land how does the situation in in Rafa and that kind of area compared to what we're seeing in Northern Gaza well precisely as you rightly say people have been crammed into a smaller and smaller area um because uh people have been displaced multiple times um from from in the Gaza Street kind of rolling down from the north to the South um since the War Began I mean just to to look at the population data there there are currently about 1.5 million people in Rafa that's six times the population before the start of the war now that means that shelters are massively overcrowded um it's just the this the scale of what what is happening in Rafa um is is another illustration of the extent of this crisis well let me ask you then we we spoke a little bit earlier about what would happen if unra had to cease operations and obviously that is a very real possibility according to to senior officials at the UN what would that look like on the ground in Rafa if if that were to happen right now well if you imagine it in a hospital setting and you imagine a life support system um on is the life support machine um for for uh over a million people in Rafa um if you unplug the machine then the consequences are extremely Stark um and if Aid is not flowing in um and un is the primary primary humanitarian organization on the ground um the the risks of the food crisis the Health crisis everything in Rafa um it's just going to be multiplied you mentioned there that analogy of of unplugging a life support machine that is essentially what's happening in hospitals across the Gaza Strip because of the lack of fuel what is the fuel situation at the moment especially as it pertains to to health facilities well that yes I mean that that that that that remains a problem that's been a problem since the beginning of the war um we we also have um I mean Beyond just fuel I mean even the lack of say solar systems something like that so solar power um it means that we have clinics which are operating with no electricity well I just imagine what it's like going to a hospital where there's no electricity limited supplies the level of care um that staff are able to provide the kind of treatment is automatically restricted um and that that means that people are not getting the help that they need um in in the darest of circumstances there a spokesperson for unra the UN agency that works with Palestinian refugees thank you so much for joining us on Al jazer Jonathan
