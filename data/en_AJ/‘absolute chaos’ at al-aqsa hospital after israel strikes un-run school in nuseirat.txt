Israeli forces have again targeted a un run School Sheltering displaced Palestinians killing 16 people and wounding at least 50 others this attack happened at the alnus serat refugee camp in central Gaza the number of victims is overwhelming gaza's largest remaining health facility the alaka hospital Hamas has rejected Israel's claims that the Army targeted fighters who are operating near the school well let's go straight to hanim Mahmud our correspondent who joins us now from out inside the alaa hospital in derl Bala in central Gaza honey as we were saying earlier the death toll from that attack has been rising you're outside the hospital where so many were taken how is the facility holding up well right now just given the past N9 months of too much of pressure on this remaining health facility in the Central Area the situations inside are quite dire not only from the influx of injuries but also from the large number of evacuates and displaced families are literally filling up the corridors of the hospital just making the job of the medical staff and volunteers here medical missions and and uh and and largely people who are here to support and help quite difficult because these people the displac families across the G STP are kept pouring into the Central Area more recently from Rafa City and Khan Unice and just within the past half an hour we get confirmed reports of more people more displaced families are uh Crossing waza all the way to the central area this is definitely going to put more pressure on this health facility but other than this the tragedy is the number the large number of casualties brought to the hospital here is the kind of injuries that they are experiencing and the difficulties that the medical staff is always uh having here to intervene properly to provide a proper medical uh uh medical intervention to save lifeare for the most part here doctors just given how exhausted they are the shortage the acute shortage of medical supplies they just make their job extra extra hard just to get more a better picture and better context of what's going inside the hospital uh of some of the cases that are experiencing a a a trauma severe trauma particularly among vulnerable group here at the hospital we're joined by Dr Ahmed yusf drmed Yu is an internal medicine and pediatrician from mid Global to tell us more about what's going on inside with these cases Dr Ahmed thank you so much for joining us and let me start off by asking just give us a a picture an assessment of what are the situations inside the hospital so currently the healthc care system is completely overwhelmed um because of what appears to be a a complete targeting of all the healthcare infrastructure uh in in this small strip of land with 2 and a half million people in it um the the few hospitals left functioning are uh in in a in a state of chaos right every few hours uh we are uh bombarded with with ambulances bringing in uh people in pieces and and uh you know uh women with their uh abdomen eviscerated little children with shle injuries uh men Dead on Arrival uh we we have a an environment where along with this the chaos of emotional families uh who have just pulled their families from the rubble coming in uh emotionally distraught traumatized emotionally and psychologically what they just experienced uh and and then beyond this you have medical staff who are part of this community who who who the first question they ask is where was the bombing is this is this my family member uh which neighborhood is the first question you hear uh and often because of how uh small the community feels uh uh they're treating their family this is every everybody here is family and so so beyond the physical impact and the and the uh physical trauma we're seeing a component of emotional stress that I can't couldn't have imagined let's talk more specific about cases that you have been dealing with since your arrival to the hospital to volunteer inside this all the remaining Health Facilities like walk us through some of the cases are experiencing traumatizing condition particularly among children and women uh this is especially poignant and and hard to speak about you know given what happened yesterday there was a a bombing of one of the schools and we had child after child after child get B into the resuscitation room uh with different extents of of traumatic injury uh standing over one child intubated with a depressed scull fracture uh another with a shaftal injury probably 10 years old uh uh so severe that we could see an exposed kidney and likely a transected spinal cord uh uh trying to rush them to the o to to salvage what we could uh and then in the backdrop as as a pediatrician I see small children sitting in the corner with lesser physical trauma injuries but but no doubt witnessing death and destruction and dying in a way that that their little brains and could never be be be capable of coping with and so uh we spoke about this briefly but but the psychological impact beyond the physical impact will be will be generational and so uh if I go into the uh psychiatric understanding of epigenetics when we talk about exposing small children with plastic brains mean meaning the ability to morph and change to to this level of stress physiologic stress from adrenaline and and stress hormone you know we we sit here and we hear the hums above us of drones which can often mean another attack is coming and the children they they are completely aware of this and they look up in fear and they startled by any loud noise the the effect on the unraveling of DNA and the epigenetic uh research shows us and tells us that this is often permanently open and that the impact can even be carried generationally in their children the trauma doesn't just happen in the three or four year-olds now it happens in their children and their children after them and so this would take Decades of therapy and and cognitive behavioral therapy try to unravel and unwrap and the worst part is we're we're still in it so there's no opportunity to deal with psychologic and psychiatric trauma when we're still dealing with the physical trauma the lack of surviving today finding clean water finding enough medication to to to survive today so thinking about the long-term effect seems silly except that you watch these kids eyes and that's that's all I can think about is is even the ones who survive uh will experience trauma forever Dr Ahmed I know this is your first time visiting Gaza and being in one of its Health Facilities but I know this is not your first time being part of medical missions worldwide how are you can you draw on your personal experience what's the difference if we set for a compare and contrast matter here what what is the difference yeah I I I've had the opportunity to work with Med Global and other organizations and and treating other Refugee groups uh and medical missions around around the world and and I will say there is nothing like this I've been in fields and Greece taking care of Syrian refugees and there were hang in refugees in Bangladesh where it was those were extremely difficult situations the difference between those things and this is that this is a killing box there's no way to escape and the ongoing trauma daily every hour uh is is unimaginable we sat as Physicians and family members and people home back home in the states where I'm from and we watched things on TV and saw some news clips from from news agencies like yours or social media uh and and we cried and we were worried and that's what was the impetus for me to come and when I landed here from the moment I landed and I saw a level of Devastation I could have never ever have imagined it based on what I had seen the the videos and these interviews never do it justice uh the blood on my hands and the the eyes I have closed for the final time of patients on the floor because they don't have stretches and medication the The Scream dreams of horror from from mothers who have lost their children I it will it will you know it'll be with me forever what's urgently needed inside the hospital now just to I know it's too much going on inside the house with the lack of medical supplies exhaustion of medical staff as well but to save lives what's needed right now the bleeding has to stop the bombs have to stop and access to all of humanitarian have to be allowed you know if there's any doubt from anybody whether or not humanitarian Aid has been allowed I can promise you the answer is no I was restricted I had multiple suitcases of many wonderful people in America who knew that something was going on and tried to donate and help with medical supplies and I wasn't allowed to bring anything except a suitcase the hospital is empty of the supplies need to take care of the death and dying if I could say one last thing that I think is important to understand in terms of the greater scope of what's happening when we heard the numbers of how many had died di 16,000 children and 35 45 45,000 other people civilians being killed in this the the number is underestimated and the reason I say this is as a medical professional this ICU where I work today is full of dka patients diabetic patients who get a very treatable disease but they are dying of the most simple thing cuz the insulin is unavailable because they're not allowed to bring it in and Refrigeration is gone there are people dying of chronic as many amputees as they are from the trauma there's amputees of diabetes uncontrolled and these people will be permanently disabled after for the numbers are are vastly high I would say four five six times higher easily let alone the ones who will die in the decades coming from both the psychiatric trauma and the physical disabilities Associated what's happened in the last N9 months what they need in the hospital is what they need in the hospital is the bombing to stop and some level of stability and flow of humanitarian Aid and medical supplies Dr ahed thank you so much for your Insight thank you so as we heard from Dr Ahmed the description horrific description of of what's going on at the hospital here with the the some of the cases that are quite treatable but people are dying here at the record number because the lack of medical supplies and the inability to intervene and to save life this is the only remaining health facility here but soon enough it's going to be pushed out of services given how difficult the situations inside of it honey Mahmud they're showing us what life is like on the ground right now in Central Gaza thank you hone make sure to subscribe to our Channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
