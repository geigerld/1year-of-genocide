hello I'm serel vaner this is counting the cost on Alia Zer your weekly look at the world of business and economics this week an economy in ruins the United Nations warns the war on Gaza could set back development in the Palestinian territories by more than a decade also this week spending billions of dollars to finance its War Israel's Central Bank says the conflict is a major shock to the country's economy Plus on the edge of the Abyss the spillover of the war into Lebanon could shatter what's left of lebanon's fragile [Music] economy the Palestinian territories are dependent on Israel for their labor and Goods markets and for basic services like water and electricity they are locked in a cycle of underdevelopment caused by Decades of Israeli restrictions and occupation Palestinian GDP stood at just over2 billion last year by comparison Israel's economy is worth nearly $500 billion the UN says the war on Gaza could set back development by as much as 16 years and the longer the conflict goes on the worse things will get in a recent report the UN says GDP in the Palestinian territories has fallen by more than 4% this is after 1 month of War that's a bigger impact than any previous Israel Palestine war two full months of conflict would cut GDP by an estimated 8.4% or $1.7 billion and three months of War now you're looking at $2.5 billion doar in GDP loss the war is also devastating the labor market 61% that's the majority of all jobs in Gaza 61% of jobs in Gaza have been raised and in the occupied West Bank 24% of jobs are gone one quarter the poverty figures are alarming the number of Palestinians living in poverty has risen by 20% and that could soon be 34% if the war continues for second month that means nearly half a million more people living in poverty now the war has had a devastating impact on gaza's economy and that's no surprise when you see flattened buildings and an entire population Under Fire we covered that in previous shows but the UN has also drawn attention to the massive economic disruption in the occupied West Bank and today we're focusing on that the territory has effectively been sealed off from Israel since October the 7th in what has been described as another form of collective punishment Palestinians and their goods cannot get into Israel Farmers have seen prices collapse as their produce ends up D dumped in local markets Bernard Smith reports from beta the crops are ready for harvesting but Palestinian Farmers have lost access to their main customers in Israel since October the 7th Israel's military has effectively sealed off the occupied West Bank the Jordan volley is palestine's food basket we produce most of the West Bank's products peppers Kat Obin everything comes from this region when the crossings to Israel are closed all of these goods go to the local markets which causes the prices to drop on some days we don't sell anything just getting to Market is a challenge Palestinians are forced to take circuitous routes through the occupied West Bank to avoid Israeli settlements the quickest Road for us today is 40 km it should take 30 minutes but it's only open to Israelis Palestinians have to take a major detour it adds 110 km to our journey in the past 5 weeks more checkpoints and road closures have appeared some checkpoints are only open from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. this causes problems and it also causes harm to the small villages we have to detour through 90 minutes later we get to the mark Market it's almost deserted before October the 7th this was a packed wholesale Market with fruit from Israel and vegetables from the West Bank but now Israel has put in a checkpoint just outside there and that's choked off access to the market because it's stopping Palestinians using a main road that passes through a nearby Village and the Israelis have done that to protect the settlers who live all around here prices of vegetables have more than haved shifts have been cut some businesses have closed go down we're constantly afraid so much so that when we come to work for example I'm from nabalis and I have to leave home at 1: in the morning when the checkpoint isn't busy because if I get there later I could be stuck for more than 2 hours which impacts my work here as settlements expand and new ones appear those weights at checkpoints get longer and longer significantly disrupting businesses as well as the lives of the Palestinians forced to enure them Bernard Smith Al jazer beta in the occupied West Bank from romala in the Palestinian occupied territories I'm joined Now by Raja khidi director general of the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute thank you for being with us we saw in that report by Bernard Smith some of the ways in which an occupying power in this case Israel can squeeze the economy of an occupied territory we saw you know there is no freedom of movement or there's limited freedom of movement limited access to other markets in this case access of Palestinian Goods to the Israeli Market what are the other factors that our viewers should keep in mind yeah thank you the report actually focused on something which is critical and which is yet to be uh as as one of the many shocks that we're we're experiencing economically is yet to be felt fully uh we've already uh in the West Bank that is uh experienced the first very important shock of the war which is the return of around 200,000 up to 200,000 Palestinians who used to work in Israel and who used to bring around $3 billion into the Palestinian economy approximately 15% of its natural income uh so those uh people are not not only no longer bringing in that that income for two months probably three possibly for the rest of the year of next year but uh they are now an additional uh 15 177% of Labor Force which is sitting in the West Bank unemployed so that's an example of the of the first shock we've had others uh Palestinian Arabs in Israel who used to bring in around 1.51 billion dollars a year to the economy and purchases and services they sto coming these are some of the immediate shocks uh the clearance Revenue cut off by uh uh Israel which anyhow is going to go down because of the repressed demand so hence less Imports hence less trade uh tax uh uh but the actual total with can we can we focus can we focus on that for a moment Israel withholding Palestinian tax that it should normally and would normally transfer to the Palestinian Authority and now that transfer of money Palestinian money to the Palestinian Authority has been disrupted what is the impact of that well you see I I find your your report was very useful and that it talked about something very specific that's at an extreme uh the local market problem is in an extreme situation today but this is something that is is structural in our economy and is worse and better from day to day from year to year similarly the clearance tax issue so Israel has been withholding deducting unilaterally uh around 15% of what is due to the PA for the last three years um and and uh and transferring what Remains What it decides it it is willing to part with of Palestinian refugees now in October it went further so previous deductions included uh its calculation of Palestinian prisoners and martyrs payments that made were made by the PA in the most in October uh episode as you recall at the end of the month the Minister of Finance the extremist uh uh Minister of Finance smich didn't want of course him and his allies didn't want to transfer anything uh because basically you know as they are punishing the whole Palestinian people in Gaza they are punishing the rest of the Palestinian people and this is the best way to punish the PA so there was a huge argument obviously amazing American pressure uh whatever and so they said I mean it's typical of Israel said okay we'll we'll transfer everything but the par portion that the PA used to pay to Gaza former PA employees in Gaza and pensions in Gaza I around 100 million so what was us uh monthly a $300 million let's say clearance tax transfer to the PA was anyhow down to around 250 million because of repressed demand and was going to be another 100 million was going to be taken off so the PA said we're not going to take it you know which was a correct position I believe in the circumstances one more thing before I let you go the impact over time of this war how do you assess that even if this war were to end now look uh the numbers quoted by the undp the UN es report are good first you know back of envelope calculations we're all doing our calculations different institutions are looking at different issues we've looked at things we have a paper which will come come out very soon on the impact of the labor force uh cut off and so I mean there are so many uh uh different waves coming at us to begin with and I think this is something we didn't have a chance to talk about but you know Gaza is is we can no longer talk about the West Bank and Palestinian the Palestinian economy is one we have to not talk about West Bank uh uh e economy uh East Jerusalem economy which is another story and of course Gaza now Gaza is zero g Gaza has been decommissioned the idea that there are even 20% its labor force working at the currently is is is almost you know fantastic and they also the idea that somehow this economy is just going to pick itself up if if tomorrow the the fighting were to end but we're already talking about put aside the tens of billions that will be required for Relief and reconstruction we're already talking about an annual blow to GDP and to gross national income of up to 20 to 30% I think this year in the coming year so that 4% a month is perhaps accurate but this this is a cumulative and accumulative and a a wave after wave effect that we'll be seeing all year all next year regardless Raja khi thank you so much for all that context you're director general of the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute thanks for your time today thank you very much consider the economy of Israel now from restaurants to high-tech companies and a major gas field thousands of Israeli businesses ground to a halt after the country launched its war on Gaza the government is now spending more on everything from weapons to wages for the hundreds of thousands of reservists that it called up for military duty the finance ministry estimates the war is costing the economy around $260 million every day now that's more than a quarter of a billion dollars every day meanwhile Israel's revenue from tourism and household spending has dropped so public finances of course are strained a couple more more numbers for you to bear in mind Israel says that it raised more than $8 billion in debt since the war started the budget deficit is increasing it's expected to reach 4% of economic output this year 5% in 2024 and the cost to ensure its Sovereign bonds against the default is more than double what it was before the War Began the calculist business newspaper estimates the war could cost as much as $ 51 billion that's nearly 10% of Israel's GDP and that is if the conflict goes on for up to a year the Bank of Israel is calling on the government to balance two things support the economy on the one hand but also maintain a sound fiscal position prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to quote open the Taps and to roll out the stimulus package bigger than during the covid-19 pandemic that includes cash handouts to Army reservists and businesses affected by the war but critics uh say the measures did not go far enough and the eligibility criteria specifically to get that government money were too strict well to discuss all of this I'm joined Now by Professor Michael benad Michael is Professor of Economics at City University of London Michael this war we just said that number is costing Israel a quarter of a billion dollars a day slightly in excess of that why does this war come with a higher price tag for Israel than previous Wars it has waged we're thinking for instance of the 2006 Lebanon war oh hello so uh first of all the number uh from calcalist I think is probably the worst case scenario yes uh the direct costs are likely to be about 20 billion over the course of this year and next of which about uh 8 billion is direct defense expenditure which is more than covered by the usaid package uh that we've received of 14 billion uh uh much of the rest will be used to support the 200,000 uh civilians currently displaced uh once the uh government gets its act together and um and then rebuilding the 22 towns and Villages destroyed in the initial attack of course none of that can actually happen so that's probably sometime late next year uh because nobody is going to agree to live alongside uh G the Gaza Strip as long as it's controlled by Hamas so uh the indirect effect is Pro in terms of a loss of uh of output is probably means uh a reduction in growth from about 3% to 1.5% that means a loss of about 7 uh 7 billion dollar um again how much next year depends on how long the war will last I think uh a full year is probably uh on the extreme end uh keep in mind Israel has about $200 billion do in reserves so it's certainly possible to pay for everything um Israel is a rich country uh what we need mostly from the United States so it's very nice that the United States is so supportive but what we really need is the ability to uh buy the weapons uh because it's it's really not possible for us to produce uh given the economies of scale everything that we we require um of course it would be a lot better if we didn't have to spend the money on on these kinds of things if there were M since since you bring up since you bring up the role of the US it's a question I wanted to ask you later but I ask you now what happens if the US were to downside downscale its financial support to Israel could Israel continue to prosecute the war the way it's been doing oh absolutely as I said we have about $200 billion dollar in reserves I mean my students back in Israel would always ask me why it is that a country with a floating exchange rate has such an enormous War chest well the answer is war yeah uh you know we need this kind of uh uh a back stop precisely for these kinds of emergencies so the the money that the United States is giving us is is you know we're enormously grateful for it but it's not necessary for uh us to defend ourselves what we do need is access to the weapons we can afford to buy it at market prices we wouldn't be able to produce them ourselves that's that's the difference the Prime Minister has approved plans to amend the state budget in order to increase the deficit and cut spending on Coalition agreements now this is important there's been a political row over these Coalition funds as they're known uh money earmarked for Benjamin netanyahu's backers like payouts for Ultra Orthodox schools and for the various parties comprising the government in a letter sent to Netanyahu a group of 300 leading Israeli economists of which Michael is one said quote the grave blow that Israel was dealt requires a fundamental change in National priorities and a massive diversion of funds to deal with war damage Aid to victims and the rehabilitation of the economy now they went on a basic and necessary step would be to Halt financing of anything unessential to war first and foremost the Coalition funds why are these Coalition funds Michael so contentious there are a lot of the government institutions because of the uh a lot of political calculus about maintaining the Coalition um you know these are largely extraneous they were extraneous before the before the war they're even more extraneous now um so it's not it's not it's not even the amounts that we're talking about because again you know 3.5 billion it's less than 1% of GDP but it also just looks bad at a time that people are being asked to make sacrifices the politicians don't seem to be able to uh to come to some sort of a consensus about getting rid of a lot of these things you know there was a a big effort uh by the government to do what we would call a Judicial overhaul a change in the way the uh the government operates to centralize more power in its hands and what this P what this what what the attack has sort of demonstrated is that actually it's the civil society that they were trying to weaken that is actually Israel's great strength I mean we have a civil society Second To None uh unfortunately attached to a government that is uh kind of incompetent at the moment but you know there's an optimistic scenario to all of that and that is that it's easy to replace a failed government it's much more difficult to change the population Michael benad professor of econom economics at City University of London thank you so much Michael now the sporadic exchanges of fire along the Lebanon Israel border continue for a second month Hezbollah is attacking Israeli military positions saying that it wants to relieve pressure on its Ally Hamas in Gaza many Lebanese fear that their country could be drawn into the war and they worry about further damage to an economy that is already on its knes Sena hod reports from Beirut towns along lebanon's border with with Israel are empty homes abandoned and damaged schools closed livelihoods Frozen sporadic and at times intense crossb exchanges of fire is in its second month Hezbollah says it is relieving pressure on its Ally Hamas which is fighting Israeli soldiers in Gaza a few dozen kilometers deeper into Lebanon there is no war but it's uncertain times for a population struggling with an economic crisis the hospitality sector has been hit hard the Restaurant Association reports an 80% drop in business people are scared and anxious about the situation there are days when the streets are empty several Western and Arab governments have called on their citizens to leave or not to visit Lebanon many airlines have scaled back or cancelled flights to and from Beirut whatever is going to happen here in Lebanon a war potential war between us and Israel so uh it will it will bring this economy into a depression uh we were already into something called the stack plation but right now it's uh it's becoming a depression in the economy we have people leaving we have no tourist no tourists coming many Lebanese were already struggling to put food on the table lebanon's economy collapsed years ago instead of carrying out much needed reforms politicians used the dwindling foreign currency Reserves at the central bank now the state is nearly bankrupt and its institutions are dysfunctional tourism and remittances from Lebanese abroad have been the backbone of the economy and while people here sympathize with the Palestinians and their struggle many fear a repeat of the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel a lot of people are worried we're hoping nothing will happen but people are afraid that the Israelis will hit Beirut as well what is happening in the south is very bad tens of thousands of Lebanese have already left their homes a full-blown war or even a protracted War of Attrition confined to the Border region would be costly for a country already in Ruins zanah aljazera Beirut joining us from Beirut to discuss this is Sami atala the director of the independent Think Tank the policy initiative Sammy thank you for being with us so it's been five weeks more than five weeks now of um permanent tension between Israel and Lebanon and crossb firing of various kinds what's been the impact so far of of this what to call it of this Quasi War uh between Lebanon and Israel on lebanon's economy hi s thank you so much for having me indeed um the last few weeks were extremely tense and remain so and uh as you know there's been a loss of several innocent uh lives um at the border or close to the Border including you know civilians obviously and journalists um the use of phosphorus bombs by Israel has destroyed um a lot of you know pine trees and olive trees um and Wildlife um and as you know this is very toxic and uh as as a material and which spreads fire and has major long-term effect which we're yet to in fact assess uh more than 10,000 people probably have left the South or their Villages out of fear that this will spread and as a result of the um shelling uh by Israel on the border um as you already know it has been said in the report in fact the tourism has actually declined the number of flights coming to Lebanon has also uh been reduced uh people are very how important is that by the way the the the uh the drop the impact on the tourism sector in Lebanon it's very in fact important because the tourism sector is a key sector in the economy um Lebanese rely on tourist and the hard currency that come with the tourist uh so in fact for consumption uh particularly and the touristic establishments restaurant you know and and other touristic sites so the government says it has an emergency plan how strong is the plan of the Lebanese government because unlike Israel that we just talked about it's not like this country has a lot of cash reserves that it can draw upon briefly absolutely I mean uh Lebanon did or the Lebanese government did produce a plan um frankly um the plan is just you know Inc on paper um the Lebanese state is bankrupt as a result of the financial crisis that has been uh in place for or for the last four years um the public bureaucracy is much weaker now people are not going to to to their jobs because of the low wages as a result of the devaluation uh we have yet to see the state being really serious about actually conducting or even implementing a plan in a case of a war now as you mentioned the reserves of Lebanon have dwindled to 8 billion but I must say that the professor from uh Israel talking about the 200 billion dollar Reserve in Israel I mean it's important to sort of contextualize this because in fact nowhere where I heard that actually Israel is an occupying Palestine and hence the reserve is not to defend itself it's actually to maintain the occupation right so uh but that's about Israel but then in Lebanon lustration is much more dire as a result of these very bad policies that have actually been uh uh remain in place in the last uh few years so we hope hope that this actually doesn't escalate because the repercussions are going to be enormous on the country samala director of The Independent Think Tank the policy initiative thank you very much Sammy for your time today and that's our show for this week get in touch with us on X van seral is my
