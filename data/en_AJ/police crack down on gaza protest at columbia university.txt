well joining us now from inside the University campus is todak Kenny shawa he's a former Columbia University graduate student and he's now a policy fellow at Al Shabaka that's a Palestinian policy Think Tank welcome to Al jazer can you tell us what you saw while you were on the grounds of Columbia University yes of course uh thank you for having me on first of all um so I was just at the the encampment in front of Butler Library and after um warning students that they were going to move in they finally did and they carried out at least 30 arrests I believe um and and since they've carried out the arrests um additional hundreds of additional students have come to the have come to the um the west lawn in front of Butler Library and have taken it over instead um so it looks like this this arrest campaign is actually galvanized a lot of the a lot of the other Columbia students to come out and support of uh students who have been arrested by the NYPD and are currently being taken how many students would you say are out there right now in these encampments and these protests it should be uh nearly either nearly a thousand or several thousand now there's there's there's a couple hundred when I when I uh came inside um but again it looks like the there's been you know there's been a call to a call to action um by quad by SJP by jbp and other um uh and other student groups for other Columbia students to come to campus and it looks like again it's it's really galvanizing a lot of people so right now there's hundreds if not potentially thousands of students out there what are the students calling for their demands are are simple um you know they're they're calling for the University to do more to support a ceas fire to call for a ceas fire in Gaza but they're also calling to the university to divest from uh companies that profit from uh the occupation and the oppression of Palestinians um and they've made their demands uh extremely clear over the over the past months and in years actually there's been multiple uh divestment votes that have succeeded and passed in which uh the majority of the student body has called for divestment from these investments in Israeli companies or companies that profit from the Israeli occupation but the university unfortunately continues to ignore the Democratic will of their own students um and as long as they do so um it looks like the students are GNA are going to remain out protesting and and and demanding uh that their Democratic will be respected all right to Kenn shwa thank you so much for speaking to us from New York thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
