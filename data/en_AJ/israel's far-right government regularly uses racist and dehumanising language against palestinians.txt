multiple Israeli politicians and military leaders have been using inflammatory language when referring to Palestinians in Gaza and this is something that began well before Hamas launched its military offensive no electricity no food no water no fuel everything will be closed we are fighting against human animals that was the Israeli defense minister yuav Galant referring to members of Hamas his language was echoed by senior military leaders Israel's farri government regularly uses racist and dehumanizing language which normalizes violence against Palestinians the national security minister posted this comment on social media supporting an ultra nationalist Israeli accused of attacking Palestinians in the occupied West Bank here's the statement a Jew who defends himself and others against the murder of Palestinians is not a murder suspect but a hero who will receive my full support and the far-right fin Finance Minister bezel smartr openly said that the Palestinian town of horaa should be quote erased that was after hundreds of Israeli settlers went on a rampage burning dozens of Palestinian homes and killing one person AKA Eldar joins us from Tel Aviv he is a political analyst and columnist for heds thank you for coming on to talk about this with us first start by giving us your perspective on this language that we've been hearing from high ranking Israeli officials sir let you just said it's not a completely new phenomena uh this kind of discourse of uh dehumanization of the other started many many years ago begging the first first leader of the leud uh has called Arafat an animal walking on two legs uh this is a language that was used to called to describe Adolf Hitler the uh Nazi terrorist the Nazi uh leader um I I can't justify the uh operation the uh murder of children women raping um members of the communities and kibuts in the South uh there is a difference between this and what Israel is doing and uh um I I can pull out dozens of articles that I wrote criticizing the Israeli uh conduct in the West Bank and Gaza uh now what you see is using the anger and the frustration from uh the Israeli military and political blunders serial blunders um in order to pave the way for uh as Manan just said uh an Israeli Invasion and reoccupation of Gaza and uh destroying communities there and shutting down electricity and water which is uh actually a human crime against humanity um but uh I afraid that uh it's not only the language that is used against the Palestinian or the Hamas I have been labeled called a traitor because I wrote articles criticizing Nano uh people who were demonstrating to defend the Israeli democracy uh Pilots have been dehumanized while they were in the field in the front uh you could read in the social media supporters of netan um calling them fif K and uh accusing them of collaborating with Hamas so this is a slippery slope serial it it will not end with the confront this round of Confrontation AA a couple different things here first of all you were saying um you were saying I can't condone uh the raping of women in southern Israel just a reminder we got that Hamas statement maybe about 15 minutes ago where they categorically deny in their words assaulting women um just want to put that out there my question was going to be what do Israelis think when they hear this language Human animals etc etc um well I'm sure that uh EO people down there in near T Aviv can find the footage of uh a bunch of Israeli holigans entering now uh a hospital and looking for a Palestinian who uh was wounded and treated by Israeli doctors and shouting death to the Arabs and trying to attack the doctors who were defending the uh patients so of course it penetrates into the society um if you watch soccer games in Israel you can hear those people shouting death to the Arabs and assaulting uh Israeli Arabs who are fighting for the national who are playing in the national team so it works for them and it works politically to dehumanize everybody who doesn't support the Israeli right or the Israeli settlers uh you know when I go to cover um the uh conduct of the settlers I am more afraid that I will not get back home safely not because I am afraid of the Palestinians who live nearby but of the settlers so it is not just a racist uh dehumanization of Palestinian it's a a political uh maneuver it's I think a system it's a method to get the support because netan is a master he's a Salesman of hatred and this is what he's doing best AKA Eldar thank you so much for joining us on the program you're a political analyst and columnist at har it's good to talk to you today thank you
