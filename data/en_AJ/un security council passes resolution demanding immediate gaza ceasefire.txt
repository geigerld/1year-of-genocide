situation in Gaza is a matter of grave concern to the entire International Community indeed the escalation of the conflict in the Gaza strep and its catastrophic consequences are a clear threat to International Peace and Security in this context the E10 felt compelled to table this draft resolution before you the 15 members of this Council individually and collectively have a mandate under the charter to work for the maintenance of interational peace and security and their actions impact the entire International Community this is the strong conviction that led to the drafting of the text that we are considering this morning this Council has been consistently unanimous in its agreement on the obligation of the parties in Conflict to respect international law including International humanitarian law and international human rights law d10 have always supported the call for an immediate sisire in Gaza as a fundamental step for this reason and in respect for the holy month of Ramadan we have proposed the present resolution that demands an immediate ceasefire during this second period leading to a permanent and sustainable uh ceasefire at the same time the draft resolution demands the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and emphasizes that humanitarian access must be allowed to address their medical and other humanitarian needs these have been among our key demands for weeks the draft resolution further demands that the parties comply with their obligations under international law as we said before including International humanitarian law and human rights law the draft resolution also emphasizes the need for the parties to abide by the pertinent resolutions adopted by this Council including resolutions 2712 and 2720 of 2023 the10 have a consultative have adopted a consultative approach during the negotiation process of this text we have consulted extensively and in good faith with all members of this Council in a Frank open and flexible manner with the aim of achieving a text that addresses the situation in Gaza the adoption of this draft resolution will certainly be another important step uh this Council can build upon to comprehensively address the crisis in Gaza given the utmost urgency of the situ situation we call upon all members Council all and each member of this Council to vote in favor of this resolution while this resolution is crucial it is essential that we continue working towards a comprehensive ceasefire and a lasting peace in the region I thank you Mr President I thank the representative of mosambik for their statement I give the floor to the representative of Russian Federation um stunned and disappointed about the way the work on the draft resolution in the last 24 hours was done the fact that the word permanent in op1 uh relating to a ceasefire is proposed to be replaced by a more weak wording was something we learned about a little more than an hour before the beginning of the meeting that is unacceptable we all received instructions for the vote on the text that contained the word permanent and we believe that that is of fundamental importance all of the remaining wording uh leaves too broad an area for interpretation which could could allow Israel to resume its military operation in the Gaza Strip at any moment following the expiry of the ceasefire which we today hope will be established in order to avoid this scenario we would like to make an oral Amendment to the text and return the word permanent in op1 in so doing it would read as it read in the previously issued resolution namely the Fs in immediate ceasefire for the months of Ramadan respected by all parties leading to a permanent sustainable ceasefire and also demands the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages as well as uring humanitarian access to to address their medical and other humanitarian needs and further demands that the parties comply with their obligations under international law in relation to all to all persons they detain I thank the representative of Russian Federation for their statement members of the council have before them a proposed amendment submitted by Russian Federation to the text of the draft resolution contained in the document 254 submitted by Nigeria Ecuador Guyana Sion Slovenia and Switzerland rule 36 of the council's provisional

their flexibility and the constructive way that allowed us today to adopt this long awaited resolution a resolution that calls for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip in order to put an end to the massacres that unfortunately are still ongoing over the past five years five months over the past five months the Palestinian people has suffered greatly this blood bath has continued for far too long it is Our obligation to put an end to this blood bath before it is too late finally finally the Security Council is shouldering its respons responsibility as the primary organ responsible for maintaining International Peace and security it is finally responding to the calls of the International calls not only from the International Community but also from the Secretary General Mr Antonio gues and once again we renew our support to the Secretary General for his Noble position and for his support to this just cause despite the heinous campaigns that were were launched against him Mr President when we voted on the draft resolution tabled by Algeria last month we promised that we will spare no effort we will continue to work hard to make sure that the Security Council is abiding by

conditions to and the suffering of the Palestinian people it is the responsibility of the security Council to ensure the implementation of the provisions of this resolution in conclusion Mr President I reaffirm that Algeria will return once again before the Council under the instructions of his Excellency the president of the Republic to make sure that Palestine returns to its natural status as a full-fledged member a sovereign member states of the United Nations I thank you I thank the representative of Algeria for their statement I give the floor to the representative of the United States thank you Mr President at the top I want to express my deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of last week's terrorist attack in Moscow we condemn terrorism in all its forms and stand in solidarity with the Russian people and grieving the loss of life from this horrific event colleagues today this Council spoke out in support of the ongoing diplomatic efforts led by the United States Qatar Egypt to bring about an immediate and sustainable ceasefire secure the immediate release of all hostages and help alleviate the tremendous suffering of Palestinian civilians I in Gaza who are in dire need of protection and life-saving humanitarian assistance the United States fully supports these critical objectives in fact they were the foundation of the resolution we put forward last week a resolution that Russia and China vetoed but colleagues the United States support for these objectives is not simply rhetorical we're working around the clock to make them real on the ground through diplomacy because we know that it is through only through diplomacy that we can push this agenda forward we're getting closer to a deal for an immediate ceasefire with the release of all hostages but we're not there yet now let's be clear a ceasefire could have come about months ago if Hamas had been willing to release hostages months ago instead M continues to stand in the way of peace to throw up roadblocks cow in tunnels beneath Gaza cities and behind uh under civilian infrastructure and hide among the civilian population so today my ask to members of this Council and to member states in every region of the world is this speak out and demand unequivocally that Hamas accepts the deal on the table now I hope I'm wrong I really do but I don't expect that from Russia and China especially because they still can't bring themselves to condemn hamasa terrorist attacks on October 7th just last week Russia and China vetoed a resolution that condemned this horrific attack a resolution the vast majority of this Council supported they have shown time and time again that they are not actually interested in advancing aor a peace through diplomatic efforts nor for all their rhetoric are they interested in making any meaningful contributions to humanitarian efforts instead they are using this devastating conflict as a political codo to try to divide this council at a time when we need to come together it is deeply deeply cynical and we should all see through it colleagues we appreciated the willingness of members of this Council to take some of our edits and improve on this resolution still certain key edits were ignored including our requests to add a condemnation of Hamas and we did not agree with everything in the resolution for that reason we were unfortunately not able to vote yes however as I've said before we fully support some of the critical objectives in this non-binding resolution and we believe it was important for the council to speak out and make clear that our ceasefire must any ceasefire must come with the release of all hostages indeed as I've said before the only path to a durable end to this conflict is the release of all hostages critically a ceasefire and the release of hostages will allow much more humanitarian Aid to get into Gaza at a time when famine is looming large and provide an opportunity to work toward a sustainable cessation of hostilities toward a future where Hamas can no longer threaten Israel and never repeat October 7th and no longer control Gaza and use civilians as Shields toward a future where Palestinians and israelies live side by side in peace in two Democratic states of their own something that will never happen with Hamas a terrorist organization dedicated to the destruction of Israel and the killing of JW a terrorist organization this body still fails to condemn controlling hamama uh controlling Gaza colleagues we meet during the holy month of Ramadan this should be a reason a season of Peace for Muslim communities around the world just as October 7th simhat Torah should have been a day of peace for Jewish communities this resolution rightly acknowledges that that during the month of Ramadan we must recommit to peace amamas can do that by accepting the deal on the table a ceasefire can begin immediately with the release of the first hostage and so we must put pressure on Hamas to do just that this is the only path to securing a ceasefire and the release of hostages as we have all called for today that is what this resolution means a ceasefire of any duration must come with the release of hostages this is the only path thank you very much Mr President I thank the representative of the United States for their Slovenia thank you very much Mr President today is an important day we're bringing you live pictures from the United Nations where members of the security Council have voted uh to support a resolution uh which demands an immediate ceasefire for the month of to a lasting sustainable ceasefire the vote for that was 14 in favor zero against one exstension that was the US
