genocide Global outrage over the war on Gaza is growing the massacres and Devastation are putting countries Under Pressure to act against Israel some have already announced they're breaking off diplomatic relations so will this pressure the US and Israel's other Western allies to reconsider their support for the war this is Inside [Music] hello there welcome to the program I'm Nick Clark so Israel's bombardment of Gaza is now into its second month more than 10,000 Palestinians have been killed huge sways of the strip have been reduced to Rubble as public anger grows around the world over what some according a genocide Israel is facing something of a diplomatic backlash South Africa and Bolivia have severed relations with Tel Aviv other countries recalling their ambassadors and Embassy staff this is seriously setting back Israel's efforts in recent years to establish relations with many nations that boycotted it for decades so can these diplomatic moves pressure the US and Israel's other Western allies to push it to at least agree to a humanitarian ceasefire we'll be discussing this and more with our guest shortly but first this report from Sarah Gil for one month Gaza has been under unrelenting attack continuous air strikes have left a catastrophic trail of Destruction every basic service is either not functioning or overwhelmed hospitals schools mosques churches grocery stores and bakeries have been reduced to Rubble more than 10,000 people have been killed in some of his sharpest remarks yet the head of the United Nations has called again for a ceasefire and help for those under attack the parties to the conflict and indeed the International Community face an immediate and fundamental responsibility to stop the inhuman Collective suffering and dramatically expand humanitarian Aid to Gaza Israel is facing pressure to stop the strikes not only from the highest ranks at the UN but also from Nations around the world several countries have withdrawn their ambassadors from Israel Bolivia was the first country to stise South Africa is the latest we believe the nature uh of response by Israel has become uh one of collective punishment which Falls fully outside of the practice of international humanitarian and international human rights law as well as growing diplomatic isolation protests against Israel's war on Gaza are being held around the world from Jakarta to Washington DC some countries have even seen their largest demonstrations ever Israel's staunchest Western allies including the US are coming under increas ining pressure to reevaluate their position on the war so can the Biden Administration persuade Israel to at least agree to a humanitarian Ceasar Sara Gil fit inside story well since the fighting began in Gaza nine countries have recalled their ambassadors or have cut off diplomatic relations with Israel NATO member turkey has withdrawn its Ambassador so has Israel's neighbor Jordan that says the country is committing war crimes South Africa is the latest to join the list and Bolivia was the first to completely seati with Israel it said its decision was a condemnation of the aggressive and disproportionate Israeli military offensive taking place in Gaza so let's bring in our guest today we are stacked with diplomatic and political expertise in Islamabad we have Mala Loi who's a former Pakistani ambassador to the United Kingdom to the United States and to the United Nations in Aman jaad anani who's a former deputy prime minister and foreign minister in Jordan and in ptor aali boa mun a professor of African politics at the University of South Africa a warm welcome to each of you uh ja danani I'd like to start with you let's cut to the chase as a former foreign minister you know well very well the machinations of diplomacy so before we get to the nitty-gritty of Jordan's position generally how serious do you think the all these diplomatic withdrawals are for Israel should Israel will Israel heed them as a warning will it make any difference as to how they proceed do you think well I'm sure they are a little bit concerned about them but probably they will not dissuade this current government from continuing with the same uh with the same genocide that it is now practicing uh so far we just heard from netan that he is going to take care of the security in Gaza for an indefinite period of time this is uh just a polite word not polite but another word for for OCC occupation and so therefore instead of uh allowing the Palestinians the freedom to have their own State he is now controlling more more more restoring the occupation to Gaza which the Israelis Rel under ex prime minister Shon so in a way uh this is not going anywhere so far and there is not and the demands and the and the United States and judging from the statements which have been made by Mr blankin state Secretary of State are not encouraging at all uh we hear of course some changes some tones in Europe but that is not echoing yet and not resonating with Israel government okay Mali you're former Pakistani ambassador to the UK and the United States and to the UN again you know very well how this all works but do you sense a growing sense of Discord in the global Community do you think we will see more ties being CT I think what we are witnessing right now is that the tide of global opinion has moved decisively against Israel and in solidarity with the Palestinians I think there are several indicators of this uh one I we know that a majority of countries in fact almost two-thirds voted for a ceasefire in the UN General Assembly uh so you can see that the US and Israel who opposed the resolution um you know they were defeated second uh as you mentioned more and more countries are severing uh their ties with Israel or recalling their ambassadors three I think another indicator is that the pro Palestinian protests across the world are just growing in intensity and there there is a momentum uh to them which is really quite unprecedented and the fourth indicator I would say of uh this change in the tide of uh Global opinion is that we have seen very strong statements from the 18 heads of un agencies and NOS that have called for a ceasefire and have expressed shock and horror at what Israel is doing so we are looking at a changing Dynamic here uh all of this pressure I think is necessary but still not sufficient to dissuade the United States from its blind support of Israel right so M I was just about to come to that because it's all very well talking about this change in Dynamic and this tide of global opinion but while Israel has the US support Mala it doesn't make any difference it can just proceed as it wishes well it seems that the only country that Israel will respond to is the United States but I think the fact that secretary blinken has been shuttling between various Middle Eastern countries shows that there is increasing worry uh in the Biden Administration also I think if you look at what's happening at the UN Security Council after three failed attempts to get a resolution through which would be binding uh there is a fourth attempt as I speak now whether the deadlock in the security Council can be broken or not we have to wait and see so far the gridlock is there uh but the US is coming under increasing pressure and as I said before this pressure diplomatic pressure is necessary but still not sufficient all right we'll explore the the situation the UN and the UN Security Council in particular shortly but let's get the view from South Africa now from ptor Cali B uh South Africa of course a big big International player and such a decision will not have come likely uh to withdraw the Ambassador tell us about the considerations that the top brass in South Africa would have been taken into account as they made this decision there are quite a number of aspects or factors that led to South Africa's view of withdrawing uh firstly it is the question of increasing public protest which we have seen recently ever since the uh attacks on Israel by by Hamas and of course the the subsequent um attacks by the Israeli military on Gaza and civilians and so on so that is the main thing that in my view has uh led us to this decision whereby South Africa eventually felt that they need to pull out but we mustn't forget that South Africa during the aparted era many freedom fighters from the African National Congress from the Pana africanist Congress and other Liberation movements were supported by the Palestinians and to that extent South Africa feels a very very strong sense of solidarity with the Palestinians especially black South Africans we are not discounting the fact that there is also a sizable Jewish population here we should obviously you know aside with with with Israel and the most important thing is that in the Diplomatic sphere withdrawing an ambassador or even cutting diplomatic ties sends a very very serious message a strong message and I think this is what the South Africans are doing also not just for South Africa but in line with many African countries because the African Union has also taken a similar strong position with the statement that they Rel released recently condemning Israel's attacks on Gaza do do you think that other African nations will follow suit now do I think so African the African nations are what sorry can you repeat do you think other African nations will follow suit now absolutely I think other African nations will follow suit currently it must be said it would appear that the Africans are divided African countries are divided what with countries like Zambia countries like Kenya like Ghana and Congo Republic seemingly supporting Israel but we must not forget that a divisive War such as this one is quite likely also to invoke what I I would call real politic in other words those countries looking at their own economic and security interest because Israel has been supporting them in one way or the other in terms of you know dealing with drought relief and so on so quite likely we are quite likely to see those States apparently you know siding with Israel but the majority in my view and the moral Viewpoint seems to rest with the Palestinians because as the secet Secretary General Gutierrez said this issue is about occupation and in my view I also want to stress that we must not forget that we keep talking about the attack of Israel on Gaza or the attacks of Hamas on on Israel we forget that actually this is the issue around the rise of Palestinians to self determination which seems to be falling off the radar or of the international Global agenda repeatedly jard so Jordan has acted decisively but few other Arab Nations have been quite so bold H and it seems that many people on the street are calling for them to do so do you think there may yet be more support and decisive action and and sing of ties from from the Arab world well thank you I believe that they should uh this is the time that they should because there is no way uh for the Arab masses which are really protesting and expecting more from their leaders to accept the current status status as as is seeing the Bloodshed and the devastation and the mayhe which Israel is inflicting on the people of Gaza uh and also in the West Bank and if they let this uh continue in Gaza then it will probably be transferred to the West Bank as well and we will see continuation of this ugliness uh I think what we need to see from the Arab leaders who are going to meet on for a summit meeting on the on the 11th of this month uh very soon five days from now they should really make a decision that they should all take a unanimous uh decision to withdraw their ambassadors whoever have ambassadors that that's pretty unlikely is it that's pretty unlikely given past performance well this is what what the people expect now whether these people are going to respond to that or not uh let's wait and see uh malha what about in Pakistan there's been a lot of protests there too as we've been showing on Al jazer but again not matched by government action yes I think the public in Pakistan expected a stronger response from the government but I think the protest demonstrations show uh that the people sentiment in solidarity with the Palestinians remains strong and I think now the focus is on the meeting or the summit meeting that has been called where Pakistan will also be present in Riyad of the organization of Islamic cooperation now this is the largest Muslim block so we have to wait and see whether any actions emanate uh from this conference or whether we're just going to hear a lot of condemnations and denunciations so this is going to be a key key Summit uh I'm a little surprised that it took a month for for this to be convened but then as they say better late than ever now these are obviously all ways in which diplomatic pressure is being mounted primarily on the United States so that it begins to see uh that its policy its dysfunctional policy in the Middle East is going to bring much more grief uh to the region uh as well as to its own policies uh in the region because I think today the United States and many European countries uh confront uh a crisis of credibility uh as the Secretary General said this is a crisis about humanity and I think on that score we've seen that the United States and many European countries have come up short they have not shown the kind of compassion uh for the killings that are going on uh in Gaza that they really should have and that their own publics also expect them to do K B is this all this diplomatic pressure and if it does build if if more Nations stise do you think it will yield anything are we to see at least a chance for a humanitarian pause at least Nick if I was speaking as a diplomat I would say probably this would H you know um affect the situation positively and bring about some changes here and there but as I speak as a student and Scholar of politics or political science I get very very dejected or disappointed knowing that this is almost like a tired you know musical record we've been here before whereby attacks of this nature violence of this nature erupts and the International Community chres foul and they try to do some ceasefire here and there and you know with people go to Oso and then after the the the the the signing of the PCT or the agreement the it is flouted and it is torn to shreds and we are back again you here so I'm a bit um um pessimistic about what this will bring about however like I said in my earlier comments this in my view will bring to bear sub sufficient or effective pressure diplomatic pressure as it were on the Israeli government as well as obviously bring about to Bear pressure on those you know governments or countries that might be feeling that they want to sit on the fence or at least to support Israel because once there's a lot of noise that is happening at the United Nations security Council un security general assembly and other International platforms when you bring in the the European Union and all the other countries in my view we will proba quite likely see you know a shift but a shift to what's the solution I am not so sure because there are other factors to consider once we start talking about this more than one century you know old conflict between Israel and Palestine jard in your experience as a a top level politician you've acted as foreign secretary roaming the world and and indeed you know the region of course very very well how does this crisis rank in terms of uh Global concern about how the war is being executed and where all this could lead well there is uh as your other inter other two honorable interlocutors have said that there is a growing concern and you have have pointed this out uh over over the world eventually somebody must heed that the United States of course I agree is the key uh is the key uh factor in this equation and I believe that they should exercise some power however we know that President Biden is facing probably tough uphill elections next November uh and at the same time he is uh looking to the probably the interest of the United States that are being tied to Israel and so in a way uh he is hesitant and he's not taking any any action uh the structure of his cabinet anyway and his AIDS who come to this area probably is very much biased and pro-israeli uh so I really think that uh the internal pressure within the United States can really impact that if he is feels that probably he could lose some of the states key key States uh or what we call what we might call swing States if they if those turn against them especially where there are Arab and Muslim majorities Muslim solid minorities then probably he would and and those could tip the balance against him in especially some Midwestern states of the United States uh and then he probably would not stand the chance of winning next November election so in a way he must be reminded and he must be pressed upon in order to recalculate uh his mathematical his political mathematical political numbers and at the same time uh take the right action that we expect a member of the United Nations who has been uh the primary intermediary in the peace process to take a more uh just and Equitable approach to this problem especially that we see what we see every day on television and we have to start also invoking the word genocide and not only genocide but the word you know this is in an apide State and uh uh my friend from South Africa have gone through that experience there is a deep sense among many africanas that you know what happened to them is happening to the Palestinians and there is a deep empathy here and so therefore nobody can question the right of the Palestinians to protest and to react to the inflicting pain that is that is that doesn't seem to stop uh whether we are inviting or whether they are resisting or whether they are accepting the the mod the the facto situation which Israel is dictating on their lives okay you've all you've all expressed dismay at the the failure of the UN Security Council Malia you have written about it indeed uh China currently has a rotating chair of the UN Security Council H is that going to make any difference in these coming critical days well I think China will push very hard uh for the kind of resolution that the Russians had proposed which as you know was vetoed by the United States which is a resolution calling for a ceasefire now as I understand that the E10 or the 10 elected non-permanent members of the security Council have put a draft together but that doesn't call for a ceasefire not as yet it calls only for a humanitarian pause so we are likely to see a great deal of intense negotiation uh in the days ahead because there is still no agreement uh between uh the Chinese the Arab countries and the Russians who all want a ceasefire and the United States and its allies some of whom are non-permanent members also who still are talking about a short duration uh pause which is neither here nor there because anything temporary is not going to stop the fighting it's not going to stop the Bloodshed so I think the push for a security Council resolution from China we will see but whether that's enough for the United States to relent uh on its position um it it's hard to it's hard to tell right now K boha why is the United States so Resolute in its support of Israel do you think I think partly because the excisable majority of the Jewish population obviously after the Holocaust in Germany and other places fled to the United States and eventually ended up um exercising significant influence in terms of uh you know foreign policy maybe foreign and domestic policy in the US and to that extent I you know attribute this to that kind of influence however having said that we must also know that you know states are want known to sign diplomatic and bilateral you know PS that will obviously ensure that one state or one country One Nation supports the other even when they are facing what the other state might not feel you know as justifiable to to find a war that know they might think is not winable so I agree with some of the penals that in this regard the US also is a very very key player uh in a sense that um it it seems to have a better side of the ear of Israel if one want wants to use that that phrase but it will also depend on whether the Israeli regime is willing to listen because we know in our case in the South African situation during the aparted era when many Western countries were supporting apartate H we had a similar situation whereby the powerful countries were listening to the minority apart government and of course you know discounting the majority voices of the African countries and other people in in the African diaspora and globally So to that extent I believe that as the phrase has been mentioned aparate Israel it will be very very important for the usual the the the US and allies and other forces of of course to look at what Israel is doing in terms of you know the um international human rights law and what others call genocide to find out whether it is actually justifiable to go to this extent I know Israel is talking about retaliating and you know is taking Israel to defend itself but also we cannot have a humanitarian disaster happening in this time and and era of this Century forgetting that this happened during the times of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the the Second World War uh jard I just want to wind up the program with you we've been talking a lot about the the countless more than 10,000 deaths that we've seen in Gaza but we haven't spoken of the the fear of contagion of this uh this war spreading throughout the region that is of course a very important consideration isn't it yeah I believe that yes sir I believe that uh the longer this war stays the more it will spread to other regions another you cannot Escape that fact uh International countries will be impacted by that the world economy is going to be impacted by that and then some superow countries will start looking for opportunities to see how they can benefit from the situation uh this is not a very nice world all the time and War if it Contin of course it will spread and it will involve many other countries and the Mayhem that would would result would probably be uncontrollable you can start a war but you cannot probably finish it uh so therefore we have to uh really try to contain the war reach a ceasefire immediately uh all this bology about uh you know human human Corridor uh is just another way of saying that Kill Them Softly uh and uh we need to have a ceasefire where gazans can have access to their basic needs uh and start rebuilding their own town uh otherwise the whole region is going to be on fire all right with that we'll leave it thank you to all our guest Mal ja anani and thank thank you very much indeed and thank you too for watching you can find this
