well let's take you back to those live pictures that we've been getting in from Southern Gaza as you can see people are still reeling there in the aftermath of what's believed to be an Israeli air strike on a hospital now I'm hearing that hundreds of people are believed to have been Sheltering in the backyard of that hospital we know obviously 1.1 million people were forced to leave Northern Gaza or ordered to evacuate a large number of them moved South they've been taking shelter wherever they can find Space hospitals in unra the the UN agency there their schools which were also hit we know this evening now in the last few minutes we've watched a number of shelters with Wounded people going past we know that there are children we've been seeing them on our screens we also know that a Doctor Who's just been speaking there says that he believes that this hospital was deliberately targeted as I was saying earlier hundreds of people Sheltering there at that hospital and obviously we we don't have any word yet on any kind of casualty toll we'll bring that to you as and when we get it let's bring in our correspondent Tark Abu AUM he's on the ground there for us in southern Gaza he's in the town of Khan unun TK I know this is possibly very shocking for many of our viewers but I can't imagine this is very shocking to you after what you've been experiencing over the last few nights well uh after just before a couple of uh minutes uh has been a huge bombardment took place in Al Arab Ali Hospital which called Al madani Hospital central the Gaza Strip This hospital is located in the central of the Gaza Strip which contains hundreds and thousands of Palestinians who have been injured during the isra dur the Israeli ongoing strikes on The besieged Enclave meanwhile this hospital is crowded with civilians to till this current moment hundreds of wounded people and victims are reaching the hospitals the hos the Al Arab hospital is similar to the place that we are right now in where people are gathering everywhere so it seems that this hospital has been uh bombarded without any prior warning causing severe destruction inside the hospital which uh prevent the hospital from continuing and briding medical services for thousands of people there and it's important also to mention that this place is full of residential buildings and commercial shops in the surrounding areas a true Massa took place in that building where till this current moment ambulances are evacuating injured people uh T I believe that we're hearing that hundreds are now feared dead after this air strike given the number of people who were Sheltering in the area of that hospital I just saw a woman and and a young girl in in a corner of that of that live footage that we're getting can you give us a sense of the the kinds of people that we're seeing take shelter in places like this at the moment well uh in Al madani Hospital in the Arab a hospital a lot of people thousands of people really display the houses from the Northern areas of the Gaza Strip they move forward to Central areas because they don't have any further place to hide in uh they thought that this place is going to be safe shelter for them but meanwhile it has been targeted by the Israeli aircraft without any prior warning uh the the the deliberate uh targeting of civilians really led to a very great jump in terms of the death toll uh the death toll number that till this current moment the ministry the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza is working on ID identifying the number of victims in order to be released after just uh after just an hour from now so the the surging number of victims and air strikes also is unprecedented due to the Israeli ongoing strikes as you can clearly hear right now there is an ulence is right to is about to enter the hospital carrying out a lot of victims you'll right now see it in the background even the southern areas of the Gaza trip were heavily bombarded from the Israeli uh different kinds of artillery and aircraft the uh the the current situation the Gaza Strip is really massively uh deteriorating people are not really uh able to keep C on the current situation as the is the Israeli compartment continue without making any discrimination without making any differentiation between civilians that are trying to attack civilians the the majority of uh the victims were young children and women uh T indeed we we just saw a very young boy with a very blooded head um pass in front of the camera there and I do want to apologize to our viewers and some of you may find these very shocking images disturbing this is obviously a live feed that we're getting right now from Southern Gaza so you're seeing things as we get them here on Al jazer tar we also have had word that an unra school that was also Sheltering many many families was also hit and obviously these are schools that have taken in people who've been evacuated from elsewhere do we know yet whether they received any kind of warning I understand six people were killed there well uh even uh the school affiliated to the United Nations uh was bombarded without any prior warning this facility is related to the United Nation that must be protected by the principle of the international law meanwhile this uh this school has been bombarded by an air strike where six Palestinians were killed due to this attack now bombardment is everywhere inside the Gaza Strip people are rushing to uh to be safe from the uh from the Israeli Bart meanwhile every single corner and the Gaza Strip get bombarded without any kind of a prior warning civilians are falling right now inside the Gaza Strip the Palestinian Ministry of Health is trying to do her its best in order to keep providing Services due to the great shortage of uh fuel uh a lot of a lot of facilities are related and affiliat to the Palestinian Ministry of Health has been bombarded by the Israeli ongoing strikes we are talking about five hospitals were evacu were threatened with evacuation while its Medical Teams refused the Israeli orders to evacuate in order to be able to continue uh its services as you can clearly right now see uh the Israeli the Palestinian ambulances vehicles are trying uh their best in order to evacuate uh victims the surrounding areas of the hospitals are crowded of people the number of victims is increasing and uh the the state of emergency in inside the palestinia territory of Gaza is really escalating right now T we are indeed watching more of the injured moving through that hospital I am hearing now that it's believed that it wasn't just hundreds but thousands of people were Sheltering at that hospital T when we spoke last you and I were talking about the um the medical supplies that are available to these hospitals obviously they've been running short you said that fuel has obviously also been running short do we have any sense of how long fuel might last we can see that the lights are still on at this hospital but how long is that potentially going to continue well there is not any further confirmation about the long the the duration of time that the the fuel will uh remain but might be run out within the coming hours due to the uh press release that had been stated by the Palestinian minister of health warning that it's uh its uh storage of fuel will run out within the coming hours it means that the situation in the Gaza Strip the medical situation in the Gaza Strip had reached critical level that the even the medical uh abilities the medical services might not be able to be provided to local Palestinians if this uh great crisis and the great shortage of medical supplies continues and the now the the number of Palestinian victims is really incredibly uh is increasing and you are talking about more than nine hospitals are trying to do their best due to the Israeli shortage of medical supplies they are trying to provide them with the treatment meanwhile different pharmaceutical warehouses were destroyed by the Israeli compartment also a lot of Medical Teams uh a lot of Medical Teams workers families were bombarded and even were killed by the Israeli ongoing strikes so the situation now inside the Gaza Strip is massively turned into chaot chaotic situation where victims are falling everywhere we are waiting as Palestinians we are waiting for further intervention to to to protect Palestinians well if you've just joined us here on alaz you are watching well explosions Rockets or lights we're not sure exactly what that is but that is above the Gaza Strip those are live pictures from the Gaza Strip as you can see it's a very very dark Gaza Strip electricity food and fuel have been cut off we know that in the last couple of hours a number of Civilian targets have been hit whether or not they were targeted they have been hit a hospital there as you can see has been hit We Believe thousands of people were were Sheltering in the backyard of that hospital facility we also know that unra that's the UN relief from Works agency that looks after Palestinian refugees also says that one of its schools which was acting as a shelter was hit and six people were killed well it is now just after 1,700 GMT and you're watching live coverage here on Al jazer of the Israeli Gaza War well let's go back to our correspondent tar Abu AUM he's on the ground there for us in southern Gaza tar just reminding some of our viewers who might only be joining us here at the top of the hour what they are seeing on their screens is the aftermath of an Israeli air strike on a hospital in southern Gaza and that's something that has been happening numerous times over the course of the last few days well uh the Israeli bombart on the Gaza Strip continues and knew masaka had be committed in central areas of the Gaza Strip in Al Arab Hospital which called Al madani hospital this hospital is located Central the Gaza Strip according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health right now inside the Gaza Strip the number of death total has been uh run Rising sharply uh due to the Israeli ongoing strikes around from 200 to 30 Palestinians have been killed due to the Israel strikes those Palestinians have been killed without any prior warning the situation in Gaza Strip is really catastrophic buildings have been destroyed roads have been destroyed civil infrastructure also destroyed victims are Fallen everywhere there is no any safe place inside the Gaza Strip journalists were targeted hospitals also have been bombarded by the Israeli occupation forces without having any kind of a prior warning ambulance are rushing around the clock in order to evacuate victims in these areas it's also important to mention that till this current moment the evacuation process of those victims inside Central the Gaza Strip in Arab AI hospital is still going uh very low pressure on the hospital capabilities specifically in a shaat hospital they are now trying to do as much as they can in order to keep providing treatment for those victims but it's also important to mention that people were residing in the complex area uh in inside the alarab hospital uh generally even similar to the conditions in every single Hospital inside the Gaza Strip a shifat hospital also is crowded with people more than 30,000 Palestinians are residing in the surrounding areas of the complex it seems that the situation in the Gaza Strip is really getting such a huge deterioration uh without Palestinian minister of Health are appealing is appealing to the International Community to open humanitarian corridors in order to aide medical help for Palestinians in order to be able to to complete the work in providing a treatment for thousands of Palestinians uh who are in from time to another I just want here to take a moment to apologize to our viewers you are obviously watching a live feed from Gaza right now there are potentially some very disturbing images on your screen that will pass from time to time obviously these are shocking images this is the aftermath of an air strike on a hospital where it's believ thousands of people were Sheltering T you were telling me just moments ago that this is a hospital that's in a in a residential neighborhood and there was absolutely no sense that this might happen there was no warning given uh um again please I cannot hear you I I was just I'm sorry and I I appreciate that you you yourself are surrounded by sirens and ambulances right now TK I was just asking about whether any warning was given about these air strikes well uh there is a new compartment took place even in khuna city where I'm I'm standing right now it's closed to the hospital by the way uh medical ambulances vehicles are rushing in order to EV uate victims from these targeted areas they are just moving uh with high very high speed in order to rescue them from being uh from being uh killed uh even from time to another different injuries have been uh reached to the hospital here also this hospital is uh similar to the Arab a hospital which is full of people now we are talking about a lot of gatherings are s are standing around us right now just following the live they are just following the situation they are afraid of being targeted also uh this great sense of fear has been broen to the hearts and minds of all Palestinians in different areas inside the Gaza Strip even hospitals are not yet protected from the Israeli ongoing compartment uh the Gaza Strip conditions are really witnessing a huge iteration uh there must be very urgent uh let's say International intervention in order to protect Palestinians and even to provide them with with humanitarian Aid in order to be able to to cope with the current uh situation T just in the last few minutes we've watched two very very small children on our screen one being held by an an older woman and another injured um very little person move across our screen we know that there were families who were Sheltering in this area and now we are hearing from a health spokesman in Gaza initial estimates suggest that between 200 and 300 people were killed in this bombing you were also talking to us a bit earlier T about the supplies that hospitals have at the moment to to deal with this this is AAL hospital that was acting not only as a hospital but as a shelter now they're not only dealing with injuries that of the people who were there but also of the injured who are coming into the hospital seeking care can you give us a sense of what the facilities are like and what what kinds of capabilities they have to deal with the sheer number of people who need help right now well the situation right now is really catastrophic ambulances car are trying as much as possible to evacuate our victims there is an increasing number of victims falling in different areas in the Gaza Strip we are talking about different compartments talk place in Central Gaza in inun City Medical Teams are rushing in order to evacuate them from the bombardment till this current moment there are still people under the rles of the destroyed houses and buildings you are talking about Collective punishment for Palestinians hundreds of massacres have been committed during uh the the early beginning of this round of fighting between the Palestinian Fighters and the isra occupation forces even though civilians are not yet protected by the principles of the international law uh the the the the current situation now is really terrifying we are talking about hundreds and thousands of uh young children and women are killed by the Israeli ongoing strikes uh those uh children uh they did not really have any gu in terms of what's happening in the ground they were targeted without having any prior warning to evacuate the buildings meanwhile the majority of families they have evacuated from the northern and Central areas of the Gaza Strip they mooved to to the southern areas meanwhile in the southern areas the level of bombardment is similar to the uh Northern and Central areas of the Gaza Strip so clearly there is no any safe place inside the Gaza Strip and the ongoing Israeli attacks T I just want to remind our viewers who might just be joining us now that Israeli air strikes have now killed more than 3,000 Palestinians since this conflict began now one and three of them are children that's more than a thousand of them killed in 10 days according to the Gaza Ministry of Health and we know that at least six people have also been killed in an Israeli air strike that hit as we were talking about that school run by the UN the un's Palestinian refugee agency that was also acting as a shelter and that took place in a Gaza refugee camp now the number of Israelis killed in hamas's military operation stands at 1,400 including 302 soldiers just going back to that Palestinian death toall that 3,000 number was before this attack we are hearing that hundreds of people two to 300 people could have been killed in this bombing on this hospital um tar we've been talking about people trying to evacuate trying to find safety obviously 1.1 million people were given an evacuation order from Gaza City from northern Gaza and they've tried well a large number of them have tried to head south can you give us a sense of what the situation is like now in in the shelters are people finding anywhere to go anywhere that they believe is [Music] safe well um the current situation right now as it can clearly see there are lot of gatherings uh of people around us even in the displaced areas they have been displaced from the houses they went to hospitals in order to be safe and even to the United Nations of schools uh today six Palestinians have been killed due to the Israeli compartment of a United Nations Affiliated School in al- magazi refugee camp uh this school has been targeted without prayer warning claiming the life uh claiming the life of six Palestinians now these kinds of violations of the Israeli violations continue uh against civilians inside the G trip uh schools hospitals uh Medical Teams journalists and every single class of the Palestinian Community has been targeted uh well there is no any safe place inside the Gaza Strip This densely populated area has been largely bombarded during uh the early beginning of this round of fighting people just are afraid of losing their Liv they are very frustrated tired they are just uh waiting for a solution or a cease fire in order to uh to breathe from the Israeli ongoing strikes the the the level of bombardment inside the G St is unimaginable it's incredible uh no one can really imagine how gazans are still tolerating the current situation they are trying even to uh to to beer up with the current situation by using their determination and even despite the fact that they have lost a lot of their family members every single house inside the Gaza Strip now has an a wounded person even sometimes they have a victim due to the Israeli ongoing strikes T Abu AUM there for us in Kan unes in southern Gaza well if you are just joining us here on Al jazer let let me tell you what you're watching these are live pictures from a hospital in southern Central Gaza and this is the aftermath of an Israeli air strike we've seen families go past Fair number of children a large number of injured people being taken past us in strollers we believe that hundreds of families so potentially thousands of people were Sheltering in the backyard of that hospital after being forced to evacuate other parts of the Gaza Strip and we are hearing from um a Gaza Health Ministry spokesperson that they believe between two and 300 people were killed and and again if you are watching these shocking pictures um I do apologize if you are upset by any of them this is a live feed now that we are getting from Gaza
