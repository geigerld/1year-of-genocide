let's bring in our senior political analyst Marwan Bashar now Marwan what do you make of what's come out of The Summit in Riad what do you make of the statement is it strong enough is a statement enough I think the the statement is is quite strong and it's quite important it's quite significant because it does Express uh the opinion and the will of 57 Arab and Muslim majority countries there is absolutely no no doubt that when almost onethird of the world States speak with one voice and speak with one clear voice that one what is going on in Gaza acceptable that it is war crime and that Israel's and America's Claim about self-defense is not justifiable is not accepted and taking a good number of steps albe it rhetorical and legal against Israel now in reality a lot of these countries are not in speaking terms with one another some of these leaders don't even talk to one another some of these countries are actually enemies with one another don't even have diplomatic relationships with one another and yet they've come together for this it wasn't supposed to be a summit with so many countries absolutely so it's it's the this is not a European Union this is not a Muslim Union this is not an Arab Union this is a whole bunch of countries some of them are completely dependent on the United States for their survival some of them are clients of the United States some of them are enemies of the United States and Israel some of them normalize relationship with Israel so the fact that they're all coming together and speak with one clear voice I think that's significant and it could have repercussions now of course expectations in the Arab world if you look at social media and what people are saying everyone is frustrated because after all the speeches and all the communic in the end of the day medicine food fuel is not reaching the people in God Gaza The Killing Fields in Gaza continue the war crimes continue I'm sure Israel did not translate the final communicate to Hebrew to understand what's going on this could be a pressure on Western countries especially the United States who without them I think Israel would think twice about continuing its genocide in Gaza so I think it's important strategically it's not actionable and that's frustrating for a lot of people and yet it is significant and you know any time that there are attacks in Gaza during all of Israel's Wars on Gaza you always hear people say but where are the Arab countries what are they doing for the people in Gaza what are they doing for the Palestinians is there anything that they can do right now in the immediate term to stop to get Israel to stop what's happening in Gaza well this this is a thing right I mean so now uh countries that are bordering Israel and Gaza for example take Egypt right Egypt now could say that it that there is a resolution by fellow Arab and Muslim countries 57 of them that say that Egypt has a right indeed I think an obligation to help the people in Gaza and to break the siege of necessary because it is part and partial to The Siege in other words the final communic could be materialized by a good number of countries who are serious about um putting pressure on Israel and the United States those countries who are normalized relations could now say we going to sever relations with Israel because there is 57 countries behind us who all say what Israel is doing is war crimes we cannot continue to have diplomatic relations now the problem with the Arab world and the problem with the expectations of the Arab world is that they are fanciful the Arab world is not United and a good number of it is impotent and a good number of it also is destroyed by Civil Wars those who are capable do not want to take action those who are not capable can say all they want but they are not effective at the end of the day so it is a poor and I don't want to say desperate but it is a poor situation in the Arab world once again because of how poor the situation is and because of how divided are the Arab majority and Muslim majority countries the fact that they could all agree on this one very particular commun I think that's important it falls short in what is needed but let's say let see if it's a good start you mentioned the neighboring countries what they can what they can't do Israel's defense minister said in the last few hours had a very strong warning for Hezbollah in Lebanon saying that civilians if Lebanon tries to join the war that the civilians will pay will be the first to pay the price war criminals honestly I mean and I'm not saying that lightly and not giving my opinion Israeli leaders are acting like war criminals they used to be political criminals now they become war criminals because when one Israeli President says there are no Innocents in Gaza all Palestinians hold responsibility for October 7 when another one calls him uh this this very particular person defense minister calls him Human animals and then he says he will treat people in Lebanon the same way basically the Israelis are taking a position whereby women children men and their animals could be slaughtered in Revenge to what happened October 7th these are war crimes this is genocide there's intent and there is action and it's very dangerous and that's why I said on a number of occasions here on on our channel that what worries me now is not the fact that hisbah wants to you know uh get Israelis busy on the Northern uh uh Frontier so that they will leasen the pressure on the Southern frontier what worries me is that because the United States has deployed its Armada to the east Mediterranean because the Israelis believe that they don't want to be subjected to another October 7 that they notah they will initiate in some form or another an aggression against Lebanon that's what worries me because they think this is their chance why because the Americans are here the Europeans are supporting and if they could finish with Gaza that perhaps they could St with Lebanon it's dangerous what's going on and once again I think the policy makers in Western capitals especially the United States should heed the calls from the Muslim majority countries because if we think that they are mild I think they have spoken all of them today not to me and to you theyve spoken to their street because they know their streets are boiling yeah and they could implode and not and not just their streets too we've seen hundreds of thousands of people coming out on the streets of of London Madan thank you as always that's our senior politic absolutely
