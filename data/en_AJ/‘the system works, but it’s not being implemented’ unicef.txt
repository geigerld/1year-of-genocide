for more on the humanitarian situation in Gaza let's speak to Tess SRAM who spokesperson for Unicef the United Nations Children's Fund and she's live from Rafa in southern Gaza Tess good to have you again with us on Al jazer I guess your reaction first to Israel's decision to open the ARs Crossing in Northern Gaza what difference is that going to make look we're going to have to wait and see how it all plays out in practice but it's really good news we've been asking for weeks now for this Crossing to be opened we've used it before for and we know how important it is to get supplies into the northern Gaza Strip because of course the two crossings that are open at the moment are both in the South and require us to transport all of the aid up the Gaza Strip so this is really welcome news but we need it to happen soon we need it to happen its scale and we need it to be sustained but you say it's an important Crossing uh test Ares though has been the main crossing point for people um to get in and out of Gaza how is opening The Crossing going to help ease I mean it's mostly been used for people how is it going to to be used for Aid to get into Northern Gaza I know that this is something that the UN has has been thinking about for some weeks now as you say it's primarily a pedestrian Crossing but so was Rafa so um it's you know something that we're working on and we hope to be able to get a trucks in at scale through our R because we have so few options we really need to take all of the options that we have to be able to get food Aid into the people of North Gaza who are on the precipice of a famine right there is getting the food Aid in but is there's also ensuring Safety and Security right for the people who are going to be Distributing this food as we've seen in in recent months this hasn't always been guaranteed by the israelies what measures are you hoping Israel is going to take in addition to opening this border crossing yeah that's right and you know as well as our safety it's the safety of the people we're trying to help we've obviously seen incidents as well where people trying to access Aid have been killed so it's really important that we make the situation for the distribution of AIDS safer what we're asking for at the moment is for international humanitarian law to be followed and one key part of that is this notification and coordination system that world Central Kitchen mentioned in their statement on Tuesday that means that when we go on missions we coordinate with Israel to make sure that they know where we're going and what we're doing and that helps them follow International humanitarian law and protect us but at the moment that system is clearly broken it's not working properly as we saw with the tragic incident on Monday night yeah it's a deconfliction process right what specific changes would you like to see made to this deconfliction process well it's a process that works in other conflicts around the world and this is the really frustrating thing the system is fine it's the implementation of the system that's not working it is not being respected we receive a safety assurance and then we go on a mission where we are told we will be safe and we were delayed for hours at A checkpoint our staff are interrogated they're put In Harm's Way or they're killed and that's not acceptable that's not what is meant to happen once we receive these safety assurances so that's something that needs to be remedied with the ARs uh Crossing uh opening up and also the port of ashdod uh do you have any more Det details test that you could share with us perhaps about you know the quantity of Aid that is going to go in uh and also how soon the border crossing will be open itself unfortunately not yet this is all kind of emerging this morning so we are going to need to engage today and in the coming days with Israel to make sure that we understand how this is going to operate and as I said when we need to make sure this is going to happen soon that it can bring Aid in at scale and we need to confirm that it's going to be sustained because we've been told we've heard that temporary we don't know for how long thank you very much for talking to us thank you for your time Tess Ingram spokesperson for Unicef joining us there from Rafa in southern Gaza
