Tamara Al Rafi is the spokesperson for the United Nations relief and works agency unra she joins us from Aman thank you for being with us on the program today so unra dismissed nine employees does the organization have evidence that those employees were involved indeed in the October 7th attack on received Al allegations from the Israeli government and the commissioner General OFA deemed that it's in the interest of the 2 million people were serving in Gaza and in the interest of the continuation of our life-saving and irreplaceable work in Gaza he deemed it um necessary to preemptively dismiss these staff members for the sake of everything else but also for the sake of due diligence the commissioner General asked the UN Secretary General Antonio gutieres to refer the situation to the highest investigation Authority at the UN in New York so we worked on several tracks together with the primary goal being the continuation of our Irreplaceable and life-saving work in Gaza okay so the nine employees that were dismissed were preemptively dismissed to be clear does that mean you don't or that you do currently have any evidence in their alleged involvement in the October 7th attacks that is correct they were dismissed upon allegations preemptively and an investigation is being open at the headquarters in New York and these now former employees will have the right of recourse in case the findings um are not are are in their favor I believe there were two employees who as of the secretary General's statement on Sunday were still being identified have they been identified now not yet no you know we have 13,000 staff in Gaza it takes a very very complex um review to be able to match names that we receive from the government of Israel with names of our employees but if I may here remind that un shares the full list of names of its staff in Gaza and the West Bank including East Jerusalem with Israel every year so the list is known the list of our staff is known to the government of Israel every year this is interesting I think it's something our viewers might not know all the people that unra employs including the 13,000 staff members in the Gaza Strip Israel is aware of who works for you that is correct we provide the names of our staff to the host authorities in the countries that we work in so Jordan and Lebanon and Syria and we also provided to the state of Israel um and here I speak specifically of our employees in the West Bank including East Jerusalem and in Gaza and and by the way do they have a say in in um not Staffing decisions but when you provide that list does Israel have any right of comment on who works for un the host governments and also the state of Israel may come back to us with concerns over staff when they received the list in the case of our staff in uh the West Bank including East Jerusalem and Gaza we have not received concerns by the state of Israel upon their receiving of these lists on an annual basis but I also want to uh reiterate the sturdy Recruitment and screening that we do to all our staff to ensure that we get uh proper recommendations for them and that their names do not match names of people listed on the UN Security Council sanctions list so we have a thorough and sturdy review before we recruit anyone what does it say to you that the biggest donors to this UN agency have pulled their funding and that is the majority of the funding that goes to unoa has now been suspended based on allegations con concerning 0.04% of your overall staff well you you got the maths right and so in response to that uh we are pleading to our biggest donors who are also our partners our partners in ensuring that there's an adequate humanitarian operation in Gaza we pleading with them not to to allow the humanitarian operation towards 2 million people to collapse unwa has the largest footprint in Gaza we run the shelters where more than 1 million people have sought Refuge we run the um food and wheat flour distribution towards the entire population there is no one no agency no no humanitarian actor that can replace unwa especially on such short notice so our position is please help us continue saving lives in Gaza and continue providing that level of relief food medical supplies Medical Services to an entire population that is now dependent on humanitarian assistance the UN Secretary General uh mentioned in his statement on Sunday that un was not funded through the end of February what happens if the funding does not resume what happens I mean to the Palestinians that you help specifically the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip but also the the Palestinian refugees across the region will no longer be able to get food clean water education Primary Health Services and much more if un can cannot sustain its operations Beyond March it is extremely serious for the well-being for the rights of Palestine refugees to critical uh care but also for regional stability it is extremely critical that the largest humanitarian agency continues providing humanitarian assistance and continues to contribute to Regional stability in a volatile environment this is really not the time to stop funding to un and to threaten its ability to continue supporting Millions especially in Gaza today where the war continues the displacement continues and the needs are so acute for us to call that to for us to warn against famine I I listen to what you say and tell me if if these dots can be connected in this way you told me that you received that unar was working off uh is really evidence I believe based on staff and that's why they were on on the staff that were pre prely dismissed so that would mean then that millions of Palestinians including 2 million ACC quarter of whom are facing starvation in the Gaza Strip might not have any help from the biggest aid aid agency currently operating in the Gaza Strip based on Israeli evidence that has not been verified is that correct that is correct but that does not diminish how seriously we take these allegations and how seriously the UN Secretary General takes them as well hence his commissioning of an investigation into the case of these staff members and hence also un commissioning an independent expert review to make sure that our internal safe guards against the implication the possible implication of some of our staff members into Political activities we are doing all we can to ensure that our Frameworks are sturdy and working and that every single staff member of unra I'm talking here about 33,000 staff member is truly working according to the UN values and principles and that is working away from politics we are extremely serious about making sure that every one of the 33,000 staff members Works wholeheartedly exclusively on humanitarian grounds and so far the 75 years of Ona speak to our ability to offer humanitarian assistance away from politics and in a way that has enabled generations of Palestine refugees to access critical basic health care reach all vaccinations educate over 2 million Palestinian children some of whom work now at NAA and in reputable um Laboratories around the world and reputable businesses and reputable um um reputable um uh Enterprises so we do have a lot of success stories that we want to be able to continue but more than that if if if I could jump in there have been in other cases in other countries around the world where there is UN un presence United Nations presence there have been documented cases of misconduct from un staff whether it's sexual misconduct other types of misconduct in in ways that were very serious that were documented that were not allegations and I don't recall that the funding was suspended for whether it was peacekeeping operations or humanitarian operations depending on the case in the country why do you think in aoa's case all of a sudden most of your funding is pulled that is a question to ask our donors and that is and and our position is to ask our donors to continue to stand by us especially that uh our added value to the lives of Palestinian Palestine refugees and to the current situation in Gaza have long been documented this current conflict showed the Irreplaceable role that erra plays it is our trucks that bring in the humanitarian assistant it is our people that distribute wheat flour and shelters is is our people who are themselves displaced in shelters that have been working even though they themselves are displaced it is our doctors that continue to give um Medical Services through mobile clinics in Gaza if that is not testimony to the hard work and the success of funa Against All Odds I don't know what would be testimony Tamor Al Rafi spokesperson for erir the United Nations relief and works Agency for Palestinian refugees in the East thank you for joining us in the program thank you
