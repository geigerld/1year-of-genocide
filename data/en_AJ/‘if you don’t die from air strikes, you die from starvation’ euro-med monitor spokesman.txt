Rights group said they've documented a series of allegations suggesting war crimes and human rights violations by Israel during its military offensive in Gaza nonprofit organization the eurom Mediterranean human rights monitor has submitted a report to the UN and the international criminal court it details execution style killings of civilians on multiple occasions in one incident it says Israel Israeli forces opened fire on six family members killing them all during a raid on their home in Gaza City last week the group has also reported allegations of the killing of elderly civilians Israeli forces allegedly shot at elderly Palestinians moments after ordering them to leave their homes the euromed monitor has called for that International investigation after recording testimonies alleging Israelis buried some Palestinians alive that reportedly happened when the Army targeted the Kamal adwan Hospital in the northern city of B lahia the UN and Amnesty International have expressed concern about the ill treatment of Palestinian detainees including deliberate humiliation torture and forced disappearances of detainees as young as 12 and as old as 70 let's talk to Muhammad shahada he is the chief Communications officer at eurom Mediterranean human rights Monitor and he's joining us from Copenhagen via Skype thank you very much for your time firstly how do you get these testimonies and how do you verify them well basically we receive testimonies from survivors of these atrocities incredible atrocities as well as Witnesses who were in the area so the neighbors or or First Responders or medical teams that were able to reach that area although it's it's becoming nearly impossible to access uh most of the north part of Gaza but we also verify it for instance with the death records in hospitals and with our own team members across the Gaza Strip we have currently about 41 researchers in Gaza that are trying their best to to work under these enormously difficult conditions but the image that we have is basically that the north half of Gaza Israel has turned it practically into what Israeli officials and journalists themselves describe as quote extermination Zone and I emphasize it extermination Zone that's is really journalists using that term as well as a sterile zone or a death zone what do that what do those words mean what does extermination zone mean it means what the IDF told Palestinians in the northern half of Gaza early on in this war in this assault they threw pamphlets on on the northern half and said that every single person that stays behind in the north is going to be dealt with as an accomplice to a terror organization so every single person in the the northern half of Gaza is treated as a terrorist suspect is guilty until proven innocent that's on the one hand on the other hand the northern half of Gaza is systematically denied any access to food Medical Care water fuel Aid or electricity it's literally a death zone that's what Israelis are calling it so if you don't die from air strikes or bullets you will die from starvation and of course this is extremely worrying because there is nowhere else for people in the north to go to there are stries across Gaza the United Nations has been saying that they're extremely concerned about the situation in central Gaza now about the bombardment of central Gaza we're talking about the documentation and the verification work that you're doing this is of course very important because you have sent a report to the United Nations and to the international criminal court demanding the establishment of an international legal team um that it secure entry into Gaza and start an inquiry into civilians being killed by Israeli forces does it become more difficult to document to verify the more time goes on the longer um a team cannot enter Gaza well precisely we have a practical and logistical difficulty at hand that Israel has gone after journalists and humanitarian workers and workers of Human Rights organizations I personally I lost three members of of my team in Gaza that were killed in Israeli air strikes and uh many members of our team have been displaced to the South either in schools or in overcrowded flats and and some are even living on the street so it's becoming incredibly difficult to conduct this work on the ground but the more time that passes the more Israel has a chance to bury the evidence so for instance destroying the neighborhoods and the buildings where these atrocities were committed therefore destroying the crime scene but it's not an issue of documentation we have ample documentation on hand we have Survivor testimonies we have the reports from the hospitals directly the thisk certificates of the victims and on top of that we have the videos that you showed earlier of Palestinians detained in mass and humiliated released by the IDF themselves these are videos released by Israeli journalists and soldiers in Gaza so documentation is there the problem is that Western media on the one hand is systematically refusing to show this documentation to the Western audience and European and American government officials are refusing and turning a complete Blind Eye to this horrendous atrocious situation where what we have on hand is crimes against humanity being committed in Gaza Mr shahada which of course makes the work that you're doing so important the fact that it it is documented what do we know about how Palestinian detainees are treated we've seen the videos but what rights do they have and what is your reaction to just the latest video well basically they don't have any rights at all we have documented that Israel has until now kidnapped about 3,000 people from Gaza some are released few days after with unbelievable marks of torture so there they they display signs of of bullet wounds and display signs of torture on their backs on their arms and they've been blindfolded and tied and starred for days so that's the people that were released the people that stay behind they are denied any sort of legal counsel there are no charges being pressed against them and they not being put on trial and the red trust does not have any access to them let alone any sort of family visitation or visitation by a lawyer in the majority of these cases we honestly we don't have any idea if people that were taken by Israel are still alive or died and we have received reports from Israeli um newspapers and journalists that multiple people in Israeli in Israel's custody have died in prison most likely under torture so there's this huge blackout on the situation but on the other hand the footage that you see in Gaza Israel the way it goes is that they go from door to door from one home to one school to the other and kidnap people in mass and gather all the men include in some instances they even kidnapped women we have reports that at least seen pictures we have seen pictures of of women in the trucks that Israel has this forcing them to strip almost completely naked and front of camera including kids that are apparently below the age of 10 it has this sort of Victory image connotation for an Israeli audience now Israel says that we suspect they might have explosive vists if you look at the history of the conflict the last time a Palestinian carried out such attack with an explosive vest was about two decades ago it has not there hasn't been a single incident in this entire war of over than two months almost three months now where a single explosive a single person with an explosive vest tried to attack Israeli soldiers so it's completely bogus but Israeli media the way they deal with it is in Hebrew it's a totally different message in Hebrew they say we are teaching the gazan population a lesson that they should never think about that again and we are trying to show this sort of Victory image that we are winning the war okay Mr shahada we thank you very much uh for your time for your insights into this and our condolences to your team for the loss of three of your members in Gaza that is Muhammad shahada of the euromed human rights monitor thank you
