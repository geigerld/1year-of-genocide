hungry displaced stressed and Pregnant doctors say these conditions are fueling a surge and miscarriages across Gaza surviving the war has been difficult enough but for many pregnant women giving birth poses yet another challenge I came for a follow-up visit but they told me the baby had no heartbeat I was told it was likely due to lack of Medicine and malnutrition this is my fifth day at the hospital and I don't know what to do after nearly eight months of Israel's Onslaught adequate Emergency Care is no longer available for many expectant mothers before the war the rate of miscarriages was low about one or two cases a day but now there's so much panic and fear we see up to 10 miscarriages on a daily basis supplies of medicine and Equipment are limited and often non-existent women are also undergoing C-sections without anesthesia doctors say the war has led to a rapid surge in miscarriages and premature births induced in part by high stress about 60,000 pregnant women in Gaza have little to no access to adequate prenatal Health Services the International Rescue committee says only two partially functioning hospitals offer maternity services the pregnant women who have miscarried face a lot of psychological suffering there's a lack of emotional support from the medical staff as well who are also facing great psychological pressures due to the war these conditions are making things worse months of bombings attacks and Devastation have led to widespread trauma I was in Rafa and had been pregnant 4 months I came to the hospital in pain I've experienced a lot of fear and exhaustion I myself had been caring for the sick and injured I think this led me to miscarry the war has created terrible conditions for Palestinians in Gaza and now increasingly also for The Unborn K Al jaaz anah flansburg is head of policy advocacy and press at Cav cavina that's wom tooman Foundation is an advocacy group for women in Conflict affected areas and she joins us now from Stockholm good to have you with us anaka your organization is describing what's happening to women in Gaza as OB obstetric violence I mean these are strong words that you're using they seem to be relevant can you give us more of an idea as to why you have labeled at this yeah first of all thank you so much for having us here at the show and for bringing up this really crucial area and uh say the K Foundation we supported women's Organization for 30 years in Conflict affected regions and we have Partners in Gaza for over 20 years and what we are seeing now I mean there have been the reports about gender based violence since the 7th and sexual based violence since the 7th of October but what we hear from our partners is this ongoing everyday violence that women pregnant women are facing uh because of their pregnan because of that um hospitals are being bombed about the indiscriminate the ongoing bom bombardment as we heard about from your uh news before here and the ongoing displacement and we see this as a form of gender-based violence as well towards uh and retroductive violence towards women uh who are it's approximately 180 women who are are giving birth every day in Gaza and they are doing that under extremely dangerous and inhumane circumstances and their children of of course also the newborns are of course also under very um uh yeah ingrained danger so we see the importance of acknowledge this as a form of gender-based violence and make it visible as well and we heard there in that report that some C-sections are being performed without anesthesia I mean that is unimaginable to most people what have you heard about that and how un Earth women can cope with that yeah it's really unbearable to hear the reports and we have as we heard that women are being forced to deliver in in buildings where who are which are are at risk of being bombed at the very second and they have no there is no as you said anesthesia and they are under great great pain and there is no Health Facilities afterwards there's no hygiene there's no clean water uh so it's they are exposed to Great uh threats uh threats and risk health risks and the the the reports that we get from our Partners the witnesses there they say that there is great pressure and Trauma and stress which also as you said previously that also um increases the number of miscarriages and steelb borns and uh premature deliveries so this is really an ongoing violations I would say and and that will has both devastating effects for the individual woman and child of course and their families but also for for looking ahead for the future of the of Palestine and the people it will be have we see generations of trauma and this will have a long-term effect absolutely I want to bring that back back up because of course the whole of Gaza is traumatized with this war but this is a particular psychological toll that women are going to have to bear and will be passed on to their children we're looking at a long-term Health Emergency here aren't we yes absolutely uh and we see both when it comes to the pre I mean during pregnancy that there is no Health as we heard as well there's no Health Care System there's no help for these women to get really and during the delivery there is very under very difficult circumstances and also post after the delivery if they if both the mother and child has survived it's very they they also say that how how should we provide for the for our children how can I provide for my newborn how can I secure I mean give security and and and food because of course the other thing is malnutrition as you said that they also Israel has been accused for using starvation as a weapon of war and and we know that there is a gender impact on this that mothers often give food to their children first and pregnant women and and women who are breastfeeding are uh really uh suffering here and they can't provide for their children uh so this has really long-term consequences indeed it's a devastating uh circumstance and a terrible situation anakah fburg go on just one last Point yeah one last thing I would also say that uh it's really important to both acknowledge this at gender based violence but also to see the incredible work done by local women's organization that we support for example women Affair Center and Aisha uh who are protect providing psychosocial support for these women in local communities and they also need support because they know what what the situation is like okay uh and what the needs are so I just wanted to to give that message as well absolutely anakah flansburg thanks very much for joining us there from Stockholm and uh shedding helping us shed light on the situation for women in Gaza thank you very much for having
