once again this is the scene in Gaza I said earlier you'd be forgiven for thinking that what you're seeing in the sky lighting up is a thunderstorm a lightning storm I've since been told there is actually a lightning storm going on over Gaza those are the white flashes of light you can see we're also seeing a huge number of red orange flashes on that night sky as of course Israel pounds the Gaza Strip and continues to do so throughout the night we're also seeing these pictures down there on your screen of the northern Israeli border with Lebanon huge fires there we can now speak to our correspondent Ali hasham he is in southern Lebanon and is near where this is happening Ally you're on the phone at the moment to us tell us if you can as far as you know what's going on there well since uh this uh afternoon is really planes uh uh have been uh raiding the Open Spaces especially after a group from the Islamic Jihad the Palestinian Islamic Jad infiltrated the the the borders and crossed to an Israeli settlement where they engaged in a in a fight with in in a battle with the Israeli Army two of Islamic Jihad Fighters were killed and several Z army soldiers according to islami Jihad uh statement were IND what we what we are seeing right now is these fires these huge fires isra planes are raing these Open Spaces to uh burn the grass the trees whatever is possible for fighters to hide and to infiltrate through um because they to prevent them from doing similar uh things tomorrow I mean at any time because from since yesterday escalation has been clear in on the the northern borders of Israel and given the the situation today it seems that this this tension is is going to continue escalating over the coming days and uh given the situation in Gaza and Ali just explain to us the significance of Islamic Jihad because of course we've been hearing a lot about Hezbollah and Hezbollah there on the border this is a Hezbollah controlled area hearing about Hamas in Gaza how does Islamic Jihad fit into all of this well the Palestinian Islamic Jihad is um active in in Gaza however there are very strong allies ofah and Hamas to so um over the past few years the Islamic Jihad started having their own also infrastructure in Lebanon however it's under under's supervision the same goes for for Hamas here they've not really uh engaged in military operations um except for a few occasions so you go back in the past years there was an occasion when a group from the Islamic Jihad infiltrated the the the the borders went to a a settlement called aine and that was a few years ago so this year seems the situation especially with the with the War uh raging in in Gaza it seems Islamic Jihad are active once again On the Border um we are also anticipating whether Hamas is going to be active especially a few months ago there were tens of missiles short range rockets that were launched from the Lebanese territories towards Israel and Hamas was responsible for that so we are seeing the Palestinian factions returning to the borders between Lebanon and and Israel and this is this hasn't been the case for um for for around 40 years the last time Palestinian faction were active on the borders between Lebanon and Israel was in 1982 following an Israeli invasion in 1982 the PLO Palestinian Liberation Organization were forced to leave Lebanon and since then it was more Lebanese factions fighting on the borders especially that Lebanese territories were occupied by Israel so this is this is new this is significant Ali we just saying more close close-up pictures of these fires they look to be extending a long way along this border region can you tell us a little bit more about them what you know about them which side of the Border they're on and just tell us once again how you think they might have been started you know this these border this border is is kind of uh uh intertwined no way or another so um these lands uh are agricultural land that also Open Spaces uh and it seems over the past hours is really are more suspicious of uh additional infiltrations taking place from that area and U the time we were there uh today the sound of of airplane isra airplanes Jones was very and um over the past couple of hours the were several rids there now putting aside this issue there were also Rats on on houses in in the village of Yin and these are also uh U border Villages and U it's also important to to mention that today just a few minutes ago hisbah issued a statement saying that one of its Fighters was killed in Israel Aid and this is this is kind of a a real escalation here because hasah um over over the past years we we know that they always vow to revenge for the fighters who are being killed who are killed by Israel so this would mean that hasah is going to launch another attack and becoming our well that's interesting Ally because we've just got word in now that Israel has said it was targeting Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon well this is what happened to today this is what happened today in the the the town of of there was a tower um that used for um observation from there this Tower was hit there was also another Post in that was hit by Israeli forces what we know now according to statement that that there's one who lost his life today so yes this is this is taking a new dimension and uh the Lebanese uh border is is getting into this conflict step by step it's not it's not a situation of War but it's neither a situation of Peace anymore and that's what making people very concerned here okay Ali hasham thanks very much indeed for bringing us the very latest there on the Lebanon Israel border for filling Us in on those fires that we've been seeing all along the border region there
