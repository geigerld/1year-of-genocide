oh our White House correspondent Kimberly halat is standing by in Washington with more on that but first let's speak to H Abdul Hamid she's in rala in the occupied West Bank what can you tell us about today's raids Huda well there's a a raid that has been ongoing for several hours now it started around 2:30 local uh which is uh sorry 12:30 GMT in Janine now Janine has been really a focus of the Israeli forces here in the occupied West Bank we do know that uh there's a lady who has been wounded by shrapnel we do know there's several other injuries some of them by live ammunition but we did speak to people on the ground and at the moment they say that the Israeli forces are inside the refugee camp they have surround they were near a hospital there and they and they they could hear an exchange of gunfire it's still a very fluid situation and it's ongoing at the moment all right let's thank ABD Hamid for now I think we're going to come back to you in a moment Huda but let's take this to our White House correspondent Kimberly Haler who's standing by live for us in Washington and Kimberly let's start with this issue of us sanctions are they targeting settler groups or individuals because as we know settlement activity under international law according to un experts any transfer of population that's illegal they say mhm and as a result uh the US uh president has promised to hold uh those individuals and groups to account and so uh what we know is uh weeks ago the US president tked some of his top secretaries to look at policies that they could use because they was a feeling within the Biden Administration that the Israeli government simply was not serious about holding Israeli settlers to account for the violent acts they were committing against Palestinians and now what we understand is that that that announcement about that policy is imminent that the Biden Administration is on the cusp of making the announcement that it will be putting in place a travel ban that will in effect prevent settlers who have committed violent acts we understand it will be several dozen uh from coming to the United States for their attacks on Palestinians we should point out there will also be uh travel restrictions put on some Palestinians who have committed acts against Israelis as well but uh this is really significant because not only did the US president Telegraph this in an opad uh a few weeks ago uh but this is something that has been been promised for about three years by the Biden Administration but has really not been done by any Administration until going back to Bill Clinton so this is a big action on the part of Joe Biden and one that uh he's been facing a lot of pressure to do now you've got to wonder Kimberly how is this going to impact relations with the current Israeli government which includes figures within the cabinet who are settlers who are from quite extreme settlements like kirat arba benir case in point all of which when you look at international human rights organization say are illegal under international law once again it doesn't appear that the US president seems to be thinking about that right now what he seems to be thinking about is his own reelection and here in the United States in some very key swing States for example there are some very prominent Muslim leaders who have put together a group called abandoned Biden and right now they are saying that they will not support him as long as he does not take action to stand up and stop the slaughter of Palestinians not just in Gaza but also the attacks in the West Bank such as we've seen by the settlers so uh the US president is under pressure uh by Muslim leaders he's under pressure in terms of the number of casual that we're seeing in Gaza whether it is protests outside the White House whether it is demonstrations around the world he's hearing the international outcry and he's also had even resignations from within his own Administration over some of his policies in support of Israel and so this seems to be what is driving these announcements it doesn't seem to be the issue of how he's going to deal with the Israeli government moving forward that seems to be at the front of the president's mind all right let's leave it there for now this has been really important developments that Kimber is updating us and let's take this back to H Abdul Hamed how any reaction coming from the Israeli authorities from settler groups to this well so far we haven't heard anything um I think everybody is waiting to see and probably wanting to know what are the details uh of who is will be on that list if indeed that comes out um now there's an the something is to issue and list and forbidding people to travel to the US the other question is will it actually change anything uh here on the ground in the occupied West Bank if you ask Palestinians they will probably be very skeptic about this uh just look at the numbers and that's according to the UN and since October 7th there have been more than 300 settler attacks attacks on Palestinians about a dozen have lost their lives others have been wounded in uh with live ammunition ever since the national Israel's national security minister itamar Ben has been Distributing weapons two settlers across the occupied uh West Bank now people Palestinians would tell you that that they don't think anything will change uh because the settlers have not only the political protection uh from the coalition government of Benjamin Netanyahu but they also have the protection of the Israeli forces on the ground so many times I've spoken to people really across the occupied West Bank I was just in Hebron uh yesterday and this morning and people were telling me there that they get attacked they get accused of things that they haven't done and and this is done with total impunity and they always pay the price crisis and sometimes it's the soldiers that are helping the settlers in whatever act they're doing and it is really a Waring situation but this has been going on for decades and it has increased and increased regardless of whatever any us Administration has said in the past certainly they it never had such a bold move as the one it will have as we understanded uh today was by issuing this list but certainly uh people here don't don't expect much change or at least not immediate change on the ground uh because also of the current atmosphere since October the 7th that the Palestinians are being made to pay the brunt to for what Hamas the operation Hamas carried out on October the 7th they they they suffer from Revenge attacks continuously and there is no one there to protect them all right we'll leave you there thanks so much h abdulhamid
