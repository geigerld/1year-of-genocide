now around 85% of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have been displaced since the War Began ammed bam is spokesman for the Norwegian Refugee Council and joins us now from Aman in Jordan good to have you with us can you tell us what has been the impact of 100 days of War as far as you've seen it in Gaza good morning um the impact is obviously out there for all to see the Norwegian Refugee Council and a Oran ation that operates on the ground that has operated in Gaza for over 15 years 16 years has of course seen the impact firsthand through the over 50 people 50 colleagues that we have on the ground who have experienced loss grief displacement and of course fear um their children who can't have a full night of sleep or 100 days now they can't have a full meal for 100 days and they can't have a clean drink of water for 100 days uh I think what we have seen uh over these you know this um very uh you know dark moment reminds us that Gaza has been made unlivable for um you know for a military reasons for which civilians are paying the price and sadly we are here 100 days after repeating the same thing saying the same thing and you know sending out the same appeals to stop the bloodshed now when you look at the the past 100 days and you look at the the amount of Aid that's been getting in give us an idea of just how far how far it falls short of what is needed given as you say the conditions within the Gaza Strip are unli unlivable without a clean hot without a hot meal without clean drinking water and in many cases without even shelter I think the answer is the in the in the numbers we're looking at in 2024 now we're looking at an entire population um on the brink of starvation and famine this should have never come down to this you should we should have never come to you know a a green figure like that uh 2.3 million people can't U you know don't know where the next meeter is going to come from the Norwegian Refugee Council and other organizations are bringing in a which is nowhere near enough we're hardly able to operate in these little pockets tiny Poets of shelters of areas where people are being told to uh you know to flee to and then go back to the areas where they have been and of course the Israeli attacks have turned the entire of the Gaza Strip into this um you know game of of uh you know table tennis almost ping ponging people around around the Gaza Strip as if they are objects they're not as if they're not humans and I think that has to stop as well I think what is most disappointing is with all the rhetoric you know with all the hopeful rhetoric that we have heard with all the promises that we have heard about more Aid that will come in on the ground we are still seeing these difficulties with you know with the bureaucracy with the with the scale of of insufficient Aid uh that is coming in and in the end it's civilians that are suffering it's children that are suffering with you know contagious diseases uh lack of food lack of fuel and lack of water the Norwegian Refugee Council has uh just in the past couple of months said that the pulverizing of Gaza ranks amongst the worst assaults on any civilian population in our time what do you make of the international response to this war on Gaza it has been disappointing and we have been disappointed at the Norwegian Refugee Council despite our constant know consistent appealing uh constant um you know calls for for a ceasefire I think the answer has still not come uh the answer for civilians has not come the answer of of you know a complete um suspension of hostilities and uh of course the return of people displaced we are talking now about you know almost everybody in Gaza being displaced some of them have been displaced twice three times and and you know all these CS have been unheeded Israel continues its boming from from all sides and now we've heard you know even in MO for example where people have been told to go now they have been told you know that you know Israel continue its operations in alasi where they have been asked to go and now they have to go back to areas where it has asked people to leave it's so confusing for people people have lost communication with their family members and I have teams you know we have teams NRC teams on the ground have lost communication with their own people and with their own colleagues we have to stop this and Israel has to stop these attacks and we have to to reach a ceasefire as soon as possible are you concerned that when the war does eventually come to an end that if people are able to leave the Gaza Strip that they will in large numbers and we'll see a mass displacement of a population what we have been saying from from the Geto really is that when Israel forcibly transfers people it Bears responsibility it violates international law and it be's responsibility for the return of these people people have choice and they have been stripped of that choice they have been stripped of that voluntary movement they are now going to places they don't want to go to so what we need to see is the opposite is for people to go back home it's for people to return and for Gaza to be made livable again and that you know that is responsibility of not just the International Community and of course Israel as the occupier which should guarantee the well-being of the people we have been very clear n compromising about that there cannot be any involuntary movement for people wherever that is if if someone you know makes the choice that is up to them but of course they should not make that choice out of being forced to leave home when they don't want to with their children and with their family ammed Bam from the Norwegian Refugee Council many thanks for talking to us thank okay
