so we start this hour in the occupied West Bank where at least three Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops inside a hospital in Janine so this is believed to be the moment when Israeli Special Forces dressed as doctors and nurses raided the main buildings in the ibben hospital the Israeli military infiltrated the city during the night Sirens have been sounded in Janine now in expectation of more raids Charles Stratford is in rala Charles so we we have this footage now the CCTV footage run us through what happened well we've been speaking to hospital staff there at the IB Cena medical facility Engineering in the northern occupied West Bank they're telling us that in the early hours of the morning two civilian Vehicles arrived at the hospital entrance and those soldiers that you see in that what we understand is CCTV footage Israeli soldiers disguised as medical staff and seemingly civilians as well um heavily armed came into the hospital obviously on a on a hunt uh hunting for for particular individuals we understand being treated inside the hospital the staff say that at least one of the members um of the three men that were killed being were being treated for injuries that had been incurred a couple of months ago during um a previous Israeli Army raid um the the the the video footage is is harrowing we see members of of this group one actually carrying a wheelchair another carrying what seems to be supposed to be a even a baby in some sort of cart um carrying their rifles pointing at members of Staff as they come through the hospital corridors hunting for these members of the Armed resistance now there has been a statement put out by the the Janine Battalion now this is or the Janine Brigade this comprises of various different groups of the Armed resistants including Hamas and Islamic Jihad they're saying that Muhammad wed jalum was a commander in Hamas 27 years old they're saying that Basel aan alazawi was also a commander we understand in Islamic Jihad um and Muhammad aan ghazawi was uh was at was another Commander we also understand in Islamic Jihad now this is the first time since October the 7th that we have seen such a thing happen we've seen the Israeli Army pretty much um every night um are very concerned about Fighters um hiding in these hospitals and we've seen them these hospitals uh be surrounded on a number of occasions also come under attack we visited a hospital in Janine only about a month ago speaking to St there they showed us video footage of tear gas being fired inside these hospitals as the Israeli Army tried to prevent Medics and patients getting inside these medical facilities but of course this is a civilian Medical Institution and there are many people inside this Hospital who are being treated for illnesses um and injuries that have been incurred during these nightly raids now the Israeli Army has put a statement out um I'll just read it to you some of the things they've said they've said that a Hamas terrorist cell that was inside the iena hospital in Janine had planned to carry out a terror attack in the immediate period had been neutralized it goes on to say that uh Muhammad jalam one of those killed 27y Old had contacts according to this statement with Hamas what it describes as headquarters abroad it's unclear as to what it's referring to there he uh the statement says that jalum had transferred weapons and ammunition to what it describes as terrorists in order to promote the shooting attacks and planned a raid inspired by the October the sth Hamas attacks inside Israel and it goes on to condemn um what it describes as terrorists of using civilian um institutions and Facilities as uh as Shields to to avoid obviously being arrested of course janin has been targeted time and time and time again over the last four months many people inside Jinan killed thousands potentially up to thousands arrested inside the city but it shows you the determination now and the Brazen Focus if you like of what seemed to be Israeli Special Forces in carrying out their mission determined now to to to to find these commanders of the Armed resistance and to take them out but can one can only imagine how terrified the other patients and the hospital staff inside that hospital as this raid happened there has been a statement by the Palestinian Authority as well the Palestinian Health Ministry um and that statement I'll read you that it says we call on the United Nations and international institutions to provide protection for treatment um and ambulance centers immediately um so yeah uh this is a very worrying development because of course there are hospitals um treating wounded right the way across the uh the occupied West Bank um as these raids these nightly raids continue these three latest deaths mean now that uh 382 Palestinians have been killed since October the 7th in these nightly and sometimes daily Israeli Army attacks right the way across the occupied territories here and and Charles can I just get you to repeat who was killed according to uh on the one hand the armed groups in Janine and on the other hand the IDE F the IDF saying they targeted a Hamas Terror cell uh the Janine Brigade saying it was at least two of them were Islamic Jihad that's according to our understanding yes at least two of the killed according to the Janine brigades were members of Islamic Jihad and there was one Hamas Commander killed the Israelis are putting special focus on this man Muhammad jalam who they say was a a Hamas Commander 27 years old who who they accuse of of potentially planning an attack um inspired by the October the 7th attacks but it's important to recognize that um this this group known as the Janine Brigade they are comprised of various different armed resistance groups including Islamic Jihad including Hamas including including others um but as I say um at least one of those three killed was being treated for injuries that had been occurred uh suffered during a previous raid around two months ago and it seems as if two other members of the Armed resistance groups were were with him when this attack happened indeed the staff say that um the the two other men were were literally sitting at his bedside as these uh these Special Forces seemingly Special Forces disguised came into the ward and and shot all three dead Charles statford reporting from romala in the occupied West Bank thank you very much
