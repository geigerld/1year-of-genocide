US President Joe Biden has spoken out against Israeli Prime Minister uh Benjamin Netanyahu and his policies on Gaza in an interview with an American Spanish language broadcaster Biden said Netanyahu should call a ceasefire immediately Pat Goan has more from Washington now this could be a very interesting comment from US President Joe Biden he was doing an interview with Univision trying to shore up some of his support with latino voters where he has been leing in his re-election campaign so there was mostly domestic questions but there was one question on the war in Gaza the reporter asked if the president believed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was more concerned with political survival than the interests of Israel now important perspective this happened shortly after there was that attack that we know Biden was outraged by on the world Central Kitchen staff but so put that in context the question was asked President we know was very angry in that moment but here's what he had to say I think what he's doing is a mistake I don't agree with his I think it's outrageous that those four three vehicles were hit by drones and taken out on a highway where it wasn't like if it was along the shore it wasn't like there was a convoy moving there Etc so I'm what I'm calling for is for the Israelis to just call for a ceasefire allow for the next 68 weeks Total Access to all food and Medicine going into the country I've spoken with everyone from the Saudis to the jordanians to the Egyptians they're prepared to move in they're prepared to move this food in and I think there's there there there's no excuse to not provide for the medical and the and the and the and the food needs of those people they should be done now what could be important here is that US president B has always said that there should be a ceasefire in exchange for trading of the captives now did he just misspeak as he sometimes does and then his staff comes out and says well he didn't mean that it's not a change of policy we'll know more on Wednesday because we expect to hear from President Biden himself in a a press conference H so we'll see if this is a change of policy but he's definitely sending the message that he is angry with the way Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been conducting this war on Gaza Patty Kain Al jazer Washington now to discuss this and all the latest developments in Israel's war on Gaza is Muhammad al-masri who's a professor at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies joining us on the newsour thank you Muhammad for being with us what what do you make of this new criticism leveled at Netanyahu by Biden do you expect any concrete changes in US policy as a result of this growing anger it would seem from the White House yeah so I sat here just a couple of days ago and I talked about how I was less pessimistic I didn't say I was optimistic but I said I was less pessimistic um because it looked like the US was on the verge of changing course uh perhaps meaningfully uh in this uh conflict and with regards to the negotiations the us is going to be the US they are staunch allies of of Israel but the US will change course if they are pressured to and I thought that the pressure was building up on Biden because of the upcoming elections because of the attack on the aid workers because of the reports coming from Israeli media that Israel is targeting civilians at this uh 100 to1 ratio um that they're uh implementing the the D Doctrine all of these things are very embarrassing to the US however over the past 48 Hours what we've heard is more rhetoric from the US from Anthony blinkin from Joe Biden that seems to me in my reading to be uh supportive of of Israel and the Israeli narrative and most notable in that is that the US continues to advocate for the Israeli position in these ceasefire negotiations they're not working or operating as a neutral Arbiter they're advocating explicitly for the Israeli position which is for a temporary ceasefire yeah interesting also to hear the UK say uh David Cameron say that he'll continue arm sales to to uh Israel despite the growing pressure within the UK for for the country to hold arm sales to to Israel in the wake of the killing of the aid workers what do you think has changed in in these last few days it's more of the same it's more of the same I think that uh we're hearing some some empty rhetoric some criticisms of Israel but we've heard this throughout I mean two months ago people made a big deal because Joe Biden said that Israel was bombing indiscriminately when indiscriminate bombing is a war crime but what did it mean on the ground it meant nothing so so far we haven't seen any tangible change on the ground not with respect to the weapons not with respect to the the negotiations or anything else but do to what extent do you think the US is willing or able to use its leverage it's it's definitely able to use its leverage the US has from day one uh had the the power and The Leverage to end this entire War but it doesn't want to it wants um it's basically aligned with Israel that it wants Israel to continue uh uh and fulfill all of its objectives which include according to Israel uh eliminating Hamas completely which is we're talking about tens of thousands of of members um and if that's the case then we're talking about a war that will go on for many many more months and it no longer looks like netanyahu's declaration in December that this would go on for all of 2024 at least it no longer looks like that's absurd yeah there was some hope there'd be a ceasefire over the Eid holiday which hasn't materialized we've seen more Israeli air strikes uh last night on Gaza but there are reports we've heard at least reports of some progress in Egypt that could perhaps lead to a ceasefire are you optimistic at all that we could see some movement come out of Egypt in in the coming days I'm I'm not particularly optim I wish I could say otherwise but I'm not particularly optimistic mostly because the gap between what Israel wants and what Hamas wants remains huge Israel wants and the United States wants for this war to continue so what they're asking and I look at this through the lens of rational Choice Theory political actors make rational decisions based on calculations of self-interest I'm not sure why Hamas would agree to a temporary truce only to allow Israel to continue what hundreds and hundreds of experts have decidedly decreed is a genocidal War you're asking Hamas to sign up for the continuation of a genocide it doesn't really make sense from their perspective to sign up for that and um that's the reason why I don't think that anything's going to get done at least not right now what about the Israeli invasion of Rafa does that seem inevitable to you now it's looking more and more like it is uh two two days ago or three days ago I sat here and said it might not happen because the US is feeling all this this pressure but now with the rhetoric it looks like it's it's going to happen the US doesn't look at all prepared to use its leverage with Israel and the disagreement is not about the invasion TOA if you listen closely they're just talking about the T the timing and the specific approach to the invasion of rafah but the but the United States doesn't disagree with Israel about the need to invade rafah or the need to uh eliminate Hamas Muhammad Alm very good to get your thoughts on this as always thank you very much for joining us m Mastery is from the Doha
