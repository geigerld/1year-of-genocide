on Gaza is the deadliest for media workers ever recorded that's according to press Freedom groups at least 90 have been killed since the conflict began on October the 7th the International Federation of journalists says around three quarters of all deaths of media professionals worldwide in 2023 have been in Gaza and they've mainly been Palestinians covering the story as the Israeli military has prevented international news outlets from entering the Gaza Strip the latest to be killed is samit Abu Daka who was reporting from a un run School in the southern city of Kan yunes when it was targeted in a drone strike alzer's Gaza bureau chief was also injured in the same attack International calls for accountability for Israel's killing of journalists during the war are growing a White House spokesperson expressed Washington's deepest sympathies and condolences for the killing of Sam Abu Daka and Riyad Mansour who's the Palestinian representative to the UN said enough is enough we'll be discussing why the war in Gaza has been so deadly for journalists in a moment but first fer yakar reports this is the price paid by Samar Abu DEA for showing the world what's happening in Gaza surrounded by family and colleagues the body of the veteran Al jazer cameraman was laid to rest on Saturday along with his protective gear he had been wearing that clearly identified him as a journalist sammer had been with his colleague W aladu covering the aftermath of an Israeli attack at a un run School in can yunes that's when an Israeli drone struck samur was hit by shrapnel and bled for more than 5 hours waiting for an ambulance it couldn't get to him sooner because medical staff and rescue teams were prevented from accessing the area by the Israeli military also injured by the shrapnel wall made it to hospital knowing nothing of Sam's fate we can't tell what exactly happened I only felt a big impact I fell down and lost my helmet and my microphone I tried to gather all my strength and was only barely able to stand up I was feeling dizzy and losing my balance it is another example that those covering the Carnage in Gaza are also living through it w lost his wife son daughter and one-year-old grandson to an Israeli air strike on a house they were Sheltering in on October 25th and 6 days later Al jazer broadcast engineer Muhammad Abu alaman lost 19 members of his family killed by Israeli missiles targeting the densely populated jabalia refugee camp then on December 6th Maman Al sharafi lost 22 members of his family when an Israeli bomb destroyed their shelter he says civil defense teams couldn't reach their bodies these are only the stories of Al jazer journalists in Gaza at least 90 media workers have been killed there since the War Began this is the deadliest conflict of four journalists that the committee to protect uh journalist has ever documented and we've been doing this work for more than 30 years by that we mean the highest number of journalist casualties in such a short space of time journalists are civilians they must never be targeted in a war we continue to reiterate that with governments around the world um because we need journalists we need them to be out eyes near for what's happening in Gaza and it's not just Gaza where journalists are Under Fire for covering the War the Reuters news agency says an investigation has revealed that its cameraman Isam Abdullah appears to have been deliberately killed by Israeli tank fire while covering fighting on the Lebanon Israel border six other journalists were wounded in the same incident Al jazer has accused Israel of deliberately targeting its journalists it's asked the international criminal court to investigate the killing of Shireen Abu akla in May last year she was shot dead by Israeli forces while covering a raid in the occup West Bank Israel has yet to charge or hold anyone accountable for any of these killings fakar Al jazer for Inside Story well samed Abu Daka was the 13th Al jaaz journalists killed in their line of work since the network launched in 1996 and a statement released by the AL jazer media Network condemns in the strongest terms the Israeli drone attack on a Gaza school that resulted in the killing of the cameraman Sam Abu Daka it adds the network holds Israel accountable for systematically targeting and killing Al jazer journalists and their families and extends its sincere condolences to Sam Abu daka's family in Gaza and Belgium Al jazer urges the International Community and the international criminal court to take immediate action to hold the Israeli government and Military [Music] accountable for today's discussion we have with us our guests here in Doha we're joined by Al jazer journalist Tam mishal from Oxford is Jim bumel who's from the International Federation of journalists and also joining us from the UK is testino Marinello who's a professor of law at Liverpool John Moors University and who's also a member of the legal team for Gaza victims before the ICC that's the international criminal court welcome to you all thanks for your time tamed I'll start with you as Al jazer the entire family here Mourns the death of Sam Abu Daka in Gaza you knew him very well you worked with him in Gaza tell us about him and your reaction to his death thank you very much Daren it's really a sad moment I worked in in Gaza for more than eight years as a Gaza correspondent with this great team including uh our martyr samur abua Sam a will professional journalist cameraman and uh video editor he joined Al jazer since more than 20 years he covered most of the incidents took place in Gaza and I was working with him also in outside Gaza and in in a professional mission for Al missions for Al jazer Samar Abu Daka he's an example of the Palestinian journalist and Al jazer journalist in Gaza who were he was determined to go on in his work despite all of these difficulties but what did what did happen to to him yesterday was an a crime and part of what we we believe a genocide targeting the Palestinians civilians including the journalist tamr what are you learning about what exactly happened from the time that Samir and wa and the team went to that school in the south of the Gaza Strip until then he was pronounced dead what have you learned about that yes according to our crew on in the field W and S went to area which is a civilians area to a un school to cover the aftermath of Israeli attack which targeted that area in Kan Yunis in southern Gaza Strip suddenly this area has been targeted by an Israeli missile causing an injury for Sam abaka and other civilians in the area W managed to walk out of the area towards Naser hospital but samur left a bleeding in the area and for five hours we contacted all the concerned humanitarian parties to help us to send an ambulance to rescue him and take him to the hospital we contacted the Red Cross Ricans and other organizations but unfortunately when the rescue team arrived to the the area they found that samur during these hours of bleeding he managed to walk and to move a few meters from the area where he was first injured and after that an Israeli drone has targeted him second time and the Missile hit him directly so this is an example of what did happen to Sam and the journalist that he was targeted targeted deliberate Target it was an assassination operation Dar to be honest in describing this what did happen to samur according to our colleagues in the ground in this incident three of the rescue uh teams from the civil defense uh uh the the the the rescue Medical Teams on the ground they have been killed so what we are what we are talking that Sam Abu Daka is an example of more than 90 Palestinian journalists have being killed since this war has started on Gaza in in a number which reflects that the Palestinian journalist are a targets for the Israeli operations and there is no place safe and they are not safe in their working on the ground okay uh let me bring in uh Jim from the Jim if you can comment on what's happened to uh to Sam and um the there's a report that the ifj has put out which says that since 7th of October more than one journalist a day has been killed during the war in Gaza I mean this is unprecedented as you Des describe it is it not thank you very much for having me um there is a kind of a in terms of what's happening right now of course there there are statistics and we're not into NE crunchin also they're very important uh the situation in the West Bank and in Gaza uh has been uh you know producing Journal is been murdered for for the last 40 years so can can I start by uh you know in a conveying to the family of the colleague Gad yesterday abaka uh sincere condolences not not only from the ifj but from the 600,000 journalists that the ifj represent in 170 countries uh in the last um three months you know we have been uh you know very much involved in reporting what's going on and there is huge amount of empathy uh from from journalists for what's happening in Gaza uh we represent them uh we uh through our affiliate the Palestine journalist Syndicate many of those journalists that have died are our members and we work day in day out uh to uh to to follow with with all the international institution on what's going on and we have been doing it as I said for 40 years uh you know up until the 7th of October uh and since the record began uh we have uh on uh our statistics some 50 journalists that have been died and of course the difference with what's been happening now is not is not you know uh during kind of decades it's happened is around 70 days that's okay so Tim look obviously I mean the way that Israel the way that Israel is going about this war is having a huge impact on civilians thousands and thousands of civilians are being killed and now we have this High number of journalists being killed in your view from the International Federation of journalists why is it that journalists are paying such a heavy price well certainly I mean for for us and uh for the international Committee of journalists that that is unacceptable um there have been cases like in Iraq where journalists died and in fact the number in Iraq was much higher statistically but nevertheless that that that was a kind of different type of war and it lasted you know for quite a long time uh as we have said all along uh the Israelis have been targeting journalists it happened in cases that happened 30 years ago but it's happening right now uh and of course one of the the very immediate kind of explanation of that is that uh they are targeting journalists because they don't want to to to to as as a as as an attempt you know to try to cow them you know from doing the job that they're doing every day and we always said that those journalists are very brave in terms of what they're doing and conveying to the world what is happening in Gaza so that is an explanation that it is you know targeting them so those pictures do not come out uh uh anymore or are somehow uh subdued and do not give the truth about what's happening in in Gaza okay let's bring in testino uh let me ask you this actually let me put this to you testino we heard from uh the National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby over in the US after Sam Abu daka's killing and he said we still don't have any indications that Israel are deliberately targeting journalists in an ongoing Dynamic conflict such as this we're not going to make ourselves judge and jury over every single air strike and every single kinetic event that happens on the battlefield what's your response to this statement from John Kirby and when you hear such statements from officials does it give you any hope that there will be accountability well first of all many thanks for having me I think that at this stage has already reported by number of international organization Human Rights group when independent experts there is already enough evidence for the prosecutor of the international criminal court to start an investigation in relation to uh the war crime of uh indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian objects and under International humanitarian law article 79 of the additional protocol one to the Geneva Convention journalists have considered as as a civilian so I mean in contct to what uh is been reported by us authorities I think that there is evidence to argue that the Israeli Authority in this war are putting in place in this create attacks against civilians including journalist and against civilian object but to be honest this is not a novelty even in the previous Wars against Gaza has widely documented by un independent commissions of inquiry U Israel the IDF has committed has put in place indiscriminate Del liberate attacks against civilian and civilian objects without forgetting that in 2021 in Gaza the the Israeli authorities intentionally targeted the media tower the famous so-called Al jazer Tower which was not a military Target at least the isra Israeli authority never proved that that was a military a military Target so um I will conclude by saying that these attacks so far deliberate but this can let's just be clear let's just be clear for a moment so intentionally intentionally targeting journalists as well as civilians of course is considered a war crime is it not under international criminal law under International humanitarian law first of all it's a serious violation of the Geneva Convention so it's a violation that entails State responsibility is a violation of international human rights law the right to life and it's a war crime on the article8 of the stute of the international but then when Israel testino when Israel in the first weeks of the War uh issues a statement the Army issued a statement to international news agency saying that it could not guarantee the safety of their journalists operating in the Gaza Strip I mean this is open contempt for international humanitarian law is it not is Israel trying to absolve itself from any responsibility here and does that work well that's a very arguable under international law has an occupying power in God even before the war Israel has the o obligation under International humanitarian law to protect civilians and that obligation has very clearly breached that does not solve Israel from any accountability both as a state and as individual criminal responsibility I mean the St of the international criminal court does not uh establish an interrogation to this I mean the question here is to prove whether the killing has been willful in other words whether there was awareness that the person the journalist had a protected status and that can be established only by an independent investigation which means not an investigation by domestic authorities in Israel which have prune like in the case of Shirak that they do not have any intent to put in place any effective independent and impartial investigation in relation to the killings of journalist by the Israeli Security Forces yeah okay I'm glad you brought up our other colleague sharen abak Tam let me come back to you uh you know we we we witnessed and and covered the the killing of our colleague sharen Abu in May of last year while she was reporting on an Israeli military operation in the occupied West Bank I mean tamed from your perspective as a journalist as someone who's experienced the dangers of working in these War zones what will it take to stop the violence against journalists and hold those you know perpetrators to account in your opinion you know Daren what is what is sad and shocking when you call and contact your colleagues on the ground they are saying and their voice who is next in the list everyone from our colleagues and from the Palestinian journalists who are covering this war expecting to be the coming Israeli Target and un unfortunately they don't feel on the ground that there is a real intervention to protect them they believe that they are targets for the Israeli operations and there is no any accountability and this is was clear in uh sh AB case even the Israeli Army it changed The Narrative of sh Issue four or five times they ignore their responsibility first then they accused the Palestinian militants then they said by mistake then they say we will open an investigation so they Target and they deny this Target and this what happened in the ground more than 90 more than 90 journalists have been killed and hundreds of Palestinian journalists their families members of their their families have been killed and in addition to that Dar the Israeli Army and the Israeli occupation forces since more than 70 days in Gaza they don't allow for any foreign journalist to go into Gaza to cover this this what is happening on the ground so it's the question now why the Israeli targeting the journalist because clearly they don't want the fact the truth to be appeared on the screens of the television and to be seen by the word let's put that question to Tim and Oxford uh from from the data that uh your organization has collected the um tell tell us in fact how deadly this war has been Tim well certainly um the the data is very clear in terms of the the sheer number of the journalists that that have died um and and we say that most of them have been targeted um however I think if I just come back on this question of how Israel uh kind of treat uh in a Palestinian journalist our Union uh in in Palestine the Palestine journalist Syndicate they prod use very accurate figures on the violation against journalists year in year out they have been doing it quarterly for the last four or five years and they range from detention pre prevention of coverage and so on and so forth I wouldn't go into the detail and the reality is that whenever as an organization representing those journalist we try to engage uh the Israeli authorities uh they they don't even consider them to be to be gener they're not within their radar I mean even the uh the the uh the the identity which is the the identity card that's produced by the ifj is recognized throughout the world and that's what really recognize a journalist as being a Bonafide gatherer of information and should be protected uh under the international human humanitarian law and and that card is not recognized in Israel and and we had for 20 years all kind of discussion trying to find a way that they will feel that they are uh responsible and the human humanitarian laws you know for for the the well-being of these journalists and they refuse to do it so it's not something so what more can you do what more can organizations like yours do Jim well uh of course we continue um you know trying to put pressure on the Israelis only recently our general secretary travel to ramala and try to to meet them uh you know to discuss what's happening to journalists they don't even respond to what we are sending out we have taken the road of going to the international criminal court and maybe there's something that we should discuss what going on there yeah let's bring in testino then let's let's bring in uh uh treso tell us about because I can tell you I can tell you what we have been doing you ask we have been doing sure okay we have taken cases in in including the case for Sharin abaka and what are we at with the international criminal court Kim KH only recently has visited the West Bank and there's no nothing very clear and positive about what they're doing is it a question of resources is it question let bring in testino then testino comment on this I mean not only obviously we know that there is a case for our colleague Shireen abak filed at the international criminal court um and um presumably there will be other cases when it comes to the targeting of journalists will the families will the organizations be able to get Justice at the IC well that's a very interesting question I mean what we know for sure is that uh the investigation into the Palestine situation was open in March 20121 but since the prosecutor kharim Khan took office in June 2021 there is never been any effective investigation into Palestine situation effective investigation means also in relation to the Palestinian journalist killed by the Israeli authorities the prosecutor has not formally engaged with the victims of the situation including I guess victim's family of the Palestinian journalist the prosecutor as we could argue has discover the existence of this investigation after the 7th of October when he has issued a few statements he has visited Israel and Palestine and he also visited the rougher border uh this is a welcome development but at the same time he continues to give signals messages of double standards he has been very prompt in meeting with Israeli victims from the 7th of October attack and that's part of his mandate but he's been very reluctant in meeting with Palestinian victims and still is not really clearly mentioned in any effective concrete case that he wants to investigate and prosecute including cases against journalist International bodies seem to fail the Palestinians testino over and over and not just in the international criminal court but like we see in the security Council for example what other avenues are there well at the international level there are not other avenues because at least from an individual criminal responsibility the ICC is the only one is a court of last resort which intervenes only when domestic jurisdiction fail and we know that Israel as as we said before the other alternatives are for State responsibility in particular the international court of justice which has the competence also to establish whether or not the Israeli authorities are responsible for genocide let me conclude that then cases like this can be brought before Domestic Court states that have specific provisions on universal jurisdiction they could be competent to address these serious violation of international humanarian law Jim I'll come to you briefly because I see that you want to jump in there and say something in 30 seconds if you don't mind yeah well certainly I mean the question of the international crial court and and the and the people who are in charge of it and what they have been doing or have been saying is very important and and we have uh and until recently pointed out you know to the prosecutor and other kind of uh uh officials within the court as to why they have deployed so much resources on the question of the Ukraine I'm not making a hierarchy of of victims of course they should do but why on the one case they did put huge resources uh many officers 4050 you know going straight to the Ukraine you know issuing arrest warrant and in this case they're refusing to do it and there is that is a big question of whether the court itself is being um perhaps you know kind of put under pressure by some of its component I mean the United States is not even the component of it but others like the UK they are and we hear every day the kind of pressure that they're putting on the court for not making a move on this and that is a big question mark of for whether the court is capable you know of doing what they are set up to do or not we'll have to leave it there thank you so much to my guests for joining us Tam M Jim bu and trino Marinello we thank you for your time thanks for watching you
