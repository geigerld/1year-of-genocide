the war on Gaza now and the Israeli military has released a group of Palestinians who were detained during raids on alifa Hospital in Gaza City they're having medical checks at Al AXA and NASA hospitals among those released is a director of alifa Hospital Muhammad Abu salamia he was detained in November while taking part in a United Nations mission to evacuate patients from the medical complex Abu salamia described conditions as tragic because of a lack of food and drink in Israeli prisons all the Palestinian detainees are suffering I left them in a very dire condition my message is that their issue must be part of any negotiations until released al-shifa hospital will be rebuilt and it will be once again a beacon of health care for all the Palestinians not only gazin I will resume my duties as soon as it is feasible let's bring in hindal hudar now live for us in daral central Gaza hind the director of alifa Hospital one of several Palestinians released by Israel can you bring us up to date with uh what we've heard about their conditions and uh what led to this release the circumstances uh surrounding this release well Dr Muhammad Abu is one of 55 Palestinian prisoners who were released earlier today uh we have been seeing all of the prisoners uh their FA P es look different their features look different they lost a lot of weight and Dr Muhammad ABIA already mentioned that the health situation the conditions in uh the prisons are are terrifying they there's lack of food there's lack of water and there's also lack of medical treatment for example Dr Muhammad Abu was detained and the Palestinians here believe that he was kidnapped on the netar checkpoint while he was evacuating from the Northern parts of Gaza to the south after the Israeli forces issued those orders to Palestinians to evacuate other Palestinians who were released today were arrested and detained in different parts in the Northern parts of Gaza and some families said that those uh Palestinians were kidnapped where Palestinian families did not know anything about those Palestinians who were uh detained and released earlier today according to Dr Muhammad Abu he says that there are hundreds and thousands of other Palestinian prisoners that are still in those Israeli jails they're witnessing horrific uh uh very terrifying and there suffering from the Israeli prisons where there is lack of food water and medicine and he also mentioned that some Palestinians died during the integration uh and process and and hind what's the latest uh are on the ground there the Israeli attacks continue across the Gaza Strip and the ground invasion of suaya in Gaza City that District in Gaza City also continues bring us up to speed with what you know is happening right now well let's start in the middle area where there was intense artillery shelling in the Eastern Parts ofah moving to a the ground Invasion there continues for the fifth consecutive day we're talking about a very densely populated area where some people were able to evacuate but some people stayed and were unable to leave and they were trapped in their houses we're talking about people who are injured and Medical Teams could not reach them there has been no water no food for 5 days and the intensivity of the air strikes continue Palestinians surrounding Shia are reporting that the artillery shelling did not stop strikes did not stop and also the Israeli forces are blowing up a complete residential area it's very sad to see this happen again in sh where in the 2014 War the same exact area witnessed the same exact demolish violence and this is the continuous cycle uh uh of the systematic uh actions against the Palestinians by the Israeli forces H thank you very much for the update that's Al jaz's hind Al HUD live there in De Bala Central Gaza let's discuss these latest developments now with Mansour Schuman who's a Palestinian journalist and humanitarian who witnessed the war in Rafa and KH Unis joining us here on the set thank you manour for being with us uh let's start with the release of uh the director of alifa hospital and several others 55 Palestinians released by Israeli forces we heard the director talk about the conditions that they were in in these Israeli prisons and what they suffered obviously this is not just a one-off incident the conditions that these Palestinian prisoners uh are faced with in in these Israeli prisons what more can you tell us about this definitely there are thousands of more like Dr Muhammad Abu who had been detained in the wrongful way over the last few months um as you heard from Dr Muhammad they are going through very terrible conditions both mentally and physically they're not being fed the proper food or water they're being tortured and what they're going through is Hell on Earth right now similar to how the international governments and communities and organizations put pressure on the Israeli government to free Dr Muhammad Abu we call upon them to also work towards freeing the thousands of other detainees that are in those detainment centers right now what is Israel's justification for arresting the director of alifa hospital he was arrested during a humanitarian Mission with with the un uh staff that were in Gaza how do they justify this arrest um they haven't I don't think they have released anything official in terms of a statement but since his detainment in November we haven't heard back from the Israeli government on why they do what they do to the medical staff to the administrators to the doctors the nurses um I'm sure you've heard about the atrocities that they have done to hospitals in the north the Central and the southern regions um it seems that they they've been given the green light to do whatever they want in Gaza both to uh residential commercial and medical facilities um I just want to point out that in the eyes of the Palestinians and the free people around the world they all see Dr Muhammad Abu as a real hero on the ground he could have left a shifa hospital a very long time ago and joined the many um uh refugees in the South but he was determined to St to stay in a shi hospital and to continue direct the work here there and not only that also as someone who I have been neighbors with who lives 500 meters away from me I know him personally and I know that for a fact that he would like to return back on the top of his work as soon as possible this shows you the determination and the resilience of the Palestinian people in general especially their leadership and the people who are in Authority yeah uh we talked about uh with hind the attacks continuing across Gaza and there's intense fighting right now in the Gaza uh City District of sua with civilians trapped there reportedly Israel has said it wants to destroy Hamas tunnel tunnels which are still in Shaya they say although this is an area which they previously declared that they' cleared completely and now they're back can you tell us more about the this District of Gaza City it's significant and you know the the civilians who are trapped there what sort of uh situation are they enduring right now the translation of it in Arabic is the neighborhood of the brave people so historically was was a place where people were resilient and people were able to remain strong and stay in their land despite any kind of offense against them historically so um I think that um for many many decades that neighborhood has always been a place where the Israeli forces fear and I'm also part of many WhatsApp groups many of who have families and relatives in sh they're saying that their civilian families are determined to stay on their land there they do not want to leave they believe that it is time for them to continue to stay where they are they don't want to be forced to be refugees and they don't want they've seen what happened to many thousands of others of people who left their lands and what happened to them and they want to stay where they are I think that's what the Israelis are trying to they're trying to drive the people out of the North they're trying to push them to the South and to other areas maybe because they want to control the North in the near future I'm not sure but it's all it's been the same um it's been the same uh clip that we've all seen every time they withdraw from a residence or an area in North they come back to it they've done that to a shiff hospital three times they've done that to many neighborhoods in the North many times and we're seeing it again happen to our people there so we hope that the International Community will put pressure on the Israelis to stop this as soon as possible and to keep our civilians safe on the ground
