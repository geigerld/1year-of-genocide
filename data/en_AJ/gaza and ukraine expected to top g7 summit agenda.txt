President Biden arriving in Italy ahead of the start of this year's G7 Summit it's a meeting that's likely to have a serious and subdued tone that's because since the seven leaders last met Ukraine has not as they'd all hoped strengthened its hand against Russia in a war that's gone on for nearly 2 and a half years but even higher on their agenda the war on Gaza all the G7 leaders initially supported Israel's right to self defense but with a death toll of more than 37,000 Palestinians that support is increasingly reluctant experts believe it's damaged the g7's moral Authority the G7 does for many people feel increasingly less relevant less reflective of of power around the world um much more of a club that's not necessarily got the uh legitimacy that it used that it once had and you know addon double standards and hypocrisy and people you know dying um in at at scale in Gaza and it's a it's a very gloomy outlock the seven leaders are the same ones who attended the last Summit in the Japanese city of Hiroshima but six of the seven are now facing serious political pressures at home in France and the UK elections are due in weeks and the US vote is now less than 4 months away after a strong showing for her right-wing party and the European elections the one leader whose fortunes appear to be rising is the host Georgia Maloney the Italian Prime Minister is bringing a record number of 10 guest countries to this year's G7 that's in part because she wants to focus on the issue of migration but experts believe she's also trying to keep the G7 relevant at a time when its self-declared role at the Pinnacle of world affairs seems less certain than ever James Bay Al jazer pulia Italy make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
