Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas is due to travel to Qatar in the coming hours Abbas is going to meet the Amir Sheik Tam bin hammad Alani in Doha he's expected to discuss the role of the Palestinian Authority in gaza's future we're going to bring in M Rabani he's the co-editor of Jalia it's an online news source focused on the Arab world very good to have you with us so let's talk about this visit by the Palestinian Authority president what role if any do you think that the Palestinian Authority could play in the future of Gaza well I think um Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas has been engaged in a life and death struggle with relevance um since the 7th of October um on the one hand uh the the west and particularly the United States are proposing that the Palestinian Authority play a role in postwar Gaza on the other they recognize that this is out of the question unless um this unless the authority is rejuvenated and in that context there's been growing talk of replacing him um with uh with someone who might be more effective but I think the broader background here is that this is really all based on an illusion because the Palestinian Authority in its current form lacks legitimacy lacks Effectiveness lacks credibility it's been very substantially weakened by Israel with Western support I should add over the years um and so I I think um given katar's role uh along with Egypt as a key mediators I think Abbas is very much trying to ensure that the Palestinian Authority maintains a foot in the door I think it's also unfortunate that it's only this issue that is bringing him onto the stage um you know his people have been subject to a genocidal Israeli assault for months now and the only issue that seems to excite him is the future of the Palestinian Authority and his personal position um in the political Arena you mentioned before that there had been uh statements from Israel that the the existing Palestinian Authority would not be acceptable but a rejuvenated one a changed one uh might be at some point it was all very vague but time is against that isn't it I mean in terms of the the timeline we're talking about Israel is is saying is preparing its people for a long campaign at the same time it was being reported that Benjamin net who saying was saying that this latest possibly last stage in the conflict this offensive towards Rafa had to be done before Ramadan which is round about March the 10th and that brings that time timeline much U much closer so one would imagine it's going to be very difficult for the Palestinian Authority as you from what you were saying to have any re relevance or even if it attempts to tr try to change in a very short time span yes well I think Israel's plans for the pales in authority and for that matter those of the um the US would make it even less relevant I think the only um uh realistic Prospect in this context would be for the Palestinian Authority for the fat movement which for decades formed the spinal cord of the Palestinian national movement um to achieve a consensus with Hamas with the other Palestinian factions and to establish what is a genuinely National rather than a factional Authority because also I mean any alternative will require the total eradication of Hamas for it to succeed and Israel has already demonstrated that you know while it might be good at genocide and mass killings it's just not up to the task of militarily defeating Hamas and if that restructuring goes ahead in some form and it does have the PA does have some sort of role in the future of Gaza one would imagine there's going to be a KnockOn effect for the West Bank as well where in many cases it had its most severe critics from Palestinians there who as you've been describing have been claiming that it has simply been an to some extent an arm of the Israeli security forces and has been unable to protect them yes and I think that's part of the problem of the Palestinian Authority that has been having increasing challenges imposing its Authority on the West Bank which in in a sense is its home base very much challenged by Israel of course so if it can't do that in the West Bank how does it expect to do that in the Gaza Strip and yes you know there is opposition to Hamas and and criticism of Hamas in the Gaza Strip of course there is but the problem for Abbas is that doesn't translate into support for the Palestinian Authority it's not a zero sum game we heard from our correspondent hanim Mahmud describing the conditions in Rafa there and more broadly the conditions that Gaza has been reduced to over the last several weeks there is this question about the the potential Israeli military operation in Rafa and the key question is where are people going to go and there is a certain amount of speculation isn't there that they might go over the border into Egypt but as I understand it the Egyptian authorities are absolutely dead set against that because the last thing they want is a large number of Palestinian people coming into the Sinai that they then have to deal with and that then puts them under a direct kind of path towards at least a breakdown in agreement shall we say between Israel between Egypt and Israel that exist at the moment yes um Egypt is dead set against the mass expulsion uh the forc transfer of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip into uh the Sinai desert I think what Israel is now doing of course it's escalating its attacks on ra I think in part it's a pressure tactic to improve their bargaining position with respect to a potential um new truce and uh prisoner exchange I think it's also intended to pressure Reg and I think in the back of their heads many Israeli leaders are hoping well if we make enough threats then it doesn't really matter what Egypt says maybe these Palestinians will just force um open the border and start leaving Mo Rob we appreciate you being with us thank you very much indeed for your time thank you you
