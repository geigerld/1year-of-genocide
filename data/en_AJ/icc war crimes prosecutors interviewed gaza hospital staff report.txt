prosecutors from the international criminal court are reportedly interviewing staff from two hospitals in the Gaza Strip that's after the discovery of mass Graves on the grounds of the two facilities hundreds of bodies were recovered from three Mass Graves on the premises of the NASA Hospital in Han Unis this month and the remains of dozens more people were exhumed at alifa hospital in Gaza City after an Israeli Siege of the facility both hospitals were left badly damaged and out of service after Israeli troops withdrew let's go straight to Al jaer Sark abum who's in Rafa forest in southern Gaza so tar what more have you found out about these ICC investigators interviewing uh staff at Nasa hospital and alifa Hospital who were they talking to and about what precisely well precisely FY uh the persecutors of the international criminal court have been speaking to a number of pal Medics who have been working in a shifa hospital in the north and even in nasar hospital in kanun in the south after the Israeli withdrawal they have been talking about possible crimes committed by the Israeli military during the existence inside the medical facility but yet the identities of those Medics is still unknown for security concerns and security reasons as the international uh criminal uh Courts office have been saying that they did not provide any proper comment about the operational procedures and investigations being made with these eyewitnesses in order to guarantee the full protection and we have been clearly remember what was going on in such hospitals in terms of the mass Graves being discovered were hundreds of bodies found de composed and they have been found also uh dug in have been buried in in deeper in sand with bile of waste and sand have been throwing over such bodies but yet the Israeli side have been saying that they have no longer uh let's say care about what the international court of justice might take in terms of actions against Israeli soldiers as the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that he will tries to he will try to afford the full protection for the Israeli soldiers under his own leadership but it's absolutely terrifying as what we do know is that we've been hearing from the Gaza civil defense Crews saying that there are still at least 10,000 Palestinians messing under the rule of the destroyed house houses in multiple areas across the territory as the the accumulation of these bodies especially when the during the onset of the summer season had contributed to increase the spread of diseases and even epidemics as till now there are struggling in order to recover such injuries and victims from under the rubble of the destroyed houses tar thank you very much for the update that's Al jaer is tar abaz reporting their live from Rafa well let's discuss this further now with Jeffrey nice who's a human rights Barrister who led the prosecution of Slobodan milosovic at the international criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia he's joining us from Canterbury thank you so much for your time uh Mr Nice so we heard that Gaza Hospital staff questioned by investigators of the ICC what does this suggest you what happens next in the process and what's likely to be the outcome of these investigations number of questions rolled into one on the last one very difficult to answer likely outome always bit uncertain but this is I think interesting and good news going in sequence and keeping a cool head about things examination either directly or through the testimony of others of what may be a crime site is extremely important and potentially very valuable in evidence terms we may have discussed this before but how bodies are found in a mass grave whether they're all killed in the same way whether their hands would hied behind their back whether they' being tortured beforehand or not is itself going to show simply as step one whether a crime may have been committed there's other ways in which it may be shown that a crime has been committed simply by the number of people killed who are Innocent by what's shown of the individuals looking at their clothing or their property and so on and so forth so you look at the scene and you decide if you can whether there's evidence there of a crime being committed once you reach the position position that there is such evidence you may seek you may find some surviving eyewitness to what happened and you take account of that what that eyewitness says if that eyewitness points to Commission of the crime by the Israeli Defense Force or any part of it you need to know first whether uh the particular unit is identified doesn't matter necessarily if not but you work your way steadily up until reach as high as you can get but what you may hear from some is skepticism about the possibility of ever drawing a link between the crime at the bottom not the crime where it happens and links rising in the chain and what you then have to take into account is the following properly constructed um military forces armies such as the IDF right have a chain of command from the top working down and you must reasonably assume that that chain is in place and therefore you can demand information from Israel if it doesn't provide it voluntarily of if you reach the position of knowing that it's been something that's been committed by a military group demanding to know who the group is and working out from there how the chain of command goes up if you look back it's it may always be said that oh this was a rogue a rogue unit right and there have been Rogue units in in the Vietnam there was a very famous Logue unit of mili but it sounds as though Netanyahu is standing by his men uhhuh if he's standing by his men that may say the chain of command was intact okay now as this is happening uh these uh investigators are talking to staff at these two hospitals in Gaza uh Mr Nice there have all also been many reports in Israeli media in recent days that the ICC is investigating Israeli actions not just in Gaza but also in the occupied West Bank and that there could be arrest warrants issued for uh Israeli and uh Hamas officials would that be part of the same case as the mass graves in Gaza or a separate case uh would there be a link between the two one assumes it would be part of the same overall case and indeed it has even been suggested that the overall case that might be raised against the state of Israel could go back to and include what happened as long ago as 2014 when jurisdiction was first granted to the international criminal court so uh although you can't be sure what we're concerned about here obviously is the overall driving mental state of the leadership of the state of Israel's Defense Force yeah um and that means what is the mental state of the intention if you like not quite the same meaning but the intention of the Israeli leadership military and political right it is that if anything which is going to join things together okay even if for example at a trial they would have to be separated out again understood now I wanted to ask you briefly one last question before we let you go and get your your expertise and insight because you have obviously a great deal of experience in this there' have also been reports of some pressure on the ICC not to issue these arrest warrants now at a time when there's a great deal of effort to reach a ceasefire in Gaza the concern being that this could jeopardize those efforts would the IC take that into consideration when and if it issues these arrest warrants a most important Point needs a much longer answer the the short answer is I'd expected there to be pressure before and was surprised and happily surprised to see the announcement of possible arrest warrants once they've reached that stage the prosecutor certainly shouldn't yield now to pressure from the United States or from Great Britain or from anywhere else the the state has been reached in the public consideration I think that law that accountability and law should to some extent out outweigh ra politic and if there has to be accountability as well as a settlement of the uh conflict or at least a ceasefire then let there be accountability if you don't have accountability for whatever reason temporarily good or not so good you open the door to Future bad actions not just by the countries presently involved but by other countries I've said from the beginning that both Hamas and Israeli leadership once evidence was available that each or both had committed such offenses should be subject to an accountability process the public expects that right and governments that go against it will lose the support of their people thank you so much for talking to us thank you for your expertise Jeffrey nice a former at the ICC at the international uh criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia yes sorry a former barister I should say thank you so much for uh clarifying it for
