the thing that jumps out of you here is that we have whole convoys of Aid stranded in Egypt for weeks and yet now everybody's talking about this this trickle of Aid coming in Via Maritime route yeah well I mean this is a little bit nonsense everybody already mentioned how difficult is technically to to do that they announce that the a ship is already leaving a port in in Cyprus and the port is not there so when they are going to build the port it's a little bit uh tricky to to claim that the the the a will will arrive in the coming days so in the meantime they have to use air drops to to reach the people I think what what is interesting to to point out here is that for the first time the European Union the UK and the United States are showing together their frustration about the the lack of um uh compliance on the Israeli side to guarantee that the civilians are not going to be affected or are not getting affected by by this five months late yes five months less but at least they they are giving a very strong message to Israel that this is the only way we can H enter the with help with Aid to these people because you are not allowing to do it whether they should on the other hand pressure Israel to open the Border simply this is something different maybe we are going to reach to that point when this idea of the p is discarded what's interesting because the UK foreign minister David Cameron as we were talking about earlier he's saying that well the port Biden's Port is going to take ages exactly so Israel needs to open up ashdod the port of ashdod and that means the a was be going through Israel I mean you know it's so complicated most probably this idea will be discarded in in the few days when they realize that this not possible and then when they realize that they need as everybody mentioned the agreement from the Israeli government and it will be managed by Israel so nothing is going to change at the end of the day Israel is preventing Aid to enter through Rafa is going to stop the the a entering for from the sea as well do you think there's a subtext here about un's role that it could diminish the role of of the Palestinian refugee agency I mean Israel doesn't want it around at all does it could be I mean the the the UN agency has gender fire since a long time ago I mean the the Israelis are keep even attacking people that they are contributing to to the United Nations agency even though they are governments I mean the the the same members of the United Nation that they contributing to the effort of the unra however Israel keeps saying that these people that they support unra is terrorist supporting terrorism which is totally uh uh trying to discard absolutely unra in providing any kind of official support to the people but providing individual support that is showing on the other hand that United States is caring about what is going on there I mean what Kimberly said about the the campaign is very clear since the very beginning it's not very timely for for Biden this this crisis since the very beginning we see how Democrats poter are changing their their view about the conflict and how this primary elections are showing that in December we will see that these people that they did the vote uncommitted they might not go to vote they will not vote to to to Trump maybe but they will not vote for Biden meaning that the participation will be lower and Trump will win right what will also not Escape voters you would think is this kind of crazy contradiction of assisting passage of a to help Palestinians while still providing weapons to kill them exactly I mean this is happened couple of weeks ago when uh Biden was for the first time or Kamal har was criticizing or saying very strong word for the first time Biden was pushing the Congress to uh give an emergency aid financially to Israel to continue the war so of course they need to show on one hand that they did not stop the support I mean that the state of the nation discourse was clear he was recognizing the 30,000 but he was still claiming that the the blame is on the inian side therefore they cannot I mean Biden also needs the support from the the Israel Lobby to continue his campaign now in the primary and also in the in the presidential campaign interesting Luciana appreciate that thanks very much indeed for taking us through Lucian zakara in the studio thank you
