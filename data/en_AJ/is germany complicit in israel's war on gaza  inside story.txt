Germany is complicit in Israel's genocide in Gaza and that must end that's Nicaragua's argument before the un's top Court Germany says Nicaragua has a one-sided view of the war in Gaza what does this case mean for countries supplying Israel with weapons this is Inside [Music] Story hello there I'm James Bay Nicaragua has asked the international court of justice to order Germany to stop supplying Israel with weapons immediately it argues Berlin is complicit in genocide taking place in Gaza the case joins two others involving Israel already before the icj Nicaragua's case is more broad drawing on both the genocide and Geneva conventions and is notable for being the first to involve two countries not Direct ly involved in the alleged atrocities governments around the world will undoubtedly take notice Germany is the second largest weapons Supply to Israel after the United States so what does this case mean for other countries that contribute to Israel's extensive military Network could third parties be held accountable for enabling a genocide we'll discuss all of this with our panel of guests in just a moment but first this report from Alexandra bers 80 years after the Holocaust Germany is being accused of facilitating genocide Nicaragua is calling on the international court of justice to stop all German arms exports to Israel it argues the Israeli Army is using those weapons and ammunition against Palestinians in Gaza and by extension Berlin is enabling acts of genocide the Norms of the genocide convention which are part of customary international law imposed the obligation on thir states to to undertake to prevent genocide this obligation arises from the moment that that state becomes aware that genocide might be committed and there can be no question that Germany as is evident from the preceding comments was well aware and is well aware of at least the serious risk of genocide being committed Germany is the second largest armed supplier to Israel after the US and its exports include Torpedoes submarine parts anti-tank weapons and Military protective gear Berlin recognizes the icj's jurisdiction the US does not lawyers for Germany have dismissed Nicaragua's accusations as biased and say Berlin is doing all it can to fulfill its obligations to both Palestinians and Israelis Germany only supplies arms on the basis of detailed scrutiny a scrutiny that not only respects but far exceeds the requirements of international law arms exports that take into account the security threats Israel is facing in particular immediately after 7 October at the same time Germany's supply of arms and other military equipment to Israel is subject to a continuous evaluation of the situation on the ground The Landmark case joins two others currently before the un's top Court South Africa accused Israel of committing icide in Gaza which the court found was plausible and the icj has accepted a motion by the UN General Assembly on the legality of Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories now Nicaragua's case could have consequences for governments around the world can countries that are not committing atrocities directly still be held responsible for them Alexandra buers Al jazer for Inside let's dig deeper into the significance of this case and what of any difference it'll make with our guests today from weisbard in Germany we're joined by Matas Goldman a senior research fellow at the max plank Institute for comparative Public Law and international law in hia Dianna bhau a Palestinian lawyer and advocate of the Palestinian cause and in New York Kenneth Roth is a visiting professor at the Princeton School of Public and international Affairs he was the executive director of human rights watch thank you for joining me all of you we have an eminent panel of lawyers today I am not a lawyer Ken though so let's start in layman's language in your view how strong is this case well it's based on you know a very simple premise which is that you should not be arming a government that is committing war crimes let alone plausible genocide as the international court of justice has called it now there's actually a precedent for this you may remember back to the former Liberian president Charles Taylor he was convicted of aiding and eding war crimes and other atrocities in neighboring sarra Leone because he armed an abusive Rebel group there and he's currently serving a 50-year prison Trum in a British prison so there is precedent for this now the international court of justice is a civil court it's not a criminal court but this premise that you shouldn't be arming a country and Military that's committing atrocities is you know morally simple and legally straightforward Matas let me ask you um about the comments from the Nicaraguan Ambassador who opened the case for Nicaragua now to be clear you don't represent the German government here you are German and a German lawyer um he said there's no question that Germany was well aware and is well aware of at least the serious risk of genocide being committed what do you make of that basic case well James I think it's it's a very good proposition to start the case and I think that Nicaragua has um made a very strong presentation in the sense that they gave a they displayed the problems that many people around the world have with weapons deliveries in to Israel in in the current conflict so I I would say that in some to some extent they really exposed the double standards of uh the Western world and uh that is from a moral point of view a very strong case which they made whether that is going to be a successful case before the international court of justice is a little bit different because the international court of justice is bound by rules of procedure and uh you know the the the substantive International legal Provisions applicable in the case and in that regard the complication is that it's quite an indirect way in which Nicaragua is challenging Germany's acts so it's um actually criticizing or it's suing Germany for acts to which Germany contributes which however have been committed by Israel and this indirect way of tackling the conflict of bringing the conflict to the court May ultimately have an impact on the success of Nicaragua's case even though many people would agree that there have been violations of international humanitarian law and even though the question whether a genocide is unfolding is uh is still pending in a different case before the court Dian you are a lawyer to and former legal adviser to the Palestinian Liberation Organization the PLO but actually I'd like to start with you taking off your legal hat and tell me what do Palestinians make of this case are they following it what do they make of it they're not following it as closely as they were following obviously the South African case but they are indeed following it and there's a reason for that uh it's because Palestinians have tried everything we've tried diplomatic means we've tried to push for Statehood we've tried practically everything and the world time and again has failed Palestinians and so now Palestinians are looking and saying isn't it time that these s systems that particularly the Europeans have been wagging their fingers at us for for decades saying that we should be using legal systems it's time to test those legal systems and see whether the law actually does apply to Israel or whether Israel is above the law so people are indeed following it and this really is a test of this along with the other cases of course is a test of the legal system and the robustness of the legal system is it a system in which it applies to some countries or is it a system in which it applies to all and if it applies to all then we must start seeing that Israel is held accountable through sanctions through arms embargos and through other mechanisms as well Ken let me ask you a question that when I was doing the research for this program puzzled me a bit which is why is Nicaragua not suing the United States and I did a lot of reading about this it seems to go back to the Reagan Administration and the case again involving Nicaragua versus the US and after that um the US decided not to recognize some of the icj's jurisdiction can you explain it a bit more a bit better to me for me please James it's a it's a bit that it's a bit the way that the United States ratified the genocide convention but to put it very simply um the US has not submitted to the jurisdiction of the international court of justice on a blanket basis but only Case by case meaning it would have to consent to be sued by Nicaragua whereas Germany has consented in a blanket basis Nicaragua could sue in this case and Germany was stuck with it so that's why Germany the second largest arms provider was sued rather than the United States now you know it's worth at some point in this show mentioning that you know Nicaragua is a poor plaintiff here you know it's a brutal dictatorship it's one of the most repressive countries in Latin America um that's irrelevant to the merits of the case but it's unfortunate that Nicaragua was the plain of here now let's say a word if we could about the German defense here because German lawyers kind of put forth three arguments none of them are very good um one of them was like oh we support Palestinian rights but you know who cares if you're also arming Israel as it bombs and starves Palestinian civilians um you know second it said Israel is not committing war crimes you know which is just laughable I mean anybody can see that it is and the third that really goes to the heart of the German state today it's that it's a stop res it's a reason for the state as a results of the Nazi responsibility for the Holocaust to support Israel and that in my view is the wrong lesson of the Holocaust the lesson of Holocaust should be that you oppose atrocities you oppose war crimes whoever commits them even if they're by the Israeli government rather than that you support the Israeli government even if it's committing war crimes and plausible genocide it's the wrong lesson Matas your take on that your the German on the panel give us your view of the historical context and as Ken say says there he believes that Germany's learned the long the wrong lesson definitely this is a valid argument to be made there is a a quite a vivid debate I would say at the moment whether this um position this policy position of the German government that the security of Israel is part of Germany's reason of state is still valid and and should still be maintained in particular if it is understood as a kind of blanket support for whatever Israel does I think you could see over the last couple of weeks that the German government has tried to at least publicly articulate its concern for the humanitarian situation in Gaza several times and of course ultimately that will will will pose the question to what extent Germany will unconditionally support Israel and at some point that will also raise the question to what extent one can cooperate with Israel in a military respect Deanna this like the South Africa case is likely to go on for a very long time but I think Nicaragua probably like South Africa cares about the immediate measures the court puts in place what are called the provisional measures now they're calling for Germany to immediately suspend its Aid to Israel particularly the military uh the Military Arms shipments but also important it says it must resume its support and financing of unra unra being the UN agency that is the main humanitarian agency operating in Gaza how important is that the only way that Aid at this point in time can be effectively delivered in the Gaza Strip is through those bodies that have had a history of delivering that Aid and that is Ana and the fact that we saw that immediately uh the day after the the order for provisional measures came out that Israel made these false allegations against unwa allegations that have not been proven and for which there's been no investigation and immediately we saw that countries cut off Aid it was a means by which Israel was able to overshadow the provisional measures decision and turn turn people's uh attention to a different issue now I think it's important to bear in mind Israel has not complied with the provisional measures order that came out in January and it continues to be in violation of not only that but of the other um demands as well for a ceasefire and you name it so this request that Israel that uh that the Germany not only stop giving weapons to Israel but also resume Aid is a means through a backhanded way of actually giving support to Palestinians at a time when Israel has made it clear that they intend to carry out genocide and they are in fact carrying out genocide and it's worth stating that Germany in its um submission in the court said it was the biggest supplier to humanitarian Aid to the opt that's the technical term occupied Palestinian territory and isra and Germany's been continuing to supply Aid even now including air drops and on that point perhaps it's worth listening to what one of the Nicaraguan lawyers Daniel Müller said it is indeed a pathetic excuse to the pal Palestinian children women and men in Gaza to provide humanitarian Aid including through air drops on the one hand and to furnish the weapons and military equipment that are used to kill and humiliate them and to kill also humanitarian Aid workers as most recently evidenced by the missile itch against vehicles and workers of world Central Kitchen on the other hand what do you think of that Ken well he's completely right and I would add to that which is is that the airdrops are really a drop in the bucket everybody recognizes that the only way to alleviate the large scale starvation in Gaza is through delivery by truck but the same Israeli Army that Germany is Army is obstructing that Aid delivery it's letting in drips and drabs of food but it's imposing these inspection regimes which force trucks to wait you know after three weeks many of them don't get through at all um it has been making it extremely difficult to distribute Aid within Gaza Diana rightly says that unra is with its 30,000 employees is the only agency capable of really doing Mass distribution in Gaza um Israel was trying to shut that down because you know and near 12 people allegedly without proof participated in the October 7th attack they were all either dismissed or two of them had were said to have died so unred did everything it could with those 12 people but Israel saw an opportunity here it has had data against unra for decades because it sees anra as the way that Palestinian refugees continue to hope to return to Israel now that's not unra is doing you know Palestinian refugees know that they're Palestinian refugees whether unra is there or not they long to return to their ancestral home whether or not there's unra but Israel despite knowing that it's aggravating starvation has been on this Vendetta against unra and while Germany has now resumed funding of unra elsewhere in the region it continues not to fund unra in Gaza where unra is the key to alleviating potential famine Dean I know you like all of our panel have been watching the developments in the ha on Monday Nicaragua's case on Tuesday Germany's response tell me in terms of the whole case how much is this new legal ground and could there be a legal precedent here it's hard for me to say because I have a fear I fear that what the court is going to do instead is wait for the larger case in relation to South that South Africa brought forward um to wait to deal with that first that's that's my fear and so it's hard to say it is important to bear in mind though and um both of my co-panelists have said this very eloquently there is a responsibility not just on Israel to not uh carry out genocide but there's also responsibility on third States as well to to prevent genocide from happening as well and this case speaks about the idea of prevention of genocide we already know what Israel is doing it's made its intentions very clear we see the actions on the ground we see the force starvation we see everything that it's doing and now it's really imperative for the world to act whether the court takes that that same route and says yes indeed we're going to be issuing some measures is an entirely different matter but it is important for the world to understand that it that this isn't just upon Israel to stop genocide it also requires that other countries around the world every country around the world act and make sure that Palestinians are not um are not subjected to this genocide the problem with that mataas is is we've already seen the court act with its provisional measures twice uh with regard to the South Africa um case they where they reacted and then they came back again and said you're still not doing it um the Court's rulings are legally binding are they not but the problem is it doesn't have any sort of enforcement mechanism well you know James um to be legally binding doesn't mean necessarily that you have to be able to send troops or a police force to enforce them otherwise it would be for not and to be legally binding can have consequences uh for countries for example they might um have to pay reparations if they violate International legal rules at some point point and U that could be enforced by governments that or by you know ultimately by Palestine which in this case is the party to to whom these obligations like the obligation to respect humanitarian law the obligation not to commit genocide are owned and uh there are ways of enforcing these uh reparations even though that can be a lengthy process but that doesn't mean at all that it's uh it's totally irrelevant moreover I would say that in a case in which Germany is being sued um as one of the you know one of the largest economic Powers but also a um political power at least in Europe if Germany gets a um an order to respect certain conditions and uh if it is seen to be in violation of that order it's a reputational damage of sorts so should that happen Germany would have all reasons to respect it because otherwise you cannot go around and base your foreign policy on the premise that you're respecting international law which is one of the you know the basic tension that Germany is uh having here on the one hand it's historical responsibility on the other hand it's commitment to international law and to build a credible foreign policy which might be important for many different things it needs to respect International or at least needs to be able to make a plausible case to respect international law and you can't do that any longer if the international court of justice is telling you that you're in violation okay let's have a quick look at where Israel is getting its weapons from Germany is the second L largest provider of arms to Israel accounting for 30% of all its weapons Imports the US is by far its largest supplier it gives Israel annual military aid worth 3.8 billion do last year Germany increased deliveries nearly tenfold to 350 $4 million most were improved approved in the immediate aftermath of hamas's October the 7th attack on Southern Israel since 2015 the UK's contributions amount to more than half a billion dollars and include components for F35 fighter jets also since 2015 Canada has sent military equipment worth $84 million to Israel before it suspended exports in February can Canada yes Belgium Italy the Netherlands and Spain they're all countries that have suspended or restricted arm sales to Israel are we slowly seeing Israel's um pipeline of weapons drying up I mean James yes and no um other governments are slowly ending this supply of arms but by far in a way the most important supplier as you noted is the United States and Joe Biden has been reluctant to take that step this also comes back to your prior question you know an international court of justice ice ruling is binding Israel is you know legally required to comply with the precautionary measures to avoid plausible genocide it hasn't done that um one way to force compliance would be through the UN Security Council but that requires contending with the UN us veto the other would be simply for powerful governments like the United States to say we are going to stop the military aid we're going to stop the arm sales until okay okay well let me ask you about the let me ask you specifically about us Ken right now because we had at the end of last week 37 members of Congress including the former house Speaker Nancy Pelosi write a letter saying that if um that uh in light of the recent strike against Aid workers we believe it's unjustifiable to Pro to approve weapons transfers there are something called the Lehi laws um the former Senator Patrick lehy who put those laws in place who they're named after says the US is now breaking the law is are things in your view changing now in the US or not yes James in the sense that there is mounting pressure on buiding to do the right thing to condition further military aid or arm sales on an end to Israel's bombing and starving of Palestinian civilians in Gaza so there's tons of pressure there he certainly you know would be within the law to do that he's just resistant and it is a bit of a puzzle why that is part of it is he seems to sort of think of Israel back in 1967 when it was David surrounded by the Goliath of the combined Arab armies you know partly it's just that um you know he's thinking about this coming election in November and is focused you know on the movable middle the handful of Independence in the six swing States and is basically taken for granted the progressive side of the democratic party that's beginning to change with the Michigan primary with or a large number of uncommitted Voters suggested that you know some Democrats might just stay home and not vote at all you know Biden says oh they won't vote for Trump but if they don't vote for anybody that's effective a vote for Trump so he's taking that for granted that said because there is mounting American pressure to stop aiding and abetting these war crimes this plausible genocide in Gaza um Biden is under pressure to do the right thing and we know that in his conversation just last week Netanyahu he sort of began to hint that maybe at some point in the future us relations would be affected if by if Netanyahu didn't change but it's still very mushy there still is not an explicit conditionality imposed on the military aid in the armed sence Matas let me ask you how are things changing in terms of the public discourse in Germany I saw there was a group of 600 German civil servants who again wrote a petition saying that Israel is committing crimes in Gaza in contradiction of international law and therefore in contradiction to the Constitution do you notice a change in Germany now I do notice a change in Germany now I think that immediately after October 7 there was a lot of solidarity uh towards Israel I think there is still solidarity in particular for you know the victims of these attacks for the hostages but criticism of Israel is rising I I notice at least in parts of the German public that we increasingly have a more nuanced understanding of Israel which means that um we don't take netanyahu's position and his government M's position in which um you know quite problematic uh ministers are assembled at least to some extent we don't take that to be um the the be all and end all of Israel we recognize that there's a plurality of views in Israel there's there has been lots of demonstrations in Tel Aviv and all around Israel actually and much of that is also perceived in Germany and so people are increasingly seeing that you know there's there's not one clear it's very difficult to put yourself on one side of this conflict given how it is unfolding and that of course has also an impact on how Germany should should act in particular in respect of weapons at the court today Germany was trying to make the argument that it is not delivering weapons that could be lethal in a sense you know not war weapons in a very narrow sense with which you can shoot it was only delivering equipment second that um its deliveries had decreased or its um its issuance of permits for weapons exports had decreased since October and that's all valid arguments to make but what I wonder is can you really deliver any weapons in the current situation as opposed to October where many people ask themselves um if there is any other way of providing humanitarian Aid to Gaza other than through a fire so that is a responsibility that many people now see very clearly and they also think about Germany's long-term Prospect of maintaining its um its status it's standing as a you know a a law respecting country so I do inist see changes here okay thank you very much to all our guests today Matas Goldman Dianna BAU and Kenneth Roth and thanks to you too for watching for more coverage on the cases before the I CJ plus background and
