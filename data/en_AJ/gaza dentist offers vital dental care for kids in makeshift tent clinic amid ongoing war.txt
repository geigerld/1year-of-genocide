my name is Dr OD Al kutri I'm a dentist specializing in treating children and people with special needs I got married one day before the war the next day missiles were flying everywhere 3 days later we left our home and we moved from one shelter Camp to [Music] another in the camp I introduced myself as a children's d children would complain about their teeth I would try treating them using colleagues tools then I got the idea of a mobile tent in the camps I got a tent and I got a device it was a mobile module I didn't have a seat so I used a car seat instead I didn't have any air compression so I used a gas cylinder and installed a valve and pressure gauge I would literally fill it up with air from any car tire repair shop my team and I would check around 300 kids and treat 30 to 40 cases we offer children primary care including tooth extraction or partial root canal treatment we are a people who don't know the word impossible sadly we lack the equipment that would enable us to provide full dental services the most common problem we face is high cost and scarcity of Dental Supplies with the crossing clothes in the last 10 months nothing comes in or goes out our message to the world is a message of defiance and steadfastness we hope the world looks at us with compassion and extends a helping hand to stop this war our children don't deserve what they have had to endure make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
