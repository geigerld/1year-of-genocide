Israel has long used the Palestinian territories as a testing ground for weapons and surveillance technology now Israeli media Reports say that's extending to artificial intelligence The Firm corite AI has reportedly been involved in search and rescue operations in Gaza in particular its facial Rec recognition technology has been applied to videos of captives and Hamas Fighters another Israeli firm say ra tracks online content perceived as harmful mapping Pro Hamas influence campaigns Anthony lowenstein's an independent journalist and the author of The Palestine laboratory a book on Israel's arms and surveillance industry he's in Sydney and joins us live from there so first of all Anthony how is the conflict in Gaza being used to develop Israeli Cy what's called cyber offensive technology in the industry what's been happening in the last two months and some ways really continues what Israel has been doing for years which is Gaza is a key testing ground as you said for new weapons sometimes deadly sometimes also just surveillance so what we've seen in the last two months is really a huge amounts of new technology new particular drones quadcopters so to speak which kind of have been firing apparently weapons into Palestinian areas including civilian areas an AI driven Warfare now there's been a lot of talk and hype around AI Warfare Israel started doing this in 2014 they did it again in 2021 in other rounds of their conflicts with Hamas and this year it's really accelerated to the point where both people I'm speaking to and there was an amazing report in the Israeli Outlet 972 a few weeks ago which outlined the fact that really any serious Rules of Engagement about worrying about civilian casualties has essentially being removed and the impact of that was the AI system was processing huge amounts of information and spitting out massive amounts of targets those targets often would deliberately be known to contain civilians if they were hit and we've seen the rate of Civilian casualties is really unprecedented in the Modern Age and what Israel's doing by using this technology is obviously in its war against Hamas it's being used to try to impress Israeli audiences and also Internationals to try to get support for Israel's brutal war in Gaza but it's also for foreign buyers now Israel's not doing it solely for that reason of course but as we've seen in the last years as a document in my book a key aspect of Israel's war making is to basically Test new weapons in Gaza or the west bank and then sell them to various um countries afterwards so almost certainly as I note in the guardian there was a followup story to that Israeli report last week which said that a Us official was quoted as saying the world is watching countries are watching what Israel is doing and what he didn't say but should have is that they want to also have a piece of their technology when this conflict is over Anthony are we seeing the Israeli cyber industry pivoting more and developing more towards Ai and data analysis after the scandals involving hacking firms and Spy software such as Pegasus the short answer is yes and no let me briefly explain um Pegasus obviously was a notorious spyware firm which does still exist its NSO group is the company though it's in financial trouble but what's happened in the last years is nso's star has decided has fallen many other Israeli companies are doing remarkably similar things so essentially technology which allows a country intelligence outfit or police force to spy on your phone whether it's an Android or iPhone so the technology is very much still being used and sold by large numbers of Israeli companies but there's no doubt there was a recent um Europe's largest national security fair in in Paris a few weeks ago and Israel had a lot of companies there even though there's of course a war going on in Gaza and a lot of those companies were selling not particularly offensive cyber such as Pegasus but surveillance technology to be able to monitor various amounts of people's phones social media and interestingly a company called toer to which is essentially a company that allows a buyer to change video feeds so you can imagine a institution or government has a video feed of some particular incident this allows this technology allows that feed to be changed to be altered which is a remarkably dangerous and Powerful tool so Israel is clearly getting in on this and it's important to note that many of the technologies that Israel is selling The Architects and veterans are coming from the IDF the Israeli military and they're getting the experience firstly when they work for the military working under the occupation to try to surveil Palestinians they take that experience into the private sector while maintaining close ties with the state so yes these are private companies in name but in fact as I showed in detail in the book they're actually an extension of the state because Israeli government uses these companies as a way to promote its agenda all right thank you so much Anthony Lowenstein there thank you
