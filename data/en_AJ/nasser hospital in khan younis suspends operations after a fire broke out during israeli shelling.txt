well we're joined now from Rafa by Scott Anderson the senior deputy director of Gaza operations for the United Nations relief and works Agency for eroa um it's great that we have you on this hour we're trying to understand as much as we can about this morning's events what can you add um to your understanding about what happened unfortunately not much more than it's already been reported what we can conf confirm is that there were no un Vehicles involved in the Convoy um and then we've heard the death toll but I think what this speaks to is the general situation in the north the deterioration of Law and Order and the security environment but most importantly it speaks to the desperation of people and we know there are pockets of starvation in the north we've had reports from hospitals of children died of malnutrition and I think today's event just really underscores the desperation people feel north of waza as they try to find food for their families it's extremely difficult as we know and as we've reported to get food to Northern Gaza the world food program just last week said they're not doing it anymore because it's not safe enough is unoa still in a position and still able to deliver make Aid deliveries to Northern Gaza um we are currently not delivering much like the world food program due to the prevailing security environment uh we last attempted to delivery February 8th we were unfortunately unable to complete that delivery and for the UN as a whole has been very difficult since 2024 since 1 of January we've only got 93 trucks of Aid North of waza which I think we can all agree for 300,000 people that are still living there is not enough aid for them to sustain themselves and again has led us to the situation where people are desperate and desperate to find food for them and their families and can you give us a little bit of context on the security circumstances is the safety conditions for the trucks that are still conducting those meager deliveries into Northern Gaza yeah I I think the the situation is very difficult um I mean in addition to the security environment being difficult the road networks are difficult and just the situation overall is very dire um and I think you know the commissioner General said it best when will this all end uh which we can all say we hope ass soon um but there aren't any police working any blue police um which continues to degrade the security situation and leads really to lawlessness and events like that happen today so what we would really need is to have a functioning police force to try to reestablish some Law and Order which would make a delivery of aid for the UN and others much easier to the north as well as to the rest of Gaza question that may illuminate what happened this morning would it be typical uh as was apparently the case this morning would it be typical for Israeli forces to be in the vicinity of an aid delivery um well not necessarily an aid delivery I think the location where this happened is near the checkpoint from the south of Gaza to the North near theadi and certainly it would be normal for Israeli forces to be near the checkpoint but without knowing the exact location of what happened I can't speak to more than that okay um the I I would like to put to you what essentially has been Israel's explanation of what happened this morning they're saying well essentially there was a crowd there was uh people died in a crush a St a stampede of sorts um and we therefore Israel is not directly responsible for this uh for most of the Palestinian deaths this morning is that uh something that you can speak to I mean The Wider context of the level of desperation that Palestinians have have when they do get that trickle of Aid coming in I me like I I I don't think any of us can speak to intent or what happened if we weren't there but as I said before what we can speak to is that it's a very desperate situation north of waza there are still 300,000 people living there trying their very best take care of themselves and their families but you have a very desperate situation with pockets of starvation and when people are that desperate it will lead to tragic events like happened this morning where we had significant loss of life significant injuries and what we need to do is get Aid to the north somehow at scale which you know hopefully we can get another Crossing opens we can enter the north from the north and that would allow the UN and others to move things in at scale and begin to address the pockets of starvation the malnutrition and the other challenges that we Face Scott Anderson senior deputy director of Gaza operations for unoa thank you very much for for joining us this hour Israel has seized nearly 3 square kilm of Palestinian land near an illegal settlement in the occupied West Bank the move will establish a new settlement near Mal adumim near occupied East Jerusalem an estimated 40,000 Israeli settlers live there settler expansion is illegal under international law yet it has ramped up significantly since the war on Gaza began in October let's bring back Bernard Smith who's standing by in occupied East Jerusalem uh Bernard why is Israel taking this land so all settlements are illegal under international law but Israel distinguishes between settlements and what it calls illegal outposts last summer 10 illegal outposts by the cabinet were approved to me become full settlements and the first of those has now been signed off by uh the Israeli military now the time timing of this is fascinating because only on Monday we were in the ha wrapping up six days of hearings where almost 50 countries had argued before the international court of justice that Israel's occupation of the West Bank should be declared illegal because continuous rampant ex excessive or continuing settlement construction and Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank was preventing the Palestinians from uh uh from self-determination and creating a Palestinian state they've seen directly the Israelis um ignoring really International uh calls uh un calls to stop settlements the US was given the the thankless task of Defending Israel's occupation in front of the court saying this should be left to the UN and the Israelis and the Palestinians to negotiate directly well there again we have evidence today the Israelis ignoring un calls not to increase settlement construction and the pal saying look this is why we have to go to the icj because Israel just keeps ignoring calls to stop it settlement construction yeah Bon Smith reporting from occupied East Jerusalem thank you Bernard Israel says that two Israeli settlers and one Palestinian gunman have been killed in a shooting at a petrol station in the occupied West Bank the incident took place at the entrance uh to the Ilie illegal settlement that's north of rala Israeli media says the Army has blocked off roads in the area as they search for possible additional Shooters let's bring in Zay basravi Zayn you're in rala in the occupied West Bank tell us more about this shooting what do you know well we heard about this about 3 hours ago at about 5:33 p.m. local time uh a Palestinian man seemingly in his 20s or 30s armed with what appears to be an automatic assault rifle possibly an American M16 according to the videos that we've seen he arrived at that gas station at Ellie opened fire killed killed two Israelis another Israeli gunman at the scene then shot and killed this Palestinian man it's not the first time an incident like this has taken place at the specific gas station June last year in a similar attack four Israelis were killed the two Palestinian gunmen involved were also killed one at the scene one later on uh down the road near tubas now uh there was another incident earlier today in which a Palestinian man was killed two others injured when uh during this incident west of Hebron according to locals uh witnessing the incident there these men were trying to cross a barrier either to get to work or to collect wild herbs for food and were shot for being at that place on that land and of course when shootings like this occur the story never ends there what are you looking up for next what do you think happens from now well we've already seen settlers take to social media calling for retaliation saying they should not not be silent Palestinian communities are expecting uh uh some kind of retaliation some kind of response some of the areas uh uh between ramala and Nablus where Palestinians drive back and forth there's already been settler attacks on at least three vehicles there uh cities in North of romala around romala uh places like sjar turmos Aya the M municipalities there have started to open their doors to uh Palestinians to afraid to travel by road back home or people stuck in limbo in between places because of road closures because of settler attacks so we're already seeing Palestinians being stranded because of those roadblocks as the Israeli forces continue to carry out manhunts and locals have also spotted military uh cars vehicles moving towards kandia refugee camp south of ramala where the shooter in the involved in the attack at Elliot was thought to have come from now whenever incidents like this happen Palestinians say Collective punishment is always part of the problem the shooters family and friends are identified detained questioned harassed often times the family home is marked for demolition so the expectation is that it will be a potentially busy and a busy night in the colia refugee camp for the residents there Zay mravi reporting from romala thank you very much
