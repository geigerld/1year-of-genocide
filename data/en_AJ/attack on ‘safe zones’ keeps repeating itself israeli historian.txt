thanks for joining us we begin this new Z on Israel where Court in Tel Aviv has ordered that a major Nationwide strike must now end Israel's largest Trade union staged the protest saying it wants to pressure the government of Benjamin Netanyahu into signing a gaza's ceasefire and captive release deal with Hamas the action was called after the bodies of six Israeli captives were recovered from a tunnel in southern Gaza on Saturday a labor Court accepted the government's petition that the strike was politically motivated joins me here on set in Doha and she's here of course because the Israeli government has prohibit prohibited us from reporting from Israel itself hamda you know the country you've worked there you've reported there extensively the courts may have ordered this strike to be over but give us a given the scale of the demonstrations we've we've seen give us a sense of where public sentiment is right now well public sentiment as we saw last night was unprecedented with nearly 300,000 demonstrators in Tel Aviv half a million demonstrators across Israel and today there are large crowds thousands of people in the streets and the head of the labor union released a statement saying that he respects the decision by the court and that the strike itself was a show of solidarity even though the court said it was Pol politically motivated that it was a show of solidarity among the Israeli public that the release of the captives should supersede all but then there was another statement from the hostage and missing families forum who said that even though the strike is going to end the protests need to continue and they're calling and encouraging on people to still continue to take to the streets and in fact the head of the labor union is set to speak around 700 p.m. local time at a demonstration he says that he's also going to continue protesting as well uh how Benjamin Netanyahu actually addressed any of this unrest or is he is he bonding Against Time well look there were some reports within Israeli media last night saying that Netanyahu was a little bit worried and this is citing Anonymous officials of course speaking to Israeli media they said that he was worried about the size and scale of these protests these are some of the largest demonstrations that Israel has seen the last time we saw something of this kind of scale this magnitude even where the labor union had a strike as well was around a year and a half ago when they were protesting a different issue so there were reports that he was a little bit worried but there hasn't been anything that's come from the office of the Israeli Prime Minister but he has previously said that he's doing what he can to secure a deal and that includes military pressure that he would fight the war despite all the international and domestic pressure that's coming his way he would prosecute it however he saw fit but this time there's a little bit of a different sense within Israel because these captives according to Israeli intelligence were alive just a few days ago and had there been a ceasefire deal the family say they would have been alive and back home all right ham many thanks that ham Salud there right we are getting some news in to us about a strike in Gaza hany mmud is live in Dera Bala in central Gaza hany what can you tell us just just couple minutes couple minutes ago an air strike just struck uh struck the Gate of the hospital that's that's actually few meters away from where we are standing here since early hours of this morning the Skies of the Central Area mainly above the hospital this hospital was clouded with many of the drones you can hear them in the background and for the past few hours we've been talking to each other that the presence the dense presence of these attack drones is for a reason here and just within the past couple minutes huge air strike that is right next to the gate of the hospital we're getting now of confirmed reports judging from what what I'm looking at right now but because it's a massive explos ion the dust and the debris just covered main parts of the hospital when I talk about next to the gate of the hospital just the landscape of the area this is a a road that is at about 8 m wide and across from the gate there is a house that has been already bombed at the initial weeks of the war it's been targeted again now the debris and the the dust all come to the Courtyard of the hospital as we speak right now this is we would been mning of the the dense presence of these drones and we we did not expect it to happen right at this time but it did happen as you can hear in the background the the buzz sound of these attack drones is still in the skies and still clouding the Skies of the Central Area mainly above the hospital see where as you see from the frame of the camera these are one of the injuries a child who happened to be hit by a shrapnel there's another one also being rushed inside the hospital and this is from the flying shrap naels and de breeze as the explosion was quite intense I'm I'm not sure if you guys could hear that in the studio but it was so deafening it was so loud here honey we can most definitely hear the continual sound of drones uh above you Israeli military drones are you suggesting it was one of those drones that carried out the specific strike and do we know what the intended target was then [Music] well what we know so far it's a house that has been already bombed but the fact that it's not far from the hospital this has already created a sense of intimidation a sense of fear and concern as people remember within the past few days right before the announcement of the pause in the fighting in the Central Area because of the vaccination campaign people were literally told by the is really military as they received messages and received they read the the leaflets that were dropped by the Israel army to go back to these blocks 128 129 130 they're all next to each other and they were told they are safe literally the word safe was in those text messages was in those deflet and people were told to get back to these areas and now the the explosion just took place just shattered any sense of safety that remain to people also it shatter any sense of a trust in the narrative about the pauses in the fighting as again this is very similar to what the Israeli military has been doing in the past 10 months it's all it's full of lies it's misleading it's contradictory it's fake people told to go to areas to avoid being bombed and they get bombed and they get killed they get bed in the very particular areas and locations they were told to go to this is we we we keep monitoring the development of this is story but the fact it's happening without any prior warning whatsoever this Road next to the gate of the hospital is quite busy at this particular time of the day it's more of like a rush hours it's a market place here people tend to leave their tents leave to to tend to leave the areas where they evacuated we they have been evacuated in and come to this road and particular streets leading to the gate of the hospital and buying and shop and restock from whatever is available here so it's really a busy hour quite more of a like a rush hour uh in the area and what we're getting now consistent than what I was saying the street was full of it of hundreds of people either those who are coming back to their homes taking their belongers and taking the very Road where the bomb where the explosion happens going back to the eastern part of Dar balah City or the vicin of the hospital when the explosion happen all right hany many thanks for that update we we'll of course come back to you um as and when we get more information just to clarify hany and the rest of the team have been reporting on the roll out of polio vaccines uh one of the centers there in der Al Bala just to repeat what we've just heard from hany what appears to have been a strike uh possibly carried out by an Israeli military drone on a Target close to the gates of that hospital as I say on day two of the polio vaccine rollout something that the Israeli military said they would provide a safe Corridor to allow civilians uh uh to get to and to allow them to be vaccinated um Let's uh move on and speak to Anan Pape he's an Israeli historian and professor at the University of extor he's joining us from Chicago um Anan a very warm welcome to you so you probably heard the uh the Panic the fear uh the pandemonium uh outside the hospital in Dera Bala many many children across Gaza have been told that they could safely go and be vaccinated receive their polio uh drops to avoid the mass spread of disease in Gaza and now this strike when it comes to hopes of a lasting ceasefire establishing trust is vital but it's massively in short supply when we see incidents like this yes indeed and I'm afraid we've been there before when supposedly safe zones for Palestinians in Gaza were bombed and uh this keeps repeating itself and this is part of the general picture that we are facing which is an Israeli Prime Minister who is adamant in continuing uh the situation of the war as he would see it as long as he can until the next elections in Israel in 2026 and he would do everything possible to make sure that uh there is no uh uh no conditions no circumstances uh for ending uh the Israeli genocidal attack on Gaza and I think uh uh the kind of cynical we have just heard about just momentarily is one indication that uh this kind of uh inhuman cynicism would be perpetrated again and again I'm afraid uh unless there is an external intervention uh uh that might have the ability to stop it uhan talking about interventions while we are having this discussion we're looking at live pictures from West Jerusalem vast numbers of people still out on the street there despite the labor Court ordering the end of the strike that was called by the trade Union on the basis that it was politically motivated said the court how do you interpret that aren't all strikes inherently politically motivated yes of course they are uh this is just uh the way that uh the legal or those who represent the legal system in Israel are trying to navigate between their full understanding and they already recognize that Netanyahu has breached almost every law in in in the book of laws of Israel on the one hand and and the fact that they depend on him H to survive in their positions whether it is the uh uh Pro prosecutor the chief prosecutor or the legal advisor to to the government and therefore uh this is just a play this is a game this is nothing to do with legality or illegality this is a balance of power by which until now at least the base of Netanyahu his Coalition allies and him himself are still the ones who determine Israeli policies inside Israel and towards the Palestinians in Gaza in the West Bank and towards the North and towards South Lebanon we're talking about pressure now from outside the country we understand that the United States could be poised to offer a so-call take it or leave it ultimatum to Benjamin Netanyahu that could spell a possible end to us mediation efforts in bringing about a ceasefire what might that potentially mean for Netanyahu if it happens well again I it's funny how how we sort of think that we are hearing some dramatic news where actually we we see the repeat of the same news again and again there were we were already in this point where the Americans said what we are proposing now is take it it and then they came again and said no this time we really mean it's take it or leave it and I'm afraid this was going to be the same netan is going to reject the American proposal whatever it is uh because as I said in my early answer uh his main strategy is to continue the situation of the war Because he believes that's the only way that can ensure his political survival uh he doesn't think that the Americans are in any position to really pose danger to his own uh uh position in in the government because we are uh 60 days before the the elections and therefore this is all going to be there's going to be a lot of talk about very little action on the ground and I'm afraid uh we need something far more drastic than an American proposal that tries to satisfy netanyahu's demands that keep changing because he doesn't want a deal and he doesn't doesn't want to end the fighting when you say something far more drastic is needed what does that look like to you well definitely not what I heard from camela Harris in the Democratic Convention a week ago here in Chicago uh we we we need a position if not by the American at least by the Europeans and at least by the European countries who already showed some uh uh conscious conscientious position uh to treat is well as a as a pariah state that commits a crime against humanity namely genocide in Gaza and that should be translated into sanctions uh into stopping military support for Israel financial support uh but I'm afraid and I have to be realistic this is not going to happen uh in the next 60 days uh or it won't come in the next 60 days from Washington uh it just remains to be seen is the world really run by the United States stay alone or are there other powers that can change the balance of power on the ground in Gaza because the genocide continues and as you have reported it has now moved into the West Bank so uh and and it won't stop by any internal Dynamics in Israel the only way to stop it is an international uh uh coordinated effort to make sure that Israel pays a price that is high enough to persuade it policy makers that it's time to stop the genocide Pape it's been a pleasure to have you on aler thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to the latest news from Al jazer
