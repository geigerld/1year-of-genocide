okay well let's bring in Mustafa bouti who is the Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative he joins us now live from rala a very warm welcome to you so I'm sure you are aware of the scenes coming out of the north of Gaza this evening along with images of as many as a 100,000 Palestinians who have been forced South uh by uh Israel by Israeli forces combining those two events how do you see this playing that well we're not just following I'm in touch with our colleagues in Gaza we have many Medical Teams working there and suffering from this terrible situation the only description of what's happening is that Israel is conducting three war crimes at the same time the war crime of ethnic cleansing where they have forced 1.5 million people to evict their homes and uh after destroying them and and uh the war crime of genocide because what we see is nothing but genocide uh with with more than 11,000 Palestinians killed and probably 6,000 children killed if we count those who are under the rebel and that nobody can get to because of Israeli air strikes and that is of course all combined with Collective punishment uh Collective punishment depriving people from water electricity Fuel and you have seen that out of the 35 hospitals in Gaza uh practically 18 or 20 have stopped working because of lack of fuel uh even those who are remaining uh functioning they are bombarded constantly we've seen horrible sites of uh horrible scenes of bombarding the Indonesian Hospital the anaser hospital the ABD rantis pediatric hospital and now the shifa hospital H so many people were killed inside the hospitals all including doctors nurses all of this is happening despite the promise of these 4our pauses um with at least 3 hours notice I mean what does that say about the success of diplomacy so far to you there was no ceasefire really and no pose uh the pose was only in the head of Mr Biden the president of the United States but natany never recognized that and never implemented that and the proof to that is that some people who were evicted from the north of Gaza and Gaza City and while they were walking to the south at salahadin Street were bombarded by Israeli airplanes and and killed so and Israel never accepted any kind of ceasefire not even poses and these poses were actually made to help Israel EV and continue the process of ethnic cleansing of the people in the north and center of Gaza they were not meant to really help the people and uh and and and in my in my opinion the big question here that should be asked as the head of the wh have just asked in the security Council why the United States of America and the prime minister of Britain continue to oppose ceas fire why don't they force Israel to stop this atrocity while why are they allowing this genocide on Palestinian people and uh I think I think uh I I've been hearing some of your guests and and I think you should be calling the Israeli Army not the Israeli Army but the Israeli terrorist Army because what they are conducting against the civilian population of Gaza is nothing but acts of Terror while the United States and the likes of the UK continue to offer their unequivocal support to Israel of course there is this diplomatic push that is going to reach ahead I guess over the course of the weekend the Arab League the organization of Islamic Cooper operation what role do you think that they are likely to be able to play when it comes to um ensuring humanitarian Aid reaches Gaza will their involvement make a difference to you the involvement of me of whom the Arab countries you mean the Arab countries Regional players they're very weak and they're they're they have not done what they should be doing I mean with the exception of a a small number of countries but in general I think think one of the reasons why Netanyahu is daring to continue these terrorist attacks is because some Arab countries continue to have normalized relations with Israel because some Arab countries continue to have Israeli ambassadors in their country they have to kick them out and they have also to tell Israel that all the Arab countries in the coming Arab Summit which is going to be held tomorrow with the with a big delay that they will send a convoy of humanitarian Aid and challenge Israeli Siege on Gaza they can do that they can invite all World health organizations and all humanitarian organizations in the world to join them in challenging this Israeli unacceptable Siege and allows the the flow of food electricity Fuel and everything to Gaza and water in particular they can do that they can also tell the United States of America and and United Kingdom and any other European country that continue to support the Israelis unconditionally that they will not receive Arab oil from now on and that the Arabs will Arab countries will not be importing stuff from them I think only if they take these measures then their their voice will be counted for and and will be considered otherwise we will see the continuation of this terrible atrocity against the Palestinian people what did you do what did we do as Palestinians I mean to the world in 1948 Israel was established on our land they allowed them to steal our land at the time when Israel was established we owned 82% of the land of of of historical Palestine today Palestinians in Israel own only 3.5% then in 1967 they they occupied the remaining of the country I want to ask you and now they are ethnically cleansing people from the West Bank excuse me Mr bti I wanted to ask you about something you said in a recent interview you said that you believe very strongly that it is Benjamin netanyahu's goal to reoccupy the Gaza Strip for an indefinite period what would the consequences of that be for the hope of Peace in the region well nanyu said it himself I didn't say it I just quoted Netanyahu Netanyahu said I that he will keep security control and Military control of Gaza for an indefinite period this means reoccupation uh but he wants to to occupy Gaza ethnically cleanse most of it Annex it to Israel and then find somebody or some organization of some entity to take care of the humanitarian needs of the people because as an occupying power he doesn't want to fulfill his responsibility exactly as he's doing now in the West Bank so yes he wants and that would mean uh not only shrinking occupation it would mean expanding occup occupation and that is the death toll to the whole idea of Peace based on two- State solution this man Netanyahu came to power specifically to kill the possibility of peace to kill the possibility of two-state solution he's the man who aggravated the public in Israel against isak Rabin till till Rabin was assassinated because he signed a peace agreement with Palestinians and Netanyahu made it the goal of his life to kill the oso process to kill the possib ility of two-state solution and he's not hiding it and now he increased the number of settlers from 120,000 in the West Bank to more than 750,000 and made them a fascist political power in the Israeli Parliament and in the Israeli government including people like smotrich and Bing who are not only extremist but they don't shy away from calling themselves fascists m bouti thank you very much for for joining us in alaz Mustafa bouti Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative thank you
