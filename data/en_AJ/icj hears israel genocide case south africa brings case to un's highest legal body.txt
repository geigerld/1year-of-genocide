at the United Nations highest court Israel stands accused of carrying out genocide in Gaza South Africa has filed a 84 page document with the international court of justice in the Haag it claims Israel has killed more than 177,000 Palestinians from October until December last year just on December 7th approximately one Palestinian was killed in Gaza every 4 minutes entire families have been wiped out with no remaining survivors at the heart of South Africa's legal argument is the mass expulsion of Palestinians 85% of the population has been forced to leave their homes 60% of the homes in Gaza are now destroyed and civilians following the evacuation orders were targeted by Israeli forces on designated safety routes the case also highlights the dire humanitarian crisis in the strip experts are predicting that more Palestinians in Gaza may die from starvation and disease than air strikes the submission also includes inflammatory statements made by Israeli leaders the Israeli president said it's an entire nation out there that is responsible it's not true that rhetoric about civilians not aware not involved it's absolutely not true the Israeli minister of energy and infrastructure tweeted all the civilian population in Gaza is ordered to leave immediately we will win they will not receive a drop of water or a single battery until they leave the world the deputy speaker of the knesset tweeted we all have one common goal erasing the Gaza Strip from the face of the Earth the former head of the Israeli National Security Council said the state of Israel has no choice but to make Gaza a place that is temporarily or permanently impossible to live in the US must ultimately back even an operation like this even if there are thousands of bodies of civilians in the streets afterward and Gaza will become a place where no human being can exist there are also examples of the destruction of Palestinian identity which I believe South Africa's legal team is led by a former un Envoy John Dugard it Compares Israel's actions in Gaza to crimes carried out in South Africa during the apartheid era but proving genocidal intent is legally complicated Israel's defense team is represented by the former head of the Israeli Supreme Court Aon Barack he's denied all accusations and argues Israel's actions have been made in self-defense in response to hamas's attack on Southern Israel on October 7th last year that killed 1,200 Israelis please be seated the case will be decided by a 15 member panel decisions are based on a majority vote with a leading judge holding the decisive vote in case of a tie despite calls for a swift hearing the case has already been delayed by a week a final ruling on the genocide allegations could take months or years but legal experts say a decision by the court on whether to announce immediate measures might come soon as South Africa hopes it will call on Israel to stop its war on Gaza Axel zovich Al jazer make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
