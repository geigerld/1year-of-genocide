has carried her all right and this just in right now as we come on the air the ceasefire negotiations in Gaza a joint statement has been released by the three mediators quoted by voters has uh just been released and it says it is time to conclude Gaza ceasefire agreement and release hostages and prisoners we have worked for months to reach framework agreement and it is now on the table with only details of implementation missing we called on two parties to resume urgent talks on Thursday August 15th in Doha or Cairo to bridge all remaining gaps and start implementing the agreement without any delay all right I am told we can go now to shab ransi he is live for you in Washington DC um tell us what more you've learned about this we don't have anymore actually this just appeared on on the wires there wasn't even actually an official statement on at the state department website either but yeah it's it's saying that it's time to conclude the ceasefire agreement and released hostages and prisoners a joint statement Qatar Egypt and the US asking everyone to resume urgent talks in August of 15th either in in Doha or Cairo to bridge all remaining gaps it's interesting that the state department spokesperson was asking a few hours ago though whether this constant emphasis about how close everyone El is to a ceasefire deal which you've heard consistently since fears of some form of retaliation to Israel's escalation in killing isma hania in in Teran since those fears have reached such fever pitch you know whether this constant emphasis on how close everyone is to to reaching that deal is some way is some attempt to diffuse diffuse the situation though Matt Miller the state department said uh um all he would say was any further escalation makes the Region's problems more difficult uh and that um we think a ceasefire would go a long way to reducing tensions this is the Mantra we've heard from the US Administration as we hear all the reports about just how concerned the US is about some form of retaliation from Iran and from Iran's allies in the region to the killing of isir in Teran this would would seem to be get another high-profile attempt then to keep on keep the focus on the ceasefire talks though you we've heard all of this before and we know that whenever it appears that Hamas is is agreeing to what was supposedly the Israeli the Israeli ceasefire plan then Benjamin Netanyahu changes the goalposts demands something else and Netanyahu himself seems pretty pretty open about the fact that now and certainly the isra media are that that you know Netanyahu wants to wants to prolong this as long as possible so as not to face his own people either at the The Ballot Box or in in the law court so yeah I mean it's very difficult to to to pass what this actually means whether everyone really is closer to a breakthrough or is this once again just you know the momentum that the this attempt at momentum in some ways perhaps to diffuse diffuse the tensions at least psychologically I don't know but it's very difficult to pass right very difficult to par s BR Ry a reporting there uh uh from Washington DC on this breaking development
