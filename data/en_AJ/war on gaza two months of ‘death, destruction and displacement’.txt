[Music] it's two months into Israel's war on Gaza and the military Onslaught against Palestinians persists unabated the offensive began on October the 7th after an unprecedented attack by Hamas Fighters members of the alasan brigades that's the armed wing of the group and other Palestinian resistance Fighters infiltrated Israeli territory by air Land and Sea a ,1 147 Israelis were killed that day including 320 soldiers and 59 police officers at least 240 people Israelis and foreign Nationals were taken captive what ensued was a declaration of war by the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Hamas and a promise to eliminate the group his defense minister immediately halted the import of all water food electricity and fuel to the strip for the past several weeks have seen an intense indiscriminate aerial bombardment of Gaza that's flattened entire neighborhoods and caused unimaginable suffering a ground Invasion Then followed no one and nothing has been spared schools hospitals mosques churches shops every aspect of daily life has been targeted but the heaviest toll has been on civilians more than 16,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza more than 7,000 of them children that means the Israeli Army kills one child every 10 minutes and 1.9 million people have been forcibly displaced We Begin our special coverage with some of the sites and sounds from the past two months of Israel's war on all right we begin our extensive coverage with our two correspondents on the ground following the story we have Alan fiser in occupi East Jerusalem we'll be speaking to him in just a few minutes but first let's go to hanni Mahmud Han you're joining us from that's in the south of Gaza and two months on Han he give us a sense of the scale of suffering and the moods in Gaza yes well uh for 60 days Palestinians have been experiencing uh the worst of living conditions under heavy Israeli bombardment since day one uh of the war where talking about a mass bombardment carbet bombardment of entire neighborhoods and entire residential blocks uh we have a large numbers of residential buildings have been destroying a level to the ground an entire residential blocks flattened a completely a large number of critically injured Palestinians a overwhelmed hospitals with shortage extreme shortage of medical supplies and Necessities to uh uh to keep them surviving there is a serious lack of everything that Palestinians need to survive so far the mood of those 60 days has been death destruction and displacement the worst of these happen to be the three together as Palestinians run from one place to another for their life to avoid getting bombed in areas where war is active and lots of bombardment going on to get bombed in a different areas 1.5 million Palestinian that's a little over half of the population of the Gaza have been under heavy bombardment and forc displacement for the past 60 days we're talking about 60 days of constant movement and running for their lives from one place to another from extreme northern part of the gos city of B Haron all the way to the extreme southern part of the gos RAF City where lots of people are being packed and squeezed in this area since the first week of the war Gaza has been put under a total Siege we're talking about a no food supplies no medical supplies a no Necessities or survival items that could help people survive their Calamity on top of that the amount of humanitarian Aid that been allowed into Gaza only represent a drop in the ocean of their needs under these unusual conditions indeed people have been put under extremely unusual living conditions where they had to cure for hours to get a gallon of water or half a day to get a pack of a bread the hospitals are another difficulty story where we have two of the largest health facilities in the Gaza Strip the shifa hospital and the Nan Hospital have been forced to be out of service under heavy bombardment and in intentional direct targeting of its medical team where they are now completely out of service other Hospital midsize hospitals eventually had to be forced out of service given the lack of medical supplies and fuel that keep them sustainable for at least some times but with the tsunami of injuries and the uh the ongoing bombardment just put them out of service completely and put the life of of the remaining resident is stranded in the Gaza City and the northern part at risk and there is as there are no functioning Health Facilities we're talking about people being uh getting injured we're talking about people are getting killed but there is no hospital to receive them the last of these remaining midsize Health Facilities has been calan hospital and within the past two days it was forced out of service it was already running on a very very low capacity giving the size of the hospital as a small health facility but it was overwhelmed running Beyond its capacity more than 50 times of its capacity the last thing the hospital did was more of a morg a large Mor morg receiving large number of injuries and dead bodies and and hany um you know families are are having to make such difficult decisions one of it one of which is as you're saying uh uh they're forced to leave their home but where do they go because we understand and we hear over and over and over that nowhere is safe in the Gaza Strip indeed there is no safer place in the Gaza Strip and so far the isra narrative whether through their the dropped leaflets or the calls the phone calls they make to the residents of the god STP or the text message have been so far as people describe them they're vague they are confusing and they are contradictory as most of the time people end up in an area that is under heavy bombardment that has been described by the Israeli military as a safe area for them and we've seen example of this within the past a few weeks where people were ordered to evacuate sharply with a threatening tone to evacuate the northern part and Gaza City going to the central and the southern part and but to to find them themselves under unpredictable bombs falling on their how there are entire families who evacuated from Gaza City and the northern part got killed in the central part in the N refugee camp in Dar balah as well as in khun particularly at hammed city where multiple residential Towers were targeted and destroyed and here in Rafa City many of the families from Gaza got killed right after they were ordered to evacuate two days or sometimes within hours of their EV evacuation they were killed here again people insist that those leaflets those calls those smart techniques that are used by the Israeli military to order the evacuation they're not as smart at all they are confusing they are uh they are vague and they are contradictory to the brutality on the ground of those air strikes all right thank you so much hany for that update from RAF in the south of the Gaza Strip let's now bring in Alan fiser he's joining us from occupied East Jerusalem so Alan uh does the government in Israel believe that it's any closer to achieving its objectives two months on well you've heard from the Israeli government from the very beginning that this would be a long and difficult operation and will certainly expand into the new year which is what just 3 weeks away the Israelis believe that they are making advances that they have severely hit Hamas that they've killed a number of of commanders that they have damaged the tunnels the infrastructure the weapon stores that they have in various places in Northern Gaza and of course now they're turning their attention to the southern part of the Gaza Strip and that will be the next part of the operation what is likely is that the face of Gaza and the Border communities in Israel will be changed forever because of what is happening in Gaza at the moment uh what is less clear is that the Israeli government will finally achieve its objective to completely destroy Hamas it says that is its main goal to completely take away the power that Hamas has and make sure they can never operate again but if you speak to many people on both sides in Israel they will tell you that that is an incredibly difficult thing to do and of course while they push forward with their agenda Prosecuting the war across all of Gaza the death toll continues to rights yeah and Alan as we know there remain um Israeli captives who are who are still being held in Gaza what's the mood like these days two months on amongst the Israeli public if you look at the opinion polls if you speak to ordinary Israelis they will tell you their primary goal is the return of the hostages and that is certainly the primary goal of netanyahu's government and how they're doing it of course is through trying to put pressure militarily on Hamas and trying to destroy Hamas anecdotally most people agreed with the end of the ceasefire quite simply because all of the the captives had not been returned and they feel that that is the primary goal what is also interesting is that many people believe the war in h against Hamas is the correct thing to do but clearly there is concern of the rising civilian death to there also interesting in the the opinion polls is that the longer the war goes on the better Benjamin Netanyahu is doing in the first 3 or 4 weeks his political fate seemed to be sealed and that his career would be over but just in the last few weeks his popularity has begun to rise again but if you look internationally almost every country in the world when they do an opinion poll on what is happening in Gaza supports a ceas fire and supports an end to the fighting there now there will be a demilitarized Gaza at the end of this war Benjamin Netanyahu says that is his intention and he also says that Mahmud Abbas will never preside over the West Bank in Gaza while he is prime minister well there's a possibility that after the war he might not be prime minister for very much longer all right thank you so much alen Fisher reporting from occupied East Jerusalem
