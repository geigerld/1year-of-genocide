Kenneth Roth is a former Executive Director of Human Rights Watch and a visiting professor at Princeton University he says the US has the leverage to stop Israel's attacks government should have been pausing already because you know whether this is genocide or simply large scale war crimes the fact is it's horrible um there are what you know an estimated 12,000 and probably that's a small number in underestimate but 12,000 civilian casualties so far and you know the Israeli government is reg ly indiscriminately bombing neighborhoods even attacking military targets knowing that the harm to civilians would be disproportionate you know we saw that in the jabalia refugee camp um we see this in the attacks on hospitals where you know at this point that um it's clear that there is no immediate threat to the Israeli government coming from the hospitals you know they're they're scraping to find a rifle here or a backpack there um but the the rule to you know breach the protection of a hospital is that it has to pose an immediate military threat which clearly is not the case so you know there's just so much to be concerned about and the US government in particular which you know sells all of Israel's arms you know has been shoveling 3.8 billion dollars a year to the Israeli military and now wants to send 14 billion more it has the leverage to stop these attacks on civilians it's not using it you know it's been pressing for drips and drabs of humanitarian Aid it's been saying oh be a little bit more careful about civilian casualties but it hasn't really drawn the line and said the form of warfare is utterly inappropriate
